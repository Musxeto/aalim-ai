  "transcript": "Nia's from Saudi Arabia stated or I was asking about his 11 year Oh eleven month old child and whether they should take him along with them for ombres or not and whether they should make him perform Umrah or not the origin of this is the hadith of the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam when a woman came to the prophet sallallaahu are you seldom with a child in her hand an infant she raised a child and she said o prophet of Allah is there any hatch for this child that means is it valid is it rewarded and the Prophet said yes and you have the reward for that this means that it is permissible for a child an infant who does not know does not recognize anything around him to be taken and to be accompanied or to accompany his parents for Umrah or for Hajj how is this done scholars say that the child has to be dressed in the same fashion as a person in the state of Iran so the boy has to wear the same two garments no underwear no t-shirts nothing and the girl is wearing the hijab that covers her like her mom and the father who's responsible for carrying that infant puts the child in the state of a harem meaning in that he assumes that the child now is in the state of a harem because the child cannot have this intention by itself and he does the ambra normally carrying their child po off is for him and the child SIA is for him the child and he must avoid all restrictions of a hammam no clipping of the head of the hair or the the nails no perfuming no underwear no shirts and trousers no shoes etc and if there is a need for wearing and of this deliberately as in the case of cold for example or the diapers for fear of spoiling the clothes and the father and the whole of area of the harem then they should give expiation for that in the expiration as we know is fasting three days or feeding six poor people in the harem area or sacrificing a sheep or a goat having said that this is the procedure for giving or making our Umbra for an infant would I do this I wouldn't because it's a lot of hassle and a lot of work and I would like to have Umbra to concentrate in it and to enjoy it so I would advise you near by to keep the childhood with the mother in the hotel room you do your Umbra finish after you finish go back you babysit she goes and make her Umbra and it's a win-win insha'Allah"
