  "transcript": "Nohan from Bangladesh after after congregational \nprayer in the Masjid and after finishing the zikr   if I like get up to get out when I get up I see \nthat everyone behind me is praying so there's   no way to me move from my spot so can I just so \ncan I just start praying the Sunnah prayer at the   same same spot however I prayed the fard player \nand also like what is the dalil for this cause   I have heard this a lot of time that it's Haram \nto start a sunnah prayer right after like praying   fard prayer but like I have never heard of any \ndalil for this can you please mention the evidence There are a number of Hadith the most famous \nis the Hadith of Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan May   Allah be pleased with him and his father where the \nProphet (Peace and Blessings upon him) prohibited   people from offering their Sunnah prayer   after the fard specifically the Friday until they \nspeak to someone else or change their position   and another narration if I'm not mistaken by in \nthe Hadith of Anas may Allah be pleased with him   that the prophet said is it difficult for you \nafter your fought prayer to move a little front   or back or to the right or to the left before \noffering the or Sunnah and many other hadiths and   they all tell you that the Sunnah is to segregate \nbetween the fard and what comes afterwards mainly   because this is the Sunnah and probably so that \npeople would not think that you're adding rakas   to the fard prayer so instead of praying \nfour for Dhuhr seems that you praying six   and they would think negatively of you so this is \nan authentic issue that you have to change your   position or speak so if there is someone next \nto you just say him al salam alaikum he says   was alaikum al salam and you can stand in your \nposition and pray without a problem insha Allah foreign"
