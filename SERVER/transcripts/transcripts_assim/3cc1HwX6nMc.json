  "transcript": "immediately slap him as strong as you can on his face and when he's shocked and say why did you do this said my intention was to wake you up if he's going to accept this alhamdulillah will he he will try to get even why are you doing this my intention was good he said yes but your action was definitely not good alhamdulillah any Islam we judge by both when interpreting to test you who is among you the best inde Deeds what kind of best ineds those though that are pure and sincere to Allah and that collaborate with the Sunnah so if you do something that does not collaborate with the Sunnah even if your intention is good you are sinful I see a beautiful blonde she's a bombshell I approach her and I said your father must be a terrorist she says why cuz you're a bombshell so I said to her let's go for dinner and I give her da what are you doing W my intention is to give her da is this acceptable will you guys say well she's intention is good of course not I thought you were naughty naughty sh not naughty Professor what are you doing har so the intention has to co coincide and be in sync with the action one of them is wrong the whole action is bad you pray like the prophet your intention is not for Allah it is void your intention is for the sake of Allah but you innovate a new religion a new thing it is void it has to be two together and Allah Knows Best"
