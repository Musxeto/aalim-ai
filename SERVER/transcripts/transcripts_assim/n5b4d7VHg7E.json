  "transcript": "I wanted to ask about what endorsing sins mean and does every sort of endorsing mean endorsing sin mean kufur as for example if two people like they don't take hijab to women and they go out does that mean that they're endorsing each other's sin and is this kufur first of all endorsing sins does not reach the level of kufur kufur has to be a conviction whether by action by rake or in your heart sinning is a sin and this is why so many people ask is insisting on committing a sin renders you a cafir the answer is no a person who is adamant on drinking wine is drinking wine Hal no it's Haram it's mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah and Allah cursed those who drink it why do you drink it I love it you know you're sinful he say I know you know you're going to be punished in Hell said I know may Allah forgive me and he insists on it till he dies is he a cafer of course not it is a sin a major sin he will he will pay the price now endorsing a sin means that you're also a sinful person so if I go and there are people listening to music and I sit with them while they listen to music I'm endorsing their sin I'm not forbidding evil or preventing Vice so I'm endorsing sin I'm collaborating I'm getting something in return if I forward a message on social media that has music or has women or has inappropriate content and I say that oh there is some benefit in it I'm endorsing this sin because I'm the one who had sent it so this is what it means and Allah Knows Best"
