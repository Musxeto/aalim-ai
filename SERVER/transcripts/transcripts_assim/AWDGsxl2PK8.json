  "title": "Fortnite bringing dead back to life & shooting, killing, & violence? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Bilal from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi How are you? I'm fine Sheikh my question was that I wanted to ask for the ruling on video games Like which games are halal and haram Because there's this one game which like a lot of my friends play It's called Fortnite where like you have to kill people And like there's an element in which you like bring back dead from alive I mean alive from dead I wanted to ask like what's the ruling on such games? There is no such generic ruling on games So any game that has haram elements in them Such as having the power to bring the dead back to life To resurrect them Or something that deals with zombies and crosses Or a game that involves shooting and killing of civilians or others Which endorses violence like this All of this is not permissible And it is haram in my own point of view and Allah knows best"
