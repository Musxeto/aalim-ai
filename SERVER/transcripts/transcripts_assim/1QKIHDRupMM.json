  "transcript": "the parents should be very careful we are in an era of fitnah where the youngsters are exposed to haram on their pdas which unfortunately are shoved down our throats due to education so even your eight or nine years old child insists on having an ipad or a tablet to do his homework and we know what entails in this what's included in the package so you get youtube you get social media instagram snapchats etc and all the filth that comes along with it unfortunately and this is very dangerous and alarming because children at a very early age are exposed to things that we as adults and grown-ups might not be aware of and they have more knowledge than when we were their age so you have to be careful even with the same gender by the way don't simply let your child play with his cousins just because they're all boys not knowing what might happen and unfortunately many sad things happen and in this era of lgbtq xy they would come and justify things let the child come out of the closet the child is experiencing his own identity his true reality etc blah blah all this nonsense and filth that the disbelievers trying to shove down the throats of not only the muslims but their own people as well and this is very unfortunate when you see these attempts and these plots being tailored made for their countries and for their people and this is something for their own people to take care of and they are the people normal natural people are are alarmed by what's happening in schools by what's happening in the media like disney and and other entertainment companies who are systematically inserting and involving people unwillingly against their will in such plots and filth may allah protect us i'm talking about our countries about our muslim societies and communities we have to build a strong solid wall against these attempts and you have to be careful about your own children don't let them unsupervised don't just for the sake of having an hour without headaches or supervision leave them do whatever they want and maybe catastrophes may allah protect them all might take place don't say it's their cousins i trust them or even their uncles they're the same age i trust them no we have trust but at the same time it's important to be careful as well and allah azza knows best"
