  "transcript": "um do we have to perform wudu when we perform russell and what about what was in the past this question we've answered so many times russell is a total bath so a total bath is called russell but this is divided into two types one a religious russell a legislative russell which is used to uplift a major impurity such as a person in the state of major impurity janaba or a woman who is pure from her menses and she wants to uplift the major impurity so this is done by performing russell there is a sunnah way of doing it and there is a normal way which is just totally soak your body turn the water in your mouth and sniff and blow your nose with more with water that's it if you do either one you are in the state of uh purity and you don't have to perform moodle because the bigger ritual the major ritual impurity underneath it once uplifted also uplifts the minor ritual impurity so two for the prophet price of one as for the second type of hustle or total bath which i do maybe to go to jummah or to the eid maybe i do when coming back from the gym or when i'm hot and i just want to freshen up this can never be used to pray afterwards because was not performed so there was no major ritual impurity uplifted and hence the minor ritual impurity was not uplifted and therefore you cannot pray uh with that what had happened in the past if it is a prayer or two make them up now if it if we're talking about years then this is inshallah forgiven due to your ignorance and allah knows best mariah you"
