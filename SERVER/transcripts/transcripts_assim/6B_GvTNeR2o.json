  "transcript": "the next question is from brother abdullah bashir can i give all my zakat to one person yes no problem as long as he's needy see sometimes when i have a thousand dollars and i give each family 100 family i give each one 10 10 10 i distributed my thousand dollars to the needy did anyone of these 100 families benefit from my 10 each no so sometimes i have to utilize and look into who would benefit so if i have 100 families but i know that if i divide the thousand over four families 250 each they would be able to pay off the rent or one would buy the sufficient medication for a whole month or one would buy food for the whole year so i would fulfill each family of these three or four families needs rather than distributed over a large amount of muslims who are not going to benefit that much from it and allah knows best"
