  "title": "Drop Selling or Servicing Halal? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have Juwayriya from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, it's drop service in Halal, so basically it's a business model where someone offers a service to clients but does not do the work themselves. Instead, they hire a freelancer or another company to complete the job. So the person in the middle makes profit by charging the client more than what they pay the freelancer. And there is a contract between the drop service business owner and the freelancer. Barak Allahu Fikir. there's no problem in me getting a subcontractor. the hoovering of the carpets, the cleaning of the toilets, everything is listed down. And we agree upon X amount of money and the terms and conditions. And I sign, and I go to another company, a subcontractor, and I have the same contract with them, but with less payment so that I can make a profit. And they pledge to do it. And I sign a contract and they go and do this work. This is totally halal, inshallah.
