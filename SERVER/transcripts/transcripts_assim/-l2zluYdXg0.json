  "title": "Why Should we limit ourselves to only ONE SHEIKH? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "First, I want to say some of the words last night in Masjid al-Bukhara that we as a young generation should not be involved on labeling individuals like this guy is multi-ah, this guy is qadari, or something like that. Yet, we are all probably aware that in this time and period, our internet and our social media are polluted by so many ideas from many fiqhs, like multi-ah, or fiqh, whatever. I'm kind of nervous right now. Plenty of them are claiming themselves as fiqh hadith, and the worst part is, each of them got their own fiqh, and knowing the fact that even the students of Ibn Abbas, which is another Ibn Azraq, even fall into their kind of shubha. So, that made me think that should we really limit our source of information from particulars to youth, but in the same time, I think that will lead me to bull. So, which made me think that, I really hope you can give me, or give us a young generation, a principle of qawatid to examine or filter any of those ideas that come to us like a poor ingredient. So, I think that's all pretty much my question. Thank you so much. Really glad to have you here. If not eaten by a shark, you will drown. So, in Islam, Allah Azawajal tells us to go to the Quran and to the sunnah. Whenever you have a dispute, go back to Quran and sunnah, to Allah and the messenger. Now, we have, as you have stated, 72 sects, which the Prophet said, all in hell except one. And everyone has hujjah. This is not true. If they had hujjah, Allah would have confused us, and we would not know what is right and what is wrong. No, no, no. Truth is clear as daylight. You can see it. Anyone from the people of khawarij, murji'ah, of innovation, of aqeedah, that is corrupt, the moment he opens his mouth, immediately you know it's falsehood. While the people on the path of the Prophet, the moment they open their mouths, you say, natural. I feel good. I feel that this is going with my soul. Because this is the religion of Allah. So, you as the youth, what to do? Number one, don't engage yourself with something that would confuse you, because this is what shaitan wants you to do. Shaitan's only mission in life is to gather as many volunteers and companions in hellfire. That's it. Whether you do it through lusts and desires, whether you do it through whispers and doubts, whether you do it through shirk and OCD, no problem. You choose. I want you to be with me in hellfire. This is what shaitan wants. So now, as youth, you have to focus. If you go to the gym and you don't focus on what you're doing, by just looking at people, you will lose. You will be distracted. No, focus on what you're doing. What are you doing? I'm learning Islam. How to learn Islam? Learn the book of Allah. How to learn the book of Allah? Learn the tafsir, the meaning, and memorize. Then, learn about the sunnah of the Prophet, peace be upon him. Implement it in your life. Learn about the aqeedah of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. Once you do this, you can easily filter, but you don't go and listen to filter. Rather, if you hear something, you will be able to filter. By saying this, we say you have to follow one trusted shaykh. A shaykh, you trust his knowledge. You trust his religious commitment. You trust his akhlaq. I wouldn't trust a shaykh who sits with women and flirts with them and laughs and cracks jokes and she cracks jokes. My place or yours? This is not a real shaykh. A real shaykh who is committed to Islam, to abiding by the religion. If you follow this shaykh, he will manage to carry you until you reach a level, when you say to the shaykh, you did your job, I can walk on my own now. Because now I, you have given me the knowledge and the strength to see for myself. But till then, you have to be with the shaykh. Otherwise, you may be distracted like you have said. Hello. So you may be distracted by the different people on the arena that you will have doubts in your own religion, which is very bad. People of deviance and different sects, they do not have hujjah. And Nafi ibn al-Azraq, who came to Ibn Abbas and Ibn Abbas cleared it up for him, his doubts. I think if I'm not mistaken, he also went to Umar and shared with him some of his doubts. What did Umar do? He took his stick and hit him on his head until his head started bleeding. So he says, do you still have doubts? He said, no, no, no. Doubts are gone. All gone. Disappeared. He said, OK, now you go. So this is the best way, inshallah, of solving doubts. A good stick."
