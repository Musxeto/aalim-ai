  "transcript": "oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious yah dear brothers and sisters in Islam yesterday we talked about the types of the sence of the hour and we if you if you remember said that there are minor size signs and major signs the minor signs some of them had taken place and will not happen again and some of them and this is the bulk is happening and will continue to happen or reoccur in the future and there are some of the signs the minor signs of the hour that did not take place yet it will happen inshallah in the future and this is common between these minor signs that did not happen and the major signs that did not happen and as promised yesterday we're going to talk about one of the signs of the hour that took place at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam chapter 54 verse number one Allah this chapter is or Surah is called the Surah of the Moon Allah says in the Quran Allah says the hour has drawn nearer and the moon has been cliffed aunder the moon has been Cliff aund it has been split into two parts now now in the sah of IM Muslim narrated by an Malik may Allah be pleased with him and also in the Sunan narrated by Abdullah Mas that the pagans of Mecca demanded a miracle they wanted a sign to prove that the prophet Alam is the messenger of Allah in the Hadith of Muslim Allah Asel made the moon to split into two parts and the prophet was talking to the pagans and to the Muslims as well testify look and testify bear witness on what is happening in some narrations the kufar they were the pagans they were the one who demanded that the prophet would split the moon and it was full moon at that night and when Allah gave that merage the idol worshippers the pagans said that well this is sorcery this is Magic he uh uh did something to make us think that we're seeing the moon to be split and he's a sorcerer so this is not new for him and we as Muslims believe that this had taken place at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam now I know know that there are the non-muslims would say this is not acceptable how can the moon be split into two even some of the so-called quote unquote Muslims may also object to that and saying that this is not possible and this shows you the amount of ignorance isn't Allah the one who created the heavens and the Earth we live on this planet called Earth and in this solar system and we have millions of similar solar systems in the uh Milky Way the Galaxy and there are millions of other galaxies do you think it would be difficult for Allah to split the moon into two halves as a miracle now one would argue and say yes but this is not scientific this is so and this is so Dr zul Nar on his website and I asked him once this personally and I told him is there any scientific evidence to prove this he told me that he and it's on his website that while he was giving a lecture in Cardiff in the UK and a person asked him about the splitting of the Moon and he said is this scientific and the doctor said Dr Z said no this is not scientific because science cannot prove it this is a miracle had it not been for the Quran and for the authentic sunn I'm Muslim no one can doubt this we would not have believed it but because the Quran and the authentic Sunnah proves it prove it we believe it and embrace it as Muslims and we don't need any signs to prove that for us he told in his website that a man stood by the name of if I recall correctly David Moses uh uh pitcock dud he's a a Muslim a rever Muslim and at the time I think he was the head of the Islamic party in the parliament or somewhere I don't know and he wanted to commment and he said that years ago when he was a Christian a student gave him a copy of the Holy Quran and the first page he opened was chapter 54 that spoke about the the Moon being uh uh cliffed aunder and he immediately closed the book and said that this is not logical I'm not going to continue to read this until years later he saw an interview on the BBC or some other channel in the UK and he saw the interviewer speaking with three scientists from NASA and he was bombarding the them with criticism how do you dare spare spend so much money with all this poverty hunger famine all over the world spend so much money on exploring things that have no value to you and they were talking to him and they said that we've spent hundred billion dollar just to set a man to uh uh foot set a man's foot on the moon and the interview was outrage and then they told him about the things that they've discovered that no way they would have believed that and what they had discovered was that after studying the geology of the Moon they've discovered that it was actually there was a crack from top to bottom going right through the center of the Moon which meant that it was split and they could tell by uh uh uh the surface of that crack that went through the core and that was from all over from the top to the bottom of the Moon and when they studied the only justification scientific justification was that it was split into two parts and then it was sealed back again so David petcock when he heard this he went back to the Quran he studied and he embraced Islam because he said that 14 centuries ago no way the prophet Alam would have known something like that to be the first Ayah in in a in a chapter of the Quran that the moon was split that the moon was Cliff aund so this is something from the Contemporary you can refer to Dr zul Nar he always appears on uh Huda TV and other Islamic channels he is known to uh uh explore the science science in the Quran and the Sunnah and not only that I I know that disbelievers with weak knowledge about Islam with zero knowledge of the power of Allah would keep on ridiculing this or thinking that this is not logical one of the scholars of Islam though he was ANH yet he had a lot of things that were positive in his work and he was known to be one of the smart uh and intellectual Muslim Scholars his name was Abu Bakr bakani and he was requested by the khif at the time it was approximately in the 4th Century to go to uh costantino and to meet the byzantian Caesar there because he requested some uh uh information and to be sent an ambassador so that they can communicate and it was almost a time of truce at the time so Abu Bakr being a a knowledgeable scholar of Islam went in and there are a lot of things that took place that were so funny but so informative and it shows you the dignity and honor of the scholars of Islam at that time nowadays unfortunately not all of them have this because some of them had sold the religion some of them had humilated themselves through asking people for money and for uh uh pity cash but real Scholars alhamdulillah they exist today there are lots of them but I'm talking about the unfortunate status of Scholars nowadays when the governments the Islamic governments are not supporting them are not giving them enough to sustain an honorable life instead they have have to work and maybe they have to humilate themselves anyhow Abu Bakr was a judge Alani so when he went to visit the uh uh bizantium Caesar they told him that you have to take your shoes off and you have to wear special kind of slippers and you have to take a turbin and wear very light uh uh cloth on your head because these are the customs and he said no I'm a scholar you accept me as I am and I will come you don't I'll go back to my country under this sort of Pride the uh uh uh the king or the Caesar allowed him to come the custom was that everyone who comes he used to he must have bow in front of the king but they knew that he was a Muslim and Muslims never bow in Islam it's shik it's associating others with Allah to Bow so that is why even in karate Muslims don't bow it is forbidden completely to bow to prostrate so the king said that make a trick so so that he must bow without ordering him to do so so they made a very small door with a low uh uh ceiling so that if he wanted to enter he would have to do this and enter bowing and then raise his head up and and the king would take this as bowing the Judge Al bakani when he came and saw this he figured it out and he went in backwards so he gave his back and went in kneeling to the opposite side so he gave his back end rear end to the Byzantium Caesar and he went in this fashion and the King immediately KN knew that this one was a tough cookie he was a tough cookie to uh uh play around with then he asked him about so many things but what I wanted to ask here was or mention here was he asked him about the splitting of the Moon and he said in your book it is is stated that the moon was split how is that he said yes this is in the Quran in the Sunnah he said how did it happen when no one on earth reported it except you Arabs and the Muslims he said because people were not watching were not anticipating he said yeah but this is not acceptable to us so the judge Alani said tell me about the table the past that descended to Jesus and his Apostles we have it we are we have it mentioned in our Quran but did everyone see it and the King said yes he said the Jews did not see it and they falsify it the Hindus the fire worshippers all denomination all over the world none of them reported it so can you say that it this is also a lie and the Caesar was wordless he didn't know what to say and there are so many things of that beautiful journey of this judge Muslim judge to that Caesar that shows you the intellect for example they gave a party a dinner party and they invited him and this was only in a in less than a week time because they dismissed him and sent him with lots of gifts back to his home country because they told him if you keep this man here he's going to affect all the Christians and they're going to reject their faith he he has so much proof and logic that we cannot argue with him one of the things that he did is the Caesar brought his patriarch I think it's called is the head of the Orthodox church and he told him listen this is a Muslim judge he's smart he's witty be careful try to be firm in your religion so that he would make a mistake and then we would hold one against him so the guy said okay and they gathered all the priests all the monks all the scholars in Christianity and he made a big feast and when the judge came everybody was there in silence he entered and the Caesar was introducing him to the patriarch and he said that this is the head of the Christian church and the judge went and smiled and said how are you how's the wife how's the children how's the family and everybody was in a very pale and straight face and he said what's wrong with you and the Caesar said I thought that you were a you were a man of knowledge don't you know that the Patriarchs and and the and and the priests don't get married and don't have wives and don't have children he said Subhan Allah you claim that allaha had a wife and he had a son and this beautiful thing you're depriving your priests and monks to have what kind of a religion is this and they were baffled and they were shocked because this is simple logic they ask him a question and this is beside the topic I'm going to go back to the topic in in a minute but his his biography is astonishing they asked him wanting to in a sense pooke our religion and make fun out of it so they said tell me about the one of your Prophet who was accused of adultery and immediately on the spot Abu Bakr bakani knew that he was referring TOA whom the hypocrit slandered her and Allah revealed a whole Surah Surah clarifying that she's innocent and pure now if he's going to tell him about that this was the hypocrit saying and this was that or like the Shia do when they slander mother AA because they like sh and those who slunder mother AA they are like the Christians they're cfir to us so instead of explaining and making a long story short he answered in two sentences or few words he said this is something that the wife of the Prophet Alam was accused of and there were no evidences and she was cleared by Allah and also Allah told us about another woman who was accused of the same thing but she came with a baby he was referring to M Mary the mother of Jesus and everyone was again speechless AA was accused now if we don't believe in the Quran if we don't believe in the Sunnah a woman was accused there are no evidences no Witnesses she's cleared she did not fornicate she did not commit adultery also with Mary peace be upon her and peace be upon her her son Jesus Christ if we did not believe in the Quran nor in the Sunnah and the Jews accused her of committing fornication the evidence is that she's carrying a son and he does not have a father but because we're Muslims because we believe in the Quran and we believe in the honesty and purity of Mary the mother of Jesus Christ peace being upon him and we believe in his miraculous birth we do not say this but though who do not believe were speechless they didn't have anything to commend because this is history and this is what you also uh agree and approve of anyhow the splitting of the moon is a fact there's no doubt in it none whatsoever to us Muslims non-muslims go ahead and research do your geological studies it does not matter to us because we believe in the Quran and the Sunnah we believe in the Unseen however some Scholars do not consider the splitting of the Moon to be a sign of the hour why is that they said because there was nothing in the Quran nor in the Sunnah that says that the splitting of the moon is a sign of the hour all what there is is that Allah said the hour has drawn nearer and the moon has been split has been a a cliff aunder so there isn't anything that states that it is a sign of the day of judgment and this is true however I mentioned it because Omar may Allah uh uh protect him and preserve him who wrote a number of beautiful books I think they are translated by Dar Salam and this book is known as the signs of the minor day of judgment which is the signs of uh uh uh the hour and there are the signs of the day of judgment which is a different topic altogether and what will happen in this universe and this is a different topic she dran Omar Asar mentioned this in his book however four years before he published his book Dr YF wrote a thesis for his Masters in the Islam in in the University of IM Muhammad about the same topic and he did not mention it because as I've stated it there is no relation between it and the and the signs of the hour it is a miracle and there is no doubt about it but it is not considered to be part or one of the signs of the hour the second um sign of the hour that took place and will not happen again is what the prophet said in the authentic Hadith in the no doubt about it that the day of judgment would not come until a fire comes out in the Arabian peninsula in hij to be specific the prophet specified Al a fire will come out from its light the necks of the camels in busra in sham area in Syria would be lit at night people would see it so it's huge fire huge light that would be light the whole of the Arabian Peninsula and also shed light to a sham District now this fire was recorded historian spoke about it and it came out in the year 654 hij those who reported it were IM nawi IMB K and also abush sh Ali they all spoke about what had happened from a number of different sources in a nutshell what had happened was a volcanic eruption that took part east of Medina in that year and it remained and stayed for about 2 months what was so miraculous about it there was a great change in the world 2,000 kilm to the Northeast in Iraq in Bagdad the capital reporters said that there was huge floods until the whole of Bagdad or almost most of it was submerged underwater from the river DEA which means that something took place due to that volcanic eruption what was so strange about it what was strange that in the first three or four nights before the eruption there were earthquakes and everything was shaking and trembling and they were hearing horrific sounds of banging and and and and earthquakes and something that they cannot describe and on the fifth day of jamad II they saw the Earth throwing l throwing Sparks like Allah described inat that Hellfire throws Sparks as if they are as big as the camels the yellow camels so huge the Sparks and what's coming out comes out like in castles so huge and so big that it started throwing fire everywhere and there was this River of lava that was moving on and the people of Medina were terrified they did not have anything to defend themselves against this and you know such acts of so-called quote and unquote nature people don't have any means of Defense a tsunami could come and it would kill hundreds of thousands of peop in seconds you cannot do anything when Allah wants it when Allah wills it it's gone an earthquake that lasts for 15 seconds you've seen what it made in Japan you've seen what it made worldwide these are the soldiers of Allah that no one can stand in front of when Allah wants it when Allah wills it that is it it's the end of the day however it was not hot in the sense that people died no one died and it remained for almost two months yet it was astonishing the the river of lava was about 3 MERS high and it was like four kilometers in wdth and the length they could not calculate and it did not approach Medina it was all surrounding Medina going through the mountains and through the valleys and blocking some valleys blocking some uh uh uh passages there and people were were terrified some of the historians said we came all the way from when we heard this and we went to see it and it was huge and scary and when we drop leaves of trees or of palm trees it doesn't eat it it doesn't consume it it doesn't burn it but whenever it passes through rocks it melts it so Subhan Allah this volcanic lava was not hot and it did not burn anything except rocks and nobody died no houses were burned nothing else was burnt ex or consumed except rocks people were terrified they the minute it took place and for the consecutive two months or so they went to the Masjid they took off the turbin they went in Repentance to Allah the judges and the scholars went to the to the leader of Medina at the time and told him you have to repent and he went to the Masjid he repented he set all of his slaves free he took all the money that he gathered from the people wrongfully and unlawfully and he returned it back to the people repenting from the money because this is the norm the rulers of cities have unlimited powers and they would embezzle they would steal they would put their hands on different properties and say these are mine this is mine and if someone objects to them they throw him in jail or they take all of his belongings they have no one to fear not even Allah but when they saw this lava when they saw this volcanic eruption they believed in the Hadith of the prophet wasam and they reckoned that it is close to Doomsday so they started repenting and giving everything back to its people the Amir the leader himself as recorded in the books of History he suspended and lifted stopped all together any taxation because taking taxes from the Muslims is Haram it's forbidden why do you take taxes unless you have a need for that in normal Muslim states you don't take taxes and it's forbidden for you to take taxes because the whole government the whole country is supposed to suffice itself taking taxes from the people is sharing my earnings and this is something I worked for you have no right to take any percentage in that that is why the prophet saidat when Malik may Allah be pleased with him was stoned to death for committing adultery and he testified against himself and he said Purify Me give me the capital punishment I cannot bear this sin when he was stoned to death one of the companions said a bad word about him and he said don't do this either him or or the who committed also adultery and was ston to death he said that he Ed a repentance that was so genuine if a man who collects taxes repented it Allah would have forgiven him which means that collecting taxes is one of the greatest and major sin taxes are forbidden in Islam so the Amir himself said no more taxations and not only that in these two months the historians say you would not hear any musical instruments or any doof or any kind of entertainment in Medina everyone was terrified it was a horrific scene they were so afraid of what's going to happen and they believed in the Hadith of the prophet in theah where he prophesies that this would happen historians say that one of the historians say that I was 14 years old when this took place and I heard one of the bedwin in busra in a sham saying that there is a strange phenomenon the light there is a light coming and we can see the nexts of the camels exactly as they didn't quote the Hadith because they did not know it but he was reporting it that exactly as the prophet saidat through that period of one or or two months the Sun and the Moon never came up except in a state of eclipse because of the volcanic ash that was in the air so so this took place and it happened and it will not happen again this fire coming from hij from Medina there will come a fire that would throw or Draw everyone and push everyone to their uh day of but this will come in the major signs inshallah uh when we talk about it we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back Allah fulfill our AIMS in don't miss ramadan's Paul of this Ramadan from Sunday to Thursday 1 hour before ask Huda that's 1:00 GMT and 4:00 meca time with me your favorite host Malik only on HUD TV us and have your say let's talk about our way remember you are not alone is the light in your home face Islam Muslims everywhere are faced with issues and situations every day let's find those Solutions together right here on face Islam won't you join us here for face Islam face Islam and pull all of those misconceptions to rest shikh YF addresses the most common misconceptions one by one and puts the critics to shame oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in lifeam alaykum and welcome back until we receive your phone calls uh maybe it's advisable that we continue to mention some of the signs that took place and uh uh were already happening or happened already um in Islam we have jiz we have alaj and we have zakat so it's might be uh uh uh good and advisable to explain these zakat as we know is one of the pillars of Islam there is a percentage that every Muslim should take from his savings if he have has money or gold or cash and a whole year passes and it is a minimum requirement below it you don't have zakat above it you have to pay zakat it's a 2.5% this is roughly speaking I'm not talking about the zakat of livestock I'm not talking about the zakat of the grains that come from uh Earth and I'm not talking about merchandise that you sell and buy so generally speaking 2.5% is what you give and you give this to the poor you don't give this to Scholars otherwise I would have been extremely rich you don't give to this to the mullah or to uh um any Tom Dick Harry you give this to the poor Allah mentioned this in verse 60 chapter 9 that you give it to the poor and to the needy so what is jizya in an Islamic State a proper Islamic State aizia is a sort of Taxation that is taken from those who are not Muslim living on Muslim territory living in Muslim on Muslim soil so why do you take this taxation from them it's a small percentage which makes an income to the treasury okay noan Khadijah uh first of all we take nus from Dubai nus hello hello Alum yeah I have a question to ask you actually uh one of my relative in India they asked me to buy a jewelry for her they offered what they asked me to buy a jewelry for her jewelry okay yeah Jewell okay what's the question okay now I I actually I went I went in search of it and yesterday I bought it okay yeah um uh the cost is um around uh uh 14 15,200 something my husband said you went to you went in you had many expenses incurred upon it like I went in transport expenses and all the food expenses so he said you can um have a extra amount um um around 100 or 200 extra and you can charge it like that is it uh valid I will answer your question inshah uh Khadijah from Dubai sister Khadija yes yes your question please alikum um she I called yesterday regarding the zakat for the property and I just have uh one clarification um I had the property for a while and I was renting it and I was paying zakat on the rental and I have now just sold it so that was my question whether I have to pay zakat now or do I pay zakat uh one year later okay I would answer your question and I have I have one more question regarding um Maham uh to go to um uh Hajj or um uh if a woman is above 45 you mentioned the other day that uh you cannot go for ha or umrah without the Maham however there's an organization here in the UAE that allows women to go and I think they group them with other groups and allow them to go for Hajj so I just wanted your comments on this okay I will comment on this inshallah yeah okay before we answer n and khadijah's question so what is the type of of this taxation the jizya for the non-muslims to be able to reside in a Muslim territory we as Muslims take this jizya from them first of all to protect them so if any Invasion anyone is trying to uh invade our country they're not allowed and they're not supposed to pick up arms and go and defend this is our job we're taking this money to defend you and this is mentioned in Surah as well that Allah ordered the non-muslims to pay this zaka uh this jizya alaraj is what they give for the lands we have an agreement with them that they may plant and cultivate and sell the crops so we take from them something that we agree upon 10 to 90 20 to 80 depending on it because the land is it it belongs to the Muslim uh uh government to the Muslim Nation this is not to be owned by non-muslims so they can live in it they can cultivate it and we uh agree on a percentage if they accept Islam all of this would be uplifted so it is an incentive for them to accept Islam No one is forcing them you want to remain as you are it's okay but you have to pay this form of Taxation and I will stop here until we answer these questions and see what uh how things develop Nas was asking about people ask her to buy them something so she is acting as an agent so someone comes to me and say sheim I'd like you to buy me a watch XY Z I know that the watch uh the watch costs a th000 uh R okay we have Abu safan from Kuwait hello yes yes bro listen to me from the phone please okay uh you see I have a question um I was waiting for I have some problem with my so I could not ask you I don't if we have to only ask question specific to Zak or we can ask anything you can ask anything insh okay hello you know uh actually about this zakat you know we have some Diamond obviously there is no zakat on diamond but actually this diamond is Ed in some 18 carat gold or 9 carat gold or 14 car gold so do we have to payak on that gold which is being used for holding this diamonds second question first question and second question is my daughter you we are from Canada we are living in Canada but I'm working in quit but my family settled in Canada my daughter she wants to go she is very religious she is taking the job and she's also she 21 she wants to go to study medical to to some other country obviously she go alone is it allowed or what are the rulings okay it'll be great if you could kindly answer me I will answer you so someone tells me she buy me this watch for a th000 real I buy the watch and then I top it like instead of 1,000 R I say it's 1,00 R and I give it to my friend and I charge him 12200 r without him knowing is this permissible this is not permissible this is Haram why because I cannot profit from something I did not own first of all second of all what she's saying is that her husband is saying that you have occurred incurred some expenses taxis parking going it so you should Top This by 200 Dirhams and charge your expenses is this permissible it is not permissible per se because if you were doing a favor to your friend you should have made this clear to her saying that listen I'm going to buy this set of jewelry 14,000 Dirhams but whatever I pay as expenses you will reimburse me usually your friend would say definitely so if you do not tell your friend you cannot top this except what is exactly what you have paid as expenses but if you go to the mall and you spend like 3 hours looking for her jewelry and doing your own shopping and you pay for uh uh the parking for 3 hours and which only took you half an hour to look for her jewelry and also you you you buy some hamburgers and drinks and take the children to play and you also consider this to be uh part of the charges and the cost this is Haram you should only actually charge what you have paid specifically for that purpose and I would personally would not do this if a friend asks me for a Faceook I would consider these 100 or 150 dams part of the favor I'm doing to my friend what are friends for and then she asks about uh I think sadik from Nigeria and we don't have sadik from Nigeria so I think this is N N's uh only question Khadijah had two questions the first of all she was clarifying the issue of yesterday's question the property she had it was on rent so she was getting rent out of it and when she sold it she's asking do I give the zakat immediately or do I have to wait a whole year the answer is remains that as it is you have to wait for a whole year her second question was about uh in in the Emirates they have groups or or companies that allow women to go for Hajj in groups without a Maham so what I did not get the point you take your religion from me or from someone else or you take it from the Quran and the Sunnah I am merely giving you the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah and you apply your Islam to it the prophet saysat and he was addressing the Muslims it is not permissible for a woman that believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a m a man man stood up and said oh prophet of Allah my name was drawn so I have to go to the expedition of so and so it's said we're going for Jihad for battle but my wife went for Hajj now you've said what you had said now I'm in a dilemma so the prophet said Alam go and accompany your wife the prophet took him off the Expedition and instructed him and ordered him to accompany his wife that is it the in the prophet did not ask him was she alone or with a trustworthy group of women the prophet did not ask him was she young or old was she white or black is she beautiful or ugly he didn't ask him any of these questions which means that any woman is not allowed to travel without a m whether for Haj which is a pillar of Islam or to anything else this is naib from Nigeria na hellum listen to me from the phone please okay yes naib you are my question okay question is okay don't listen to me do not listen to me from the television mute your TV and speak to me from the phone I don't understand your question of I didn't um I'm afraid I cannot understand what you're saying brother na uh okay so she is not entitled to travel with without a m for now if there are companies saying that we have fatwa from so and so I don't care about their fatwas I care about the Quran and the Sunnah and the prophet is the one who gave us the fatwa one would say oh but the scholar so and so says as long as she's in an airplane with trustworthy compan where did what would I do when I meet the prophet at on the day of judgment and I said oh Prophet I apologize but they were Scholars big Scholars they come on my 44 inch screen uh LCD what is this you're a Muslim you follow the Quran and the Sunnah and the fatwas of Scholars would not help you on the day of judgment if you know the authentic Hadith and it's Crystal Clear what else do you want who do you believe in the scholar or the prophet alham so I hope this uh answers your question brother Abu safan is saying that in case we have gold and the gold has diamonds so a woman has a necklace beautiful necklace a big diamond with a necklace of gold whether 14 16 20 uh carats gold so how do we calculate the zakat this is something you cannot do maybe the necklace is worth $100,000 and if you take it to the jewelry shop he would tell you that there is only 20 G of gold in it hence it is not zable yes why because the gold does not reach the nisab which is 85 g of gold of pure 24 karat gold so you have to take this whatever jewelry you have you just put it in a bag and take it to the jewel shop and ask uh uh the uh Goldsmith to calculate the amount of gold this is something they know by profession and then you can calculate the gold but diamonds as long as you're not keeping it to sell it you're not investing in it there is no zakat for it nor any other precious stones his second question was about his daughter she's 21 she's wearing nikab she's a practicing muslima masallah may Allah preserve her and send her a righteous and Pious husband that would cherish her and love her he's asking that she would like to pursue her studies in medicine but she wants to travel somewhere else to finish her school is this permissible if she's not traveling with a Maham this is not permissible for any reason as we've stated just a while ago and if a Maham is taking her to that school Let's uh uh um say that she lives in Vancouver and she wants to go and study in Toronto so if her Maham her father her brother takes her to Toronto and she would stay in a safe in environment so she would stay in a hostel that uh um only females reside in it no males allowed and she's safe and sound everything comes to her uh way she doesn't have to go out and expose herself without having any Mah in town and the school that she goes to it um omin from Amin okay Amin from Saudi Arabia as I have two questions okay one is I own two houses in India okay I have rented them do I have to pay zakat on it or only the rent okay second question and the second question is how many should be offered for and is okay okay thank you thank you too so um if the university is mixed and you have have boys and girls and as we know it in Canada or in the states that there is no segregation you're unable to maintain your Chastity separating yourself from this uh uh spoiled and corrupt environment I personally believe that women should not go to uh such extent because their Chastity and preserving their Islam and being setf on Islam is a priority is a must so if they can study through uh correspondence if they can go to segregated universities this is a must for them uh sister uh just called from Saudi Arabia she has two houses in India and she is having them on rent she's renting them uh out so does she give zakat on the property the answer is no the property uh uh is not Z catable things that you own and and they're not for sale you do not give zakat for them I could have a um a rental car company and I have a fleet of 100 cars the best models today's uh uh model this uh Year's model very expensive and maybe it cost the whole the 100 cars May cost over 10 million real and I'm leasing them and I get them back and I lease them again and so on do I have to give zakat for these 100 cars answer is no the the zakat is only due on the rent that I collect if it mounts to the nisab and a whole year passes so for you when you give your house for rent in India and they give you in advance the monthly uh the yearly rent then you have to give 2.5% when a whole year passes over if you spend it throughout the year then there is no zakat if you collect the rent at the end of the year the minute you take the rent you give 2.5% so I hope this answers your question and clears it when you get rent you either get it in the beginning of the year for a whole year or you get it at the end of the year if you get it in in the beginning of the year and throughout the year you spend it and at the end of the year it's all gone there is no Z but if you lease the house for a whole year and at the end of the year you collected the rent for the previous year immediately you have to give 2.5% for that uh rent and she's asking how many R do we pray for D or is is which is the prayer that follows the sunrise the Hadith of the Prophet a beautiful Hadith he said that whoever prays F in congregation that is in the Masjid and he remains in the place where he has prayed remembering Allah making Vick invoking Allah until the sun rises approximately the span or the length of a spear which is about 15 minutes after the calendar sunrise and then prays two ra then Allah would reward him a perfect and Hajj perfect perfect the prophet say three times so it's a great reward these two are known as the two of is and dispute among Scholars whether these two of is are the same as or not and the most authentic opinion is that they are the same but the difference is that is is a DHA prayer prayed at the beginning of the day and DHA is prayed throughout the day before thean of how many R you can pray two r and the sky is the limit if someone wakes up and at 10:00 a.m. 2 hours and a half before time he wants to pray voluntary prayers two raas 4 10 20 100 all of this is acceptable because this is a time of prayer there's no problem in praying it but the is two the minimum and some say that you can even pray it up till eight raas where the Prophet Alam as in theith went when he conqu conquered Mecca in the conquest of Mecca and she entered and she saw the prophet pray eight ra if I'm not mistaken and the prophet after that attended her questions so some Scholars say that these eight rakat are part of the D others say no this these eight rakat are the prayers of conquest and either way alhamdulillah the minimum is to if you want to add to that there is no problem in that inshallah tomorrow we will begin with uh where we stopped and we will continue inall to talk about um one of the signs of the hour which is the suspension of collecting jiz and and uh what the scholars said about that until we meet you tomorrow same time an hour from now I leave you my creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our s yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious"
