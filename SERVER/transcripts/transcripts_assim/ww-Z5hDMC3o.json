  "title": "Ritual before Eid - Zakat Al Fitr | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "as we've said allah azzawajal has mandated rituals at the end of ramadan as a form of betting ramadan farewell as a form of what a sunnah prayer does to the fart where it completes whatever short flaws were there in the fart likewise this is something that islam mandated upon the muslims in the end of the month of ramadan as a conclusion among these rituals is what is known as zakatul fitor zakat is one of the pillars of islam but this is specific this is zakat al-fitr is when you break your fast and this is what we call al-iftar or when you break your fast when you eat the first meal of the day it's called so the cattle footer is something related to breaking your fast and this is what allah azza has mandated upon us at the end of the month of ramadan why was it prescribed it was prescribed for two reasons one that it is a means of purification for whatever shortcomings we had during our fasting and to whatever bad things we've said so as an expiation we are to give this zakat to erase and expiate what had happened second reason is the day of eid is a day of celebration and jubilation so it is inappropriate for the poor and we mean by the poor the really poor who don't have a thing it's inappropriate for them to go and beg people for lunch or for dinner on that day therefore islam mandates that we give a certain amount of food so that on that day they would not need to ask anyone or to beg anyone for it so what is the the cattle footer mandated by the prophet alaihissalat to be given a particular sar one sar is a means of measurement by size not by weight so it's a vessel or a container and this container carries four mud this is a mud if i take a scoop with my two hands this is one mood so i put four of them fill them up four of them would make a sar and people's hands very if i was in the nba my side would probably be a lot and if i were from the far east then my hands would be so tiny no it's the average height and size of a person and this saw has to be from what is commonly consumed by the people so usually it is given out of dates wheat barley beans corn macaroni whatever people eat and you have to pay attention that the weight differs so one saw of dates is different than one straw of wheat or of macaroni or etc so the size is what matters not the weight and i have to give it out on behalf of myself and those whom i'm providing for providing that they're muslims so whether a slave or a free man a boy or a girl a male or a female old or young i provide for them they then i have to give zakat on their behalf and usually in some cultures the father keeps on giving the cattle further on behalf of his children even if they're earning and they've left to live somewhere else and this is permissible only if they authorize you so if my son or my daughter have moved out and i want to give the cattle photo every year as usual i have to take the permission son listen i'm i'm giving zakat to future on behalf of you and your wife and children if he says okay dad no problem this is permissible and as in the hadith of abu sayid the hadith of umar ibn umar may allah be pleased with them all the prophet specifically alaihissalafslam indicated that it has to be food and he gave categories of food and the value of each sar differs from one another this is what called the vast majority of schools of thought and scholars to state that it is not permissible to give it in cash it has to be given in actual food items and it cannot be given in cash if it's given in cash to the poor it is invalid because the value differs and because the prophet had money at his time allah yet he ordered the companions to give it in food so unlike what imam abu hanifa says the vast majority of scholars say you have to give it in food now there's no problem in authorizing an agency an institution a charity organization an individual etc there's no problem for me to authorize them by giving them the money in their hands and saying to them you have to give it to the poor in food so you buy food and give it to them no problem in that and when to give it out to the poor there is a time of permissibility and there's a time of recommendation the time of recommendation is just before the eighth prayer the eighth prayer is done after sunrise on the first day of shawwal so just before that between the sunset of the last day of ramadan till the eighth prayer this all time the whole time is approximately 12 hours a little bit less is sufficient for you to give your zakatel this is the recommendation sometimes due to big metropolitan cities you won't be able to know where the poor is so you may need a little bit more time there's no problem in giving it out a day or two like ibn umar may allah be pleased with him and with his father used to do so a couple of days before eight you can give it to the poor without any problem inshaallah do i have to have a certain threshold to qualify to give zakat no if i have my food for today to most of us this seems that come on we have food for six months in advance yeah but this is what the norm was at the time of the prophet people only had the food of today so if you have your food and your family's food for today and extra that suffices to give zakat then you have to give zakat if you only have your food for today you're not obliged to give zakat so if i'm stoned broke and i have only what suffices me for today and tomorrow give zakat but then i won't have food for tomorrow don't worry for the likes of you others will give you zakat and there's no problem in a group of people a family of 10 giving there's a cat of 10 people to one individual or there's a cat of one individual giving it to a family of five or ten or fifteen there's no problem in that and if you add a little bit more there's no problem in that either this is in a nutshell what the cattle footer is now can i give it on behalf of non-muslims no do i have to give it on behalf of my maids and drivers and workers no because i don't have to provide for them i give them salaries but if i want to do it as a form of charity there's no problem do i have to give it on behalf of my uh pregnant wife the wife yes the pregnancy no it's not mandatory but if you do it then this is recommended as per uthman may allah be pleased with him he recommended that but it's not mandatory at all and do i give it to a specific individual the answer is yes you give it to the poor and the needy only don't make the same mistake that lots of us do when they select their relatives and loved ones and friends and neighbors and they give them the zakat when actually they're not needy or poor this is not permissible and it doesn't count what happens if i was late in giving it so i went for i eat prayer and the time is up what can i do there is nothing for you to do because you're sinful you have delayed it after it's due time ask allah for forgiveness and repent so do i give it the answer is yes this is the right of the poor even if you're sinful you can't just say okay time's up i'm not gonna pay it no it's mandatory upon you to still pay it and give it to the poor you"
