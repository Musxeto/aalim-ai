  "title": "Our sins affect the Ummah, blaming clean shaven men on what's happening in Gaza",
  "transcript": "Imad from the US. Imad. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, I've heard on YouTube that our sins affect the Ummah. You heard what? Our sins affect the Ummah. The sins affect the Ummah. Okay. In generalization, this has reality in it but not as what people think. So a brother next to me is clean-shaven and I say to him, Akhi, all what's happening in Gaza is because you are shaving your beard. Come on, this is not logical. But when the Ummah itself, in its whole entire Ummah, they do not enjoin that is virtuous and righteousness. They don't enjoin good. They don't forbid evil and vice and transgression. In the whole Ummah, where we see it in the market, in the homes, in politics, in economy, in everything, and we're totally diverting from the straight path, this would have an impact on the whole Ummah and Allah knows best."
