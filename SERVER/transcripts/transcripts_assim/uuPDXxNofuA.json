  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh so my question is \nis it permissible to live in Saudi Arabia with   a domestic worker or a private driver \nFisher without working meaning I will   pay all fees and I will not work if it's not \npermissible then how can we live in Saudi Arabia   this is a little bit weird question   countries have laws and among the laws is that you \ncannot live in Saudi Arabia without a work permit   if someone has the financial means to come under \nmy sponsorship and he says listen you pay nothing   I'll come as a driver I'll pay for my residency \nfee every year and for my medical expenses you   don't pay me any salary I'll have my residency \npermit stating that I'm a driver working for you   but I won't be driving for you and I'll just \nlive in this beautiful country as a Muslim   praying in the Masjid and going everywhere I \nwant and I have income from other country for   my country so I'm not going to beg people \nfor money I'm not going to be a liability   technically speaking this is fine but logically is \nit the answer is definitely not you want to come   and live come and work like normal people and if \nyou're rich come and be an investor alhamdulillah   there are laws for investors to come and have the \ngolden residency or Silver Platinum or whatever   you have to pay a a certain amount of money and \nyou can live without even investing if not then   you have to have a business and work so there \nare many ways for you to come and live but the   way you've mentioned it is more closer of someone \nwho's not thinking correctly why would a local   Saudi sponsor you for nothing he said oh no no \nSheikh I'll be paying the Saudi some amount of   money as a salary so that I could do this \nno this is Haram this is breaking the law   and it's not permissible for him to charge you \nanything for such a a scheme so there are many   ways of legitimately coming and living in the uh \nthis country but you have to be able to provide   and to earn as a domestic worker or even as \nan investor whatever and Allah Knows Best"
