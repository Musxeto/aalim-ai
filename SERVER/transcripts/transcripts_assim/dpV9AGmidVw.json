  "transcript": "Ibrahima from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Allah bless you and reward you Sheikh I did not hear that May Allah bless you And you as well Jazakallah Khair Yes Ibrahim what can I do for you? My question today is regarding Khulwa I saw one of your videos where you said that if alone with a woman do not answer her Salam I live in a multiple apartment house and the main building where my mother and some other woman live is downstairs that is also where the kitchen where we get our food from is among the women living there sometimes is my aunt who raised me when I was a child but she's not in she's a non-mahram I never stays in a room with one of them if they plan to stay I leave so does that mean that if I am in the kitchen and one of them comes in to drop a plate for example and give me Salam if I respond I'm sinful? No no no no no no this issue of responding to the Salam when there is Khulwa is referring to whenever there is fitna a young beautiful woman comes in and the man says Assalamu Alaikum and she replies what do you expect is going to happen next a lot of shaky business so this is a fitna she should not respond when there is a possibility of fitna someone who is as old as your aunt says Assalamu Alaikum there is no problem in that someone who is an old geezer and that is in the age of her father and there is respect and he says Assalamu Alaikum or she says Assalamu Alaikum and he replies there is no problem in that Allah knows best."
