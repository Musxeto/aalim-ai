  "transcript": "I WP if I wipe a puddle on the floor and after 3 hours I found out the puddle was an impure water I'm pretty sure the nudes surely has spread CU after I WEP that impure water my feet were still wet from that water and I went to my room uh to my bed some of the family members also step on that impure wet floor uh so my question is should I purify large area in my house including my bed SE this is a hypothetical question that people with OCD usually generate so they make it ALS almost impossible that everything in the house is contaminated by now so the only thing for the Sheikh to give fatwa is burn the whole house and reconstruct it from scratch that's the easiest way to do it this is not logical now we have a ruling that is certainty is not affected by doubt if you're certain that this puddle is NIS and that your feet are NES and that you walked across the house I would say the places that left traces of such liquid would be NES but this is not Corona virus that would spread all over the place this is not acid that would penetrate the floors and the carpets and everywhere else rather where you see traces of njasa this is NIS wash it off if you don't see then it's clean so she I walked to my bed to walk with Feet Two Steps then it's dry even if you climb to your bed there won't be any traces of NASA because your feet are dry now no she my feet had some moisture in it do you see any impurity on your bed sheets no Sheikh then it's pure maybe it dried ah maybe maybe is doubt we can only Implement and apply certainity and this is something that most OCD people don't want to uh uh swallow they just simply want to someone to say to them everything is NES you have to burn the whole house and you have to do drastic measures that are not possible which would inevitably make Shan sayas leave the dean leave Islam that's easier for you than this and Allah knows best may Allah make things easy for all of us faal from Canada"
