  "title": "Divorcing while the wife is Pregnant - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says that there is this woman who got divorced a year ago and they reconciled now I believe that when he divorced her she did not finish their inter period which is noted by three monthly cycles so during these monthly three monthly cycles there still man and wife but they are not allowed to have any types of intimacy unless he intends to reconcile with her and in this case he should notify two Muslim witnesses so I'm assuming that he reconciled with her before her period was over so now they're back man and wife one down that is divorce two to go after being pregnant now he divorces her again and the consensus of all scholars that when a woman is pregnant the divorce takes place immediately no questions asked and I asked her did he divorce you or divorce that woman your friend once and then reconciled and then divorced the third time and she said no he divorced her twice five minutes gap and this is an issue of dispute so if you are from certain schools of thought such as Hanafi school of thought they say that these two divorces are binding and they took place the most authentic opinion is that if a person divorces more than once at the same setting before reconciling this counts as once so if a man says to his wife I D force you I divorce you I divorce you or you divorced you divorce you divorced discount as one and this is the ruling of the Prophet himself alayhi salatu was-salam but if he divorces her and then at night he reconciles with her and few weeks later he divorces her again both divorces are valid so the most authentic opinion Nabila is that your friend is officially now divorced twice and there's one divorce to go and with this track record of her husband I think they need counseling and she must involve his family and her family because this is not child's play now you have two children involved in this family and within a span of couple years or three years maybe less than three years he divorced you twice then you have a serious problem and I don't know whose problem it is maybe it is the woman's problem was nagging and making life impossible to the man or the opposite maybe the man is impulsive and a ignorant brat so we have to look into this and Allah knows best"
