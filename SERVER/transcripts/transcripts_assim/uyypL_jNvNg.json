  "transcript": "and finally muhammad from malaysia so he says that we online classes by the university they set us in groups and so many times there are boys and girls in such a group and we're forced to do this we're forced to have this group come up with a research paper or a project to present and our grades and um passing the course depends on that so is this halal due to being forced to do it being forced to be in a class with the opposite gender this is something for men that is mandatory they are the breadwinners they have to obtain a degree in order to work in order to get married and have a job and have a house and a family so they are obliged to follow this we cannot just simply say to people no don't go to universities work as a janitor work as an uber driver work as a delivery boy no this is not appropriate however once you are forced to be in such groups you have to abide by the islamic rulings no seclusion lowering your gaze no flirting or socializing or chit-chatting be straight to the point be serious don't crack jokes don't try to impress others because you are forced to do this it's exactly when you find yourself stranded in the desert about to die due to starvation and you find a dead donkey so you have to eat in order to remain alive and this is permissible in islam you don't feast on it and start to make a french gourmet and put appetizers and the stuff and invite others you just eat a morsel or two that maintains your life and this is for someone who's stranded and is in a necessity like you but to go on and do whatever you want this is totally unaccepted and not permissible you"
