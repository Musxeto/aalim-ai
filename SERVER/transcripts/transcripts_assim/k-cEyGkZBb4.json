  "title": "If I taught a sin, repented & advised others against it, will I still carry the sin if others do it?",
  "transcript": "my question today is uh if a person assists someone not to do a scene like listen to a music or something and assist him in watching movies and things like that so afterwards the person who assisted him he turned back to allah he he comes out of the jahili and he repents and he becomes a sincere person and then he actually wants to repent so he repents to allah for what he did in assisting him the sin and he advises his friend about not to listen to that music anymore and stop it for the sake of allah he allah he and he repents so even after that if that friend of him continues to listen will will the person who taught the sin still receive the sin or will he be forgiven if he repents and advises him so the question is clear if a person assists and directs and teaches someone to sin and the first one the teacher repents and feels remorseful and pledges not to do the sin again and advises his protege not to do the sin but his students his friend continues to do it would the first one the teacher still be accountable the answer is no with the grace of allah if a person's repentance is accepted and he's truly remorseful and regretful and he asks allah for forgiveness and he tried to advise his friend not to continue in such a sin and how bad such a sin is then he has done his due diligence and allah is most forgiving most merciful and allah azzawajal knows best you"
