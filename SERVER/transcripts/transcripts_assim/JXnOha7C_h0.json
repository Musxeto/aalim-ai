  "transcript": "how to wipe okay I made wood oh I put on my socks and shoes went out answered the call of nature time to pray I want to perform although I performed everything up to the book when I come to the feet I have my socks on so how would I wipe the answer is you wet your hands that's it and there's no water in it it's just wet you place your fingers over your toes and you pull that up to the beginning of your legs to the shin that's it and you do that once you don't go back again you don't wipe the sides you don't wipe what's underneath your feet there's nothing as such"
