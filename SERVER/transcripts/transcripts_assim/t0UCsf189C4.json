  "title": "No race is superior to another race so why did Prophet ﷺ‎ marry mother Safiyyah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay so a brother was telling me about this and he i like he was seeming a little bit confused i'd like you to clarify this so he told me when mother safiya was captured during war she was allocated as a slave girl voldey but some of the companions came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and told him that she is not befitting of de here because she is a daughter of the leader of the jews so the prophet prophet saw islam agreed and he proposed to her so he was saying that we know in islam a race is not superior to another race and like so he was wondering like what was the wisdom behind the prophet salallahu islam agreeing to this first of all it is not wise to try to justify or to look into the logic or to try the prophet alaihis this is not logical we know that he is the messenger of allah we know that he was sent by allah we know that he is the best human ever to walk the earth we know he has no ill intent so what is the reason for such a question okay i'm not going to doubt people and say that oh these guys are hypocrites and they want to do this and do that no but i'm trying to raise the bar a little bit muslims love their prophet unconditionally and they would not argue let alone discuss such thoughts that might confuse people we always think of him as the best without any negativity and everything that he does he does it by the will of allah and the command of allah full stop and this is how we feel about our prophet and we are not willing to compromise this nevertheless to answer your question safiya may allah be pleased with her was the daughter of a great tribesman of his people who was a jew when she was enslaved and captured due to the treason of her people and their plotting against islam and the muslims she became a slave woman and she was allocated to the al-qaeda may allah be pleased with him the companions suggested in order to honor this woman who the lineage has a great importance in islam and we all know this we it's not a an issue of race it's an issue of knowing who the people are and the prophet ordered us that we should place people according to their status it's not be fitting for me to go and treat a muslim dignitary or a muslim judge like i treat a janitor for example when addressing them when uh honoring them when dealing with them in normal life oh sure you're a racist no it's not like that a janitor is a janitor he's my brother he's muslim i honor him but the appreciation i show to the judge or to the dignitary or to the prince or to the head of a tribe is definitely different than this there is no segregation they're all equal in the eyes of islam but the prophet al-islam ordered us to honor people according to their status and this is why when the conquest of mecca took place and the prophet assam wanted to honor a particular individual he said whoever enters the masjid he's safe whoever enters his own home he's safe and whoever enters the house of abu sufyan he's safe any person would have thought that why would i go to abu sufyan's house to be safe if i can go into my own house and be safe why did the prophet assam single out abu sufyan because he knew that abu sufyan was a dignitary of his people and he wanted to honor him he's a man of pride so he wanted to single him out so that this would pay off in the future and it did so why did the prophet sallam ask to let go of safiyyah for him and compensated him with two other slave girls because the prophet hassam wanted to honor this woman who is the daughter of a dignitary of his tribe by freeing her marrying her and restating her status and allah azza knows best you"
