  "transcript": "how are you doing today I'm doing great alhamdulillah okay so the prophet Alam said in I quote there's no house in which agricultural equipment enters it except that Allah will cause humiliation to enter it as well end quote what is the meaning behind this Hadith what jaak this Hadith was in reference to the Muslims leaving Jihad and leaving striving for um spreading the dean in exchange for cultivating their lands and this is similar to when Allah um reprimanded the Muslims for leaving the Jihad and staying behind to cultiv ctiv at their land and to increase their wealth through trade so this Hadith is directed and understood in this context not that Islam prohibits or discourages the Muslims for from working cultivating the land Building uh um projects and dealing in trade and commerce not at all there are so many evidences encouraging this but you have to look at this Hadith in that context as the scholars have indicated and Allah Knows Best"
