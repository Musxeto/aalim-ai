what good the truth is to you so the borderline is if you're praying two RA in the Masid and you get Whispers that oh they're looking at me I'm praying so that I can get their praise and compliment you have two choices on the table either to break a prayer or to continue logical is there a third option no you tell me not that I know okay if you break your prayer Shan Satan Lucifer El is pleased because you obeyed him correct yeah but Allah is angry because you broke your prayer yeah but if you continue to pray Shan is pissed because you disobeyed him and his strategy did not work Allah is pleased because you're worshiping him it boils down to two things either you obey Allah or obyan now you tell me watching anime you tell me snle anime [Laughter] too I'm so glad I got to I hate an

you does it please Allah or please Shan simple as that very simple question don't be thr the bush he's not going to save you in your grave I'm not going to do anything to you on the day of judgment I'm going to bail out for myself man it's my skin so this is how we role in Islam it's not what the people say it's not what my followers dictate that I should do a lot of my followers would like to see me uh in a boxing match with this uh what's his name the one who fought no no who fought uh Tyson Jak PA Jak Paul yeah something like that I'll get paid a lot but who cares what followers want yeah you have three boxers here M I go with Glock n you win a boxing match with the Glock yeah this is nonsense this I I've done this 40 50 years ago I did kungu I did Karate oh I I I did a little bit of aido you sweat and you like a p and then get a shower and then what a 9 mm Glock does the job you don't have to got upgrade man I don't mind you look guys help yourself H first first round is on the house but then I'm I'm a she I'm not used to serving people you guys going so enough preaching so what's happening you with you guys what's what's up oh busy day we just flew 24 hours and we had a jam-pack day and we were we were all tired downstairs and now we're wide away tired you're all sleeping in the car ah W yeah they're wide awake miss that first fight uh one of our brothers over here uh got held up at the airport cuz he was wearing a unfriendly sweater was the sweater that's not true I don't think it's the sweater was a part of it was a giant part of it he was getting eyes everywhere he's wearing a sweater that says the White House is Israeli owned or what is it Israeli occupied territory you any yeah anything anything that is political motivated it's not welcome here we don't we don't mess around with the politics yeah yeah yeah thank you it's not messing around with it's just what is it you want to do yes send a message you have to be aware of the environment you're sending a message so I wouldn't go to America and say Trump sucks or El musk is the president he's a very political man he loves like being uncensored again as a Muslim what is your intention is it to and I know this is is com like you're not my father don't judge me what I'm a Saudi I'm a she I I have the hell to judge you man what are you going to do Sue meching sne is I want to get content out of him that's what it is content the sh it is our part and responsibility in Islam to give as much da and advice as possible because this is what we do this is how we roll on the day of judgment I'm going to be questioned alone and Allah is going to ask me you sat with these guys why didn't you benefit them why didn't you give them advice yeah we could all laugh and could have jokes and you know have a good time but I'm going to be questioned for every second of my life and I have to have an answer so do I want to be controversial no I could be one of the most controversial people on Earth do I want to be a standup comedian I could do a good job I think I've got the wits for it but I want to be a Muslim meaning I don't want to control people I don't have control over anyone I don't control people's lives and you're going to hell and you go to heaven or you're good or you're bad I don't judge people I like how you pick me for heaven I appreciate that you're big you big the Glock going work too I'm afraid you is it being a Muslim telling the truth always no matter of the cost I like that Muslims do and say according to the result and the consequence of what they do and say meaning if I'm going to do or say something that has bad repercussion and make things far worse Islam tells me stop I give you an example in the Quran Allah says in a crystal clear Ayah do not insult the idols that they worship come on insulting the idols is a good thing because it's false it doesn't have anything to do but why Allah says do not insult the idols they worship so they would not insult Allah unjustly so the consequence is what is far dire and serious though insulting the idols is good but if it's going to cause them insulting Islam and insulting Allah refrain this is what you do if I'm going to say the truth or if I'm going to do something that is good what is the consequence it's going to cause someone to die it's going to cause a whole village to be annihilated no stop keep it to yourself but if it's going to cause something good go ahead I don't know if this makes sense no I understand I understand Sor the don't personalize things because when you personalize things it makes the advice watered down so even if I was about to accept your advice when someone WS it down and makes fun of it Shan is going to make me rejected not accepted watch out again father figure so you got any questions our brother over here is a convert he's been Muslim fully 9 months he's a revert back to Islam is it about to say convert convert is when you convert from a religion to another religion but a RT is you're going back to your nature to original state original state I'm sure he has a lot of questions right not any off the top of my head right now no I'm just listening have any experiences no you had a couple questions you're asking me but I have talk about your experience in Saudi obviously it's the first day you know as an Italian uh what do you what do your thought so far yeah this is my first time in a Muslim country it's been the craziest thing has probably been the NBS everywhere seeing wom everywhere you kidding most of we are complaining that women are not wearing theab as they supposed to really yes and we're seeing that we're being westernized more and more and the women are being liberated from Islam unfortunately it's very sad we weren't like this but unfortunately that's a good thing I mean compared to the yeah they in hijab there yeah that's the modesty is a good thing in in in in s we're still enjoying a fair amount of modesty the the family unit here is incredible praying Tower we having kids running around with a father and a wife we just prayed in um the golden justed there right now so they like where the kids were playing in the beach and all that that's good I have a question or so like I get like why our purpose is here is to worship Allah but like why did Allah like create the whole simulation like why create everything why not is it just like out of his mercy and his love why not why not he can't afford it see he is not a CEO of a company that we can hold to account and do a congress hearing he is not someone who's equivalent to us we cannot imagine the greatness of Allah because unfortunately we're not doing a good job look at you in which state you coming from Boston massachusett Mass okay so Boston massachus Mass and compared to the US where are you I can't see you the US compared to the earth I can't see it and I definitely I can't see you so minut and the Earth compared to the solar system where I need 100 light here to travel from one end to the to the other with millions of solar systems in the Milky Way galaxy with millions of galaxies with so many solar systems and planets and the likes where are you you're nowhere to be found you're negligible and all of this is like a ring tossed in the desert as in the Hadith imagine this huge creation of Allah is like a ring tossed in a desert what's the comparison compared to the throne of Allah and this is one of Allah's creation so when we get to know who Allah is nobody has the guts to question but we know that we were nothing and Allah created us from nothing and he gave us life and gave us the ability to grow up and to eat and drink and mate and enjoy life with all his pleasures and not only that he gave us an ultimatum and he told us if you guys do well I'll give you a paradise where there's things no eyes had seen no ears had heard of and no heart had ever imagined for a gazillion years no whatever years no is for eternity you will enjoy eternity no death no sleeping all enjoyment just if you do well in these 60 or 70 years of your lifespan but if you don't I'm going to throw you in hell and you have no way of objecting or complaining so we are living in this life having a good time having a blast enjoying everything that is halal and at the end of the day when we get the SMS come it's your death time we die we I'm hopeful that I'm going to enjoy life even further and more so it's not that why did Allah create us it's what are we going to do now that we created we have a choice take the red pill or the blue pill NE you make a choice so this is the choice you have to make I don't know if this makes sense or if it's not it doesn't challenge me no yeah I get what you're saying saying like we're already here we're already created like there's no point in really tripping about why it is it's nobody cares you have the full will to just Blast away and say I'm not interested okay do whatever you want do drugs do women do boys it's a free country is that is that it is it is do whatever you want but at the end of the day you're going to pay the price I love to drive my car 230 kilm per hour but if I get the cameras picture I'm going to pay the price either my license is going to be suspended is either I'm going to pay the fine but if not I'm not cadh handed no problem so this is what life is Allah doesn't need us we need him we are so vulnerable and weak and poor our hearts can't beat without his permission but we don't show our gratitude to him once Allah wants it stops the blood in our veins the breath that we take we can't inhale and exhale without him giving us the authority to do so but we don't think about this we're so arrogant we're so thinking highly of ourselves no I can do this I can you know you can one Corona virus does wonders I don't know if this makes sense question so uh we're actually the most popular Muslims in America America right now the most popular youth Muslim youth in America what advice do you have for us you know going back to America after this trip like some general advice that you can give us cuz we do have influence it doesn't matter what influence you have it doesn't matter what people think of you what matters is what Allah thinks of you I like that and so many people say she you did this you said this who cares so no you have to care you have so many followers you have this I don't give a damn excuse my friend seriously I don't care if you come and criticize what I say who cares if you come and compliment me and praise me I don't care what counts is does Allah approve of what I'm doing or not so you ask the same question I asked your your fellow brother a while ago is Allah pleased with you or is Shan please with you this is what counts so you go back to the States and you do a an of your life nobody's going to help you nobody's going to go down in your grave with you you're going to go alone and when the moment you die they're going to strip you butt naked and they're going to wash you and perfume you and have you ever washed someone before I haven't oh it's a sight to see when you just strip them out of the clothes and then there they're a corpse and you have to make them sit and squeeze their stomachs or whatever impurities come from Wow front and the the back and you have to keep on the water running and you have to conceal it not tell anybody I been the guy had orchestras no you have to conceal it and wash thoroughly and then you make wood and then you turn them over to the side and wash their back and then turn them to the other side and wash their back and you try to clean them and then put Cur which makes the skin a little bit tougher and and and stiffer You perfume them and you shroud them you're going to be do this alone and everybody's going to be doing it and weeping up he was a good brother it's too late we pull the plug so whatever you do you're going to find in your grave and this was what a joke I always make to the to the guys guys when I go in my grave alhamdulillah it's all furnished I got two slit units and spotlights and fridge and everything is fine all what I need is just connect the the power what do you have in your grave this is what everyone should ask what do I have in my grave if I have good deeds and no sins you're fine you're doing great you are living the life but if not you have time to rectify it fix it up nobody says ditch everything you're doing go to the Masid stay there 24/7 this is not Islam but at the same time you have to check in balance is what I'm doing pleasing Allah or is it pleasing Shan whatever pleases shitan I cross it out whatever pleases Allah keep up the good work it's very simple awesome some I have a question sure um but what if what do I do if I'm not I'm not like these guys I'm not driven to maybe strive to do a lot of uh work on my own I feel like I'm being lethargic or how do I find the motivation to or the drive to accomplish something that is worthwhile every day every Friday that is we read and in verse I think 28 Allah addresses his messenger and the message is really weird to us what does Allah say to him he said make yourself patient and tolerant with those who remember Allah in the morning and the evening and do not look elsewhere wanting the prompt and the adornment of the dun these guys are poor guys I I'd like to go with 50 Cent and you know uh the guys that have Ferraris and Lamborghinis and old um bling blings and these these are my my type of people that are like to these are my grandchildren so don't overlook around and um don't overlook keep your eye on the ball and do not associate yourself with those whom we've made their hearts neglectful and their Affairs on the loose so Allah is telling his Messenger to Circle himself with righteous practicing people when you go with righteous practicing people hypothetically hypothetically assuming me what would you always get from me reminders words of advice yes we may do something I may play eight ball with you and you know beat the heck out of you we may play sports you know paddle or table tennis and I I give a handicap of 10 points I could do that so it's fun to be with me but at the same time I'm going to do what remind all the time remind you of Allah get you closer to Allah because we want to roll together to Allah and if we don't listen you pull out the Glock n right no I choose someone else it's not sufficient time is short if I give him advice and he doesn't listen the hell with him I go somewhere else because time is limited I can't invest my time on an individual or in a group and it's not paying off I have to keep on trying through even if I have my siblings my my own brothers and sisters and I try my level best to give them da and it's not working what should I do go look for someone else because I want to fill up my grave with another Split unit and few fridges and maybe I don't know so this is what the advice to the prophet was you look for good companions in the Masid in the community this would motivate you when you strive to be with someone higher than you you try your level best to reach their level but but when you ruin always with people that are lower than you they'll drag you to their level and before you know it you like them so I don't know if this answers your question the she and the US just told us uh last Friday your friend is the one that will judge you which way you want to go the rway or the you know the WR with this depends who's stronger if you have an influence of the prophet am who was his best companion Abu Bakr did Abu Bakr drag him down no the prophet dragged him up so yes your friend dictates what kind of a person you are if you are not strong and well-versed and steadfast on Islam but if you AR then alhamdulillah you're a good influence to the community and to the others I got a random question yeah it's random I'm just saying my friend Adam over here he's got engaged and I was asking him about his if he's going to have a second one but he was telling me like like people in his family were like saying it's Haram or like they look like FR upon like I don't know why is it so FR upon like it's not FR upon it's with all due respect stupid is it to ask someone who's not married yet have [Laughter] a he was interested too he was telling me like no by my answer I say you start with one you start with one so before you can think about two you have to think about one true I know how come like women get so like there's always a debate when I'm with around like Muslim women and Muslim men they always have like a crazy debate and the women always get so mad about it so like what's your thoughts on polygamy how is it even logical for Muslim women and men who are non M to engage in such debates this is immodest America this is our definition here of slots what you slots yeah woman who sits with an and talk about issues of the bad both of them are not real Muslims yeah what is this first of all second of all those we have a saying dogs that bark don't bite those who talk about polygamy and I'm just interested honestly I'm gives you an idea how much you got honestly under the belt under the hood what oh no I'm saying in my bank account what how many wives he's trying to say how many wives I have one wife Oh's your voice and it is not it is not indicative of how M you are yeah maybe if you are not a Muslim and you say okay I have my black book or blue book and I have how many girls I know yeah this is really bad om says I hate it when men speak about their private parts and about the stomach all what they care about is their food and their sex life this is not befitting for a man marriage is a sacred bond between two for the sake of having a family having a kids and finding your soulmate down the line if there is a need Islam allows you to marry a second and a third and a fourth but with the right intention not with hey how many wives you got hey Tony got bit sound he was kind of shy to ask the question doesn't look sh s rever too you know don't dodge a bullet like a man just stand and block nine is good for you so basically speaking the issue of marriage is something but the guys in the west are making it really bad this is what I was talking about consequences when you open this topic women become aggressive defensive and they hate Islam they hate men especially with bearded because they think that any person who's committed to Islam is going to take her as a second or a third or fourth wife it's not it's it's not a a hurricane that was over in 5 minutes like most people are it's a it's a commitment it's not only the 5 minutes at the end of the night when you try to listen to it's not it's a commitment it's a financial commitment it's uh having the tolerance of being good to your in-laws your kids and responsibility huge responsibility yeah I have a use your right yes yes did keep I I have a question that um I I've been struggling with this one ever since I read this Hadith which um St I have to admit I I didn't like when I read it and the Hadith is uh the prophet P he said that the people of Yemen are the best of people and I also read Hadith where it says that there's uh no race is better there's no racial Supremacy and then I I read this one and I to this I'm still struggling believe like why are the the people of are the people of Yemen better what what does that what does that mean change your profile picture this my niece even though can I love no problem no h anyhow listen first of all we as Muslims have to have submission certainty no questions asked no strings attached this is Quran I believe it do you fully embrace it yes no questions asked this is a Hadith do you take it uh is it authentic is it that's what I I read yeah then if it's authentic is from Allah how could I be shaky because if you want to be shaky this means that you don't have certainity and when you don't have certainity you're this close to flipping to the dark side but I mean how how are we able to judge how authentic Hadith is or you don't how do you judge whether this neurosurgeon who's going to do a spine cord surgery on you is authentic or not I judge by opinions of other people okay so by whose people the professionals professionals so you go to the scholars that's I'm asking you I'm coming to you I'm not answering yet I'm just setting the foundation for the belief the biggest problem we have with the westerners from America and from Canada and from Europe is that they don't have their Islam on cemented area they're so easy to flip to the other side and that's why you find many of them starting to be good and strong and mashallah and all of a sudden I have doubts why ah the prophet married AA when she was nine uh o you're a cafir if you doubt the prophet thought of for a second you're a full-fledged CER get the heck out of my house don't even think about it no Second Chances watch out I don't know I don't know why you they're laughing guys I don't know any of you with all due respect not because you're not famous because of my ignorance I don't watch social media I don't watch people I don't follow people we are your fans though we always watch you may Allah promote you to Big Air Conditioner any so the issue is I'm I'm not yeah punching below the belt I don't know what you guys views are but I'm telling you Islam is C clear the prophet said I've left you on Islam which is as clear as night and day there's nothing ambiguous in it so if someone has the hesitation and is not certain you know how many counseling sessions I do over the the year thousands I counsel people for money they come to me they pay me $220 per hour I'm cheap so what what what's the problem and they come to me say she I'm not certain that Allah exists you're CF end of call watch out if you doubt something in Islam that is beyond doubt the prophet Alam if you look down at him if you think bad about him if you think something wrong with the Quran if you think Allah is unfair you're a cafir we don't have to beat around the bush but if you have a doubt why did this happen I'll explain it to you this is why I'm here you said I don't know why the prophet married AA when she was nine and he was 50 years of of age doesn't sound good but I accept it do you think bad of the Prophet is he a parfi I would be a CAF think this but I just want justification I I explain it to you I'll remove all doubt in your head I have no problem ah men marrying four and women marrying only one I'm a little bit dodgy about this but I embrace it I can explain everything to you the thing is if you don't have certainty this is one of the seven conditions of ill honesty certainity acceptance uh and the likes if you don't have certainity you're not a Muslim what are the three questions you'll be asking the grave you know no what's your what's who's your lord who's your messenger what is your religion and who's the man who is sent to you the prophet told us two people would be placed in their graves we did a course in Medina the whole book yes the three principal fun fundamentals the first question would be the three questions would be asked to a Believer and two horrible looking Angels would come grab the man Shake him up he's dead huh but he's dead and but alive in the Barak life which is not our if we pull him out of the Grave he's dead he's a corpse but this is another level of Life between this dya and the Hereafter it's called Barak so they Shake him violently and they say to him who's your lord what's your religion who's this man who was sent to you and he would say out of confidence my Lord is Allah My Religion Islam and this man is Muhammad they Shake him again and ask him and he confidently answered Allah says to them my servant has said the truth open a window from Jenna from Paradise where the fragrance and the coolness and the blessings would come to him and let him rest the other person would say huh huh I don't know people said something and I said it and this is the hypocrite who says things but um yeah but I can't say anything bad because everybody's watching so yeah I'm a Muslim but deep down He's a hypocrite this guy easily flips and this is what most scares me about the people in the West that their IM is not stable it's not cemented it's not concrete it can flip any time if you manage to strengthen your religion by not only reading books because you need to walk the talk if you read six volumes on how to swim in the ocean and you throw yourself in a swimming pool what will happen you'll draw them like a rock you have to practice it so what you practice in your life your daily routine your Masid your Salat your Quran your community work this is what will help you answer in the grave if you don't walk the talk you will be saying huh huh I don't know people used to say can I ask you about that Hadith specifically sure thing what was the why are the people of Yemen the best of people the prophet did not say that they are the best in the sense of that they are the most Believers he said that they have the cleanest of hearts and the truth the most truthful and honest of rhetoric they don't lie that's in generality and this is one of the ways of the prophet of being positive he said positive things about all the tribes in Arabia about the people in tamim in he said this about the people of hij he said this about this and that because the prophet was always positive looking at the the positive things of the people not looking at the negatives and to put them down so this is not a blank check Blan for them to do whatever they want they said that simply they have clean Hearts they don't hold a grud and we see this among the people we know from Yemen we know them I'm not talking about the hthis so it's is you can't say that this about people uh uh in genetic I hope this makes sense well could you don't me to keep going on this but could you not argue that that's racial Supremacy so what we do know that there is racial Supremacy we do know that although blacks and whites red and yellow are equal and they only differ with the tawa the piety in the heart but we also know that Allah selected the Arabs due to their language due to their Heritage due to their a Supremacy at the time between the byzantian the Persians the Jews and the Christians of maintaining a level of moral conduct and um a level of social uh justice between them at the time but today we don't judge people by the color if in Saudi Arabia you've see this we may have imams who are black we have non-arabs leading the prayer you have me I'm not originally Arab I'm originally from Indonesia M so nobody says anything nobody dares to say thing with my 9 mm Glock but still we respect it and we feel yeah there our homies we have no problem so at at a certain time the Arabs were chosen people the same way Jews believe that they were chosen yes and this is why Quran is in Arabic it's not in any other language you can have translations in many languages but Quran is Arabic so can you say Arabs were the chosen people no because we have the worst come from the Arab world B give we can few name few but it's not the race you don't have the uh um what is it the notion that I can say bad things about Islam because of this or that we don't have any racism in Islam blacks and whites are equal we have this we can see it everywhere my father-in-law is as black as night my father-in-law he's black and he's the most beloved person to my life Allah have mercy on his soul that doesn't make any difference we don't have this in us we don't think of a race where are What are you Hispanic no I'm uh I'm everything so everything but originally my uh mom is Filipino my dad is black white so we we we we integrate we don't look down at anyone but to have this notion of no black life matters me to movement don't say I'm your [ __ ] sh we don't have this nonsense we don't have this nonsense we're all equal if you're black and you're thinking that oh you use the NW yeah I did not use the N word what's wrong with you oh you're racist you come on get a life we're all the same uh uh uh origin I didn't choose to be white or yellow Indonesians are yellow not in the sense that they're scared but you know and you didn't choose to be black this is what Allah created you be proud of it live to it don't play the vict Ro it's not going to take you anywhere we both children of Adam man [ __ ] yeah everyone says to me what are your origin especially here in in Saudi they have this this racism stuff tribal stuff so what's your origin my they don't know they say I got I got your ask from the beginning you're from everywhere okay so when they say to me where do you come from what what's your origin I said I I play the serious you know role and say my my grandfather is is a a prophet of Allah they said whoa okay W what do you mean said my grandfather is Adam Adam my grandfather's Adam as well so what are you boasting about we come from the same root palas we're Adam so you don't have any leverage whether you're white or black whether if you're American from Arabia or from the Far East you're all the same H you got a problem with that huh yeah was but I like the way you explained about generalities and the prophet not saying things negative about people like they're they're the best they're the best great he's great you know I'm good too but also he's not saying they're the best he's saying a spe specific trait in them is good yep a specific trait their kind Hearts is good in Yemen and truthful and truthfulness a trait is uh that's beneficial not best of all people I think I think the misunderstanding of theth you read that wrong yeah translation is very very problematic and this is why we say learn Arabic in the translation it could flip things all over the place there's a Hadith where the Prophet says seven are martyred other than those those killed in the on the battlefield one of them is in the Arabic means the person who dies with the plague but it also means the one who's killed with a stabbing so imagine if I and I read this in in in a Hadith translation in in Los Angeles the IM of the Masjid was giving a and he translated to be a stabbed person so imagine if I'm listening to theith and I think oh if I die stabbed I'm going to be a martyr and a guy Harlem says to me give me a wallet I'm going to stab you I would like to be a martyr go ahead and I'm killed am I a Marty of course not I'm a not case give him your wallet and save your life but this is the translation that you have to be careful of the Prophet s when he listed the companions he said uh uh the most shy of all Companions isman and the most uh uh strong the truth is Omar and the most uh person who judges among others is Ali and the most person who knows in inheritance is z and he started naming Companions and pointing out to the best in them not meaning that the others are nothing so this is the way of the Prophet tomorrow in we're going to go do inah and then it's the last 10 days of Ramadan so we're going to be meca for a few days in the Medina what advice do you have for us in the last 10 days in meca and Medina and some of them it's their first time doing what advice my advice is you guys are the chosen one though you're not Arabs so you are the chosen one that Allah selected you to bring you to the most purest of all regions of the world meca and Medina utilize your time to cleanse your hearts because Allah does not look at your bodies or your wealth this is Hadith narrated by IM Muslim reported by IM Muslim Allah does not look at your bodies and your wealth rather he looks at your hearts and deeds no one can look at your heart only Allah so utilize this time to cleanse your heart how purify it repent ask Allah for forgiveness go to Allah whole wholeheartedly and asking him for guidance and to remain steadfast on Islam avoid being together not that I want you to disunite rather avoid being together because when you're together you're going to waste your time chitchatting joking cracking jokes talking about things here and there and that's not helpful for you have quality time with with Allah just be there with Allah reflect on your past life reflect on how much time left for you on Earth and utilize the best of it and inshallah it's going to be a transformational period for you guys I'm engaging proposing to a woman first one first one and the sunah is what is it you guys called yeah the prophet said you have to go and look at the one you're proposing to because yeah ideally you don't know the woman of course if you've been going out steady for four or five years you don't want to you exaggerate looking at her again it's going to put me off no no talking about ideally so yes you go and propose and if they accept you after doing the due diligence and check on you you have to have a an interview with the woman for the first time in the presence of her father this is when you get to look at her and take a good look at how she looks communicate with her for half an hour or an hour exchanging views of polygamy don't ever open the topic in such incidents because they're going to kick you out of the house um I have a video on this I'm telling them whoever opens this topic get kick his butt out of the house cuz this guy is bad news anyone who goes to say listen we're getting married I think you're good girl but I'm giving you a heads up I'm going to get married again maybe a third time get the hell out of my house I thought being straight up works though right the what being straight up you got to be like no no no this is being stupid straight up anyhow so the question is is she allowed to come in normal house clothes or she has to buy by it's an issue of dispute I'm inclined to the opinion that says she can come with her hair exposed wearing normal decent clothes zero makeup zero eyeliners so that he would see her as she is of course not wearing tights or Min skirts decent clo so where I can see her face her her hair and and maybe part of her arms this is totally Halal insh I hope this yees they're very strict with it like they have good hearts and they never they always come with the hij you know this is cultural again the majority of Scholars follow this opinion but says you can I get to see I get to give my another yes you can take a group picture apologize if I offended anyone huh 30 more questions that was amazing next F or you have to pay for it so I put it on what what is the DM that you just got"
