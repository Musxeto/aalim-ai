  "transcript": "Ameena from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh I have a question regarding Madi for females. Can we feel if Madi is discharging? If no then how can I know if Madi is discharged or not? I check always after prayer. Sometimes I find something and sometimes I didn't find anything. Then how can I be sure? The default is that normal people don't have prosthetic fluid or pre-cum. And this is usually emitted or discharged when an individual has erotic fantasies or his desire is provoked. So if a person gets such thoughts and he feels that he emitted something and he checks and he finds something that is out of the ordinary and the norm, in this case this is considered to be Madi. But if you don't have any such erotic thoughts or desires, you should not check. Even if you feel something came out, you must not check. Ignore it because this is Satan messing up with your head. And if you do have such erotic thoughts and or fantasies and you emit something and it looks out of the ordinary, you have to wash it or sprinkle water on it and perform wudu. But if not and it's always your normal vaginal discharges or nothing at all, then you must not check and ignore these thoughts and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all by the will of Allah."
