  "transcript": "me um is now officially the messenger of allah now he has the strongest message to deliver and the heaviest burden to spread among mankind now it's time to work seriously and to leave behind all that he was used to allah has instructed him to warn the people and to call them to islam to abandon and avoid their idols to associate none with allah azzawajal who is the only god worthy of being worshipped the prophet salallahu was not hasting as we are the prophet sallallahu alaihi was wise and knew every step he was about to make what the consequences would be because if it were any one of us we would probably go immediately and start fighting people and calling them to islam and tell them that we are right and you are wrong end of story the prophet salallahu was not at all like this he knew that in the city he was living in in makkah there was no power struggle everyone had his own share of power so he knew that if he declared his message that the people of mecca would probably harm him or do something that would annihilate his message from the very beginning so he went into the secret period or the secret phase that the majority of scholars say it took three three years and he started by calling those whom he felt that had the initia the acceptance for islam who can be possible candidates to embrace and revert to islam he started with those who were surrounding him so the first woman to convert to islam of course is the mother the mother of the believers may allah be pleased with her and he also called his best friend abu bakr a sudder who was the first caliph who was his father-in-law and also who was his closest companion abu bakr assad so he is the first man to embrace or to refer to islam and the first child to revert to islam was ali even who was his cousin the son of his uncle who cared for him and took care of him and the first slave or the one who was a slave to accept islam was said even who was the adopted son of the prophet alaihis before adoption was forbidden in islam and from there the prophet salallahu kept on calling people to islam in secret quraish heard something about this but prefer to ignore it because it was not public and it was a new gimmick it's it's a new stunt that someone is doing so it will fade away so they did not pay a lot of attention to it abu bakr from his side may allah be pleased with him was very active and he started mingling with the rich and the poor trying to recruit followers to the muhammad to muhammad sallallahu alaihi sallam the prophet of allah and among those whom he called to islam were a large portion of the first ten that the prophet sallam gave them the tithing the tithing of being in paradise and these ten are the people that the prophet salla died while being pleased with so abu bakr call to islam abdullah so the majority of them were called to islam by abu bakr and they were the most elite of quraish at that time yet they were young but they were gallant brave and rich and they also came from very noble families for example was the cousin of the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam his mother was i'm asking the mother of azerbaijam and it was said that he embraced islam when he was 8 years old 11 years old or 17 years old so he accepted islam at a very early age sad even or known as he also embraced islam when he was at an early age he loved his mother so much and his mother hated islam so much that she said if you claim that your lord tells you to be kind to your parents well it's an oath that i do not eat or drink anything until you reject your faith and come back to the faith of your ancestors your forefathers and worship the idols she starved herself she did not take anything for three days and nights to the extent that they used to open her mouth force her to eat by stuffing her with food and she insisted she was a very determined woman at the end sad came to her and said o mother by allah you know that i am among the very most people who love their mothers among us here in in quraysh the quraish all of quraish know that i love you so much and no one is faithful to his parents more than i am but by allah if you had a thousand soul and each soul departs you and you die so that i would reject times a thousand times so that i would reject my religion i would not do so so eat if you wish and stop eating if you wish once she saw how firm he was she let go and she started eating and left her cause you go to uh abdul rahman bin auf he was the most wealthy person in all quraish he was a merchant and he was known for his trading capabilities uthman even a fan also was one of the richest families in quraysh all of these though they were noble though they were rich but islam did not spread a lot in the rich ones it spread a lot among the poor and the weak and abu bakr gave us the clearest example he himself was a merchant and he was himself was wealthy but he spent all his money buying slaves that have been uh tortured to abandon islam so he bought bilal niraba he bought ammar banyaser he bought this and that he bought so many slaves to the extent that his father used to talk to him to tell him brother a son why not buy strong ones why buy these weak who are being tortured they will not give you any benefit in the future he kept on telling him oh father i'm doing this for the sake of allah i'm not doing this for people to protect me or to defend me one of those who he bought was bilal even abraham who was an abyssinian a slave and omar muhattab whenever he saw bilal and abu bakr he would say abu bakr is our master and he had freed our master pointing at bilat so um considers bilal the slave a master to him say it to to him i think having people like us come to islam will refuse the allegation that islam was the religion of the poor and the weak well actually islam was the religion of the poor in a sense because the majority who converted to islam were actually poor and this brings us to the hadith that was narrated by abu suff and this is way ahead of our time but in the truth time between the hijra year of six and eight there was a truce between the muslims and the pagans through that time abu sufyan went to a sham to make uh to trade as he was american the prophet saw sent the caesar uh a message calling him to islam so the minute caesar saw this message and he was recently victorious over the persian so he was in gratitude to allah was praising allah and he was in jerusalem at that time he called his uh uh courtyard men and told them to go and look for arabs where this message was uh initiated and and came from and told them to bring who was ever there so they went in the soldiers and they saw abu safyan and those who were with him and they brought them in front of the caesar heracleous he was called so he brought abu sufyan and those who were with him and asked him who is the closest in ken who is the next of kin to this man who claims that he was a messenger of allah so abu sufyan stood up came forward and said i am the one you want so he asked him what relation do you have to him he told him i am his cousin and indeed they are cousins because when it comes to all the other uh divisions of quraysh they are considered to be different so he told his companions hercules told his the companions of us i'm going to ask abu sufyan questions and you stand behind him if he says a lie indicate that to me and if he's telling the truth then let it be so abusive and came up forward and hercules started asking him number of questions and this is authentic hadith abu sufyan said that i was so ashamed that people would call me a liar otherwise i would have said everything that he asked me about to be lies what are these questions inshallah this is what we will tell you just after the break if you're 18 or if you're 18. if you've been muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hoodah.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you and welcome back there were a number of questions that the caesar heraklius asked abu sufyan ibn harp who was at the time a pagan he asked him a number of questions just to determine the authenticity of this man calling himself a messenger now caesar was a christian heraclius was a christian and he was a devoted christian he was surrounded by his court men he was surrounded by those who are dignitaries in his kingdom so he started asking abu sufyan specific questions he said what nobody is his lineage among you so he said he is of our best tribes and this is something you cannot deny so he said has anyone came before him claiming the same thing has anybody one came about 10 years 20 50 100 years saying that he's a prophet and a messenger of allah they said he said no he was the first so he asked him has he ever been accused of lying so abusive said no he is well known to us as the truthful and honest and the trustworthy so he asked him again has any of his ancestors was a king and again he said no we had no kings in his ancestors so the question which brings us to your question was who follows him the rich or the poor and the answer was the poor follow him most so islam is the religion that attracts the poor and we will get through that but remind me if i forget and then he went on to say what about the followers do they increase in number by day by day or decrease so abu sufyan said they increase he cannot lie because there are people behind him will correct him if he tells any line so he asked him again does any of his followers reject his religion after believing in it do we have anybody refusing islam and abusive and said no no they don't and then came his chance i was fed so when hercules said and asked him okay does he keep his promises and his treaties or does he break them so abuse a friend thought to himself this is the only way i can get muhammad he said well usually not but we are in the time of a treaty between him and us so we don't know what he's going to do in the future he could not even lie but he tried to you know do something that may influence the opinion of uh caesar and uh he's he asked them afterwards uh have you ever fought together did was there any war between you so i would say yes and sometimes we win sometimes uh we lose so the final question was what does he order you to do so absolutely thought of it and said well he ordered us to pray to worship only one god and to abandon our idols he tells us to be good to our next of kin to feed the hungry and to be kind to our parents so heraclius took a moment of thought and then said i'll tell you why i ask you these questions i ask you what is the nobility of his lineage and he told you told me he was among the very elite and this is the case with all prophets and messengers of allah they always come from the best lineage the best families among their people and i ask you has anybody preceded him in his claim and he told me no and because if there were to be someone before him maybe he was trying to imitate him but he there was there were no one so this means also again that he was telling the truth and i've asked you about a king in his forefather and you said no because if they were a king then maybe i would say that this is a man trying to claim the kingdom of his ancestors i asked you about lying and he said he never lies and the man that does not lie would definitely not lie on allah if he does not lie to others then definitely he would not lie on the lord of the universe and i asked you about his followers and he told me the poor follow him most and this is the same case with all messengers of allah they are to be followed by the oppressed and the poor and this is logical because usually when a message come to those who are rich or in power they usually would look down at whoever came with the message and envy him and say now allah almighty chose him over us we were not going to accept that from him and that is exactly why abu jahl who was the head of the pagans and the fierce enemy of islam once he was talking to one of his friends and he told him why don't you accept his message as long as you know he's telling the truth muhammad is telling the truth he said well since old age we were trying to compete with venue ab manaf because we come from banu abdul and this is from it's a different division of the sons of kosai they are our cousins and since so long we're trying to compete with them they feed the pilgrims we feed the pilgrims they fight in wars we fight in wards they help the poor we help the poor and now when they come and say that there is a prophet and messenger from our descendants how can we compete with them there's no way that we accept this so it's arrogance that prevented them from believing the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and that is why the poor always accept the message and that is why as muslims this is a crystal clear a a point to those who perform dawah and make tawa the easiest people to call to islam and the fastest to accept islam are those who are imprisoned if you go to a prison and you call the prisoner to islam they will accept it immediately because they have all the time to think and they realize that whatever islam is preaching is something revealed from allah azza so they accept it on the spot and uh heraclius also asked if they are increasing in number or decreasing and i ask you muslims nowadays are they increasing or decreasing christ they are increasing drastically and never ever we have faced the problem of people rejecting their religion now there was this afghani man called abraham who became a christian and the cnn the fox news and all the media was focusing on him saying that this muslim refused islam and became a christian so what's the big deal he's won in 1.6 billion rejecting islam and so what we don't want him we don't need him we have enough but why don't you focus on the christians reverting to islam by the hundreds per day look around you people alhamdulillah are converting are reverting are coming back to islam in their hundreds and thousands and this is the biggest proof that islam is is the religion of allah why are people expect accepting islam why don't we have people except in islam and after a year or two say well i don't think i need this i'm going to reject it. no one is threatening them they live in the states they live in europe they live in russia they accept islam if they want to reject it they have all the freedom to do so yet they do not do so because they believe that this is the religion of allah they feel it they sense it they can find its positive traces on their life and on the lives of those whom they mix up with and that is why muslims are increasing and never decreasing and the same thing applies for his question does anybody abandon his relationship no never and about the other uh uh stuff what does he order you with anyone that is not muslim if he is objective if he is realistic if he is fair look into islam and i guarantee you i don't want to say i'll bet you because betting is forbidden in islam but i guarantee you if you are sane if you are realistic and if you are objective that you will accept islam immediately because whatever islam teaches it's only few words of everything that is good so anything that is under the word virtue islam orders you to do and anything that befalls under the word of vice islam prevents you and deter you from doing it this is islam and the only reason why people do not accept it is their ignorance their arrogance and their temptation that prevents them from reaching such a stage this is what uh hercules told abu sufyan and he also told abu sufyan by allah if this man was as you describe him he will rule the area in the land that i'm standing on at the moment and i wish i was there with him so that i can wash his feet and he was all this close to accept islam hercules he was this close to except islam but the problem was with his kingdom and his power that prevented him from accepting islam i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time"
