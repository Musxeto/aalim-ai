  "title": "Whoever does not pray at all will enter hell for eternity vs. who has a mustard seed of Iman Hadith?",
  "transcript": "Rashad from Tunisia. He says, 'I have a confusion.   And this confusion is, you said that a person who \ndoes not pray will enter hellfire for eternity.   And we have another hadith where Allah tells \nthe angels to take out from hellfire who's   got a mustard seed, the weight of a mustard \nseeds, of iman in his heart. So how can we   reconcile between these two hadiths?' There's \nno problem, akhi. First of all, I didn't say   that whoever does not pray at all will go to \nhellfire. This is what Allah said in the Qur'an.   When the people of paradise, the \npeople of the right, look into hellfire   and address the people of hellfire and say, 'مَا \nسَلَكَكُمْ فِي سَقَرَ' [Surah Al-Muddaththir   74:42].'What made you enter hellfire?' So the \nfirst answer would be, 'قَالُوا لَمْ نَكُ مِنَ   الْمُصَلِّينَ' [Surah Al-Muddaththir 74:43]. 'We \nwere not among the worshippers, those who pray.'   So the first thing that qualified them to be in \nhell, that they did not pray. And the Prophet   said, 'alayhi salatu wa salam, the pledge between \nus and them (the non-muslims) is prayer. And   another narration, 'between a man and shirk, or \nkufr, abandoning prayer.' Whoever abandons prayer   is a kafir or, committed kufr. And this is the \nsaying of the Prophet, 'alayhi as-salatu wa salam.   And another hadith, the Prophet tells us about \nthose who come out of hellfire. When the muslims   intercede for their brethrens. When the \nangels get them out, they recognize them   by the areas of sujood because, fire consumes \neverything in the body except the areas of   sujood where they used to prostrate. Which means \nthat, they used to pray and these are the last   people who come out of hell and are admitted to \nparadise. And they're called Al-Jahannamiyyin.   They are the people of jahannam. They identified \nin paradise by the late people who came out of   hell and they were burnt like coal. So all of this \nproves that a person who does not pray at all,   he has breached islam and he is a kafir.   Those who have the weight of a master \nseed in their hearts of iman used to pray,   but they may have used to pray on and off. That's \nwhy there are signs of prayer on their faces that   they are identified by and they're taken out of \nhellfire because of that. And Allah knows best."
