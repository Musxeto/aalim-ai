  "title": "What to do with leftover food, should we eat it, give to animals, or throw it away? Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "farhan says what to do with the leftover food can we throw it in the dustbin or throw it in a place where animals and birds can eat it again this is one of the the the issues that the muslims have great confusion about i remember when i was little whenever we ate with our parents and we were stuffed we were full and we lift some left some food over maybe some pieces of rice the father or the mother would say eat it or it will run after you on the day of judgment and this scared the heck out of us to just think of the food is to run after us on the day of judgment we were children we were kids so we did not think of what kind of weapons what kind of form the food would take we took their statement for granted which shows you that be careful of whatever you teach your children because it is going to come back to them so if you want to go out and your child asks for your companionship and you say no no no i'm going to take a vaccine or an injection and the boy will grow up feeding going to the doctors if you lie to your child if you talk about tooth fairies and how you put your tooth under the pillow and then the ferry exchanges it for um gold or coins or money or whatever this is shirk but this is what sometimes we bring up our children not being aware of tawheed this is why we always emphasize on the importance of tawheed on the importance of getting people back to the quran and to the sunnah so this confusion is simply looked at through the quran i have a plate i put some food in it i had enough and there is a considerable amount of food what should i do one option number one i force myself to eat it which may cause stomach problems indigestion whatever two i can put it outside for animals and birds to eat from it if it's meat then i don't know if there any canines would eat it in the area or cats or whatever if it's rice okay then it can be eaten by birds but i have to look into whether i am annoying my neighbors because there is a possibility that my neighbors would be harmed by it especially when it pollutes the area and it makes it dirty thirdly i can put it in the fridge and maybe eat it tomorrow and this is rare because most people don't like to eat such food that is left over from yesterday and some food does not even can't be eaten when heated again fourthly i can dispose of it and throw it in the dustpin so what is the best well if there is a possibility that someone else eats it or and a living creature would feed on it without any bad consequences that's a win-win situation if not then throw it but never force yourself to eat something when you're full and this is what yani uh mean me allah have mercy on his soul was asked once i finished eating but there is some food remaining what should i do dispose of it and the man said shouldn't i force myself to eat it and the sheikh said no unless your stomach is a dust bin it's a trash can then yeah you force yourself other than that nowhere in the quran of the sunnah we're told to force ourselves to eat something that we do not want and allah azzawajal knows best"
