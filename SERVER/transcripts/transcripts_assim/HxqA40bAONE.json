  "transcript": "Zahil from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. Speak up Zahil. Sheikh my question is about an imam. I am not certain that he is a mushrik but my friend is that I trust and that I think are knowledgeable say that the imam is mushrik. Can I pray behind this imam or not? Yes you can pray behind him unless you have proof. Your friend's testimony is not sufficient. Labeling someone as mushrik or refusing to pray based on hearsay is not something that is endorsed in Islam."
