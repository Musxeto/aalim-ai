  "transcript": "what can you tell us about barzach what can i tell you about barzah our lives as human beings are divided into two in the into three phases phase number one is this life we live in we are born we grow up to be adults then old folks and then we die phase one is over phase three is when we resurrected from the dead and we're held accountable to what we had done in phase one in this life and after the scales work to determine our good deeds from our bad deeds we are directed either to heaven for eternity or to hell to purify our sins and then go to heaven for eternity and if people were disbelievers they will stay in hell for eternity phase one phase three what about phase two this is in between and this is after we die until we are resurrected which happens in the grave so this is called and in arabic means a divider when allah spoke about the two waters the two seas these two different seas whether it's sweet water and salt or different oceans between them there is a barrier that one does not overflow the other so means a barrier it's a barrier between this life and the hereafter in this phase we wait in our graves and we have a glimpse of what will happen on the day of judgment where allah opens a window if we are among the people of paradise where we get some coolness and fragrance and beauty from jannah some of us get some blessings and favors in their graves from jannah not the full entertainment but a glimpse of it and those who are sinful in the phase of barzah they will be punishing their graves some of them will have torment in their graves for their sins like in the hadith where the prophet told us about the fornicators men and women being in a furnace with wide bottom and very tight top and it burns and the fire burns them and makes them go up to they until they come to the narrow top and then it is put off and they fall down and then again or about those who committed suicide how they keep on stabbing themselves or drinking poison in hell fire in their graves until the day of judgment or about those who do not pray their isha prayer and they sleep without praying their obligative prayers how a man cracks their head open with a big rock and he keeps on repeating this action and so on this all happens in the face of al-barzah may allah protect us all you"
