  "transcript": "anyone who seeks risk from other than the means that Allah had permitted has zero so if you go to a shop this is a supermarket mashallah you have uh dates you have mushrooms you have soft drinks you have fruits and vegetables and groceries very good all Hal but why why are you selling cigarettes he says well if I don't cigarettes customers will not come does he have impossible he says yeah but this is good for business but it is bad for your Iman Allah had made this Haram and you are claiming that risk will not come except through Haram means which means that you have a problem when you find someone working hard in a Halal job but he is skipping Salah why well we have a meeting what what is more important or your meeting um yes but this meeting happens only once every two days oh Mah you pray one day and Skip One Day said yeah you know the CEO the managers the directors so you have a problem with your when someone deals with Haram deals with RBA deals with bribery I know a lot of companies and people in the purchasing procurement or in the sales they say we have to under the table we don't have tables anymore it's direct people don't give under the table they give you this is the contract and this is my invoice and you give me 25% of the invoice first but write 25% more no under the table everything is mashallah Subhan Allah then how can you have to if I don't this do this I will not get jobs I will not get a contract don't get a contract no problem work something else but because you have been used to a standard of living and a certain salary or income you are not willing to jeopardize it you're willing to jeopardize your Dean your on Allah but not willing to jeopardize anything of your risk why do people cheat I taught in English in a foreign School in in a public school as a foreign language for 15 years and they used to call me tank Hunters tank Hunter because I used to I can tell if someone is cheating and I immediately expose him and cancel his examination gave him zero so has to repeat the year I was ruthless when it comes to cheating I would tell them if my father were to be alive and he cheats W I will flank him so so before giving them the papers I would say you will claim that your young sister put something in your pocket check your pockets you'll claim that your brother wrote something on your hand where you will asleep check it before I give you the papers because if I catch something with you I'm going to flank you I'm going to give you zero and you're out and I used to do this regular basis alhamdulillah but people cheat 40% of them in schools cheat why because they don't have trust in Allah they don't have dependence on Allah their Iman is weak and you can say this when you have a Contractor Building a wall the amount of cement the amount of Steel Etc you can tell this when a person is working 9 to5 where his productivity in these 8 hours is actually 45 minutes this is the study about Saudi and the Gulf area in the working hours the actual productivity and working is 40 to 45 minutes the rest is full and in and probably sometimes we would eat which is liver and and and kidneys and very nice but not this is not the time for it so this means that we have a problem when we don't have full trust in Allah we start to lie we start to cheat we start to bend the rules if not break them but if we have full trust in Allah that he is our creator that he is our provider that he is alone the one who gives life and takes life that he is alone the causer of harm and the bringer of benefit that he is alone the one who brings people down and the exalter subhanahu waala that he's the only one that con is the Constructor and the expander if we have full trust that Allah is like this and that everything is in his hands and that nothing happens on Earth without his permission if we have full trust and dependence on Allah Asel then we will not ever see people cheat or get bribed we will never see people rush to rais asking them for because of evil eye because of black magic because of sorcery because of gin possession they trust Allah they depend on Allah they don't go to people to have this on them and this is why we if we claim to have the good AA the sound AA we have to check we we have to cross-examine our tul is it sincerely and truly upon Allah or [Music] not I pray to Allah that he grants me and you the full trust Reliance and dependence upon Allah Asel and to make us among those whom he loved in so I pra to I pray to Allah that he makes us among those whom he loves through our Muhammad"
