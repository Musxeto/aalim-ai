  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing!!! ğŸ˜„ [Sheikh] Mahdi from Oman? [Questioner] Sheikh uhÂ \nif I go to an interview for marriage and if theÂ Â  girl or her father asked me to recite Quran toÂ \nexamine me like to see if I know how to reciteÂ Â  Quran, I'm afraid that like I will commit RiyaÂ \nlike showing off, because if I recite it then itÂ Â  will be for it will be not for the sake of Allah,Â \nbut to show them that I know Quran so what shouldÂ Â  I do in such a scenario? [Sheikh] There is noÂ \nRiya at all akhi, it's this is totally normalÂ Â  to recite the Quran, on the contrary, you shouldÂ \nbe proud of them asking you to recite the QuranÂ Â  because I'm proud of the Quran I memorized. It'sÂ \nlike someone asking me, Sheikh, are you a Muslim?Â Â  and I say I don't want to commit any Riya,Â \nif I say I'm a Muslim I will be showing off,Â Â  so are you a Muslim or not? Please, pleaseÂ \npardon me from, uh not answering. This is stupid,Â Â  with all due respect. Yes I'm a Muslim! Do youÂ \npray five times a day? Oh if I tell you I'm,Â Â  yes I do pray five times a day. Do you know theÂ \nQuran? Of course and I'm proud of knowing it,Â Â  so there is nothing wrong in that don'tÂ \nallow shaytan to mess up with your head."
