  "title": "Will Allah forgive me if I didn't know that backbiting was a sin & did it out of forgetfulness?",
  "transcript": "give a bit of a background before my question. I hope it doesn't exceed more than 40 seconds. I'll try to make it as quick as possible. So what happened was that I did learn about backbiting and slandering, but it was I think a few years ago that I was doing certain actions, but I didn't realize that this was backbiting and slandering. For example, I was laughing about my teacher, but I did not feel a single bit of remorse because I did not realize this was wrong. And it was I think after two years or three years, yeah, two years that I realized this was wrong, that this was backbiting. But unfortunately, I had forgotten about the ruling that this was backbiting. So I must be sinful because I did not realize that this was a sin. You know, if I did, I would have perhaps refrained from it. Thank you for your question. Allah, Azza wa Jal, says in the last ayah of Surah Al-Baqarah, Oh Allah, do not hold us accountable if we were to err, to err, to make a mistake, or if we were to forget. What you've done in the past was a mistake. What you're doing at the moment is an act of forgetfulness because you forgot. In both cases, Allah says in response to our du'a, I shall do so. And this is in Sahih al-Imam Muslim. I shall do so, I will not hold you accountable for whatever mistakes you had done or acts of forgetfulness that you've committed. So embrace it, that Allah is most forgiving, most merciful, most compassionate, the one who guides us to repentance and accepts it from us, and you will be saved with the grace of Allah."
