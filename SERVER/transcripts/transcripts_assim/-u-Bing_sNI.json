  "transcript": "Musaid from India Hello Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh there is a hadith that says seeking knowledge Why are you whispering ya Musaid? Do you have people around you with a gun onto your head? I'm sorry Sheikh I will say so there is an there is a hadith that says Anas Ibn Malik reported the messenger of Allah said seeking knowledge is an obligation upon everyone and it is the source of this hadith is Sunan Ibn Majah 224 and it is graded as sahih according to Sheikh Halal Bani May Allah have mercy on his soul so I have heard that it this hadith refers to the basic principles of Islam but there is no but it is but this hadith is not referring to the basic principles of Islam according to the Quran please tell me how this is referring to the basic principles of Islam according to the Quran and Sunan. Do you know Arabic Musaid? No Sheikh. Do you memorize the Quran? Yes I try to memorize. The whole Quran? No. So with all due respect how do you know whether this is referring to what if you don't have the appropriate tools? Now when we know that there are certain certain things that are minimal requirements for a Muslim to be a Muslim and there are things that way above that however not all the companions knew the things that were above that for example the hadith of the Arabi the nomad tell me about Islam to believe in Allah and the messenger tell me about the prayers to pray five prayers a day anything else no unless you perform voluntary prayers tell me about fasting Ramadan anything else no unless you voluntary fast tell me about zakat tell me about this what did the nomad say by the one who sent you with the truth I will not add or subtract any of what you've just mentioned to me and left what did the prophet say alaihissalaam whoever wants to see someone from ahlul jannah let him look at this man in another narration he has succeeded if he told the truth the prophet didn't tell him wait wait wait there are so many minute things and detailed things of Islam you were not told about you have to learn these this is one of the examples where the the scholars figured out that seeking knowledge is only the bare minimum requirements for you to be a Muslim and Allah knows best"
