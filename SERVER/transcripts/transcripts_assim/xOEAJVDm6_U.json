  "transcript": "Brother Yunus from Holland or what is known as the Netherlands. I have a question. What advice do you have for learning more about Islam? I have a fear of getting the wrong knowledge and the English and translation of the Tafseer and Quran is really hard to understand. Do you have a reference for easier and simple understandable translations? Okay, first of all, this is a journey that you have to take while being careful not to learn from the wrong people. And Alhamdulillah, we have many people that you can trust and the best website to my knowledge on earth that is trusted and trustworthy to learn from authentic knowledge is IslamQA.info. So if you watch or learn from that site, you will be in safe hands, Inshallah. Now, I would also recommend that you watch my YouTube channel and learn from the playlists there that I hope I did my level best to give the most authentic knowledge that I have through the most authentic sources that hopefully you will benefit from in an easy way of teaching. That is not complicated. Once you make the first three or four steps in acquiring such knowledge, then the sky is the limit. You will be able to differentiate between what is beneficial and what is not between those who are on the right path from those who are not with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal."
