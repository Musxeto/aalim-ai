  "title": "How to reconcile every living creature was made from water, but jinn was a smokeless flame, & angels",
  "transcript": "Yusha from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Allah Azza Wa Jal says in the Quran that every living creature is made from water and then Allah Azza Wa Jal says in the Quran that jinn are made from smokeless fire and in Sahih Muslim the Prophet Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam says that angels are made from light. How to reconcile this Sheikh? You can reconcile it by believing in it as it came without going into details because when Allah Azza Wa Jal says that every living creature was created from water this might mean that the origin of everything is water. How this is possible? We don't know. Clay is mixed with water. Light could be ignited from water. Fire, the type of fire that the jinn are created of we don't know what the origin of it is. Is water here meaning the H2O or is it referring to semen? Because this is also referred to in the Sunnah as water as in the Hadith Innamal Ma'u Minal Ma' Water of ghusl is mandated when the water of semen is ejaculated. So as Muslims we don't go into details. Things we've never seen in our lives. We've never seen angels. We've never seen jinn but we believe in them. So why would anyone in his sensible mind go into details and say hmm how were they created? I'd like to see the blueprints. This is not logical at all."
