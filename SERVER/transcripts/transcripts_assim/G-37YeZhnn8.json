  "title": "If 12 people say Bismillah 1000 times, this grants deceased place in Jannah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abu Rayyan from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikum My question is, here in my country they have a practice for the deceased. They say that if 12 persons get together and each say 1,000 times Bismillah, that deceased person will be guaranteed Jannatul Firdaus. And I was wondering what's the ruling on this? What about if they say it 99 times, not 100 times? I don't know. He will fall short, he will go to the doorsteps but not enter? This is all baseless. Whenever someone comes up with such a stunt, such a gimmick, such a thing, and he says if you do this, this will happen. The first thing we say is, show us your proof and evidence. Where is it found in the Qur'an? Or where is it found in the authentic sunnah of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wasalam? If he fails to provide us with the evidence, we take whatever he said and throw it in the dustbin. It has no value at all. Even if he says, well scholars so and so said, and Mawlana so and so said. All baseless. Our religion is only taken from the Qur'an and from the authentic sunnah. Not from the awliya, not from Tom, Dick and Harry, not from the 12 imams or so and whatever they call their ulama. No. It is taken purely from the Qur'an and from the sunnah. Because this is what Allah Azza wa Jal ordered us to follow."
