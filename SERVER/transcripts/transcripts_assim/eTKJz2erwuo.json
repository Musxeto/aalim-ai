  "title": "Is Sex Education permissible in Islam (taught at schools) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "finally abdullah says what does islam say about sex education is this permissible how they teach about such topics to children in schools the answer is islam is a religion of bashfulness islam is a religion of modesty and the way sex education is being taught in kafir countries in countries that do not believe in islam is definitely something wrong and out of the question the way they address children at an early age about sex about sexual organs about sexual intercourse about contraceptives and how to avoid stds sexually transmitted diseases it's etc etc all of these things are not education they are an explosion of lusts and desires and the urge to learn more to go to upper grades in school seeking to take their subjects which are more advanced so that they would look at the book the books and see maybe illustrations and something they don't know about this encourages children to investigate to experiment to play doctors and nurses as we know and see this causes them to surf the internet which is now available for everyone with the covet pandemic and children being confined to their homes being home schooled and they're having these tablets and laptops which gives them hours without end of exposure to things that would encourage them to try to experiment maybe to rape or sexually being assaulted or to assault others this is totally prohibited in islam and goes against the spirit of islam yes islam teaches us to teach children from an early age the importance of being modest the importance of not exposing your aura your private parts your body the importance of knowing you're a boy and she's a girl by telling no you should not wear an earring or a necklace like your sister this is for girls and to address the girls by saying no you should not do this because this is only for boys so they're proud of their gender and they know and acknowledge we teach them not to come to houses or to bedrooms at restricted times so that they would not be exposed to adults or to grown-ups aura such as after fajr prayer at the siesta time the the kailua time at the zord prayer and after isha uh prayer so before fajr during the lower time and after risha these are the times where people tend to relax in their bedroom so children are not allowed to enter without knocking and seeking permission and we teach them this at a very early age we separate them in bed when they go to sleep as the prophet said al-islam because this is the age of investigating but we don't go to the extent of giving them sculptures of private parts and how to use condoms and how to do this and do that which is crazy for adults let alone for children no this is totally prohibited and allah azza knows best"
