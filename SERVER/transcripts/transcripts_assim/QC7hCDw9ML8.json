  "transcript": "[Music] aldam [Music] AB [Music] for it was reported in M IM Ahmed and narrated by may Allah be pleased with him that a man came to the prophet Sall alai wasam and he said oh prophet of Allah preach me advise me but be brief so the prophet said to him when you stand to pray pray pray like a man bidding farewell do not say anything for which you will have to apologize for and give hope give up hope give up hope for what other people have this Hadith is a manifestation of what the prophet saidat upon himself he said I've been sent with concise speech which means that few words that the prophets sayat that the prophet says that we need books to explain due to the profound benefits and pearls and fruit in it s also in this Hadith it shows us how eager the salaf our righteous predecessors were they were laser focused on what benefits them and what gets them closer to Allah this is what counted to them they were not interested in real estate in money in women in worldly issues they were interested in what leads them closer to Allah this is why he came asking for advice and he did not want a lecture he did not want to be entertained as many people do he wanted something that is brief so that he would not forget it that he would benefit from and this is why the of the Prophet was very short it wasn't long because the benefit would be lost if you lecture for an hour or two or three beautiful beautiful lecture what did you benefit I can't even remember what it was about so the prophet sallallah alai wasam gave these three advices three statements if we manage to implement them in our lives I believe we should be winners the first one he said when you stand to pray pray like a man bidding farewell imagine if this is your last Salah how would that Salat be Salat in our religion has a very important status and upon Salat there are numerous rulings the prophet told usat am and gave us the fatwa whoever abandons Salat is a cafir and he also told us as mentioned in the Quran those who are lazy those who delay it have signs of hypocrisy in them when your Salat is valid and accepted all of your Deeds are accepted but when your Salat is invalid or rejected likewise would be all of your Deeds the prophet said the first of his deeds for which a person will be brought to account on the day of Resurrection will be his prayer if it is sound he will have succeeded and if it is lacking he will be a loser may Allah protect us from being losers Salat is very important in Islam each and every one of us when we pray we should Thrive to make it we should strive to make it the best Salat as if it is the final and last Salat our hearts should be emptied except from the love of Allah we have to perfect it according to the way that the prophet prayed fulfilling its obligations fulfilling its sunnas and voluntary acts we have to have Tranquility in our Salat and to contemplate that when I'm standing in Salat I am speaking to Allah Allah the almighty with all that I mention from Vick from Dua supplication and from the Quran wasn't it Allah who said in the hadithi when you sayd Allah replies to you and says Allah says that whenever you say in alhamdulillah Allah says my servant has praised me my servant has complimented me my servant has glorified me who Among Us will we pray and read the fa contemplates upon these beautiful words and meanings we have to show our submissiveness in Salat when we do when we are in frustration so when we have these magnificent meanings in Salat only then our Salat will drive us where it will drive us to enforce virtue and righteousness and to forbid evil and vice as mentioned in the Quran but how would any one of us offer the prayer of someone B [Music] farewell in another Hadith the prophet explains and the best of explanations are those of the prophet he says remember death When you pray remember death When you pray we are in a hospital we pray to Allah that all those who come seeking cure and healing will be cured and that Allah will restore their health and wealth and make him stronger and better than before but death is inevitable if anyone would have escaped death our Prophet would have lived but this is a human nature and a Divine decree Every Soul shall taste death so the prophet says remember death When you pray for if a man remembers death when he prays he will strive to make his prayer good he says pray the prayer of a man who does not think that he will ever pray another prayer W if the angel of death is standing next to you when you pray will you perfect your prayer will you think of your prayer definitely but also you will think about the debts you owe people which you did not pay you will think about the rights of your spouse which you've consumed in Haram you will think about how bad you were to your neighbors to your parents to your next ofkin you will think about how a bad employee you wear to your company or to your firm that you're working for and your consuming the Haram salary without any justification if you were to think that you will be dying soon any one of us in a survey when do you think you will die 90 100 even if you go to those who are 100 years of age when do you think you will die well I heard of prophet n he lived 950 years so inshallah you never know no one thinks that his death is so close to him and this is why the quality of our life is miserable the quality of our is miserable we want quantity not quality we in Islam are ordered to remember positively death because death can be posit positive and can be negative if death leads you to be depressed and despair of Allah's Mercy if death makes you sit home not work not be active not wanting to do good things in life this is negative and it will lead you to hell in Islam we're ordered to think of or about death in a positive way it is the driver that makes us excel in what we do and to get closer to Allah and to get closer to our Targets in the Dunya death remembrance does not mean you become poor begging people for charity it drives you to be the best in your field whether you're a medical doctor or an engineer or an entrepreneur or a businessman because you want to achieve as much as possible to benefit the community yourself which would inevitably benefit you on the day of judgment those who think positively of death will not ever take or give bribes will never be late for Salat will never cheat or lie or deceive others but when we look at our own prayer today no one doubts or debates that our prayer has no Baraka the vast majority of us don't pray in s in the Masjid they pray home even practicing Muslims have seen neglect prayers in the Masjid it's not their priority it's something at the bottom of the list and when they pray you don't see there's no submissiveness in Salat the prophet said the first thing to be uplifted from this is you will enter a Masjid and rarely see someone who is in the state of of submissiveness to Allah the vast majority of us would when we pray we may physically look as if we are in the state of but the majority of us don't they either play with their garments they scratch themselves some of them even take W I've seen this take the mobile phone and text messaging in the or looking who calling to know whether to answer it or not in the Salat the vast majority of us their hearts and minds are thinking about their business their wealth their spouses their children their work what they will do the groceries they have to buy from the market they look right and left and you see this in Salat people while praying they look they look at people walking in front of them what kind of Salat is this is is anyone of them offering the prayer of someone bidding for well for farewell I doubt this and even those who do not move in Salat their hearts are somewhere else not in the Masid and this is what the companions used to seek refuge in Allah from the submissiveness of hypocrisy is when you see someone not moving but his heart is everywhere so on the surface he looks good but his heart is with the Excel sheet how much I gained how much I have to spend and may Allah be pleased with may may Allah be pleased with him who said by Allah if our hearts were purified and clean we would never had enough of the book of Allah and I say wah if our hearts were purified and clean we would never have lack of in our [Music] prayers ald the prophet says in in his second advice do not say anything for which you will have to apologize for and this is awkward is the prophet telling us not to apologize of course not because when you do a mistake it's part of adab and good moral conduct to apologize this this is not what the prophet telling us not to do the prophet is telling us initially not to do something that would require us afterwards as a consequence to apologize and this leads us to think before we Act and the vast majority of us fail to do this miserably we act we speak without thinking and then we are stuck between a rock and a hard place how can I Rectify it how can I apologize how can I fix what was already broken this tongue this organ that Allah has blessed us with has dire and severe consequences to it no Gathering of Muslims today is free from GBA backbiting slandering gossiping chitchatting mocking and ridiculing others the companions used to say there is nothing on Earth in need of long incarceration incarceration nothing is in need of being imprisoned more than the tongue how many many marriages have been destroyed by this tongue by the in-laws by the gossips how many feuds among the best of friends and relatives have been ignited by the Tongue how many words have we spoken that made us fall in hell for 70 years because of a word we did not pay attention to the prophet sallallah alaihi alam's words were limited and few they were numbered but he was given the concise of speech so a Muslim should not open his mouth until he weighs the gravity of what's going to come out of it finally the prophet saidat wasam and give up hope from what other people have a real Muslim is a Muslim who acknowledges Allah by his beautiful names and attributes the vast majority of us don't know Allah's beautiful names and attributes there are 99 Names of Allah 100 minus one whoever calculates them knows the meaning of them Implement them in his life will enter Jenna if you make a survey among those attending today and gave them a paper to write what they know of Allah's names you will be surprised if you find any of them writing more than 30 30 names 1/3 and those who write the 30 names if you ask them about the meaning would fail and could not give you except the meaning of one or two names if this is our status with Allah's names how can we devote our entire life and submit our will to Allah Asel our hearts are not connected to Allah we must not ask other than Allah we must not look at what others have in their possession and who whoever is successful in limiting his gaze and connecting his heart only to Allah then this is the happiest man on Earth he's sufficed by Allah so Allah will make him Rich physically and mentally but who's ever connected to the people dependent on what they have have always eager for them to throw him a bone why is it whenever we pass by a billboard saying that if you do this there is a draw and you may get a car you may get a house you may get property you may get you may win a million ring it why is it that we're always looking and hoping that we are one of those because we don't trust Allah Allah has given us so much we're never showing our gratitude to him but we're always looking at what my rich friend has or my influential friends possess or what my politician friend or relative can do for me and this is what why the more you are like this with the people the more insults humility you will get from them because this is what you get when you connect to yourself to the people the prophet said whoever guarantees for me that he will not ask others for anything I will guarantee him Jenna very easy the prophet says don't ask people for favors don't ask people for this or that and he guarantees you J but this is very difficult unfortunately so fear Allah oh Servants of Allah only few days maybe hours and we shall meet our makerel and those who have perfected their Salat who have in Salat who offer their Salat on time and in the places that Allah has commanded us to pray then they will come to meet a Lord that is pleased with them them and he will reward them with rewards that no heart had ever thought of no eye had ever seen no ear had ever heard of whoever is sufficed by Allah Allah will make him rich and whoever looks for sufficiency with what the people have Allah will make him poor so oh Allah make us Rich by you and make us rich with your Halal provision and grant us to be sufficient only by worshiping you and making Dua for you oh Allah as you've prevented our faces from frustrating to anyone other than you oh Allah protect and preserve our faces from asking anyone other than you oh Allah grant us the in the Sal grant us the frequency of remembering death and grant us the ability to to protect our tongues and our limbs from Haram oh Allah purify our hearts from hypocrisy purify our actions from showing off purify our tongues from lying and pu purify our eyes from deceit for"
