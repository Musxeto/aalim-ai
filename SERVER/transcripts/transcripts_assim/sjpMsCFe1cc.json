  "transcript": "nevermind over him at hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa I believe he also D he nabina muhammad in wine early he was like 'i'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Islam promotes science and knowledge unlike other religions for example centuries ago there was a great clash that its ripple effect its consequences are present until today and this clash was between the church and scientists we know how they used to forbid Sciences whether it's biology whether it is geology whether it's astrology or astronomy we know what they did to Galileo who talked about the rotation of Earth what they said about Newton who spoke about gravity we know what they said about scientists who spoke about the universe about the solar system about the galaxies and how they used to hunt them down literally and kill them and with the progress of science there there is a scientists reach a conclusion that Christianity does not coincide with science it goes on the opposite direction and that is why they disbelieved in that religion and that is why they called for the separation of church and state because it could not coincide it could not live together in Islam it is completely different story his lamp promotes knowledge Islam promotes science and you will not find in the Koran or in the Cigna something that goes against science and if you do then the problem is in science not in the Quran not in the Sooner because these are only theories yet the Quran is the ultimate truth and the ultimate fact Islam promotes knowledge and that is why the first word to be revealed to the Prophet Elias alarm was a para which can be translated into read or recite Allah says read in the name of your lord who has created all that exists has created man from a clot read and your Lord is the most generous Subhanahu WA Ta'ala who has taught the writing by the pen has taught man that which he knew not look at us nowadays we claim to know everything don't we wherever you open a subject if you are four or five people sitting together open any subject and you will find people who are shallow speaking with full confidence politics yes there are they been spring there a B in summer there a B in winter masha'Allah all seasons talk about cars everybody knows about cars economics yes we know why the credit crunch took place it is all because of the Jews Subhan Allah you ask them about medicine and you will get people telling you if you say yes will I have this pain here you'll find 10 among us masha'Allah surgeons and physicians and yeah you have to get some herb you have to do this and that and drink it before you go to sleep masha'Allah it's okay we claim to know everything yet we are the most ignorant people on earth so many times in corporates and in companies usually they look at what they have achieved throughout the past year so usually when people make presentations and they say in the first quarter I managed to do this and that and I succeeded in securing so many deals and preventing the company from incurring losses because I did and I did and this by itself is an indication of ignorance not only that it is one of the types of do you believe that when you say this you are committing a kind or a type of even a blast may Allah be pleased with him said that when a person says al hamdulillah had it not been for the duck of my neighbor or for the dog of my neighbor who made a sound when the burglar was trying to break into my house had it not been for the duck the burglar would have stolen my house even a message whoever says this he had committed an act of because he attributed the blessing in the favor of Allah soil to a duck or to a dog and likewise when you talk about a presentation you do not attribute it to your knowledge your ability I managed to do this I succeeded in doing that I protected my country from these and those losses you always say it's a grace of allah azzawajal who did this and I managed with the blessing of Allah I managed with the favor of Allah always attribute everything because you do not know anything and the most of us who masha'Allah are like big fat balloons full of hot air yes I have a PhD I have a master's degree I have this and that I know I yeah you do not know anything Allah tells you in the Quran so that you would remember always it is not you it is His grace as though Allah says subhana wa ta'ala and Allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mother while you know nothing is it a fact when you came out of your mother's womb did you know anything not a single thing and it is Allah Azza WA JAL who gave you the hearing the sight and the hearts that you might give thanks to Allah Azza WA JAL so the knowledge that you possess it is not yours it is not from your own doing it is from Allah Azza WA JAL who has given it to you did you thank Allah for that or did you miss use it in means that he does not approve of Islam values people with knowledge but values scientists Allah so Allah says Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those of you who have been granted knowledge Allah will exalt them not because of their wealth but because of the knowledge he bestowed upon them and never you will find in the Quran that Allah or there is a prophet alayhi salatu salam to ask for more wealth for more wives for a better health for a better position in life never the only command from Allah Azza WA JAL to His Prophet in the whole of the Quran to ask the increase of is in huh al-bakr Robby Z Denis real men and this is what you should pray and ask Allah in your prostration Sydney Elmen and you say my lord increase me in knowledge allah azzawajal values those who have knowledge say are those who know equal to those who do not know no they can't be equal you cannot have someone who knows his Deen who knows czaja you cannot have him equal to someone who is ignorant someone who is not possessing such knowledge knowledge and allah azza wajal joined those who know with him in the quran just to show you their level where Allah says Allah bears witness and the angels and those have acknowledged that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah so these two the angels and those who are granted knowledge Alonso JAL joined them with his always with him soprano attire in such testimony now what one may ask ok what kind of knowledge are you referring to is it science science that we know physics chemistry medicine geology or is it something special well scholars say that knowledge science in Islam is divided into two types Islamic knowledge and convention and knowledge so what is meant by Islamic knowledge it is the knowledge that is based on the Quran and the Sunnah such as the knowledge of the Quran a person who recites the Quran is considered to be half of the power of the Quran masha'Allah the knowledge of the interpretation of the Quran you may have someone who's half of who knows the Quran but if you ask what's the meaning of this word what's the meaning of this ayah what was it revealed in I don't know so didn't he he has a deficiency in his knowledge because reciting the Quran without knowing the meaning is good but definitely is not close at all to someone who knows the meaning knowing the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and you ask people yeah it's of Han Allah open any subject about halal Haram with your friends and see how many fat was you get you get tens of fat words yes is halal no no no this is how about everybody yeah you have evidence I know I heard someone but if you have a hadith no if you tell someone a hadith nowadays then I remember one in Saudi a brother who's about 55 years of age I was talking to him and he was apparently a liberal any new Muslim in the sense that he Saudi but he doesn't believe in the Quran Sunnah so much he believes that what America and Europe say is correct this is a liberal Muslim a new trend so I was talking to him and I was passionately trying to convince him with diplomacy and tolerance and he said yeah he allah azza wajal says in the quran he's telling me Allah as the widget is saying the Quran in a man a man who bring me yet and I was doing this I said excuse me see this I might've been yet very that deeds are by intention and I said hey I think I'm yeah I'm trying to be polite I think this is a hadith that was in the Bihar a Muslim is narrated by Omaha Public alarms what I always thought it was an iron and then the guy stopped speaking and how he knew that he fell into a very big hole that he thought for himself ignorance is harmful so you have to know the Quran this is the not the knowledge that that Allah all praises in the Quran you have to know the Finland you have to know Fick halal and Haram how to pray how to fast how to make hatch you have to know also what is known as a soul fundamentals of which is the science that governs the the things or the rules and regulations that governs the film itself and this is something that is high and you cannot give fatwa if you cannot master this science and you have the NASA human suffering you have the knowing that the language which is Arabic without Arabic you cannot be even a good student of knowledge you have to master these things these are the sciences that is are known to be Islamic Sciences and the second type of knowledge or science is the conventional such as well even this conventional is divided into two sections the first section is the halal section such as medicine engineering geology biology pharmacology anything mechanics whatever anything that deals with the demian and it has nothing to do with the Quran and Sunnah but if you have a good intention allah azzawajal will reward you for it why because this is a communal obligation imagine that everyone in our city is a half of is a scholar is a diary but we don't have any medical doctors will be sin will we be sinful yes all of us will be sinful because it is part of the community that a portion of them must be doctors engineers pilots businessmen people working in the economy etc but if all of them became scholars and that is and they neglected what makes no farmers where will we eat in it's a higher Buhari share the book on farming bismillah r-rahman and I'll read the whole thing and crops will not grow I have to work so this is a communal obligation some of us have to do it and with the grace of Allah the origin you see it now a lot of the days they're not actual scholars in Islam they are either engineers medical doctors businessmen professionals scientists and they acquired the Quran and the Sunnah because there is no contradiction nothing stops you from doing this so this is the first type of the conventional Sciences which is halal if you have a good intention masha'Allah you reward it in the dunya need a friend because it pays well as well the second type of conventional Sciences is the Haram Sciences such as can you give me examples of Haram Sciences a very good astrology one says ok bye when were you born what's your mother's name yeah what does my mother name has to do with it trust me ok and the stars ok tomorrow this wouldn't this will happen to you anything tells you 100 lies one of them is is correct so Shaitaan comes to you and when the thing that he told you will happen happens this guy knows done see and a lot of the people go into astrology they go into zodiacs and signs and they tell you what is your zodiac the guy says I'm a bull and the other one says I'm a goat I'm they have different cat you know zodiacs Arab scorpion yes all of these bad things what are you and they tell you that yeah ok I can't go tomorrow to work why it says that something bad is going to happen if you believe in this ok renew your Islam you have committed an act that nullified your Islam whoever believes a fortune-teller he's a kaffir whether this fortune teller has a crystal ball and she's an old lady of 9 of 95 years of age and she tells you that this one this was going to happen to you or the fortune-teller reads your palm in Arabia we have people holding your and seeing mashallah you should change your soap it's not good for you but but this and this will happen some of them in Syria and Egypt in parts of Arabia they need this Turkish coffee after they finish it they turn the cup upside down and the coffee remaining makes tracks and then they look and say oh subhanAllah tomorrow is gonna have you you have a good thing happening to you and also there's something bad I can see a friend of yours doing something bad everybody tomorrow insha'Allah see what's going to happen you will be had you have something good and you'll have something bad and one of your friends will do something but every day this is happening this is not fortune-telling this is taking you for a stupid person whoever believes this is a sh a Catholic the Prophet tells us but if I do it for the fun every time I open magazines and newspapers they have these you know zodiacs and signs I just need it for fun yeah if you read it for fun Allah will not accept 40 days of your prayer that's all you don't Muslim hamdulillah so one says ok then I will not pray what if I was not going to accept 40 days of prayer why should I pray ok don't pray then you become a kaffir again so no you have to pray for 40 days though Allah is not going to reward you for it just to stay and remain a Muslim so this is science and Sciences it's been taught in universities yet it is haram science what else hmm philosophy some of the philosophies Haram but not all of it so it cannot be yet it depends but the majority of philosophy it makes you doubt Allah because this is how they start first of all doubt Allah is Allah existing let's think yeah asking this question is covered by itself no what else theory of evolution studying biology and thinking that your grand grand grand father is an ape when people when I go on a tribe to Europe and say this yes this is a true any Syria well life your grandfather is eight mine is a human it's up to you and this is your any much much easier to prove logically that it is a false theory Janna masha'Allah we've evolved from apes okay the poor apes now why didn't they evolve when will they evolve again how did it reach the missing link and Halasz who stopped it changed his mind on Apes chimpanzees remain as you are why we're the lucky ones so this is part sorcery you know sorcery magic black magic this is a science also it is science but it is forbidden for you to learn and what what about Jeff if I watch Harry Potter is okay no it's not okay come on it's very nice it's Haram it's teaching you how long things giving life to the dead okay making someone a hamster and returning it into a living being flying doing this doing that controlling knowing the future knowing the unseen all of this is covered so it is not permissible what else science is now in you have universities they teach you anywhere in universities music it's art teaching you theater or or acting this is science but is it halal or Haram it is Hama so anything that leads to Haram is considered to be also Haram therefore when you want to identify what science is what knowledge is how do I know what is knowledge one says to know the Quran and to know the sooner that is it so if I know the Quran by heart in a fine of the Sunnah all of it and I know the fit am I considered to be at the sight of Allah a knowledgeable person yes or no I know the Quran from cover to cover and I know the Sunnah and I know the fact you asked me any fact well I'll give it to you everything according to the Quran Sunnah am I considered to be a person of knowledge at the side of Allah no you cannot be knowledgeable you cannot be a scientist you cannot be a scholar at the side of Allah by only knowing these Sciences you have to have the fear of Allah as elgyn that is why Allah says in the Quran in Nima Yasha llaha mini body he'll rue de ma that verily is only those who have knowledge among his slaves that feel a lot what does that mean this means that if a person who cannot read and write who does not have any degree who does not have a car who does not have an owner house whose clothes are not as fashionable as ours who has nothing of this life a person if you look at him you will learn until I'm not like him yet he prays five times in the Masjid he never does anything in Haram not in eating not in looking not in listening his income is 100% pure he connects to the next of kin he does everything he does because he feels a large division this is considered to be ish I had him in neshama having a body I remember on now turn the table if someone has PhD in Quran and he has a PhD in hadith and he has to be A's in son and fifth and in Arabic and so on and masha'Allah his world is decorated with certificates yet he's arrogant he looks down at people he cares less if he listens to music or watch his movies or he curses he prays a prayer mother even Asia mashallah he prays in the machine father is too early now suppose in 3:30 booth I'm crazy and the hope he's in at the office he may pray him in an ass or he's asleep or every day he goes to home he tells his wife when the end is called served the lunch because the Prophet said Isis ran that if the lunch is there eat even if the prayer is one so alhamdulillah or if he comes before us or prayer he tells her okay give me some garlic and some onions and colossal hamdulillah I have an excuse is this considered to be an island no therefore it is that the the rule of thumb it is the criteria that we classify someone to be a scholar in the sense of scholar of knowing allah azza wajal is when he fears allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala and that is why in most ethical hacking the prophets a who looked once at the heavens and said this is the time when knowledge will be uplifted it will be taken from the hearts of people Rowbotham know some it may allah be pleased with him when he reported this hadith he said I know what is the first branch of knowledge that would be uplifted so his companion said what is it he said it is Allah sure it is the submissiveness and concentration in Salah Nevada at his time at the time of the Prophet as have said it is soon you will enter a message it and you will not see one single person with oh sure do we have this in our message I pray as an imam in Judah and when I finish prayer what does an imam do he faces the congregation so first row second row they prayed with me they finished the third and behind that they are completing their prayer wallahi i make this B and I look at their faces and I see people looking at me yeah he's praying instead of looking at his frustration Spotty's so I do this and the guy's looks and he feels ashamed on well why on the left on the far left hand side and and right you see people doing and looking at me yeah what's wrong with me and I look at them and it and then this they're playing hide and seek they are playing with and what kind of kosher is this I prayed next to a brother Salih here in his mid-50s and while he was praying the phone rang in his pocket well I he did this and next to him he did this and he's going down and up okay I thought he's gonna send an SMS but I did maybe he was embarrassed or it was disabled I don't know what kind of sure do we have this is actual knowledge it is not how many books you've read it's not how many times you finish the Quran it what-who sure is what knowledge is the actual knowledge it is what helps you in your life the actual manifestation of all what you've read and learned is when you reach a fork of the road should i do Haram or not what do you do this is your actual knowledge and that is why I get a lot of emails from broad brothers from the Gulf and from abroad Jay I'm a chartered accountant and I just discovered that RIBA is Haram and everything in my work is Haram what should I do resign full stop the following day the kalahari have resigned and pray for me that I look for a good job this is knowledge because this fear of allah azzawajal this full trust in allah and dependence and reliance tells you that this man and on the other hand go to the other Muslims share then I will starve then I will die then I will beg so what you do I have a raise they're promoting me so shall Allah will forgive me where is your knowledge where is your attending the classes when where is your listening to all different courses so the best kind of knowledge is the Islamic knowledge providing that you have the good intention and the fear of Allah otherwise it is like any other knowledge and the Prophet tells us adding salat wa salam that there is nothing equivalent to studying the sciences of sharia the sciences of the deep in the authentic hadith the Prophet tells us whoever follows a path to seek knowledge Allah will makes it easy for him a path to paradise what kind of knowledge Islamic knowledge how do we know listen to the remaining of the hadith the angels beat their wings in approval of the seeker of knowledge and those who are in the heavens and on the earth pray for forgiveness for the scholar even the fish in the water subhanAllah you are asleep in your home and you have teachers of Allah seeking Allah's forgiveness for you while you are asleep the superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like the superiority of the moon over all other heavenly bodies the scholars are the heirs of the prophets for the prophets did not leave behind dinars or Durham's rather they left behind knowledge so whoever gains knowledge has gained great good fortune so this hadith my itself should help you determine how to proceed in your life even if you're 60 even if you're 70 even general property the compiler of the tafseer one of the greatest scholars of Islam on his dying bed some of those visiting him they said the Prophet said I like his thought or said I'm so-and-so on his dying bed he instructed the slave to bring him a pen in the paper and then he told the man repeat the hadith again he's writing it down his companion said subhanAllah you don't die you're dying in bed and you are writing this hadith and he said yes a proper Muslim does not leave seeking knowledge even when he is dying and some of the scholar said with the inkpot till the grave yard yeah I keep on writing until I reach the graveyard and they bury me this is the knowledge the the majority of Muslims nowadays talk without knowledge and Allah Azza WA JAL told them that follow not that which you have no knowledge well at up of who marry celica be hearing something you don't know but refrain do not speak why because verily the hearing and the sight and the heart of each of those you will be questioned on the day of judgement by allah azza wajal and by highlighting the importance of knowledge in Islam without acting upon this knowledge it turns against you so if you know but you do not do what you know of this would be something that you will be punished for Allah Allah says limit Apollo animal at the fountain why do you say what what you do not act upon and in the scary hadith of Osama bin zaid pretty hair if I may Allah be pleased with them both the Prophet said that Islam on the day of judgement while people are in hell a man's guts will be split spilled and he will turn round it grinding it and people will come and say so and so in dunya online life or orang earth you used to come and order us to do good things and used to forbid us from doing bad things you were a good person he said yes I used to tell you to do good things but I would not do it and I would tell you stay away from bad things and I would do it and among the first three well then this is a good question for quizzes who are the first three to be thrown into hell who are the first three to be thrown into hell a scholar a martyr and someone who pays met his money or spend his money in the course of Allah these are the first three to be thrown into hell the first one the scholar or the one who teaches the Quran Allah Azza WA JAL shows him his favours and blessing and he tells him what did you do in the things that I have given you and he said o Allah I've learned the Quran and I've taught it for your sake Allah says you are lying you learnt the Quran and taught it so that people would say that you are a scholar and they had said that throw him in hell so it is extremely scary to know that if you acquire the knowledge and you did not do and act upon it that you will be upon this one would say ok this is dangerous in this case I will not learn how I'll remain ignorant I remember one of the brothers he was listening to music that was about almost 80 years ago when I was still young and active and you know Haram Haram breaking hedging now it's not bringing heads I have people doing that hunting that no I was just kidding so I went to the brother and I told him if he what you're doing is Haram because the prophet sallallaahu line as I was saying that he said this he puts his fingers in his ears I said Marshall why are you doing this so that you cannot listen to the music turn it off said huh I said you're doing this so that you would not listen to the music's no no I don't want to listen to the hadith so why this is because if I listen to it Allah will ask me about it on the day of judgement so by not listening to it Allah would not ask me how stupid can a person be as long as you know Hamas Allah will question you and if you ignore and give you back to knowledge so that Allah would not question you Allah will question you because you have no excuse in the land of Islam someone comes and asked me Sheikh what is the ruling on having intercourse during the day of Ramadan while fasting this is Haram I did this I said okay you have to give the expiration fast two consecutive months and don't break your fast for 60 days depending on the month say check what like I didn't know that this is a severe punishment for this otherwise I would have not done it said well you have no excuse because you are in the land of Muslims he said I knew it it was Haram but I would didn't know that it was 60 days I thought maybe in 3 days maximum said no as long as you know it's Haram you have to pay the expiration even if you did not know what the expression is but if someone in Norway calls me and says sure I embraced Islam two years ago and I didn't listen that I was doing it through last Ramadan and this Ramadan until someone told me that it is not yet it's not permissible I didn't know I thought that it was only food and drinking that we fast so what do I say to him go you have nothing to do alway do I repeat the days that I broke by having intercourse that no do I give explanation should know because you did not know but someone in the land of Islam who knows and who has the ability to learn but turns his back so that he would not know allah azzawajal would hold him accountable this beautiful hadith shows you the of knowledge if you go back to your home and you teach your wife you teach your children you teach your neighbor something that you've learnt you will be rewarded even while sleeping on your bed the Prophet says Alan salat-u-salam whoever calls people to write guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him without it detecting from detracting from their reward in the slightest so imagine how great rewards you can get now a lot of the time people say share we have problems we have sciences we have theories that may go against Islam so what follows what which is superior Islamic Sciences or conventional sciences who governs the other this is a dilemma and that is why a lot of the people are drifting away their schooling their degrees their studies are all done in a non Islamic institutions whether universities or research centers and they are not based on Islam they're based on theories so you get people coming and saying yeah actually this the issue of eclipses for example we know exactly by the minute and by the second when the eclipse is going to take place so why do people fear the Eclipse and when they pray they have to make themselves cry everything has been calculated and we know from here till 50 years from now when the Eclipse is going to take place this makes people feel a lot less why because they know that this is the Eclipse is taking place not knowing that allah azza wajal has calculated every little thing until the day of judgement and us knowing when the eclipse is going to happen does not change the fact at all that this is a sign from Allah and this sign is supposed to throw fear from Allah in our hearts do you feel afraid when the Eclipse takes place do you people say yes the majority say it's nice when the Sun eclipses people by special lenses wow it looks very nice yes you should the minute it happens you should come to the Masjid and pray and try to make yourself cry because no force on earth no force in the universe can make the sun's light go out except Alonso vision so this should throw fear in your heart is science superior to Islamic knowledge no so for example what is the ruling on a person who commits who fornicates or commits an act of adultery can we bring one witness to testify is it enough it has to be four witnesses what about if we have marshal are these cameras from all angles and it's on tape seriously we cannot get it on the Internet no if we have this what is the ruling can we go to the judge and say so-and-so committed adultery with so-and-so and this is the tape is this possible no one would say this is science - no this is an Islamic issue if I divorce my wife how long would it be for her to wait before she becomes free and can marry someone else three three periods a lot of the brothers say three months this is wrong there it there the waiting period of a woman after being divorced the first or the second time is three menses menses cycles three menstruations not three months three months is with those who have exceeded their age and their 60 or 70 they don't have their period or for those who did not they're so young they did not get their period yet as mentioned in the Quran so someone says okay my wife is 30 years of age forty years of age and instead of waiting three cycles we'll give her a birth test pregnancy test and if she is not pregnant class second day she can get married isn't it only just to make sure that the womb is clear or not no this is not the case so a lot of the times people come and say ah hey I had an affair with a woman and after having the affair we immediately got married and she gave birth to a child that I know that she conceived before our marriage but it is my child what do I say that to this man the child is not yours it was born out of wedlock he said I did the DNA and the DNA came positive it is my child what do I say islamically it is not your child even the DNA stated that it is therefore Islamic Sciences Islamic sharia islamic law overrules any other kind of statements Sciences theories in the modern science of today why because this is the religion of allah azzawajal and this is what the Prophet said at his salat wa salam therefore i do ask you all to reevaluate it is not never late some people think or have this notion that a fee to study Islam is backdated now on the contrary well I I know people from America from Europe masha'allah la quwwata illa billah they did there be in engineering and there did their MBA or the master's degrees in medicine or in whatever and now they are in Islamic University pursuing their studies and you know a lot of guys medical doctors who finished their Islamic studies and now they have both a hamdulillah so it is never too late the knowledge that draws you closer to Allah providing you have good intention is the Islamic knowledge put a schedule for yourself start to learn gradually because if you take everything at once this would make you bored and you leave it is like brothers I've seen going to the gym doing bodybuilding they go in the beginning mashallah with full enthusiasm taking protein and then cry teen and things you know pills like this big one of the boxes I saw the Box in the pharmacy this big mashallah and the pill isn't what is this area deposited over now what are you doing you should know this your protein try teen and they take it they come for two three months they look at the merits this is nothing well they they let go it needs a long time knowledge needs patience there isn't any you know fast food sandwiches you can get a bit like a chef please give me something you know awful fundamentals of that to go so that I can any consume it and there isn't anything like this you have to sit on your knees with you recite books stay late at night record what you have seen research ask analyze why did this go back to the share why did you say this share so-and-so said so-and-so try to get on and off with the share until you grasp this information until you learn it and you digest it takes a long time six years five years depending on the person but you have to put a schedule for you to reach that and you have to know that the Islamic Sciences are much superior and they overrule all other sciences Allahu Alem when is Patil me era he Aslam Oh sallallahu sallim wa barik an AB D or Julia nabina muhammad"
