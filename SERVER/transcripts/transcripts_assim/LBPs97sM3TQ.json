  "title": "Imam gives a lecture in local language before the Friday khutbah, is it permissible? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so where i live before the actual photo of friday every time there is a small lecture in the local language is this permissible here this is an issue of dispute whether it falls under the prohibition where the prophet al-islam prohibited circles before friday and this is not a circle it is the imam himself giving a summary or a reminder or a dars before the friday khutbah simply because usually in your country and i've noticed this they have the khutuba in arabic which not a single soul understand i remember i was in delhi one year and i went to a very famous masjid and the imam came who was like in his maybe 90s or 80s with his turban with his red beard and with his cane and he delivered a hotwa was short concise it was in arabic being an arab a native i could not understand a single word and looking at the faces of the indians around me they could definitely not understand a single word so the only one who understood what was being said hopefully was the imam and this defies the purpose of the khutba so a lot of the countries like in pakistan india bangladesh etc they give a sermon for like 40 minutes 50 minutes and then when the imam is over he comes to the pulpit again and he says he sits and the muthan gives the adhan then he stands and gives two khutbas two speeches or orations this is what is part of the jummah what was before that was a voluntary thing is it permissible or not it's an issue of dispute inshallah it is valid when they don't speak the the language and they need to explain to the people so that they would benefit from it however i personally and strongly feel that in such countries the khutba has to be in their native language if you go to malaysia giving the khutba in arabic would not serve the purpose of the khutbah which is to enlighten people and to educate them you have to speak in malay you have to speak in the native language of the people if you go to the uk don't give it in arabic because the vast majority don't understand give it in english everybody understands it in english and include in your khutbah a verse from the quran in arabic one hadith in arabic and the pillars have been fulfilled and the goal has been achieved and allah knows best you"
