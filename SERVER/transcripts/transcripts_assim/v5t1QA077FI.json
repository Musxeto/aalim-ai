  "transcript": "foreign we are still discussing the long list of atkar we say before going to bed and this shows you how islam puts a lot of emphasis on worshipping only allah the almighty this is who you worship this is who you depend upon so hadith number 111 if you take to your bed or if you go to your bed then perform ablution lie on your right side and then supplicate this is an instruction to one of his companions to do the following perform mudo go to your bed and lie on your right hand side what to say the prophet said alaihis i submit my soul unto you and i entrust my affair unto you and i turn my face towards you and i totally rely on you in hope and in fear of you verily there is no refuge nor safe haven from you except with you i believe in your book which you have revealed and in your prophet whom you have sent the prophet said allah if you die you will die upon the fitrah meaning that this is your pass to paradise with the grace of allah if you die upon them and not only that the prophet stated as i'm another hadith that make sure that these are the last words you utter before you sleep so you may say this dua and then you say to your wife listen tomorrow we have to go and bring so-and-so and you go back to sleep repeat the dua again because if it's the last thing you say this would with the grace of allah ensure that you will be having this past that would allow you to enter jannah with the grace of allah because you have died upon tawheed hadith 112 mother aisha says that the prophet susam used to say at night if he turned during sleep except allah the one al-kahar lord of the heavens and the earth and all between them the exalted in might and the for giving what a beautiful dua that the prophet used to say the one who subdued all of his creation and all of the creations are subservient to him as the wajal and nothing can move without his will when did the prophet hassan say these words when he used to turn while asleep so this is not part of the dua of going to bed but what you should say when you are turning over side to while asleep one would say we're asleep we don't know and we're not aware of what we're saying well yes and no lots of people when they turn they get few seconds of awareness and if you're lucky and successful and guided by by allah you would be able to remember him and say this beautiful dua foreign then hadith number one hundred and thirteen the prophet allah used to supplicate allah and says in the perfect words of allah we've mentioned what are the perfect words of allah and that is his quran and the commands and whatever allah azza says i seek or i take refuge in the perfect words of allah from his anger and punishment anger does allah become angry the answer is yes but allah's anger is not like ours our anger is a deficiency while allah's anger is a sign of perfection from the one who owns and possesses everything in this universe so we seek refuge in allah azza from his anger and punishment and from the evil of his servants and from the madness and appearance of the devils what madness this refers to seizures it refers to insanity that can be caused by the possession of devils may allah protect us all so the prophet is seeking refuge in allah azzawajal and in his perfect words from all of these things and allah's anger is his hellfire allah's anger can be portrayed in his punishment in this life when we receive calamities or some tribulations that are apparently due and caused by our own shortcomings and our own sins all of this indicates that we have to frequently and continuously ask allah for forgiveness and seek his repentance this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you if you're salam alaikum warahmatullahi foreign"
