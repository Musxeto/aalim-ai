  "title": "Marriage contract that allows wife to divorce her husband. Can wife divorce herself? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says in Bangladesh during marriage we have to sign a registration form where in one point it's written that a wife can divorce her husband and as husband signs this form it's clear that he had given this right to the wife but from Hadith it's clear that divorce is only in husband's hands so in this manner can a wife divorce her husband as husband gave her the right first of all such a condition is according to the majority of Scholars and invalid condition because one cannot give what he does not possess before a marriage contract is conducted we cannot stipulate such condition because he cannot give you what he does not possess he cannot divorce you before you're married so the scholars say if he signs such a registration form and he accepts it the marriage is valid but the condition is invalid the moment he gets married she has no right to divorce herself this is different to stipulation or not stipulating this is different to giving her the right to divorce herself after the marriage so if a person marries a woman and now they're married and he says to her your choice is in your hand if you want to Divorce Yourself Divorce Yourself the majority of Scholars say that while they are together now at this moment if she says okay I divorced myself she's divorced one divorce and if they don't take any action and they depart or he has intercourse with her then there is no option or condition continuing unlike if he says I give you the right to divorce yourself for from here to a month or to a year or indefinitely this is authorizing her to divorce herself he can any Moment In Time says I take back my authorization so she cannot divorce herself and she can divorce herself if he doesn't take it back so this is different before the marriage contract any stipulation of such a condition is invalid in Allah Knows Best"
