  "transcript": "from algiers called and says why do we recite loudly in fajr prayer while we recite silently in the assault and in the last raqqa of maghrib and the two last raqqas of al-asia why is that and this is a good question to answer it we have to realize that our religion is based on submitting our wills to allah so for example the last two or three verses of surat al-baqarah chapter 2 the last three verses allah tells us in the beginning that whatever goes through your mind allah will hold you accountable for it the companions came to the prophet and said o prophet of allah we were instructed to do jihad to fight in the cause of allah and face the possibility of being killed or injured we were ordered to fast pray and to give zakat and all of this we comply we have no problems but to be accountable for what goes in our minds this is beyond our ability so the prophet said to them do you want to do and say what the jews had said that we listen we hear and we disobey say we hear we listen and we comply and obey so they immediately said that they didn't hesitate so allah azza abrogated this by saying that allah azza does not burden his soul beyond what it can bear so what goes in your mind allah azza forgives it what do we learn from this we learn that islam is based on compliance with the quran the sunnah it is based on submission your will to allah azzawajal which means that the prophet salallahu says pray as you have seen me pray and we look at how he prayed we find that he used to recite every single fajr the quran in the prayer loudly and in the first two raka's of maghrib and the first two raka's of isha he used to recite loudly and in the four raka's of lahore the four raka's of asura the last raka of maghrib and the last two raka's of isha he used to recite silently now we look in his teachings never ever he explained that to us we look into the companions may allah be pleased with them and never ever we will find any of the companions asking why therefore we understand that this is how religion is and we have to take it as a package deal we don't have the right to say why is it loud and not silent or why is fajr two raka's and maghrib three raka's why not all of them are four or two or one or why do we have in every unit one bowing and two prostrations why not having two two or one one this is how it was given and relayed to us and we have to comply to it and allah knows you"
