  "title": "Can we go to a Mixed Gym (men and women)? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shakeel says can we go to a gym where there are both men and women well Shaquille if you analyze your question you'll understand that women being there is not permissible are they masha'Allah wearing the abaya full face veil and working out of course not they're wearing a sports bra and maybe leggings or indecent clothes and they are posing in inappropriate pauses because this is the nature of working out in a gym with men around them this is not permissible at all the men themselves are not appropriately dressed and when you put the two together it's like magnet it's inevitable there is attraction between the genders and this is what Islam prohibits Islam calls for segregation between the sexes even than the most sacred places on earth even the Masjid listen to what the Prophet said that is a lotta Sun he says the best rows of men are the front and the worst rows of men are the last and the best rows of women are the last and the worst rows of women are the first so the worst from men is the last and the worst for women are the front because they're close together and the best of men rose and the women rose are the first and the last because they are distant from one another in a gym where music is blasting and women working out in the best of physical form and so are the men what is expected sure this is modern times we don't look we don't have any feelings if you don't have any feelings you've got problems with your hormones my friend too much estrogen in your bloodstream you're not a real man so definitely this defies all teachings of Islam sure I lower my gaze come on do you expect me to believe that let's hypothetically assume that you lower your gaze and there's no temptation on your side can you guarantee that someone else will not be tempted by you that no woman would look at you and admire you Shaitaan is there so definitely this is totally out of the question may Allah guide us all"
