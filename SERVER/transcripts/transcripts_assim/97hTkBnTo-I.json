  "title": "Prophet's ﷺ‎ Miracle of the Splitting of the Moon - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "we're going to talk about one of the signs of the hour that took place at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam chapter 54 verse number 1 allah azza wa jal this chapter is our surah is called the surah of the moon alkmaar allah says in the quran air-quote era but is Sara when chakra Tama Allah says the hour has drawn nearer and the moon has been cleft asunder the moon has been cleft asunder it has been split into two parts now in the sahi of lemon muslim narrated by animal Malik may allah be pleased with him and also in the Sunan narrated by Abdullah Moses wrote that the pagans of Makkah demanded a miracle they wanted a sign to prove that the prophet al Islam is the Messenger of Allah in the hadith of Muslim allah azza wajal made the moon to split into two parts and the Prophet was talking to the pagans and to the Muslims as well testified look and testify bear witness on what is happening in some narrations the kuffar they were the pagans they were the one who demanded that the Prophet Azam who split the moon and it was full moon at that night and when Allah gave that miracle the idol worshippers the pagans said that well this is sorcery this is magic he did something to make us think that we're seeing the moon to be split and he is a sorcerer so this is not new for him and we as Muslims believe that this had taken place at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam now I know that there are the non-muslims would say this is not acceptable how can the moon be split into two even some of the so-called quote unquote Muslims may also object to that and saying that this is not possible and this shows you the amount of ignorance isn't allah azza wajal the one who created the heavens and the earth we live on this planet called Earth and in this solar system and we have millions of similar solar systems in the Milky Way the galaxy and there are millions of other galaxies do you think it would be difficult for a large result to split the moon into two halves as a miracle now one would argue and say yes but this is not scientific this is so and this is soap doctors are losing a jar on his website and I asked him once this personally and I told him is there any scientific evidence to prove this he told me that he and it's on his website that while he was giving a lecture in Cardiff in the UK and a person asked him about the spreading of the moon and he said is this scientific and the doctor said that the solut said no this is not scientific because science cannot prove it this is a miracle had it not been for the Quran and for the authentic Cygnus I am a Muslim no one can doubt this we would not have believed it but because the Quran and the authentic Sunnah proves it prove it we believe it and embrace it as Muslims and we don't need any science to prove that for us he told in his website that a man stood by the name of if I recall correctly David Moses pitcock that would he's a Muslim or even Muslim and at the time I think it was the head of the Islamic party in the Parliament or somewhere I don't know and he wanted to comment and he said that years ago when he was a Christian a student gave him a copy of the Holy Quran and the first page he opened was chapter 54 that spoke about the moon being clift asunder and he immediately closed the book and said that this is not logical I'm not going to continue to read this until years later he saw an interview on the BBC or some other channel in the UK and he saw the interviewer speaking with three scientists from NASA and he was bombarding them with criticism how do you dare spares spend so much money with all this poverty hunger famine all over the world spend so much money on exploring things that have no value to you and they were talking to him and they said that we've spent a hundred billion dollars just to set a man to a foot set a man's foot on the moon and the interviewer was outraged and then they told him about the things that they've discovered that no way they would have believed that and what they had discovered was that after studying the geology of the Moon they've discovered that it was actually there was a crack from top to bottom going right through the center of the Moon which meant that it was split and they could tell by the surface of that crack that went through the core and that was from all over from the top to the bottom of the Moon and when they studied the only justification scientific justification was that it was split into two parts and then it was sealed back again so david petcock when he heard this he went back to the Quran he studied and he embraced Islam because he said that fourteen centuries ago no way the Prophet Alakazam would have known something like that to be the first ayah in a chapter of the Quran that the moon was split that the moon was cleft asunder so this is something from the contemporary can refer to dr. rule in the jar he always appears on who the TV and other Islamic channels he is known to explore the science science in the Quran in the sternum and not only that I know that disbelievers would weak knowledge about Islam with zero knowledge of the power of Elijah which I would keep on reticule in this or thinking that this is not logical one of the scholars of Islam though he was an a shoddy yet he had a lot of things that were positive in his work and he was known to be one of the smart and intellectual Muslim scholars his name was Abu Bakr Ibaka lining and he was requested by the Caliph at the time it was approximately in the fourth century to go to Constantinople and to meet the Byzantine Caesar there because he requested some information and to be sent an ambassador so that they can communicate and it was almost a time of truce at the time so Abu Bakr being a scholar of Islam went in and there are a lot of things that took place that were so funny but so informative and it shows you the dignity and honor of the scholars of Islam at that time nowadays unfortunately not all of them have this because some of them had sold the religion some of them had humiliated themselves through asking people for money and for a pity cash but real scholars and hamdullah they exist today there are lots of them but I'm talking about the unfortunate status of scholars nowadays when the government's the Islamic government's are not supporting them are not giving them enough to sustain an honorable life instead they have to work and maybe they have to humilate themselves anyhow abu bakr was a judge at about Kalani so when he went to visit the Byzantium Caesar they told him that you have to take your shoes off and you have to wear a special kind of slippers and you have to take a turbans and we're very light clothes on your head because these are the customs and he said no I'm a scholar you accept me as I am and I will come you don't I'll go back to my country and did this sort of pride the the king or the Caesar allowed him to come the custom was that everyone who comes he used to he must have bow in front of the king but they knew that he was a Muslim in Muslims never bow in Islam it's it's associating others with Allah to bow so that is why even in karate Muslims don't bow it is forbidden completely to bow to prostrate so the king said that make a trick so so that he must bow without ordering him to do so so they made a very small door with a low ceiling so that if he wanted to enter he would have to do this and enter bowing and then raise his head up and the and the king would take this as bowing the judge had not Kalani when he came in so this he figured it out and he went in backwards so he gave his back and went in kneeling to the opposite side so he gave his back and rear end to the Byzantium Caesar and he went in this fashion and the King immediately knew knew that this one was a tough he was a tough cookie to play around with then he asked him about so many things but what I wanted to ask he was or mentioned he was he asked him about the splitting of the moon and he said in your book it is stated that the moon was split how is that he said yes this is in the Quran in the Silla is it how did it happen when no one on earth reported it except you Arabs and the Muslims he said because people were not watching we're not anticipating he said there but this is not acceptable to us so the judge at Babylon he said tell me about the table the repast that descended to Jesus and His apostles we have it we are we haven't mentioned in our Quran but did everyone see it and the king said yes said the Jews did not see it and they falsified the Hindus the fire worshippers all denomination all over the world none of them reported it so can you say that it this is also a lie and the Caesar was wordless he didn't know what to say and there are so many things of that beautiful journey of this judge Muslim judge to that Caesar that shows you the intellect for example they gave a party a dinner party and they invited him and this was only you know in less than a week time because they dismissed him and sent him with lots of gifts back to his home country because they told him if you keep this man here he is going to affect all the Christians and they're gonna reject their faith he has so much proof and logic that we cannot argue with him one of the things that he did is the Caesar brought his patriarch I think it's called is the head of the Orthodox Church and he told him listen this is a Muslim judge he's smart he's witty be careful try to be in your religion so that he would make a mistake and then we would hold one against him so the guy said okay and they gathered all the priests old amongst all the scholars in Christianity and he made a big feast and when the judge came everybody was there in silence he entered and the Caesar was introducing him to the patriarch and he said that this is the head of the Christian Church and the judge went and smiled and said how are you how's the wife house the children house the family and everybody was in a very pale and straight face and he said what's wrong with you and the Caesar said I thought that you were a man of knowledge don't you know that the patriarchs and and and the priests don't get married and don't have wives and don't have children he said subhanAllah you claim that Allah Azza WA JAL had a wife and he had a son and this beautiful thing you're depriving your priests and monks to have what kind of religion is this and they were baffled and they were shocked because this is simple logic they asked him a question and this is beside the topic I'm going to go back to the topic in a minute but his his biography is astonishing they asked him wanting to in a sense poke our religion and make fun of it so they said tell me about the wife of your prophet who was accused of adultery and immediately on the spot Abu Bakr Bertolini knew that he was referring to Aisha whom the hypocrites slandered her and allah azzawajal revealed a whole surah surah noor clarifying that she is innocent and pure now if he's going to tell him about that this was the hypocrite singing and this was that or like the she I do when they slandered mother Aisha because they were like Shias and those who slander mother Aisha they are like the Christians the kafir to us so instead of explaining and making a long story short he answered in two sentences or few words he said this is something that the wife of the Prophet Allison was accused of and there were no evidences and she was cleared by Allah and also Allah as usual told us about another woman who was accused of the same thing but she came with a baby he was referring to Mary the mother of Jesus and everyone was again speechless Asher was accused now if we don't believe in the Quran if we don't believe in this Rinda a woman was accused there are no evidences no witnesses she's cleared she did not fornicate she did not commit adultery also with Mary peace be upon her and peace be upon her son Jesus Christ if we did not believe in the Quran nor in the Sunna and the Jews accused her of committing fornication the evidence is that she's carrying a son and he does not have a father but because we're Muslims because we believe in the Quran and we believe in the honesty and purity of Mary the mother of Jesus Christ peace be upon him and we believe in his miraculous birth we do not say this but those who do not believe we're speechless they didn't have anything to comment because this is history and this is what you also agree and approve of anyhow the splitting of the moon is a fact there's no doubt in it none whatsoever to us Muslims non-muslims go ahead and research do your geological studies it does not matter to us because we believe in the Quran listen we believe in the unseen however some scholars do not consider the spreading of the moon to be a sign of the hour why is that they said because there was nothing in the Quran northern the Sunnah that says that the splitting of the moon is a sign of the hour all what there is is that alonso said the hour has drawn and the moon has been split has been a Clift asunder so there isn't anything that states that it is a sign of the day of judgment and this is true however I mentioned it because cher Omar Suleiman Oscar may Allah protect him and preserve him who wrote a number of beautiful books I think they are translated by Jerusalem and this book is known as the science of the minor day of judgment which is the science of the hour and there are the signs of the day of judgment which is a different topic altogether and what will happen in this universe and this is a different topic share dr. suleiman omar suleiman oscar mentioned this in his book however four years before he published his book dr. Yusuf reliable wrote a thesis for his master's in Islam in the University of Dammam hominis wrote about the same topic and he did not mention it because as I've stated it there is no relation between it and the Sun and the signs of the hour it is a miracle and there is no doubt about it but it is not considered to be part or one of the signs of the hour"
