  "transcript": "what is the best way to make wudu and not waste too much water less lessen the opening of the tap or have water in a bottle and make wudu from it how about russell the shower is running more than the tap do we have do we just do the russell quicker to not waste water this is something for you to improvise you have to come up with new ideas for example i don't have a shower i have a water um what i don't know what it's called uh it's a special nozzle that has a lever in it that opens the water and closes it so i use this when i take a shower which means that when i'm applying water i put it on and if i'm not using it the water stops this is used usually in toilets this this nozzle that a hand shower they call it this reduces your consumption of water drastically when it comes to tap water it's difficult to bring a water bottle and put it next to you and perform water will do with it this may consume time this may cause people to think negatively about you but if you control the amount of water coming down you would be more than perfect in performing would insha allah the only thing is that it will take a little bit more time when we turn it on full power we seem to make wudu quickly but when it's almost dripping and you make wudu with it it will take maybe double the time but you will definitely follow the sun and save a lot of water"
