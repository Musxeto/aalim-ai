  "transcript": "foreign [Music] dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamu alaikum and welcome to this new episode of our program the basics and today insha allah we will talk a little bit about one of the most basic things in islam the most basic thing in islam is to hate and to heed in in linguistically means to make allah azzawajal as one and to worship allah in his lordship worship and in his beautiful names and attributes and we will come to discuss this so linguistically to hate is to make something as one everything has a key and the key for paradise is the heat without it no doors would be opened for you a person who does not have to heed will not enter paradise it's prohibited upon those who do not have to hate and this is the basics of islam now let me rephrase that this is the basics of all religions of allah since the time of adam peace be upon him peace be upon him called his people to worship only allah azzawajal abraham ishmael ismail isaac ishaq and all other prophets and messengers all of them called to tell haiti and any blind man can see this clearly in the quran any lay man can read this clearly in the sunnah of the prophet salallahu however this concept of tawheed which is the basics has been neglected by a lot of the muslims and not only that a lot of the muslims have great beef with it so the moment you utter the word to heed they all of a sudden come like a cat in an offensive position with its hump on its back and they just want to attack as if they have the rabies why people even due to their ignorance reject the word to hate i remember seeing in a clip a video clip of one of the quote unquote prominent da is who was ridiculing this concept after a lecture he delivered in one of the gulf countries a woman approached him with a book and from the way he's talking you can understand that this book is kitabu tawhid written by the imam muhammad abdul wahab so he said i look into this book and i said what is this she said this is a beneficial book you should read it and maybe talk about this subject he said why she said because this is an important book he said why would i talk about something allah did not talk about it in the quran look how ignorance overwhelms people due to their hatred maybe or due to their envy maybe or due to their simply ignorance he thinks that the word tawheed because it's not mentioned in the quran we should not address it and he made the fuzz out of it is everything not mentioned in the quran is rejected in our religion this is the methodology of al-quran yun those who neglect the sunnah ignore it and don't pay attention to it with your concept of thinking i should also reject the jal the antichrist though it is mutawatar everybody knows that it is part of islam and whoever rejects it is an apostate it's not found in the quran and the list goes on and on and on we believe in the sunnah as well as the quran and we believe that the prophet's teachings allah came to explain and to complete and to specify what was general in the quran so to come easily and cross out tawheed because you don't find the word and what is the hate a lot of the people are ignorant of the meaning of ash so when you tell them what is the meaning of that they say there's no god except allah that's it if you go to the quran you would find that the concept of tawheed is far greater than this definition because the height is to believe in the oneness of allah azzawajal and by the way for those who claim that the tawheed is a phrase or a word that is not found in the quran and the sunnah this only shows their ignorance to heed the origin of the word is found in sahih al-bukhari tawheed is the first thing that the prophet allah used to order his messengers to deliver in the hadith of the sahel bukhari the prophet salallahu sent him to yemen and he told him that you shall come to the people of the book jews and christians and he said to him let it be the first thing you call them to is to believe in the oneness of allah and a lot of those quote unquote so called scholars especially in the west who were brought up learning to hate teaching and studying the books of tahit and now turn back on their heels only do this for recognition they have nothing to show for they have nothing that makes them shine and this is why they decided to do something that would bring them recognition among the disbelievers the orientalists and the hypocrites and also they would be recognized among the believers among those who believe in the akhida of the salaf but only by cursing him and this is a shame all what they hate is the concept that imam muhammad abdullah is a reformer and a great imam of islam after so many years studying now they turned back on their heels and started slaughtering the imam talking ill about the imam even talking wrongly and deviantly about the concept of shirk they've diluted the concept of tawheed due to political reasons due to their hidden agenda or due to their ill intent to gain support from their race from their people it's a racist thing so they take they talk ill about najd they talk ill about sheikh muhammad abdullah and they say that he is the father of all khawarij and they speak ill about his akida and he did not get anything new from his own pocket it's the same akida of ibutamia ibn khaiyan and all the other great scholars of the salaf yet they don't prove or provide any evidence it's just what they say one of them says i've been studying the arcade of sheikh muhammad abdullah for 10 years and i have a book soon to come out and it will make a big bang in the academic world where is it where's the beef it's a big loaf of bread but where's the beef nothing it's all his talk without any proof because he knows if he writes anything he will be exposed and people would know that he's lying and that he hasn't a hidden agenda against the heat so such people we have to be really careful it's not those you see on tv screens or on your social media or on your youtube fame is not a criteria that determines whether this person is following the right akida and teaching the correct teachings of islam or not a lot of those who change their colors those who you under identify 20 years ago are different than today and believe me they will follow the highest bidder give them another 10 years and they'll change their colors again these are not worthy of being called scholars scholars are those who are identified by real scholars of the muslim um not people who went to canada or australia or to america or to europe and then they had to change their akida their views their own opinions because this is what the public want this is what the environment want this is what the government want this is not islam you have to remain steadfast say i believe in allah then go straight forward on the path of the of the prophet allah of the companions of the taberean and tabi it tabiy to shoot from the hip and to speak to laymen who don't know whether you're lying or telling the truth everybody could do this but who verifies what you're saying they've diluted the concept of tawheed even shirk nowadays is not shirk anymore so you yeah you can invoke the dead you can make dua to the dead this is not shirk it's something easy subhanallah this is not what the salaf used to teach this is not what the religion of prophet muhammad the quran and the sunnah state so be careful the basics in our religion is to hate without it there is no islam if you nullify the heat it's like your wudu when you break it by answering the call of nature you cannot pray it's nullified so what is tawheed tauhid is divided into three types the heed of lordship meaning who's the lord of the universe it is allah azzawajal what do we mean by him being the lord it means that he creates no one other than him creates he gives life and death he gives sustenance he provides for us he runs everything with his command and no one else can does this he has sovereignty over the whole universe he owns everything this is worshipping allah azzawajal through his actions subhana wa ta'ala allah says in the quran say who provides for you from the sky and from the earth even the disbelievers the idol worshipers would say allah no one says buddha or my cow they would all say allah or who owns hearing and sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living and who disposes the affairs they will say allah say will you not then be afraid of allah's punishment this tauhid even the idol worshipers did not differ in they acknowledge this they acknowledge that it's only allah that gives life and death everybody acknowledges this and knows that allah is the creator the sustainer the provider the one who makes the rainfall the one who grows the plants and give sustenance to everything the one who runs everything everybody knows this what about atheist sheikh even atheists allah says in the quran that they may reject it but deep down they know it and they know it even the atheist when their plane is about to crash they would shout oh allah help us if it lands safely no i it wasn't me someone else said that they reject this but they know when they're sick about to die they know when in danger when in need they know and if they come to know and don't want to confess boom they just commit suicide and they'll go to hell straightforward no other way this is the hedo ar the heed of lordship the heed of worship is known as the and this is what the messengers were sent for this is where the beef between the believers and the disbelievers lie of worship is to worship only allah to devote all of our forms of worship specifically and to limit it to allah azza such as things that are done by the heart the fear the love the hope the dependence the uh and and the rest of that things that are done physically as prayer fasting sacrifice performing hajjun umrah etc things are done by the tongue saying vicar always remembering allah azzawajal saying oaths by allah this is meaning that i devote all of my forms of worship only and solely to allah the almighty this is where the dispute took place between the messengers and their people their people said whoa wait wait wait hold your horses do you want us only to invoke one god do you want us only to worship one god what about these gods we have no this is something that we cannot accept allah says in the quran and we did not send any messenger before you o muhammad but we inspired him saying none has the right to be worshipped but i allah so worship me alone and none else this is what the prophet was sent and all messengers were sent with it's the same identical message there is no one worthy of being worshiped except allah no holy spirit no messenger no angel no statue no rock no tree no building no sun no planet nothing the only one where we devote our worship to is allah the almighty subhanahu azzawajal the third type of tawhid is the beaut the the beautiful names and attributes of allah and this we will hopefully postpone till tomorrow alongside with the importance of tawheed in our lives and we shall discuss that and elaborate upon isha allah we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back"
