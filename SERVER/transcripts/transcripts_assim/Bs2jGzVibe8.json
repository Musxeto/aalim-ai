  "title": "Is there any dua to be safe from Rapists? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says what dua must a girl recite to be safe from rapists there isn't any specific dawn for this cause and I understand that the issue of rape is quite unfortunately common in some Una's lamech countries especially in the subcontinent and elsewhere and Islam has the answer to all of this there isn't a specific donor for this but there are doers in half car the evening in the morning that we say that we seek Allah's protection through and Allah would protect us with His grace subhana wa ta'ala and mercy but Islam gives you the solution for rape we see that a woman was raped in this country or that and was maimed maybe tortured maybe burnt alive and then she died and the court takes long proceedings for years and maybe would acquit the convicts for one reason or the other this encourages people to commit such a heinous crime alongside the fact that Islam orders women to be protective they should wear the hijab the property job and when a woman wears a proper hijab most likely perpetrators would not look at her as an easy prey rather they would look at someone who's flashing herself and putting ads look at me now I'm not justifying but I'm saying that Islam protects women from such attacks so if a woman is abiding by the hijab if a woman wants to be protected from such a heinous crime she's ordered not to go to dubious places not to go in dark alleys not to go alone especially in an environment or in an area where she knows that she is vulnerable and not immune against such attacks so Islam puts barriers Islam encourages Muslims to come to the defense of such a woman if she were to be attacked and we cannot just stand by watching what's happening or turn a blind eye and look the other way Muslims have to enforce enjoying goodness and virtue and prohibit and prevent vice and evil this is part of our religion so sister in a nutshell there isn't any specific duaa to be said to be protected but there are ways of protecting yourself and secondly you have to trust Allah Azza WA JAL fear can be negative and it can be positive fear is negative when it prevents you from progressing so the fear of being raped if it prevents you from mobilizing from moving from going out totally to legitimate things in broad daylight this fear is negative yes you can visit your family you can go shopping you can visit friends and do normal things like normal people but if this fear cripples you and stops you from going out for legitimate things then you have got a problem now having said that you must also be aware that fear can be positive so a woman or a sister who fears being raped she takes the necessary means and trusts Allah and go ahead so she is decent in her clothes she doesn't apply perfume she wears the proper hijab she doesn't go into the dubious places or places that are dark or the possibility of being mugged or greater than others she's usually accompanied by other women or a man to be with her a Muharram etc if she is in an area that infested by such crimes and Allah knows best may Allah protect all of us from such fitna"
