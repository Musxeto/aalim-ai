  "transcript": "that they won't repeat that again. And from this story we learn that some mistakes may lead to killing people such as giving an evil eye or even driving recklessly. So when you see someone driving recklessly or speeding, you may rebuke them, you may be harsh before something that is worse may happen in the future and then there is no point in regretting it and saying, I wish I did this, I wish I did that. And finally in this hadith, in this story, the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam is teaching us how to block mistakes from happening in the future. So when you see someone doing a sin or an error, you teach them that this is wrong and in the future you should do so and so to avoid falling into the same mistake. We have a short break, stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back."
