  "title": "Wiping over the neck in wudu - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay sh we have an interesting question here from Brother ABD from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia he says someone told me that if I wipe my neck during wo it's like cutting it with a sword he wants to know if this this is true this is not true because there isn't any Hadith that backs it up and besides there is a Hadith which is weak that supports those who say that wiping the neck during Wu is part of it but the most authentic opinion of Scholars that it is an innovation and one should not do this yet when we warn people of Innovations we don't go to extremes and fabricate hadiths over the prophet Alat so that they would stay away from Innovation this is even worse and Innovation is a sin while it's a greater sin to lie over the prophet and say that he said a Hadith while he did not"
