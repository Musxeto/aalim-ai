  "transcript": "ja abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father got married the prophet told him did you get married he said yes a virgin or someone who was married before he said no someone who was married before the prophet inquired asked him why why not a virgin that would play with you and you will play with her because when she did not know any man like you because he was also a virgin so it would increase the love between the both of you why not and he justified this he said I did this for a reason prophet of Allah he was rich no no no that was not the reason definitely he said that my father Abdullah Haram died and he left me a lot of young sisters and I was afraid of bringing another Young girl with them and they'll all be lost so I needed someone who was married before who was wise and mature so that she could take care of my sisters calming them dressing them taking care of them look at the wisdom there was a reason so the prophet Alam prayed for him that Allah would bless him and bless his marriage okay among the things that you only can achieve through marriage is theith of the Prophet all that does not have in it is Amusement except four things what are they so that people would wake up a little bit I can see people D doing dozing and and sleeping H riding horse riding good archery archery is a possibility because the Hadith says a man walking from between two Targets so the majority say it's archery some say no no swimming is yeah okay this is the last one but in regarding of walking between two Targets some say that this is archery others say that this is reconciling between two who have enmity so there is no two brothers two sisters are fighting they don't like each other so I go to this one I talk and I try to soften him I go to the other one softening him going off and on so this has no thck in it but it is not part of the amusement it is not part of the bad things that uh a person would not be uh rewarded for on the contrary he will number 11 of the of the Ben benefits and blessings of getting married is reproduction something I think the Indian government does not support does it yeah well our government supports it our legislation and our Shar supports it and people say she W I have so many children how will I feed them you will not feed them you will die today what will happen to them even if you have one child what will happen to him he will die if you die today and you have only one child he will die as well Allah will provide for him so you're not the provider the prophet says uh uh not the Prophet this that is reproduction is the Dua of ibraim who did not have any children of his and also of Zakaria don't leave me alone and you're the best of inheritance and also is old he doesn't have any children his wife is so old yet he did not give up hope and you should not give up hope if you don't have any children so reproduction is an essential thing in our religion Islam Islam that Adam believed in peace be upon him and all the messengers of Allah it is the Sunnah of the prophets as well Prophet suan this Hadith whenever I go through it it blows my mind away Prophet suan had 100 wives or concubine and one day in the Hadith is in theah he was telling to his friend tonight I will sleep with all of them hundred one would say come on how is this possible well it can be tonight meaning the whole day powerwise he did not have any bison he did not have any Red Bull he doesn't need this he is a messenger of Allah a prophet of Allah and they are the Elite of humans they are the strongest so His companion told him when he heard him say tonight I will sleep with 100 of my women and each one of them will become will conceive and give birth to a warrior that would fight in the cause of Allah look at the intention what is the intention of sleeping having fun he's he's a prophet what is your intention when you sleep with with your wife I want her to stop talking she no this is wrong this is wrong this is the wrong intention have the intention of having a righteous IM that would teach the people have her that is why when someone is blessed with a baby the Dua of the Sal is now you translate this very difficult may Allah bless that you have been granted and may Allah Grant you his praise and you praise Allah for what he has given you may Allah Grant him to grow as old as he can be and be strong a man uh and not only that he grows old may Allah also makes him an obedient and respectful uh child because without this you're lost so many of of us may have children who are not obedient and respectful are they happy with their offspring sometimes they say I wish I did not have a child I would have been better off may Allah protect all our children inshallah and with women we say the same four things if she's a girl baby girl and we add a fifth thing and that is and may Allah make her a bed a bed for one of his righteous Pious uh uh uh Muslims and because if you have a if you have a daughter you will be offended when you hear this huh H what do you mean my daughter is a bed for a man yes she's a beted for a man but a righteous and practicing and Pious person what is your intention as a father of girls I have alhamdulillah 13 girls no boys with the bless with the blessing of Allah what is the best thing I would wish for my daughters to become a medical doctor no wrong to become engineer wrong what what do I want for my daughters a righteous husband that's it he doesn't have to be rich he has to be Saudi H sorry he doesn't have to be rich he has to be practicing God-fearing and a man knows how to make decisions if I get this alhamdulillah I've got it made so we always supplicate this to people when they get children and if it's a girl one of his anyhow so the intention of Salman was he said I want 100 Fighters for the cause of Allah 100 muah his friend what did he tell him anyone knows the Hadith is in theah by the way his friend told him say inshallah don't say I want this say inshallah and the Hadith tells us that Shan did not say most likely as Muslims we believe that he forgot no way someone tells you no and he's a prophet of Allah he will not say no he will definitely say yes but he forgot the Hadith says that he did this and all of the 99 women got miscarriage they conceived but they miscarried so no Warrior was born one woman gave birth to a crippled man A crippled child half a child it says in the Hadith so this highlights the importance of what saying inshallah on the things you will do in the future so when my brother presenting who was uh um graduated from prestigious huh prestigious University inshallah is it possible he didn't say it he didn't say it but the brothers say this I ask a friend yeah what's your name he says Muhammad inshallah and and if Allah does not will it what would it be Ahmed the funniest thing is that I met a friend and I saw a child with say Mall this is your sonallah it is abuse of the word inshallah inshallah is only used for what for the future you never say inshallah for the present time or for the past how much is this it's five rupees inshallah this is the present no you use inshallah if you want to do something if you want to say something in the future so production reproduction is important as illustrated by uh San peace be upon Him among the benefits of reproduction which is a byproduct of marriage is that your children pray for you after your death this is something Second To None the prophet tells if a man dies his deeds are stopped except for three and one of them is a righteous child who would pray for him who among you has lost his father 1 2 3 4 okay about 12 okay alhamdulillah I lost my father as well like 35 years years ago he died and with the grace of Allah till date every single night I pray for him though I don't remember him I was only maybe 15 years old when I when he died I don't remember him I I try as much as possible to offer for him whenever I find it possible and I seek forgiveness from for Allah from Allah for him this is one of the greatest Deeds you can leave after you leave you die when you have your children praying for you seeking forgiveness for you and if they are righteous and they are scholarly like alhamdulillah whenever they make a seminar it is in the credit of the father because he's the one who brought you to this life he's the one who taught you he's the one who up brought you in a good way so without marriage you can not have this say yeah I can no you cannot you cannot he's not your child huh without marriage he's not legit legitimately yours this is a lot of uh uh the brothers and sisters are confused with if a man commits adultery or fornicates with a woman and she conceives and she gives birth to a child is it his child no it is not related to the man it is not called after the man it cannot inherit from that man and the man is not responsible for supporting that child although biologically he is the parent the father but islamically he has no relations with him so this is something this is not the time for it again blessings of marriage okay that was number 11 H this is number 12 no repr production again okay this is may Allah be pleased with him he came to the prophet Alat wasam and he said oh prophet of Allah I found a woman that is beautiful and good lineage and mashallah everything is but she has a one problem what's that she does not bear children she cannot conceive so can I marry her and the prophet said no so the man repeated the question again and the prophet said no and the man repeated the apparently she was very beautiful and he repeated the question for the third time and then the prophet saidat marry those who are loving and fertile for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations and inshallah I'll be one of the the people that will make the prophet proud inshallah marry the one who is loving and fertile loving okay fertile how do I know if she's fertile or not not do I take her for a test drive for example it's not a car so how is it possible who knows the answer yes uh one one the brother only yes I look at her relatives what's this I get one like this okay give the brother a gift masallah this is grade one SW works by its own how do I know that a woman is fertile by looking at her relatives her sisters mallah they're reproducing then the chances that she will be like them if she comes from a family that cannot produce there's something wrong in the family then most likely she would be like this and the second possibility is that that woman was married before and she's widowed or divorced and through her marriage she could not conceive so the possibility is is there does this mean she if I are um if I am a if I we a woman and I cannot have children that I'll remain to the rest of my life unmarried yes no no no this is not forbidden here it is not forbidden for a man to marry someone who's not able to reproduce it is not recommended especially if she is his first wife but if if a person has another wife and he has children then it is permissible for him to get married so this is for a family that wants to make a family but it is not possible due to this test of Allah upon them the last point in uh this segment is that you would have in-laws this is one of the benefits one says well it's not benefit it is it is it is is it benefit or not to have in-laws raise your hands is it the benefit to you personally the sisters hands are very shy because they are suffering the most from the in-laws men don't suffer I know this men don't suffer because man the least he could the most he can do is I'm not going I don't want to see in my in-laws the sisters are suffering and the cause of suffering is you they're suffering from their in-laws because they're forced to live with their in-laws and they're forced to to to serve and to cook and to clean as a servant I she says it would be better for me to do this in my mother's house I'd rather serve my mother and father rather than serve a stranger and if she finds appre appreciation from the husband that would have lessen and softened the hardship not only that he's abusive you're not respectful to my mother my mother complains about you why are you doing this why are you doing that so she is living in hell not all of you alhamdulillah all of you are content and we will come to that inshallah later later don't don't worry I just want to make sure that they come tomorrow I'm afraid tomorrow no men and no male no females will come to have in-laws is a blessing of Allah why because I have three brothers when I get married I have five brothers they help me I help them I feel proud when I sit in a gathering and they say oh you know this family you know that family I said yeah these are my in-laws mashallah you're married to them so the more in-laws you have the prouder you are the stronger you are the more efficient you become in a society and that is why the prophet was married when he died he died marrying how many nine he had nine wives and how many families did he have Abu Bakr was related to the prophet correct Omar may Allah be pleased with himman Ali all in-laws in-laws in-laws so he was surrounded by his own in-laws and this gave him power and gave him Prestige of course he has power and Prestige from Allah but talking on the level of Dunya it adds a lot of value to have your in-laws and finally I hope this is number 13 marriage protects the society if you don't get married the society would be corrupt if you go to America if you go to Europe they do not get married a man on average has 18 19 girlfriends before getting marriage married on average a woman would almost have the same what would this cause it would cause the society to deteriorate and collapse we only watch America and Europe from TV from movies from tabloid papers and we think oh what a life W they don't have life they have filth they have divorce in very high rate they have fornication adultery cheating betrayal they have bastards you meet someone who's your father I don't know what's your name my name is so and so did you do you know your father no he left when I was young he didn't leave when he was young his mother doesn't know who's the father you have hundreds of thousands of similar people if there is no marriage in the society this is the collapse of a society why if you remember in World War II all the German soldiers all the French soldiers were dead and consumed in this uh uh uh War which resulted in having too many women if a woman cannot marry except one man and you have three or four or five extra women by Nature this is something natural women like to beautify themselves even men even men like to beautify themselves right wrong men yes men have this but women it's nature but but also men have this if I walk in the streets of you know market doing this if I see someone I know especially if he's an athlete from the gym the minute he approaches me I do this once he leaves I go back to my normal stance why human nature this is human nature you like to beautify yourself I get a lot of phone calls from women asking questions and my wife usually sits next to me and when I sayum she says a woman she smiles I finish the question said why are you saying this I know when you sayum to a manum Salam and if it's a woman you soften I do do I do it intentionally no but this is human nature women are like this they love to beautify themselves because Allah created them beautiful all women are beautiful Allah created them this way so when she cannot fulfill her desires by marrying a man what would she do she uses what she knows best beautifying herself and going and this caused of the increase of prostitution after the second world war everywhere in the world where you have women more than men and they are unable to get married this happens so it protects the society marriage protects the society we move on to the second chapter there the time or shall we take questions yes please the volunteers please collect the questions inah I'll start the first question alaykum my married friends can't find time to study Islam and they say that and uh it's for a serious Islamic Studies it's better to delay marriage your comments please for for a serious what Islamic Studies they get married they don't get time to study so for the sake of having serious Islamic Studies they want to delay their marriage well I think that this is a lame excuse because even if they're not married they will still complain that we don't have time we have we we need to go on play cricket once a week and football twice a week and we have to do this and we don't have time to study marriage gives you a lot of time because it gives you quality rather than quantity if you're single you have a lot of time but I know a lot of single people when they study it takes them five times more than a married person to go through one page they read the page five times until they can understand it a married person read it only once because his mind is is is not pressured so I do not believe that it is a legitimate excuse however if a person does not have the desire to get married then yes you can if someone does not have the drive to get married he does not think of getting married he does not have the feeling that he needs it and he wants to continue studying go ahead I'm talking about a person who finds himself inclined to the opposite sex and he wants to get married whether a woman or or a boy then in this case no it becomes part of what we mentioned any questions online students inshallah uh for those who are not doing uh Islamic Studies but secular education but the financially they are not able to get married so can they delay this falls under the Hadith that we've mentioned in point Point number three or four oh youth if you can afford it get married so if a person is in University if a person is in high school I get a lot of high school students uh age 17 or 18 is education here uh mixed yeah we have both mixed and you segregated alhamdulillah so they complained that we want to get married we cannot afford it so what to do if you cannot afford it then you have to fast but if you are able to afford it if you have parents that are willing to get you married then you should get married as much as soon as possible in not as much so uh what is the basic requirement for marriage you want an answer for that that's a question what what is the basic requirement for Mar to to be a man and to be able to afford it and to know the responsibilities and obligations which we will come to discuss inshallah fully but and also for a woman to be able to uh be a woman to satisfy her husband and at the same time to be qualified to lead a marital life and to open a house there isn't any something that you can touch and what are the requirements that you can get married someone who cannot get married then you have to have certain conditions if someone is unable to reproduce is someone is unable to have uh uh marital relationship with his wife so can he get married yes if she knows this and she accepts this and she doesn't need this this is possible but not to all okay the second question what happens in society is that uh those women who get married but after the marriage they come to know they cannot uh uh reproduce or beget children they are getting divorced so it's happening so what's your comments on this what does Islam say it is the right of a spouse now I did not say a husband HH it is the right of a spouse to reproduce so if a woman marries a man and a man is proven medically that he cannot reproduce he has some sort of deficiency he's not impotent but he has deficiency physically he cannot make have any children she has all the right to have the marriage contract void and separated not she goes to the judge and she complains and the judge gives her separation because it's not her mistake the other way around is correct if a man is married to a woman and she cannot reproduce he has all the right to marry again whether she produces or reproduces this is but usually we encourage him to get married again without divorcing the wife but if he cannot financially afford it he says I cannot afford to open two houses in this case divorcing that woman who cannot bear children is a legitimate thing next question do you have any online questions it's coming okay uh can I have uh put up a condition in marriage for example like I will divorce her if she isn't virgin can I put this condition while doing my marriage contract no how would you know that she's not virgin I don't want you to answer this to if she's not virgin this cannot be a condition this is one of the things that call for the cancelling of the of of uh the marriage if you discovered this but this is difficult if not impossible to discover because the old primitive way of proving a woman's virginity is not used anymore and it's not acceptable islamically and a lot of the women may not have this bleeding s sort of to speak at the night of the wedding because of many medical reasons and I have had uh a program in Huda where I discussed this unfortunately yeah uh it's called the himim or the him Hyman and it was about cosmetic surgery and what's the ruling on restoring it it was"
