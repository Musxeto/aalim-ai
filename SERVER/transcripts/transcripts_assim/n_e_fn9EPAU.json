  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah Revelation started but how is this Revelation coming to the prophet the scholars divided the types of in Arabic which is the Revelation into six types the first one is true dreams or visions and this is how the prophet started seeing things that would come exactly as he saw them in his visions and that was 6 months before being first revealed to in the cave of and in the had the Prophet saidat The Vision the true vision of a believer is one over 46 of prophethood a portion of 46 of prophethood how is this calculated this is something in Allah's knowledge some Scholars say because the prophet used to see these true Vision that came into reality 6 months before Revelation 6 months compared to 23 years of prophethood is 1 over 46 so we as humans as Muslims we may get true Visions in our dreams that Allah makes into reality and this is a portion of 46 of prophethood then the prophet Alat wasam or the second type of um Revelation is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to encounter and that is the Angel would appear to him in the form of a man and he would speak to him in a way that he would understand what he said to him and in this form of Revelation some of the companions may see that angel in the human form the Archangel giel used to come peace be upon him in the form of one of the companions known as and was a very handsome man so they thought that this was where actually it was the AR AR Angel giel and he would say to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he would reveal to the prophet alaih wasam whatever he wanted through this Revelation and other incident the well-known Hadith where a man entered upon the prophet Alat says that he had white clothes black hair no dust no traces of travel appeared on him and no one of us knew him so how would a total stranger come in such clean clothes and clean shape and none of us know him and he came and asked the prophet alai about Islam Iman the signs of the day of judgment and when he left the prophet told them that that this was jiel teaching you your religion indirectly the third type of Revelation is what the angel what the angel used to inspire the prophet and this is something that the angel would cast in his heart without seeing him and the prophet saidat wasam the Holy Spirit the that is jel peace be upon Him inspired in my heart that no soul will die until it has received its Provisions in full so this is the third type of Revelation that the prophet used to receive the fourth type is that used to come to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in a fashion that was really hard and this was the most severe uh uh type that the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam used to receive and he used to receive something like the sound of bells or when iron is struck so he used to suffer a lot from this and his body would sweat and you can see sweat dripping from his forhead even if it was cold and if he was on his ride his Mount would sink to the ground jab Abdullah says that I was sitting with the prophet Alam once and he had his knee we were so close that his knee was on my thigh when he got this Revelation he said it I felt that my thigh is going to break because of the weight of this Revelation upon the prophet and the fifth type is when the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam would see the angel on his actual natural form we as humans can't see the Angels Allah Asel has hidden them from our sights we can't see the Jin because Allah has hidden them from our sights we know that the Jin are created from fire while angels are created from light but Allah has given them the ability to take shapes and forms other than their natural form their natural form is out of our imagination as mentioned before that the prophet sawat the Archangel jiel peace be upon him on his in his true form twice and he had as the prophet described him 600 Wings how would you fit wings as IM shaf once was trying to advise one of the sons of of Kings who lost his way in terms of a and he started giving a shape in a form to Allah whom we know that nothing is unlike to him and he's all hearing all seeing so we cannot imagine Allah and we cannot shape Allah's attributes and give it similarity to his creation so he heard of this youngster individual and he went to him to advise him that this is not the belief of and he told him my son did you let's let's not talk about Allah let's talk about one of Allah's creation did you hear of the Hadith that jel had 600 Wings when the prophet saw himam and the boy said yes he said let jiel aside here is a bird give me or place three Wings to this bird not 600 and the boy was speechless because he can't so this is one of Allah's creation how dare you think of Allah the creator of the heavens and the Earth whose nothing is unlike to him subhanahu wa taala so the prophet saw the Archangel twice and as mentioned in Surah in the Quran and this is the fifth type of Revelation and the fin final and the sixth type of Revelation is what Allah reveals to his messenger directly without any intermediates and this happened in the night Journey the miraculous night journey of Al when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was ascended to the seventh heaven and he was allowed to enter a place where even the Archangel jibriel was not allowed to enter and he was received by Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala though he did not see Allah as he could not be able to do so in his human form and all what he saw was light as in the Hadith and Allah the almighty prescribed to his umah 50 prayers per day and night and this is when or what gives the prayers a huge value Over All all type of rituals that Allah himself revealed it directly to his messenger in the seventh heaven so these are the six types of Revelation as per the classifications of the scholars which the prophet Alam got from his lordel now when we come to the stages of Da when it started the Revelation started the prophet could not directly go to his people and tell them to leave their idols and to worship only go one God and to follow me they would have executed them on the spot as we know they were not lenient people they were not soft or civilized they were rude they had no Authority the tribe was the authority and each tribe protected its members and those who did not have enough protection they would have been wasted killed disposed of and nobody could have talked against that so when Allah revealed to his Messenger to arise and warn he did this in secret and definitely the natural thing was to call those closest to you so the first he called was his wife Khadijah his best friend Abu Bakr his own cousin Ali whom he brought up himself as a token of appreciation to his uncle who brought him up and took care of him and then and finally Z who was the his acclaimed adopted son before this was abolished and abrogated and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam kept on giving his Daw spreading it alongside Abu Bakr and Ali and Zade they all did their job secretly and it was said that this took 3 years in secret though the people had an idea of it but it was never done publicly and it was said that 130 men and women accepted Islam in secret some of them did not know one another because they did not want to expose their dawa in such a fashion and prayer was at the time given to the Muslims but not in the far five F prayers they used to pray only two raas whether it was night prayer or any random prayer but they had to have a connection to Allah and and this was before any type of legislation so what was the message of the Prophet wasallam through these three years it was to purify your soul to cleanse your heart to deal with good maners with others to know who Allah is to acknowledge Allah with his beautiful name names and attributes and to ponder and contemplate upon the verses of the Quran that was revealed and to know and protect your messenger Muhammad s this is all the time we have until we meet you in the next class I Leave You [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
