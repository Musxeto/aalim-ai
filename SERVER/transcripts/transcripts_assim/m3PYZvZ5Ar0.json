  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ admonishment of his own cousin Ali | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "And finally the Prophet ﷺ admonished his own cousin, his own son-in-law, Ali may Allah be pleased with him. Once he visited his daughter's house, Fatima, and her husband Ali, and when they permitted him to enter, he found them lying in bed. And it was night time. He said, why don't you pray? Why aren't you praying night prayer? Immediately Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, replied and said, O Prophet of Allah, our souls are in the hands of Allah. Whenever He wants to set them free for us to wake up, we will wake up and pray. But other than that, we don't have any control. We're asleep. The Prophet did not reply, alayhis salatu was salam. He gave his back and went out, striking his thigh and saying, Wa kaana al-insanu akhtara shay'in jadala. But man has ever been most of anything prone to dispute, argument. Which means that the Prophet, alayhis salatu was salam, did not like the answer of Ali. That was quick. And instead of saying, yes, insha'Allah, we will do that, O Prophet of Allah, he gave a justification that was not adequate to the Prophet, alayhis salatu was salam. And this is why he said this ayah and left admonishing Ali, who understood the message and learned the lesson. We have a short break. Stay tuned and insha'Allah we'll be right back."
