  "title": "Is it mandatory to remove Beard oil, wax, or cream for Wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] my question is if a person uses beard oil or other similar product such as beard wax which is used to make the beard look presentable is it important to wash out the product during mudo and is still valid if there are traces of the product left okay i will answer inshallah this hank from india says sometimes we put beard oil or creams or whatever when we perform wudu must we remove this the answer is yes because the beard belongs to the face and it needs to be washed unlike the head the head we're ordered to wipe so even if you have hair gel or creams or whatever just wiping over it does the job while the beard itself it has to be washed while washing the face and hence you have to ensure that there's nothing making a bad ear but if it is normal creams that are absorbed by the hair itself then you have no problem in that insha'allah"
