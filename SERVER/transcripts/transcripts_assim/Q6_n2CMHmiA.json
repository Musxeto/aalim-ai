  "transcript": "Maajid from Saudi Arabia. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I hope you're doing well, Sheikh. Alhamdulillah, I'm doing great, Akhi. What can I do for you? Alhamdulillah. Yes, I have two questions, actually, very quick. One question only, please. Please, Sheikh, it's a request, please. Your first question. Okay, my first question, because in these days it's a little hard to find the right guests practicing Muslim as a spouse and although searching a lot and asking my mother to help me with it, but really it's tough. And my second question, Sheikh. What is your question? The first question, what is it? My first question is how to find the right spouse in this age, because really it's really tough. Where do you live? I live in Saudi Arabia, Jeddah, really. Okay, so for your first question, to find a righteous spouse in your locality, your mom, your sister, your aunties, your cousins, should know within their community where to find. To claim that there are or it is difficult to find righteous women, this is not true. I live in Jeddah, there are so many available righteous practicing women who are to your liking if you want to find. All what you have to do is ask the right women to direct you to them. There are khattaba, as we call them. And they know, okay, you want someone who's niqabi, someone who doesn't work, someone who has a degree, someone who is righteous practicing, this and that, you will find. The problem here is not in finding such a woman. The problem is in the stereotyping you have in your head. And I am certain that your mom brought to you a number of choices, and all of them you've declined because, oh no, her hair is not soft enough, oh, she's not white enough, oh, she's a bit chubby, oh, she's not tall enough, oh, she's not this, oh, she doesn't speak English, she doesn't do this, she doesn't do that. So it's your bar that is too high, which you have to lower. And I tell people, I tell boys who are interested in getting married, before you set your conditions, take a good look at the mirror. Do you fit the conditions that a woman is looking for you? Are you her knight in shining armors? Are you the one to be sought after with the sports physique, with a good job, with a good house, with a good car, with a nice personality, with a humorous soul, with, with, with, with? Or not any of the above? So it's all about demand and supply, and it's all about what you bring to the table that would count. As much as you have, you should expect. But don't shoot for the stars when you yourself could not fulfill that, and Allah knows best."
