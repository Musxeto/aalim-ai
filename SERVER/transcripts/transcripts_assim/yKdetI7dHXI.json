  "transcript": "oh alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in Hadith number 110 in the chapter that deals with tum the dry Evolution or the purification using the soil was read last time we met and brother Mustafa will remind us again with this Hadith narrated The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam sent me on an errand then I became junob from seminal in in my sleep I did not find water so I rolled on the soil like an animal does to perform tum then I returned to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and mentioned that to him he sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it would have been sufficient for you to do with your hands this way he then struck his hands once on the soil and then rubbed the left hand on the right and the exterior part of his palms and his face in the narration of Al bukari he Allah's messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam struck struck the Earth with his palms both hands and then blew off the dust and rubbed both of his palms over his face and hands the Hadith again if you recall we said that is one of the things that tells you that it's not everything that is logical that we should apply in our lives because Islam is a religion of submission and you have to submit your will to the will of Allah by applying the Quran and the Sunnah to your life without questioning without asking why it's like wearing gold it's is forbidden for men why you're not allowed to ask you have to comply it's exactly like when someone says that you have to have a a visa to this country to travel you don't have the CH the right to go to the Embassy and say why I don't want I want to travel without a Visa why should I buy a ticket it I want to go into on the plane without but it's it's something that you have to follow whether you know the wisdom and logic behind it or not now the origin of tum is in the Quran where Allah says what translates roughly to but if you are ill or on a journey or one of you answers the call of nature or you have been in contact with women that is sexual intercourse and you find no water then take for yourselves clean Sands or Earth and drub there with your faces and hands now is it intended that we dirt our faces no because the prophet Salli wasallam blew in his hands after striking the the the ground which meant that he removed all uh uh particles that were on his hand B blowing in them and from this this verse and from this Hadith we learn that the soil the ground suffice in case of theh the absence of water you can perform dry pollution if you don't have water or if you are in if you are ill as mentioned in the verse read to you a while ago and this is whether you are performing Evolution or you performing total and obligatory bath it's the same same thing if you don't have water for either you can perform uh uh AB uh the dry abolon or you can perform a um do we have any questions or should we move on to the following Hadith you can move on um brother Mustafa how is T performed exactly do you wipe your hands first what's your face or hands first it's it's any as it states in in the Hadith you strike once the ground and and this is a point that one should also pay attention to imagine you are on a mountainous area and it's all rocks some people think that you should only hit the soil or sand this is not true whatever is on the surface you can use it so whatever is on the surface so if you are in a mous area if you are on on a rocky uh ground you can hit the rock strike the Rocks strike the so strike the grass you don't have to take off the grass and you know dig in look for no you don't have to do all what you have to do is hit it it's it's a symbolic thing it's a symbolic thing it doesn't have any water in it or something that you cover your body with no and likewise if a person was in a hospital God forbid he's hospitalized and he's unable to go to the toilet to perform a pollution and he has no one to serve him and to bring him water or he has something wrong with his body or you know with all these tubes and and gadgets connected to him he cannot wash his self so he may use a dry bution tum but he also does not have anyone to bring him anything so he can easily hit the bed hit the pillow if you can go to the to the to the walls he could hit the walls of of the room and this is enough and insufficient now whether to begin with the hands or with the face it's all the same see the wow is W when you say that and he wiped his palms and his face or wiped his face and his palms it's the same thing the thing is that you do this you wipe your face you wipe your hands or the opposite it's inshallah the same thing and and and there is nothing according to what I know that implies that you have to do it in this sequence and Allah knows best the following Hadith Hadith 111 narrated byar may Allah may Allah be pleased with them Allah's messenger sallallah alai wasallam said meaning purifying with the soil consists of two strikings of the soil one for the face and one for the hands up to the elbows okay this Hadith is not authentic so we should not elaborate a lot on it why is it unauthentic the chain of of of narrators it's weak and the meaning also is weak because the other stronger and authentic Hadith all say that you strike the floor or the ground how many times only once so by by adding another one it has to be authentic if it's not then why should we do it one would argue and say why not what would I lose if I strike the ground another time okay what would you lose if you strike the ground 10 times 10 times is better than two times and why not 100 time Islam tells you to do this and it forbids you to increase or decrease because both sides are called Innovation so you have to stick to the Quran and Sunnah one would say yes but it doesn't harm anyone it does it does harm you because the minute you think that I may add something in religion this is an accusation from your side to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that he did not fulfill his mission and he did not teach us everything why because you're adding to him which means that he didn't complete it and whenever you say that no this is too much I'm not going to do it instead of praying for ra every I'm going to make it two why it's too long for why why should I do it this way or is three it's the only odd number in the five prayers so either make it four or take one and make it two it's your choice you you can you can choose whatever this is unacceptable because because you're changing the religion of Allah no innovation would be accepted so it's only once that you strike the the ground it's the same thing when Satan comes to you or to someone else not to you when Satan comes to someone and tells them why only perform Evolution three times for each part of your body why not make it five cleanliness is uh next to whatever they they call it cleanness is good so let's do it no it's not good you're not cleaning you're performing ablution keep this in your mind when you're performing Evolution you're not cleaning your body you're following the instructions of Allah and that is why if there's no water you follow the instruction of Allah and and strike the floor or the ground and dust your face and hands so you have to always keep in mind that only authentic hadiths we should follow unauthentic weak we do not want to even look into them because they do not add any value to US unless and this is a specialty a speciality of uh the scholars of Hadith unless this or weak Hadith has another way which makes both of them become Hassan and and we don't want to go into details of this as it's a little bit uh of our line and leag uh the following Hadith Hadith 112 narrated by Abu Allah's messenger Sall wasam said the soil is a means of ablution for the Muslim believer even if he does not find water for 10 years but when he finds water he should guard against disobeying Allah reported by alas okay this is a a Hass Hadith so it's authentic it's acceptable uh Abu Hur brother Zaki do you know what his real name is you remember it no we mentioned it three or four programs 10 20 programs ago God knows when uh without cheating without referring to your notes does anybody know Abu Malik ABD and is one of the tribes of the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula it's a part of uh uh the zahrani tribe and he he converted to Islam or reverted to Islam on the seventh year of hij on the day of uh he tells us that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is showing and instructing us that dry AB olution tum is exactly as good as Evolution with water so it's not something that is made for a while it's a temporary thing no as long as you cannot use water you may use it the the tum even if it's for 10 years but once you find water you have to stop and uh uh uh uh refrain from using the soil and use water and this is the Hadith that tells us uh so now some Scholars say that you have to perform forever prayer why they say that let it let me go back a little bit should I perform Evolution for every prayer uh r no except if you I mean if you uh nullify okay that's true I don't have to perform ation for every single prayer as long as my wood my evolution is intact and I did not do anything to nullify it then I may pray now some Scholars say tum is different why is that they say that is a substitute to Evolution so it's not depend Independent by itself therefore every single Salah we have to perform tum again until we find water is this authentic is is it not authentic this is what we will learn inshallah after the post so stay tuned we will be right back inshallah back to the prophet join shikh ahmar in the program back to the Prophet wherein he teaches us practical lessons from the prophet's life and how this can help us to overcome our challenges in the present we talk about the life example of the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon Him seeking guidance for ourselves in the early days after the revelation of the Holy Quran the Muslims were greatly persecuted so much so that quite a few Muslims had to leave Arabia and migrate to Africa to live among Christian people who follow the gospel of Christal and welcome back brother Zaki can you remind us again with the Hadith please yes narrated by Abu Allah's Messenger s said the soil is a means of ablution for the Muslim believer even if he does not find water for 10 years but when he finds water he should guard against disobeying Allah and let it touch his skin okay we uh stopped by saying that some Scholars consider tum as a substitute that is used when needed but not as an alternative which means that you may use it only for this particular worship so they say if you want to pray perform tum but if you want to read the Quran perform tum for to it again and when the other prayer is being called for then your previous tum is void automatically you have to perform another tum this Hadith or this verdict of Scholars is not authentic the authentic thing is that tum is actually it it is an alternative when you don't have water and it fully substitutes the the absence of water which means that if fer prayer is being called for I perform tum I pray fer if I did not not nullify my woodu or if I did not nullify my Purity I may read the Quran I may perform ta I may even wait until it's prayer and pray with the same uh uh previously made I don't have to do it again and this could go on for 10 years you can substitute it completely and make tum in the absence of water or in the case that you may cannot use or touch uh uh water touches your skin even if it was uh even if it were for 10 years as the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said now uh in the following Hadith Hadith number 113 we have an extra bit of information which is what happens if a person performs tum and then then after five or 10 minutes after his pray has prayed after he has prayed he found water must he repeat the Salah again as long as he is in still within the time boundaries the second or the following prayer was not called for yet so should I pray it again or the prayer that I've done is enough this inshallah we will find the answer for in Hadith 113 narrated by two men sat out on a journey and when the time for Salat meaning prayer came they had no water they performed tum they performed tum with clean Earth and prayed later on they found water within the time of the prayer one of the one of them repeated the prayer and ablution but the other did not repeat then they came to the messenger then they came to Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam and related the matter to him addressing himself to the one who did not repeat he said you followed the Sunnah and your prayer was sufficient for you he said to the other who performed ablution and repeated for you there is a double reward now this Hadith shows us that if you put some effort Allah will you reward you for that effort but if you are lazy and don't put any effort at all Allah will punish you for that and you will have to repeat the worship you've done again let me give you an example a man goes to another country he doesn't know where the is so he looks around in his hotel room where he's living and he thinks that this wall looks very nice the is there and he prays now is this acceptable no why is that because he did not do any effort then what should what should have he done he should have gone downstairs and asked the receptionist where the is and if he's in a non-muslim country he should ask where the east or west is so that he could determine where the is or he should have called the Islamic Center and told them where he is and ask them to give him the directions but or the least he could have done was to go out in the open look at the sky try to determine the directions by looking at the sun but by not doing this then his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat the prayer again even if he prayed 10 times he has to repeat them all again now if a person does the effort but he fails in achieving the objective and what he wanted in the same scenario a person goes to the hotel he asks the receptionist they tell them that it the East is this way so he calculates it and figures out that the is a little bit to the South and he prays accordingly and after a week or two he discovers that the receptionist was wrong and the East was this way which meant that all the time that he had prayed was to the wrong direction must he repeat it again the answer is no why is that because he did all what he can do and Allah Asel tells us in the Quran no matter where you face your prayer will reach Allah and the East and West is for Allah subhana tala providing you put some effort into it but in the first scenario the guy did not even care where the was and he prayed in any direction so this is unacceptable likewise these are two men traveling and they all perform Salah with but after a while like 5 10 minutes they find water so one of them say well I've already prayed I shouldn't do pray it again the other one said well as long as we are still within the prayer time this prayer we've done five or 10 minutes ago should be void and we should perform a pollution as long as we have water and and pray the prophet Sall wasallam told the first one who did not repeat the prayer what you've done was correct because at the time the only available source of purification was was T the F the only available source of purification was tum now after you prayed and you did your best whatever comes afterwards does not count and the prophet told the other one who performed a volution and uh uh uh gave the matter some thought and he figured out that this is the best thing to do he told him that you will have uh uh your reward doubled because you you've done this twice you've prayed twice now the question is Abu Malik if it happens to you what would you do now would you choose the double reward well it depends on my situ situation you know it's the same situation you're stranded in the desert the prayer has been called for you look for water and you don't find it you perform tum and you pray and immediately after you finish prayer it's it rains and there's this bucket next to you it's filled with water really usually you know before I read this had I'll probably know just pray this you know not pray this you know double word there so inah I Pray Again pray it again do you agree all I think let's take the vote of the United Nation Security Council I think yeah if we repeat it's okay because it's based on this Hadith according to this Hadith it's right but if we feel tired you know we can just leave it because it's uh it's right okay do you agree do you have the consensus of Scholars or Mustafa maybe doing the Sunnah itself because the prophet Muhammad Salli wasallam told the first man the first companion that what you have done is the Sunnah so maybe no it's not maybe so it's definitely definitely it's this is the right thing the prophet Salli wasallam told the first one who did not pray you did the right thing you did the sunna and he told the other one who could not figure out the because he didn't because if they both knew the Sunnah they would have followed it right yeah but they they didn't know everyone took his choice hoping that this is the right thing so the first one he was he you know he got lucky he he he was the one following the Sunnah the other one on the other hand was not following the Sunnah yet he was rewarded because he didn't know the Sunnah and he put some effort into it so if it if if we were to be in their shoes now we do not repeat the the prayer one says okay what happens if I do repeat the prayer we will tell him that you have done something that conflicts with the Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallah wasallam is not to repeat it again now this Hadith tells us that or shows us how the companions of the Prophet Alam used to inquire about every single detail because if it were uh if we were in their shoes we would have done it and forgot it I get questions from people asking me about events that took place 10 years ago I got a brother called and said sheh 10 years ago I performed Hajj and I didn't do the following thing so is it okay or not and I've asked the brother were you in a comma or were you traveling in space or something 10 years it took you 10 years to ask the question and I live next door to you said well um I didn't think it it was that important and and he figured out that it's about time he asks the question about his Hajj and to his luck his Hajj was invalid the thing he did invalidated his Hajj and he only knew 10 years afterwards the companions were not like this whenever they had a problem whenever they had something they immediately went to the prophet and checked it out just to know exactly if it's okay or not okay and this is how we Muslims should behave we have so many new things coming up you know transactions Finance uh uh inventions and we have to ask inquire about our knowledge in order order for us to know our Dean I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time oh yeah"
