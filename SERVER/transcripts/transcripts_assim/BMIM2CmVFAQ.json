  "transcript": "finally sua says is it permissible to say things to my kid like if you don't eat food the crow will take it away or if you do that then the police will come and take you this is not permissible this is a lie and we as Muslims are prohibited from lying abdah may Allah be pleased with him says once the prophet Sall wasallam came to visit us when I was a young boy and my mom said to me come let me give you this so the child came and the prophet said what are you going to give him so she opened her hand and there was a date and she said oh prophet of Allah I was going to give him this date the prophet said Alam had you not had anything in your hand that would have been a lie so many times people do this with the children come come let me give you this and when they come they grab the child this is prohibited and this is a sin even with children not only that some Scholars say that it's a sin even with animals may Allah have mercy on his soul writes that some students of Hadith went to a sheh to hear and note down the Hadith he was reporting you know the chain of narrators he was one of them and when they went to see him and meet him they found him with his mule and he had a bucket doing this to The Mule so that the mule could come and he could get hold of it when they looked in the bucket they found it empty they turned around and left and when people said wait you did didn't hear from the Sheikh you didn't register anything they said if he lies to Ule we can't trust him that he may not lie and fabricate a Hadith he's not trustworthy so in Islam we cannot even lie to a an animal let alone a child let alone a grown-up man unfortunately the Muslims are light years away from such eates that constitute the essence of our beautiful religion they don't know or they know but that they're not willing to practice it because of all what they see around them all what they're interested in is the buck money how to be wealthy how to be famous as soon as possible lie cheat accept bribes do whatever it takes to reach where you want to reach but this is a life that is limited to a number of years once it's expired then you have eternity whether in heaven or in hell and the choice is yours"
