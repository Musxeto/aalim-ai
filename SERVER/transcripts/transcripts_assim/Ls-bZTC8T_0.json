  "transcript": "a brother says Salaam my beloved chair it's right to have phone romance with your spouse abroad making xxx videos for after all we have heard so many cases but I haven't heard anyone talk about it especially our Islamic leaders so the brother is asking on the ruling of exchanging erotic videos or having chats video chatting where the most likely the wife is the one who exposes her body because if the man exposes his body who cares so he's asking what is the ruling on that our leaders Lamech leaders did not address they have they had addressed this before and in so many places but maybe you are not looking at the right place first of all women are not permitted to record private videos like this whether sent to you personally or exchanged to the internet or using Skype or other platforms for video chatting because you cannot ensure that this would not fall into the wrong hands it is very possible that it is being hacked being recorded being distributed on a big scale and you are not aware of it and this is all your doing if you come in the future and receive something of such nature from a friend and tells you Wow luckily this is a nice video clip and you find your wife this is your doing you're the one who requested most likely you are the one who forced your wife to do it so this is totally prohibited secondly usually or on long distances when such video chats take place it 99.9% results in masturbation which is another sin so why call for such a thing a Muslim does not endanger the reputation and the chastity of his wife and a Muslim does not fall into sin red-handed willingly while knowing that this will be the result of such chatting analyze Oh gel knows best"
