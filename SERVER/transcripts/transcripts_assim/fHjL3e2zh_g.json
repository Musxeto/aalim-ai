  "transcript": "uh I have a question regarding no cost Emi so in my country what what is that interest I'll tell you what the process is so I have two options here in my country so if I go to a merchant and buy a product say the product price is, uh uh and uh I I have to pay in monthly installment so uh I paying in 10 installments 100 rupees per month and uh it is financed by a bank uh and whatever the interest is I have no idea it's a it's a deal between the bank and my Merchant so uh this is option a option b I have uh when I go to the merchant he tells me so the the price is 1,000 rupees uh if you're aving installment facility uh the bank will charge 100 rupees interest so that goes to 1,100 but uh we are giving you 100 rupees discount so it comes back to th000 rupees and we have we have to pay 100 monthly 100 rupes 10 monthly installments so in both the cases I'm paying the same amount and if I bu by giving the money I'm also paying the same am I'm just I wanted to know the okay first of all a you have to know that long distance calls the sound is not very great and if you have an accent that would and cause a great difficulty for me a difficulty for me to understand your question this is why I urge the people when they speak that they try their level best to speak clearly so that the words can be understood from what I understood from your question that you want to buy a product worth of ,000 rupes and there are two scenarios one scenario I did not understand the second scenario is that the bank charges 100 rupees interest but the seller gives you a discount so that what you actually are paying is 8,000 rupees the problem is that if you're dealing with a third party the third party is a bank and this is a conventional interest based riba bank they don't care about what you're buying or selling what they care is how to magnify the 1,000 rupees into more so a th000 rupees 100 uh 1100 rupees 1200 rupees the all all what they care about the is the interest so if you dealing and agreeing with the bank as a third party financing your transaction this is clear riba it is Haram if the seller himself has under the table agreement with the bank to finance such transactions and Deals and you as a buyer has nothing to do with the bank you're dealing directly with the seller in this case buying an installments is permissible with two conditions condition number one when I want to buy this mug from the seller he has to possess it and own it so when I go to buy it and negotiate the price he already has it in his possession so I'm buying something that he owns unlike when I buy it through the bank the bank is selling me something he does not possess in all what he's interested in money versus money here it's a product versus money so there's no loan involved condition number one the seller owns it and possesses it condition number two we negotiate the price the original cash price is 1,000 rupees the seller wants to sell it on installments for 2,000 Rupees I as a buyer I'm shocked 100% increase why the seller says you want it you can buy it you don't want it go away buy it somewhere else because I need it and I don't have the cash I agree with him and I say 2,000 is too much give me a discount blah blah blah he may give me a discount and goes down to, 1500 and he may not whatever the end result is as long as we come to a conclusion and an agreement that I will buy this product for 2,000 Rupees over the duration of X amounts of months and we sign a contract then this is permissible and valid providing that the final price is fixed and it cannot go one rupe up it cannot be increased and at the same time it can and must not have any late fee penalty because any increase over the last price agreed before signing the contract any increase would count as RBA these conditions fulfilled you're fine to go"
