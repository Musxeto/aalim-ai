  "transcript": "foreign so I checked my Purity on the seventh day even though usually I get pure on the 10th day but I was lazy to take to take it on the Eighth Day the father of the eighth day because I didn't think I was going to be pure amazing for since I there is a possibility that I was going to be pure even though I wasn't pure on the age day but I was lazy to check it because I didn't think I was going to be pure so if you were not pure on the Eighth Day what's the problem the problem is I was lazy to check for Fajr because maybe I was playing with my prayer if I was pure but you weren't so it's okay to I'm not sinful no you're not sinful you are sinful if the blood stops and you know that you have no Menses anymore no color discharge and still you did not go to check whether you're pure or not to pray but if the message is on but you have hesitance should I go and check or not and the norm is that on the 10th day you are pure you have no signs no indications or evidences to hint that you have become pure there is no sin at all in this"
