  "title": "What is a woman's awrah in front of other women? Is it from navel to the knees? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "nusrah from the u.s says that what is the aura of a woman in front of other women because she read on some websites that it is from the naval to the knees and this is a little bit preposterous with all due respect to such opinions does it mean that a woman can sit in front of other women topless of course not in cases of necessity when she's breastfeeding and something may appear without flashing her goods then there's nothing wrong in that because it was random it was unintentional but to just say that from the navel to the knee that is what should be covered in the rest is permissible no this is not true so what is the actual aura this is an issue of dispute scholars said that from the self they say whatever a woman adorns herself with jewelry these places can be shown so a woman wears a necklace so she's entitled to expose from the neck downwards not showing her cleavage she wears a bracelets and sometimes they wear these i don't know what they call them and it goes to the biceps maybe so the biceps are okay but to expose up to the whole shoulder no this is inappropriate the back itself is aura she's not supposed to wear them dresses that expose her back her knees are aura without any dispute but below the knees she may wear an anklet that goes up to uh um the cough or the middle of the leg which is okay so a maxi is permissible to wear but something that goes right to the knees or expose the knees when she sits this is not permissible and haram and the likes of course the hair in the face etc in front of other women or mahram is permissible and knows best see you"
