  "transcript": "foreign from Germany so my question is uh we know from a Hadith that it's not permissible for a woman to travel um but nowadays some people say that um that nowadays it is permissible because it's safer how should we respond to the to these people the response would be to ask them the one who said this Hadith was he talking out of his own whims and these and desires or was he talking according to the Revelation he received from Allah azzawajal they will definitely say of course not Allah says in the Quran it's merely a revelation revealed to him from Allah the prophet does not speak from his own whims and desires then we ask them again when the prophet said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah on the day of judgment to travel without a maharam didn't Allah know that it would be safer in the future or did Allah say in the Hadith or the prophet uh clarified in the Hadith that this is due to the dangers that a woman May face or the hardship that she may encounter the answer is no the prophet just put this statement of prohibition and did not elaborate which means that this statement is still valid till the end of time if we were to use our logic to refute verses from the Quran or from the Hadith we will fall in the same trap that Satan fell into when he refused to prostrate to Adam using his logic I am better than him I was created from fire Adam was created from clay so how and why would I prostrate so he defied a direct order from Allah with his logic and now these people are doing the same thing anyone could come and say Yes intoxicants were Haram at the time of the Prophet is because people used to get wasted and then go to the streets with their swords and kill one another or rape people nowadays alhamdulillah we are in the safety and the security of our own homes we lock ourselves up and we get wasted and nobody is harmed so it's okay and you can do this with so many things that are major sins in Islam Zina was Haram due to veneral diseases and the possibility of a woman being pregnant now we have condoms we are contraceptives we have medications we have uh antibiotics Etc what is this this is playing around with Sharia with the religion of Allah and those who try to counter the verses of the Quran the hadiths with their logic are most likely Hypocrites wanting to dismantle the religion they can't come and say no this is a lie this is a fabrication the religion is all bogus because people would not accept that so they try to dismantle the religion from underneath from the infrastructure by rejecting one Hadith after the other using their logic and trying to dilute the Sharia trying to make fun of the scholars and the people of religion and discredit them make them look silly make them look foolish so that the religion in people's hearts would be also discredited and tarnished may Allah protect us all [Music] um and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
