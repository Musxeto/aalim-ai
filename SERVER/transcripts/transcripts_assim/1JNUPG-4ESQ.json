  "transcript": "uh swadd from switzerland how are you i'm fine so i live far from my parents by myself since my separation with my ex-husband and i have cats when my parents visited me they didn't like the fact that i had cats but they knew about it i didn't hide it from them and my dad threatened me to either i had to throw the cats or uh he would uh stop reaching out to me or talking to me so what i did is that i gave up the cats but yani i didn't do anything haram so like i don't know like was my dad right to threaten me for cats i i don't know first of all unfortunately some parents push their children to be undutiful to be disobedient they push their children to fall in hellfire when they ask for things that are not logical now if the cats are not harming your son or daughter and they find comfort in having them as pets and when you know that the prophet allah is told us about cats roaming in the homes as being part of those who roam upon you and some of the companions like abu may allah be pleased with him had a pet cat so what's wrong in that why do you go overboard to such extreme and threaten your own child that you'll not be coming to visit unless she gets rid of such an animal without any legitimate reason yes if the father has allergy i can understand and if the girl is being harmed by having such a pet for any reason i can understand but if it's just because he doesn't like cats and simon says well like this is problematic some of the parents will be questioned on the day of judgment for their ill treatment of their children some parents think that they are free to do whatever they want their children are their own property they can sell them they can this uh throw them away they can do whatever they want this is not right nevertheless what you have done by trying to please your father and allocating a better place for your cat is something good inshallah and you'll not be sinful for that and allah knows best"
