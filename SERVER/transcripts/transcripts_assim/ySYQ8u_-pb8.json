  "title": "Playing Quran at a Military Parade instead of music permissible? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "taimou says in a military parade some countries while the soldiers are marching and they are displaying their tanks and their uh weapons and uh military power they play mu they play the quran instead of playing music this is not permissible why this is a mistake which is very common that people do so when they put you on hold in some companies you hear the quran randomly being recited and in the middle of the word or of the ayah when somebody picks up that whole call the ayah is interrupted and you did not understand when it began and when it ended this is disrespecting the quran because it is not placed and it's not put with the intention of people benefiting from it rather it is a substitute to music and this is not permissible yes you don't want to put music put any advertisement of the company put your corporate ad or corporate film or something that has no music it talks about your industry in military parades it's the same thing nobody's listening to the quran they're watching they're enjoying they're clapping they're talking they're commenting while the quran is in the background and this is disrespectful"
