  "title": "How is it fair that Allah will put those who did not hear about Islam in hell?",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi The question is, we know that Allah will give hidayah, will guide us for a certain way, we don't know, like a dream or maybe other person come to us and tell us. And we know there is people which live in Long Island or in other word we say inland tribe. So these people, they don't know about cars, about internet, they are so far away from modern society. Even they don't know about famous people like including you. When they die in the Judgment Day, what Allah is going to do about it? I mean, is Allah going to put them in the hellfire? If so, of course the Muslims said, your Lord is merciful. Why? Your Lord put them in the hell. We know that all of them, when they still alive on earth, they don't know about Islam at all. Nobody can oppose them because of many several reasons. One of them is when we try to oppose them, they think that we are enemies. Because like I told you earlier, they don't know about us. They are so far away from modern society. I hope you can get my question. Send them my videos. I don't have the technology. I understand the question. Because this question, I will ask it. I hope you can clear my doubt. I've been doing this for almost 23 years, answering questions on TV, live. So all of these questions have come to me and already inshallah, I'm not that old, I can remember. There is a hadith, which Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allah be at peace with him, and other scholars narrated to answer your question. These people are known to be Ahl al-Fatrah. Meaning that they are in the period, there's no messenger, there's no prophet. Allah will not punish them without having knowledge. Allah says in the Quran, وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ أَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا We will not torment a people until we send them a messenger. These people don't have messenger, so they will come on the Day of Judgment. And they say, Oh Allah, no messenger came to me. How would I know that you exist, you this, you that? This person will be tested on the Day of Judgment. Now imagine, resurrection. All humanity are there. Everything is clear. Angels, you see them. Jinn, you see them. Humans are all resurrected. You see hell, and you see paradise. Everything is clear. Now do you have any doubt on the Day of Judgment? No doubt. So when they say, Oh Allah, I didn't know. In this case, Allah says, Okay. Allah orders a, the hadith says, a neck. Something like a beast from hell to come. And Allah says, Enter it. The believer, he says, Okay, Allah ordered me to enter it. Bismillah. Because he believes now, he sees. The disbeliever will say, Ha ha. You want me to enter it, it will take him to hell. No, I'm not entering it. It will take him to hell. But those who enter it, it will take them directly to paradise. So their test will be on the Day of Judgment. Allah's name, the most merciful, the most forgiven. Allah will not punish people unjustly. So don't let shaitan whisper in your ears or head saying, How is this fair? Allah will put them in hell. No, Allah will not put them in hell. Without giving them a fair trial. I hope this answer is clear."
