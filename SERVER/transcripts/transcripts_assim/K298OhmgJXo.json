  "transcript": "Carlos from Ireland. Hi Sheikh. I'm new to Islam. I've just been watching stuff on YouTube and I've read the Quran. But how do I become a practicing Muslim? That's my question. Are you a Muslim, Carlos, or not yet? I want to become one. Okay. It's very simple and easy, Akhi. My friend, to become a Muslim, you don't have to go to a clergyman or to a priest who would give you his blessings. It's something between you and God. It's something between you and Allah. So the moment you embrace Islam, revert to it, and declare the testimony, the Shahada, with your tongue, verbally, and with full conviction in your heart, boom, you're a Muslim. That's it. There's no fireworks or anything to be done. Now I would advise you to go to the nearest Islamic center and tell them that you would like to accept Islam. They'll provide you with the literature to read, the procedure, and they will teach you how to say the Shahada. And I'll teach it to you right now online, or live, so you can say it. So you become a Muslim on the spot, just in case you die five minutes later, you will go to heaven. But till you go to the Islamic center, you won't be a Muslim until you say the Shahada and believe in it. You should say, أَشْهَدُ أَن لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَن مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ This translates to, I bear witness there is no God worthy of being worshipped other than Allah. And that Muhammad, peace be and blessing upon him, may be, and that Muhammad is his servant and messenger. That's it. If you want to know the transliteration of the Arabic testimony that I said, and the meaning of it, and the translation, you can go to www.islamqa.info or you can go to my website www.assimalhakeem.net and In Sha Allah you will find your answer."
