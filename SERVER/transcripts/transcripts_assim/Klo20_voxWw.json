  "title": "Must we Remove thick oil in hair for Ghusl assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fadila from India Sheikh you said that we don't have to remove the oil and hair in ghusl is it only for a little bit of oil or a lot of oil thick oil is okay as well? In ghusl one has to thoroughly wash his hair and scalp and ensure that the water has reached the scalp well because the Prophet did this with three scoops now if there is oil on the hair and this oil is by nature it floats over water and it's not grease it is not something that sticks to the hair rather it is something that can mix with the water and can allow water to penetrate and in most cases it is absorbed by the hair and the scalp and in this case yes washing the hair and rubbing your scalp would be sufficient whether it's thick or not and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best"
