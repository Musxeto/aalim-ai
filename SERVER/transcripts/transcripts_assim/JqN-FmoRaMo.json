  "transcript": "was here today what you know the brothers and sisters departed on the so many gay here is cream and after no more honest well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to contemporary Islamic issues and concepts on Hooda TV I'm your host our machine in this episode we will discuss the concept of Islamic Dawa or calling to Islam preaching to Islam so let's start off by welcoming our wonderful guest your hassan al Hakim us an erotic oh and welcome to the show why you can sit down but I hold a light like a - sure you know this episode is wonderful doing with you because you've been in the Dawa scene for so long most of your life you've been giving dowry the people so you can share with us so much experience that you have in this field in sha allah so let's start off with something very simple the importance of Dawa why is it important in Islam Salaam and Rahim and hamdulillah hello banana me or sallallahu send them over a car I have the URL Saudi he nabina muhammad in father joseph eh main Dawa in the very beginning is the call so you call someone and generally speaking if you believe in something you call others for it so if you are obsessed with music you're always calling others did you hear what Eminem said did you hear this song did you hear that and you give people DVDs and CDs and links and whatever is your obsession even if you are obsessed with diet and you see someone eating unhealthy food you can't stop yourself by saying okay this is there's so much cholesterol in this and the salt is this and sugar levels and you have to exercise and you say okay this is Maya can have to share with you because I love you so that one is calling others to what what you convinced off and it can be good and bad and those who give the hour are known to be Imams so any man is a leader and in this the Quran it's described that there two types of leaders leaders that guide you to hell and lead us to guide you to paradise so what is the importance of Tower every Muslim must take the Prophet arrest a lot of salaam as a role model there's no doubt in the mind of any Muslim you can not simply say yeah I'm a Muslim but I don't follow the route and and and in the path of the Prophet Isis I am because this should know you're a Muslim you have to comply Allah says in the Quran all say Muhammad in kuntum to hit born Allah if you claim that you love Allah fact a peony then follow me you know become Allah then would love you and then would forgive your sins so the condition is that you follow him sure what are you talking about why are you talking about this when we are asking you about the importance of Dawa this is what I'm getting to sure Allah says in the Quran all happy he said BD I do in Allah Idaho cer and our many turbine you are Subhan Allah woman an imino mushrikeen Allah says o Muhammad say this is my way what we are we talking about the way of Allah the way of Islam the way of the straight path definitely not the way of Sinatra so this is my way I invite on to Allah with sure knowledge so I invite to Allah I make that WA any kind of Dawa no it has to be with sure knowledge with vision with wisdom I and whosoever follows me so this means that the Dawa is not only isolated in the Prophet that is awesome it is also within those who follow him and to be followers of the Sunnah of the Prophet Isis and their for Dawa is an essential part of your life as a Muslim so this this directly leads me to my next question I had in mind which is is it mandatory for every single Muslim to give Dawa what if I'm a Muslim I pray my prayers I you know give my zakah i fast during the month of Ramadan I do all my five pillars whatever Allah subhana was gonna ask me for personally I do it right is it mandatory for me as an individual to give the hour to people or can I just live my life and do my five pillars and live isolated for example the problem is that people miss and and determined that is why such a question would rise because that were he is not only given sermons and lectures otherwise no one would be able to give down because those who are qualified to give sermons and lectures are maybe one in a million or less but that WA is to call people how would I call people you call people by inviting them with your speech but you also must call people by inviting them with your actions and usually this is more influential than preaching because we have so many preachers saying what they do not do so at the end of the day you will not have your children obey what you tell them to do when you yourself not walking the talk if you smoke and you tell your children don't smoke smoke kills you they have okay definitely not listen to you because he tells us things and he doesn't do them so Allah religion when he says to us women say no : me manda illallah muhammadan sorry hon were called in any male Muslim is the verb or the word woman accent : is interpreted as there is no one better in rhetoric than that who calls to Allah one does righteous deeds to and proclaims that he is among the Muslims so you may invite to Allah a soldier that's good but there's a possibility that you don't walk the talk so you don't do righteous deeds then your invitation and call would not be accepted so you have to invite to Allah you have to do good deeds but you have to also proclaim that I'm a Muslim some of us call to Allah by enjoining good and virtue forbidding evil ahee or friend or John or Tom do not drink intoxicants this is harmful this is bad so masha'Allah you're calling to goodness and you yourself do not drink but you are happy to proclaim and to show them that you're a Muslim because you're afraid they may call you a terrorist etc so this is the type of Dawa that every single Muslim is obliged to do not only by verbally inviting people but by acting like a Muslim behaving like a Muslim once I was with a friend in a foreign country and the driver was taking us somewhere so he was talking to me in Arabic and I realized that this is not correct because the Prophet is a lot of sunset when there are three of you two must not speak in secret in the presence of a third because this depresses him and the driver did not know Arabic so I sought permission from the driver and said my friend we're Arabs and you don't understand Arabic so do you permit us to speak the guy was shocked why are you asking me this nobody ever is this question I said because in my religion it is prohibited for two speak in isolation while the third is present does not know what they're talking maybe they're talking against him or plotting against him he says no no mister go ahead and speak in your own language I have no problem with that and I bet you I had that bet because betting is hahaha yeah you know try to find a way out for it but as a figure of speech I bet you that this left great impact on him about Islam so if we manage to do this not directly whoever you meet in the street here you have to embrace Islam you do you accept Islam you believe in a lot nobody accepts this kind of rhetoric just from day one you need a lot of preparation so that way is very wide aspect of it okay so I mean just from your last answer I've gathered many questions that I want to ask you so let's start one by one so one thing that you mentioned was that a person who's inviting to allah subhanho wa taala needs to also you know conduct these actions such as a father who's telling his child don't smoke but he smokes himself he's not going to be taken seriously so just quickly going over what should a person do in terms of say for example he sees somebody doing evil and he wants to invite him to Islam he went to town this don't do this brother don't drink this acaba he himself does this bad deed shitty in this situation do it or not well we've mentioned this I think in a previous program about enjoining virtue forbidding evil and we said that each individual has four obligations upon him one two enjoying virtue to call people to do good to to him for himself to do good so calling people and doing people but you call people to are two different things thirdly to forbid evil so don't smoke don't drink don't lie don't cheat don't backbite fourthly not to do this yourself to refrain from it so this means that if I see someone doing something evil but I'm at the same time doing it myself this is not an excuse for me not to forbid evil no I have to even if I'm doing it myself but definitely the higher level would be to forbid people from doing evil and to refrain myself from doing it so the father who smokes if he sees his kid smoking it would be insane for him to say son you want to smoke hmm because smokes no he has to tell him son you're not permitted to smoke it's Haram it's harmful I am wrong but I'm sinful pray for me that I quit as well and as a matter of fact being a good father Carlos I quit this is the highest level of course but it doesn't mean that if you fail in one aspect you thank you for that wonderful categorization of you know just because a person is not doing one action or one aspect that's required from him doesn't mean that he does not do the other we're gonna get into the forms of love before for a short break so stay tuned Oh welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break we were discussing the concept of Dawa share we've covered a few questions before the break and we said that we were going to get into the forms of Dawa now I know there's thousands of forms of Dawa but we just want to cover some of the major forms in a general sense if we can say inshallah well I don't know of these different forms to be accept whether it's verbal or by your actions now verbally you can do this through direct Dawa and this depends on the recipient so when people come to you asking you for advice you can give them Dawa because they're susceptible they're ready to take it sometimes you go to someone who is not ready to take it and you try to convince him like the Prophet as I'm used to do with the idol worshippers so this is also acceptable definitely because it was done by a prophet Aristotle saram sometimes you need to divert to indirect Dawa especially when someone is not going to take or accept what you are giving him and this happens in the case of those who are superior to you so if you're a subordinate of someone if you are a son of someone if you're younger than the elders giving them straight down sometimes may not be acceptable to them so it would be advisable to do it indirectly a lot of the times sisters ask my husband does this my husband does that he does not pray on time he doesn't go to Masjid it isn't wake up for Fajr and every time I speak to him he's frustrated outraged he's angry and he doesn't want me to preach him and this is unfortunately normal because men think that they're far superior than women and they would not accept women to advise them so what to do should I seek divorce should I give him color this is way too extreme it's like killing a mosquito with a cannon take your time give your Dawa change the main means of the hour sometimes if you ask or tell someone directly and if he doesn't accept this change the methodologies they change your strategy sometimes when we feed our children eat this so no I don't want to eat this and he's stubborn so you change this strategy by saying to him next time I don't want you to touch this you can eat anything else but don't touch this then he's encouraged out of curiosity to see what is wrong and he may eat it so with your husband you should change and try the indirect way so tell your husband that a story for example a friend of ours her husband died because he was playing on his laptop or watching inappropriate material and he missed fire and he died subhanAllah something of this sort that may have something tick or open his heart without you knowing it throwing series from the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam here and there giving a hadith giving an ayah this kind of atmosphere though it's indirect but it is definitely means of verbal Dawa now part of the verbal Dawa is writing because this is something that is verbal nobody's looking at my actions so if you use the internet if you use the social media which is used in 90% evil utilize the 10% into something that is good giving that one again direct or indirect posting stories of the Prophet I'm giving proper knowledge giving reminders giving real-life stories that people would benefit from whether on Facebook Twitter or snapshot in the gram the whole nine yards you can do this and gain a lot of reward through it because you're calling people to Islam and you never know if it's like throwing seeds on in an open field you throw but the one who grows it is allah azza wajal and tomb ezra una who i'm never that your own when you plow and you throw the seeds allah says is it you who make it grow or is the large that was you it definitely is Allah so Dawa is related in this sense of exerting the effort doing your best in calling people to Allah and then we can look at the data through your deeds and actions now through these and actions the sky's the limit your behavior the way you talk the way you address the way you communicate with others this is all called Dawa now you can make that wa even by having yourself killed imagine that to have yourself killed can be a form of that wa those who know the story of abdullah al Ghulam which you will find in Surat al brooch the man or the boy who found a lot of almighty and believed in him he was tortured to reject his religion the sorcerer that worked with the King was executed because he believed in Allah through that boy the priest whom the boy learned from was executed when the King tried to execute this boy through throwing him from a high riser from a mountain and failed throw through drowning him the ocean and failed the boy said you will not be able to kill me until you put me and tie me to a tree take an arrow and take my my bow and you shoot me right in the torso so the but before you do so you have to say bismillah bill Willam you have to announce it publicly and this has to be in front of all the people of the town so I'm assuming that the the king by now is extremely frustrated I mean he's giving in to the boys demands you know is it is it because the boys preaching a new religion what's going on here the origin of the hadith which was narrated by Muslim the Prophet tells us that this King used to call the people to worship him so everyone in town was actually worshiping the king so the boy came to give Dawa and he tried to give Dawa to the sorcerer and to the priest who him was his teacher to begin with and hanged Allah the sorcerer accepted Islam and he gave the hour to the people and some of them accepted Islam so that's that the king was afraid that if this spreads people would not worship him anymore so he tried to kill him as mentioned earlier through drowning him through throwing him from a mountain and those who took him there died instead and he came walking back to the king he didn't flee he didn't run away because he's doing this for Allah the king was frustrated to the extent that he would he was going to accept any proposal just to get rid of this boy regardless of the consequences so the boy thought of the best way of giving math Dawa to the people so he told the king you will never be able to kill me unless you do as I say gather the people of the village in one place the people of the town take an arrow from my own and put it in my bow and my bow and before shooting me in the torso say bismillah heard below them in the name of Allah the lord of the of the boy so the king did exactly i stoled and once he shot him saying this statement and the boy died all the people of the town said if our King whom we think he's the Lord to be worshiped said this this means that the boy is on the right path and that we should worship Allah and the all embraced Islam and defines to the Kings or in opposition to the Kings intent and this shows that that WA is not limited only by writing and calling directly people verbally but also by your actions now a question that might pop in to many of the viewers minds is that well if that WA comes in the form of action and I act upon what the Prophet SAW I thought I must taught us and this shows other people that are not Muslims or that might be Muslims and not practicing that you know what this is the correct way look at his manners look at the way he interacts with people what about the exact opposite what if I behaved in a rude manner and something for example it doesn't even have to be Haram but something that pushes people away from Islam is this Islam is this are you responsible for this type of negative Dawa definitely you are because when a person does something that repels people away from Islam he's sinful and he'll get the same amount of sins due to his actions allah awj says in the quran and we made them leaders who invite people to the fire so there are there are imams and leaders who invite to paradise and there are those who invite to fire and the Prophet SM was so many times outraged by the actions of his own companions who done what they had done out who did what they had done out of good intent so for example Mahad in Japan praying Isha prayer leading his people but prolonging the salat so long that people left the prayer now the Prophet said I'm got outraged when he heard this and said F at 10:00 on an tamarod are you the person or the type of person who repels people away from Islam don't do that who do you pray alone prolong it as much as you want but when you lead people you are going to leave an impact this is a negative dower on the people so what you do is always being scrutinized as a Muslim so you should always not care about what people say about you but what about what people say about Islam so if I do something wrong people would not say Oh Sheikh Hassan did something wrong they would say the die the scholar the student of knowledge did this this is a representation of Islam and that is why those who do terrorist acts and claim that this is Islam that they're doing they are the most sinful of all and that is why the Prophet described that a his salat wa sallam harshly but truly and the Prophet is never harsh he is the mercy sent to mankind he he described them as being the hounds of hell and why would he say such a thing because they repelled and distract people from Islam and from going to paradise thank you very much aware concluding this episode inshallah we're gonna continue a part 2 for this episode because we still have to cover the responsibilities of a Dalia and the characteristics of a dolly inshallah and we'll save that for next time so once again thank you very much dear viewers I hope you benefited from today's episode join us again so we can continue this conversation and inshallah delve into some of the details of how a diary should be so until then may Allah subhana WA Ta'ala bless us all assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wa barakaatuh Oh Muhammad's on the long wale you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sony
