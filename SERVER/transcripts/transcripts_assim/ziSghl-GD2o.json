  "transcript": "people who are like me are capable to talk and teach people this is one way of making tawa other people may not have this blessing of allah azzawajal they don't have the ability to preach people but they are able to write so masha'allah they compile and they write articles about islam and it's very strong and solid and authentic but they when they talk they are hesitant other people don't have the knowledge but masha'allah they can do the support services so they can for example print books they are very enthusiastic and very energetic when it comes to distributing pamphlets and tapes they have the ability to stand in a corner on a stool or a table and distributing dawah books for people asking other people don't have this or that but they are very good in business you give them one euro in a month time they change it or invest it to become a hundred euro so these people definitely will help dawah more by dedicating themselves to providing for dawah financially because i cannot make dawah if i don't have money people cannot print books without money people cannot invite others to conferences without money so finance is very important others don't have money don't have knowledge but they have computer knowledge so they say okay i will devote myself to benefiting the ummah by making a website by supervising a website by having a mailing list where every single day i distribute hundreds and thousands of emails for sisters and brothers inviting them to islam or clarifying a doubt or so that way is different but the most easiest to in my uh opinion and most effective is when you make dawah by practice so when you are actually walking the talk when you actually are doing what you're saying doing what you're preaching so you don't lie you don't cheat you don't abuse people you're honest you're always on time you don't beg others for money you don't cheat on your working hours with your wife your excellent your moral conduct is above uh average level masha'allah you give you have night prayer you fast voluntary mondays and thursdays and you do things that normal people don't do for the sake of allah azza by doing what you're doing when people see you they acknowledge that this is a diary even if you don't have a lot of knowledge but just simply because you are walking the talk you uh are honest you're kind you're generous this means that you are offering dawah even if you don't open your mouth and allah"
