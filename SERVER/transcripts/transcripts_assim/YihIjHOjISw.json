  "title": "Fortress Of Muslim 54 Dua before after eating. Drink Milk Guest to host Dua for 1 who serves U Assim",
  "transcript": "oh the following chapter deals with something that we do every single day and that is eating so imagine islam governs what you say before you eat and we don't have grace or we don't say grace as some religions do but before you eat anything before you drink anything hadith 178 when you are about to eat you should say either bismillah in the name of allah and we've talked about this before we say bismillah before doing almost everything so this is what blesses your food what happens if one were to forget the hadith goes and if you forget to say it before starting then you should say when you remember bismillahifi in the name of allah in its beginning and end and the prophet alaihissalam once saw a man eating he did not say bismillah and just before the last morsel he remembered and he said and he ate it and the prophet laughed so the companions asked him why are you laughing he said satan was eating with him and the moment he said bismillah at the very end of his food he vomited all of that and this is something we cannot see we do not see devils and and we cannot see satan but we believe that the prophet told us as some when we do not say bismillah that the devils eat with us and share with us the food which means that the blessing of the food is gone and that we are nourishing them and making them stronger hadith 17 9 whomever allah feeds should say okay the food is from allah azzawajal so when i eat i should be grateful and show my gratitude to allah azzawajal and i should say this is normal food not milk what's the difference well i'll come to say to you the difference what does this do i mean o allah bless it for us and feed us better than it now this is normal food okay then what about if it is milk if it is milk then you should say o allah bless it for us and give us more of it so normal food you ask allah for something that is better than it with milk you ask allah to grant you more of it and why is that well because milk is one of the full foods that is easy to obtain but it has everything nutritious in it it's almost full of food whole food so dates and milk in islam has a lot of value for us in it normal food grant us better than it milk grant us more of it because it is something that is beneficial and what to do after finishing the food chapter 70 upon completing the meal this is what you should say and by the way i'm reading the translation because you've already heard the arabic text you must memorize the arabic text why because this is a form of ibaadah and you have to say it if you can memorize it in arabic like the fatiha in prayer you don't say allah is greatest you have to say allahu akbar you don't say praise be to allah the lord of the worlds you say alhamdulillah you have to read the arabic in dua if you are capable of memorizing it so this is why we're translating it so it would make it easy for you to understand what you are repeating in arabic what to say after finishing a meal alhamdulillah all praises for allah who fed me this and provided it for me without any might nor power from myself big meal delicious my wife spent three hours cooking it after finishing i acknowledge that this is from allah alone and that i could not have been able to collect and get this without allah facilitating it for me another dua hadith number 100 and 81 the prophet used to say alhamdulillah mubarak [Music] be praised with an abundant beautiful blessed praise an ever-ending praise a praise which we will never bid farewell to and an indispensable praise he is our lord we cannot praise allah enough yet this is the best we can do and this is why we say this dua we acknowledge and we hope that this is not the last time we say this beautiful dua what about if i were to dine at some people's house what should i say chapter 71 supplication of the guest for the host so you invite me i come to your home i eat after i eat i supplicate and i say allah very clever bless for them that which you have provided them forgive them and have mercy upon them this throws a lot of comfort in their hearts after serving this food and paying so much money and putting effort into it when you make this dua for them and what do you say when someone serves you chapter 72 supplication said to the one offering a drink or to the one who intended to do that this is the beautiful dua that you say to him oh allah feed him who fed me and provide with drink him who provided me with drink so whenever someone serves you a cup of coffee or tea you say provide him with drink who provided me with the drink if he gives you food at allahuma and this is the sunnah of the prophet wasallam this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave [Music] foreign"
