  "title": "Giving Dawah, Speaking Without Knowledge & Narrating a Hadith In One's Own Words? Assim AlHakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "so hey from malaysia yes sir um and his curses on the the ones that conceal the revolution so my question is if i have a chance if i have a chance to stop people from buddha especially from my family and i try to use some some some some what is it okay i i know the the the i'm forgetting okay i don't know the exact hadith or i don't know the exact ayah but i know the lesson from it so i say it for the benefit but then i'm doubtful whether i'm quoting it correctly or not but i have an opportunity to cut a bitter so what what should i do in this scenario first of all it is not permissible for you to talk without knowledge if you don't know simply don't talk as for not knowing the hadith exactly but know the meaning some scholars say it's permissible to narrate a hadith by mentioning the meaning in general not specifically specifically as it was said by the prophet but the problem is that when you remember or you think you remember and hadith does not exist this is problematic so if this is frequent you have to stop gain more knowledge be more authentic in what you say and if you make a mistake every now and then alhamdulillah yeah this is forgiven because this is not the norm but if you make 9 mistakes out of 10 then this is a problem you should stop and allah azza knows best you"
