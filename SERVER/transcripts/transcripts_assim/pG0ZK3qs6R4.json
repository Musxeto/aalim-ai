  "title": "Can I pray behind a person who is an Innovator? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s uh my question is uh with the place i live so the masjid i usually go i noticed uh imam actually you know after the prayer he made dua by raising hands then uh during announcement for ramadan he recites the dua for uh what is it called rajab then what he said it is an innovation and also they are announcing for ramadan there will be five odd nights which we know like it could be any day of the last 10 nights so in my belief they are following some innovation so my question is uh will i be sinful or will that affect my prayer if i pray behind that imam okay i will answer inshallah muhammad from the u.s he says should i pray behind someone who commits innovation this is generic muhammad because any person who's a muslim and his prayer is valid at the sight of allah for himself then his prayer as an imam is valid for me to pray behind him and innovation is divided into two types innovation that takes someone out of the fold of islam so if someone uh um does not believe in the beautiful names and uh attributes of allah if someone talks ill about something in islam if someone doesn't believe in the torment of the grave or in the sirat types of shirk all of these are innovations if he believes that you can invoke the dead in their graves and ask them for help and assistant this is shirk so sit such an innovation takes a person out of the fold of islam and you cannot pray behind him but if the innovation is making congregational dua after salah throwing a mole it to the prophet without any or the likes of what you had mentioned then prayer behind them is valid but it is not recommended"
