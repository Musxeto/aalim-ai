  "title": "Giving the Athaan on RoofTops at 10pm to seek cure for Coronavirus? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question for today and I've as you have noticed we've changed from the evening between Mahadev and aja Mecca time to two o'clock till three o'clock p.m. Mecca time because of the curfew so Isis says in Pakistan many scholars advise to give a van in mosques and from rooftops together from 10:00 p.m. onwards so that Allah will cure and uplift the coronavirus they say they will continue this every day until the disease ends they used a hadith regarding this which says Allah uplifts punishment from places where the Adan is given is this hadith and action correct well first of all the hadith is not authentic it is very weak so it is not permissible to implement it second of all any young student of FIP if you ask him define the a van for me he would say then is a collection of phrases prescribed by Sharia that is said by the more Advan to notify that the time of prayer is due and this is only given for the five daily prayers so we don't give the event for it we don't give the event for prayers of rain and we don't give the add-on for Salah cliffs etc only for the five daily prayers now if this is the case how would you justify the action of the people of Pakistan India Bangladesh asking the people to come at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock p.m. when they have prayed Asia and just call the athan those who wake up think it's fair not knowing that this is an innovation they're bringing so is this or does this have any basis in Islam if you go back to the Quran and the Sunnah you will not find anything related to this in the Quran or in the Sunnah but if you look in the books of schools of thought you will find that the Shafi school of thought were the most in promoting this so they say you can give a van when a newborn is born and if someone is depressed and if someone is travelling you give a tan while he's leaving at the time of fire when there are je armies about to fight when there are Jin spreading around when you lose your direction while traveling when a person has seizure when a person is angry Subhan Allah when when they put a deceased corpse in the grave because they give a Dan in the ear when he comes so they give another and then when he leaves this world what is this all of this has no basis to it in Islam at all the Maliki school of thought said all of this is bida all of this is innovation it's not based on the Quran nor on the Sunnah the only excuse that we can find for them is that Omar may Allah be pleased with him said that when you feel that there are lots of devils and demons around you give a damn and this is a narration that was made hassan by al half of the Minnehaha i don't know what other scholars said about it but being made hasson doesn't give it full authenticity unless it was authenticated by other amounts but even if it is authentic this is the opinion of Omar may Allah be pleased with him not of the Prophet our s-salatu sir and some would say that the hadith of the Prophet Alice Aslam when he said that whenever the Methvin is giving the van the devil's run away farting because of the event so this might might help if someone is in the wilderness and he's afraid of the Djinn that he gives the other and though this hadith clearly states that the devil is running away from the call of prayer when done in the Masjid not in normal cases when it's not time for prayer but even though this is not a strong way of utilizing this evidence so in short what the people are doing in Pakistan what they are calling people to go on rooftops and call the Adhan this is totally baseless this has no foundation in Islam one none whatsoever it is like when the French invaded Egypt the scholars there said let's gather in the Masjid and read in sahih al-bukhari because it's a blessing it's a blessing but it will not help defend your country you have to go pick up arms and fight in the cause of Allah they sat in their messages they conquered Egypt they overtook the whole country and Bihari did not help them so you have to help yourself confine yourselves to your homes try to wash your hands stay from physical contact quarantine yourself and inshallah this all would wither away with the grace of Allah"
