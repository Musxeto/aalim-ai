  "title": "What to say to someone who justifies his sins by claiming actions are judged by intentions",
  "transcript": "The next question is what can we tell someone who justifies his sins by saying that actions are judged by intentions and they use this every time to get out of it as if it's a diagnomical regard? Immediately slap him as strong as you can on his face and when he's shocked and say what did you do this my intention was to wake you up if he's going to accept this alhamdulillah will he he will try to get even why are you doing this my intention was good said yes but your action was definitely not good alhamdulillah in islam we judge by both when interpreting to test you who is among you the best in deeds what kind of best in deeds those though that are pure and sincere to allah and that collaborate with the sunnah so if you do something that does not collaborate with the sunnah even if your intention is good you are sinful i see a beautiful blonde she's a bombshell i approach her and i said your father must be a terrorist she says why because you're a bombshell so i said to her let's go for dinner and i give her dawah hey sheikh what are you doing wallahi my intention is to give her dawah is this acceptable will you guys say no of course not well i thought you were naughty naughty sheikh not naughty professor what are you doing so the intention has to coincide and be in sync with the action one of them is wrong the whole action is bad you pray like the prophet islam your intention is not for allah it is void your intention is for the sake of allah but you innovate a new religion a new thing it is void it has to be two together and allah knows best"
