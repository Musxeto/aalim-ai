  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, last time the question I asked, you said that if you think such and such is valid. After that I was wanting to ask that sometimes in my sujood and sometimes anytime in the salah, I get distracted, I forget which part of salah I am currently in and it happens a lot to me. So, is that always really valid for me or am I thinking too much? I don't know Akhi, this is something you have to decide for yourself. Again, I am not here to hold people's hands like children and drag them to the toilet or to the kitchen and to help them eat and drink. I give you guidelines. You are in salah. Every single salah you keep on forgetting and not knowing whether this is dhuhr or asr, whether this is ruku or sujood. You need to see a psychiatrist. You have a mental illness. Nobody is confused like this. Because later on in the day you may go and face the mirror and say, who am I? Or what am I? And this is not normal. People who are confused whether this is the third rak'ah or the fourth rak'ah and they often get this once or more a day. This is shaytan messing up with their heads. Ignore it and act upon your gut feeling because most likely your gut feeling is that it's the fourth rak'ah, it's the final rak'ah. I know, but wallah I don't know, maybe this, maybe that. This is from shaytan. People who get this once every blue moon, this is normal. The prophet said, alayhis salam, whenever you pray and you're confused whether you prayed three or four rak'ahs, cast the doubt. What is the doubt? Three is certain. The fourth is doubtful, whether I prayed three or four. No, three is definitely certain and fourth is the doubt. So these are the cases and Allah knows best."
