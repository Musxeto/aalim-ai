  "transcript": "um as per the Hadith the one who maintains reciting aat after every F prayer nothing will prevent him or her from entering Paradise in the case of men stating women how should this Hadith be followed okay this Hadith relates to those who pray those who are Exempted from prayer like women in their Menses are not included in being sinful so this six or seven days they are Exempted from it and what counts are the days they pray in as long as they pray their five times a day and they recite aat afterwards they're included in the Hadith when they have their excuse they're Exempted and forgiven and they're not held accountable for that and Allah Knows Best"
