  "title": "Are Taliban true representatives of Islam, can we judge a whole religion by a particular group?",
  "transcript": "sam from canada hey uh i need to provide some clarity on this um when it comes to islam you know some people they may not have a proper idea of it and they refer to like you know for example talibans right they may say that these are the ones who are representing islam so i don't want to learn about islam and you know as far as talibans you know they usually like they uh tell the women to dress up or to you know cover yourself and all that so i'm just wondering like when you hear talabas right are they like true representatives of islam are these people that really you know are steadfast or on the dean are they just like people that you know distract or misrepresent islam i don't know anything about them except what the media shows us cnn fox bbc and the secular arab uh news agencies which definitely they would have hidden agendas like uh uh mountains so i don't believe what they say because i know that they're blatant liars they make they're living out of lying i can see their islamophobe i can see their lies about islam or anything that's related to salafia or to islam or akida or tawheed and how they would like to make any muslim a criminal by default so i don't have any crystal clear idea about this group what i know is that you cannot represent a religion by a particular group and judge that religion from that group i wouldn't go to north and south ireland and see the fighting between them and say that oh christianity is a religion of violence i wouldn't go to uh judge people by the actions of the follow a religion and judge a religion by the actions of the followers i would judge the religion by their sources so you want to judge my religion as islam look at the quran look at the sunnah and look at the vast majority of muslims worldwide don't come to a minority and say that they represent islam because they do not you"
