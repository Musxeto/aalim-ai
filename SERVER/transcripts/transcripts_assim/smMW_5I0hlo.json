  "title": "Our negligence towards Allah - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you praise Allah and glorify him till the day you die you've not done your due diligence and your duty towards Allah Allah is more deserving than what we offer yet we're so ignorant negligent that we think that this is our right When We complain blasphemously Allah did not answer my Dua Allah deprived me from what I deserve I deserve more than this why is he giving Tom Dick and Harry so many things and not giving it to me subhanallah I remember once I visited an uncle may Allah have mercy on his soul a dear Uncle to me and he used to pray every five prayers in the Masjid and he was like in his mid 70s and he fell ill so I went to visit him so I said Uncle how do you feel and he said alhamdulillah all praise be to Allah I'm um okay I'm fine however the only thing that bugs me is that I've been praying for Allah azzawajal or I've been praying to Allah for the past 50 years and look how sick I am while my neighbor had never entered the Masjid in his life I've never seen him in the Masjid for the past 50 years and he is as strong as a bull so the uncle a time of distress instead of turning to Allah praising him for his endless gifts and blessings and favors he's complaining and he's comparing and he's objecting to Allah's rulings may Allah give us a good ending therefore we are negligent we are ignorant when we ask Allah we ask for the one thing that we think is missing money oh Allah pay off my debts Allah increase my income oh Allah help me build my third Mansion o by my fourth uh uh Bugatti or do this or do that and then we're out of requests why because we take everything that we have for granted you have good health masha'allah yeah so what everybody has good health ah so you think that it is something that you deserve to have the blessing of sight to be able to hear to be able to speak to be able to walk straight to have good legs good knees a good back to be able to breathe now it amidst the people with covet 19. may Allah protect us all so you take these things out for granted do you have food and and beverages of course I have like five meals a day breakfast lunch brunch snacks dinner Etc and I have storage of like six months to a year this is normal well why are you asking masha'allah do you have a roof on top of your head of course do you think I'm a refugee do you have a car I have three cars I have children I have bank accounts I have everything man why are you asking these stupid questions because you're not grateful to Allah azzawajal for giving you these things and this is why you don't thank him you don't express your gratitude to him and when it comes to asking Allah azzawajal you want more have you ever thought when you raise your hands to make Dua to ask Allah for forgiveness yeah of course Allah forgive me then you move on when you say Allah forgive me do you contemplate upon the things that you want forgiveness for the sins that you've committed when you looked at something Haram when you heard something Haram when you said something Haram backbiting making fun of others lying when you say oh Allah forgive me in less than a second do you remember how many prayers you came late to or let me rephrase how many prayers you've skipped from praying in the Masjid oh I don't pray in the message to begin with I pray home on time Masha Allah and you know that praying in the Masjid is mandatory for a man and the prophet almost burnt the houses of those who do not perform prayer with him in congregation and you're proud of praying home like women and elderly and children do you contemplate when you say oh Allah forgive me the number of times you cheated people you broke your promise you held a grudge against someone times you did not pay your dues on time you thought that you fooled someone in a transaction which won you few dollars here or there yet you think that you're smart there are so many things that we do during the day and night being unfair with our spouses being rude being disrespectful raising our voices against our parents looking them straight in the eye when they're talking to us showing them our resentment from what they are saying sivering our kinship not helping the poor and the needy hoarding money do you ever when you say for Allah recall any of these things when you make Dua do you ever say o Allah grant me beneficial knowledge that allows me to worship you so that you're pleased with me do you ask Allah to cleanse your heart from hatred enmity Envy grudges and all other illnesses and then you tell me I don't have anything to ask Allah for you have so many things to ask Allah for but because you are negligent you're ignorant if I give you an A4 piece of paper and I ask you to write the beautiful names of Allah and his attributes you won't be able to Cross or to pass two lines because you don't know foreign foreign but if I ask you to write to me the Blockbusters of 2019. or the top 10 songs or the most highly paid actors and actresses or the prices of gold over the past three months the Stock Exchange Market if I ask you about the types of cars that can do 0 to 60 in less than three seconds you'll be able to write a lot because this is your Dunya this is your life this is where you think that you are born in and that you live forever if I ask you to describe Jannah Paradise which you are about to leave and go to insha Allah you and I do you find that you have no knowledge at all if I were to travel may Allah uplift the travel ban they've canceled two courses one in Kuala Lumpur and one Nairobi next week Easter it's canceled we're in a curfew this is what Allah pre-ordained so it's definitely the best but as humans we miss these trips that were meeting people preaching if I were to go and travel to a country I do my due diligence and my research I know their currencies I know their capital City I know what's the weather gonna be for the next three weeks where are the tourism sightseeing places what's the best restaurants to go and eat how to get in and how to get out clean what to buy what to look for and I do this religiously so that I would spend quality time when it comes to Jannah do you know the ten heaven-bound Companions of the Prophet that is that you would be honored to be with and to meet nope do you know any of the companions of the Prophet Sam yeah like a man or two subhanallah"
