  "transcript": "god from bangladesh  my question is is saying anything with amin is an innovation for examples is a word that is said which with the meaning of o allah accept or o allah answer so if you add something to it this is not from the sunnah but if it's something appropriate such as glorifying allah azzawajal that should be okay insha'allah as in the case when we say so we are describing allah azza we are praising allah and glorifying him with this addition therefore it's not what the prophet said allah but it is not an innovation because it is appropriate now to say like many people i've heard before when you say may allah forgive us all he says where is this coming from i mean from i mean this is not from the sunnah why not i mean this is something that people catch up from others and parrot without knowing the origin of it or the reason for saying it so it's best to avoid saying these things and las vegas best you"
