  "transcript": "our man says people in the subcontinent say that it is prohibited to cut hair and nails on tuesdays and after maghrib is this true of course it is not true any person claiming that such a thing is prohibited he's obliged to provide us with the evidence from the quran or from the sunnah of the prophet sam that is authentic and this is the beauty of islam i cannot come to you and say by the way it is prohibited to wear glasses on a saturday because a saturday is the day of the jews and this holiday of the jews must not be taken seriously so you have to take off your glasses sounds logical sounds legit i can't say anything like this because any tom dick or harry can challenge me and say listen with all due respect we're muslims if you don't provide us with the quran and the sunnah or from the favor the three favorite generations interpreting it and stating it i will not accept it which is totally legit therefore we don't have monks or priests we don't have popes in islam that say you have to do this why don't ask you have to do it and that's it everything is cleared and it for the muslims from eastern to the west rich or poor educated or literate to understand this religion that is for all you"
