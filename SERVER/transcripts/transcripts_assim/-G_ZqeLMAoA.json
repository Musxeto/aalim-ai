  "transcript": "Z from Kashmir sh I have usually seen so many contradictions to your FAS regarding from my so whenever I get confused I always get to see some references that go against the authentic Hadith in the hanafi text such as the M OFA and sunal kubra and some other books I want to know the authenticity of these books whether they are authentic or not because they always seem to contradict the authentic in the these these ABD ABD these have authentic and weak narrations so you cannot paint them with the same brush you have to be a scholar of Hadith and to filter each and every Hadith by studying the narration and going back to the students and uh to the scholars of Hadith who would filter it for you and you cannot depend on such books while ignoring theah and the Sun as well"
