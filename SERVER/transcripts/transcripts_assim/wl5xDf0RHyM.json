  "transcript": "one question that recently my son passed away and some people think that Jin poses with him that's the reason he made a suicide so my question to you is that is this possibility that Jadu or kill Jin possess the suicide by them themselves first of all what the people say is totally out of order such people are not known to be knowledgeable they're not known to be Scholars of Islam they're not known to be Physicians or doctors or scientists most likely they don't even know how to do things on their own so all what they're doing is filling your heart with despair making you more depressed and sad as if it's not enough that your own beloved Son committed suicide this by itself is a crisis is a calamity is something that breaks anyone's heart let let alone a mother secondly what is done is done and what's in the past remains in the past nothing on Earth we could do that it would reverse it the only thing that we have control of is to depend rely and have total confidence in Allah's mercy and forgiveness this is the only thing that you can hang on and clinge to so keep on asking Allah for forgiveness keep on asking Allah to have mercy on your son and trust that Allah is the most forgiving most merciful whatever caused your son to commit suicide whether it was Jin possession black magic mental illness or meere weakness it is to Allah the most merciful to deal with it so leave it with someone you trust that is more merciful to your son than you to your own blood flesh and blood and may Allah Grant him rahma and forgiveness"
