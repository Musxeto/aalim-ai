  "title": "He leaves the house cuz wife celebrates birthdays! Men take charge of your household assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "now my question revolved around um that during celebration in Islam so I have a brother who is a practicing Muslim and he made it known to his family that he doesn't celebrate the Day and he tried to teach his kids this um part of Islamic uh teachings however his wife his resistance to the message and sort of uh sometimes argue with him but the point of this question is that the wife celebrated birthday hugely for the children recently and the brother decided not to participate by leaving home the way the birthday was done on a Saturday but the brother left home on a Friday with the intention to go back home on a Sunday because it doesn't want to participate and be there however this is causing a sort of a bad biting and slandering towards this brother is taking Islam to extreme and the prophet did not forbade us from doing that day so the brother is like very confident in what he did we just made a sort of guidance from people like you to understand better that what he has done is it right or is it wrong for not participating and collaborating with his wife in this birthday celebration for the kids first of all Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe protect yourselves and your family your household your wives and your children from Hell Fire so this is an instruction in order an obligation that the guardian of the house the man has to protect his women folk and children from whatever may lead them to Hellfire secondly celebrating such feasts and events is not part of our religion definitely birthdays were adopted from other nations it is part of their customs and traditions and the prophet had said be pleased with a man with his father and whoever shall imitate a people then he is from among them this does not relate to wearing a watch or driving a car or using glasses to see this is related to whatever is considered to be part of their Customs Traditions religion and so forth and birthdays are not part of our own Customs or traditions this is taken from the non-muslims therefore celebrating them is not permissible otherwise we would have been celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Allah which is the most noble of all birthdays and the birthdays of Abu Bakr or Omar uthman Ali and the whole nine yards but this is not part of our religion therefore celebrating such birthdays Mother's Days the Labor Days Halloween Easter Christmas New Year Valentine and the list goes on all of this is totally prohibited and not permissible thirdly it's a man's job to enforce such conviction and beliefs in his household in his home unfortunately I've been doing a lot of counseling sessions and I get a lot of brothers like your friend from the UK and elsewhere who accepted to be treated as a doormat I am shocked sometimes traumatized when the brother says to me well my wife did this my wife did that and I said wait wait wait is your wife earning says no I'm the breadwinner does she chip in in the bills in the rent in the foods and no no nothing I give her allowance and I give her a credit card and I give her a car and I bring her a maid but she does this and that she refuses to obey me or to listen to me she kicks me out of the house if you're a wimp if you don't have a spine I can't help you when it comes to Halal and Haram we love our women we love our wives we are willing to swim oceans and climb mountains and cross deserts for them but when it comes to disobeying Allah this is a red line that I'd rather never cross even if it was for a woman I love and if she insists well another one bites the dust I could get someone younger smarter more religious and much much much more beautiful and they're cheaper but it doesn't and no disrespect is intended but this is reality if you fail to find your purpose in life in obeying Allah and implementing Sharia in your life with diplomacy with being polite and uh kind and easy going but never ever allow anyone to cross the red line simple as that now these brothers are seriously a doormat their wives control them shouted them slandered them say lies about them and they come to me and say what should I do man up Ahi learn how to be a man I'm not talking about being a tyrant or being abusive deal with them like the prophet used to deal Allah he was the kindest of all men but when it came to Red Lines he would never compromise his religion it is an issue of zero tolerance when he comes to the home and he finds curtains that have life portraits of animals he doesn't enter and you can see anger in his face and mother says the most beloved woman to his life to his heart o prophet of Allah what have I done I seek Allah's forgiveness he says Aisha don't you know that the owners of these portraits are being tormented in hell end of story she takes them down tears them up put them in a pillow and that's it stuff stuff's pillows with it and that's it it's torn it's it's totally deformed so this is what you need to do explain to them show them but at the end of the day you're the man of the house put your foot down who says you have to leave the house no I'm not leaving I'm not an ostrich whatever there's danger I just put my head in a hole in the ground and say whoops it's dark I don't see anything everything is fine no it's not like this it's your home you're paying the bills they have to comply and Obey whatever you say not you fleeing the battlefield and letting them do whatever they want so tomorrow they say we would like to have a party and we would uh smoke or maybe have some a pint of log every now and then and you say okay I told him and I advise them they wouldn't listen and I leave the home actually put your foot down be a man and act like a man within the boundaries of sharia and Allah Knows Best"
