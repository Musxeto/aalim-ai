  "transcript": "ANS from Canada uh may Allah bless you she and you so I have a question regarding like uncertainties and doubts uh like regarding wo and and impurities uh for instance I was like during the time of f i was urinating and I saw in my underwear I knew that uh there was no traces of unur or Medi and then I got up uh afterwards and then you know had some time to you know spend some time looking in the mirror and brushing my teeth uh before I made wo and then I made uh and then uh maybe I thought I sent some uh uh wetness maybe before woo so I made my woo and then uh uh so I made my woo and then I uh decided to check if there's any impurities and then I checked in my underwear and saw there's a one Trace that Medi so I was kind of like doubtful and not really I wasn't certain whether that Med came while I was in or before or you know before the W wall I was brushing my teeth and looking at the mirror maybe I'm inclined that it came before but I'm not really ever certain so uh so while so since it was feder time and the time was constrained I just decided to pray and not make uh another woodoo as I thought this would uh might open a door for wias so what's the ruling on what I did should I have should I must I should I have done another wo or was I of course of course you should have cleaned yourself removed that spot of NASA and made wo and your prayer is invalid you have to repeat it now aono from Nigeria oh even when I'm not certain no no no this is no nothing to do with your certainty you're definitely certain you made w you had a feeling you checked before Salat what are you talking about you didn't even you didn't check after Salat if you checked after Salat I would have said your prayer is valid but you checked during and you found it and still you did not do anything about it definitely your prayer is invalid"
