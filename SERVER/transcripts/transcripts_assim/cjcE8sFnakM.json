  "title": "What should we say after yawning? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what should we say after yawning so we know that yawning is from shaytan and sneezing is from allah and allah loves sneezing what does this mean yawning when you say and you open your mouth and you stretch out this is from shaytan because it is a sign of laziness and shaytan loves laziness now agnostics and atheists would say no no this is nonsense yawning is due to the fact that the body needs oxygen and that's why one yawn so that he gets more oxygen in his lungs and this would pump the blood all of this is nonsense muslims believe in the quran the sun and the prophet told us haslam that the anime is from shaitaan so whenever once one wants to yawn he should suppress it how do you suppress it by biting your lower lip like this closing your mouth or if you're unable it's so overwhelming you simply put your hand over your mouth and cover it because this prevents shaytan from laughing at you or entering in your body through your mouth so what are we required to say when yawning lots of the people say [Music] and though this sounds good as muslims everything we do we have to refer back to the quran the sunnah so seeking refuge in allah from the satan the cursed satan is usually done before we read the quran it is usually done when we wake up from a nightmare and we seek refuge in allah three times from shaytan it is usually done in certain places certain circumstances etc never ever it was reported to us that the prophet al-isram would seek refuge in allah from the shaitaan yani simply because the prophet ali never yawned and this is one of the things that scholars say that the prophet alison's special treats of his he never yawned and he never had an eternal emission due to the fact that these both are caused by shaytan and shaytan cannot come to him so the most authentic opinion is that you say nothing because if there was something to be said the prophet would have ordered us to say it and allah"
