  "transcript": "is at my school um I was asked uh to do uh but the only problem is is that there's actually a message right next to my school but the students in the school are like too afraid to like go or just walk like two minutes to the Masjid why I was asked to do this and uh pretty much uh the only other option was that we would hold a second and I was against this Cheyenne why are they afraid to walk to the Masjid well not necessarily walk to the Masjid but rather like miss their classes and stuff okay so basically if you're living in a cafe country and the authorities or the management of your work of your school of your uni would not allow you to leave class or leave their premises to go to the Masjid to attend Friday hotba the alternative is that you conduct a of Friday in congregation in the same uh place you're in which is the school and you can lead and they watch an attend there's no problem in that as"
