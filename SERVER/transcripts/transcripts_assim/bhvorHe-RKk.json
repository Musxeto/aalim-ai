  "transcript": "says what is the ruling on a woman chatting with other women and mahram's without hijab providing non-mahrams could possibly see her now this is not clear and this is the problem with a lot of the questions that come to us what the questioner had in mind is something and what we understand from it is another thing most likely the questioner is asking about chatting with other women and mahram's over chat apps such as skype zoom whatsapp or whatever so video chatting what's the ruling on that this is one part and the other part is providing non-mahram's could possibly see her how is that possible if there is a possibility of nun mahram's seeing her this would be totally prohibited if a woman says can i go to the balcony without wearing a hijab or anything covering my aura and there are buildings around me but most likely nobody is watching what do you mean no buddies watching can you tell do you know if there's someone behind the curtain with binoculars or with a camera with zoom peeping tom trying to take your photo no this is not appropriate there is a possibility and a considerable possibility but on social media uh platforms such as whatsapp or zoom or skype the possibility is non-existing rare if not non-existing because nobody hacks and monitors such chats and go out of their way unless they're spying on you there's they are spying agencies and this is very rare so what is rare and what is not possible we do not pay attention to it because it's quite rare it's like saying is it permissible to sit in a studio where there's a possibility that the ceiling would fall on your head and you will die if there's a possibility don't know nobody says this because this possibility is not existing and if it is it's rare and not to be put in into consideration this is unlike what is possible so a woman says what's the ruling on going to a wedding where i put all my adornment and wear a nice uh night dress or any soiree dress um putting my full makeup wearing my hair not mine of course doing this and that and there are women with mobile phones clicking pictures i said this is haram because definitely they will take your picture and definitely you will be seen by non-mahrez oh sure there's so much hardship your aura your chastity your privacy is more important than this hardship but on skype or zoom or the likes the possibility is very negligible and allah azza knows best um you"
