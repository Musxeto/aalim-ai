  "transcript": "is it permissible no it is not permissible unless it does not include anything that is forbidden and to my the only thing that it is not forbidden nowadays would probably be the National Geographic uh or History Channel whenever they have good material without any music see what is Haram for us as a Muslim as Muslims we're not allowed to look and stare and probably enjoy movies and I can I should not watch soap OAS or or TV series because it involves women and I'm I'm supposed to lower my gaze I'm not supposed to listen to music and all types of media involves music I'm not allowed to listen to um something that is filthy that is not pure so if I for example watch a concert for Richard prior this is not permissible because it is dirty it's filthy though there's no music there is no women involved but there is rhetoric that Allah is not pleased with and so on and those who are hooked on watching uh TV series or uh soap opras or even movies Unfortunately they are brainwashed they are manipulated by the things that they see their Customs their desires even the things that they love changes imagine if a person from the jungles of Africa logically speaking he would think that the beauty Queen and his dream girl would be someone who's back and who has the features of an African woman if someone in Indonesia for example or in China his dream girl would be from his own race now with the media there and and the beauty pageants you have all of this changing so a person from the heart of a Aria would be interested mostly in a blonde with blue eyes with a certain height with a big forehead with a small nose with a big mouth or whatever why because this is what he sees in likewise in Africa likewise in Asia so it is brainwashing you by being hooked to it to this uh uh um media Moguls and and and and institutions you will be a prisoner of war to them and Allah Knows Best"
