  "transcript": "says some people say that the Dajjal will have a palace on jebel hap she in the outskirts of medina and that is a place that has been and there is a place that has been built there recently what are your thoughts on this and does this mean anything thank you first of all yeah any some people say how would I verify this and they said that that the jail would have a house in jabal hep-c now what did they get this from is it from an honest and authentic hadith first of all second of all some people say this is not part of our Islamic beliefs or etiquettes to depend on rumors or hearsay and whatever people delegate and mention in their gatherings on the contrary the Prophet has earned forbade this and he said Cafe bill maher Heathman and you had difficulty Messimer it is sufficient burden and sin that a person would speak with everything that he hears so many people call and say this person did this that person did that all things that are not related to reality did you see this yourself no but I heard people say I googled Wikipedia and they said that this is confirmed subhanAllah it is one of the signs of the approaching of the day of judgement when a liar is believed and the man saying the truth is being accused of lying this is an authentic hadith where the Prophet told us about it erased alot of cinema so the Prophet said I am bit Sommelier Torah Julian's amo and this roughly translates to that it is one of the most hated and abort ways of speaking to say or to begin what you want to say by saying I heard people say they claim that this and this so I could come and begin anything any topic by relieving myself from responsibility and I say to brother say it brother say it and I hear people say that you're gay a fee and I don't know what's not for Allah what are your thoughts about this is this acceptable now you're basing your allegation upon what people say upon a hadith that that the jail would take a palace in jail Hep C or Hep C or whatever at the outskirts of Medina do you know where that place is no have you seen it no is it confirmed that the Prophet said this I don't know they say subhanAllah have you seen that the place does not take any other palaces around it so how can you build any argument on this therefore we should not pay any attention to such any rumors or cheap talk that doesn't add any value we believe that the jail is coming and he would be be prevented from entering Mecca and Medina so the palace you're talking about being built there at jihad she do you think that the people are any furnishing his accommodation in anticipation of his coming this is not logical"
