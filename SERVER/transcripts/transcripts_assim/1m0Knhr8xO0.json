  "transcript": "so should we always walk around with okay I cannot do this bad deed because I'm going to go to help constantly being scared of Hell living life of being scared of Hell or being happy of okay if I do this I'm going to go to Jenna and constantly do good like just just in your head you know like the balance of that I have a lecture I did in Peis Malaysia about a year and a half ago and it's the balance between hope and fear mhm see a Muslim has to strike the balance there are three things each and every Muslim must have and believe in the love of Allah the fear of Allah and the Hope in Allah so the love of Allah is like the head of a bird if you chop it off the bird is dead and the fear and hope in Allah are the wings if one of them there's an an imbalance the way the bird flies is going to be tilted and it's going to fall eventually so you have to balance between the fear and between the Hope in Allah in the sense may Allah be pleased with him used to say and someone says that this is attribute to Abu Bakr it doesn't make a difference both of them are the best Companions of the Prophet Sall he used to say if someone were to shout oh people of Earth all of you are in Paradise except one I would have feared I might be the one and if someone shouted all people of Earth all of you are in Hell except one meaning going to Paradise I would have hoped I'm not that one so this is the balance and this gives you check and balance so whenever I do something I'm fearful would Allah accept it is it for the sake of Allah is it going to be in my good deeds or bad deeds and likewise if I do something wrong am I going to be punished for it and so it gives me time to repent reflect and ask Allah for forgiveness"
