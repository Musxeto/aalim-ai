  "transcript": "uh Sheikh I'm coming back at you with a sports related question if that's okay yes sir um so and basically not too long ago I stopped my career in basketball I used to practice a lot and had a good amount of Team practices um however after this year's Ramadan uh I felt a change in my heart about the things that I do on a daily basis it bothered me for example that my teammates sometimes swore and mostly wore shorts that exposed the aura you know but now I still feel a great passion for this Sport and I still wish to pursue basketball and want to and I want to use it to see how I can attain possible future benefits and education and so on and so forth so what is your advice on this and what is the rules ruling on this playing sports as we've stated many times before is a good thing to be healthy and to play sports and to utilize your time in something you find your passion and heart in as long as there is nothing Haram this is totally permissible so you're saying that your friends wear shorts to my knowledge the vast majority of basketball players if not all their shorts go to their knees and almost covering them but even if the knees are exposed this is not our the aura is what is above the knees so the vast majority if not all covered their Aura so there is no problem in their clothes to my knowledge now if they're playing with really short shorts that expose their thighs then you should not be involved with them you should not play with them now pursuing basketball as a career is it something befitting a practicing Muslim the answer is no why first of all it involves a lot of Haram if not the least would be one of the haram's things the music they have involved during the playing time or during the breaks the cheerleaders that come and dance in inappropriate clothings all day long the practicing time that may go against your Salat may go against Ramadan may involve things that are inappropriate hitting the showers if they don't have private showers and everybody's taking shower together and you know what happens uh over there from exposing Aura and Etc among other things so if you can guarantee to avoid all of these things I see no problem in pursuing it as a career but if not then yes you can play it you can enjoy playing it but not as a professional Knows Best"
