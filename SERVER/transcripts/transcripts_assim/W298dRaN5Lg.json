  "transcript": "so I wanted to ask a question um when we're praying when we go to I never paid attention to this thing but it has become a frequent thing nowadays so when I go to I don't know when exactly I'm in like if I want to say it's like I'm still moving like I'm not settled so I have to wait for some time for me to be settled and then say and I don't want to wait there I want to pray like in a much lesser time than I usually do which is very long first of all you have to focus on the quality of your prayer not on the quantity so you should not be mindful of the time rather on whether my prayer is valid or not whether I'm achieving the best results out of it or not secondly for you to be in Ru is for you to place your hands on your knees this is this is when you are settled so while you're going down and you say subh this does not count the moment you place your hands on your knees this is the position you can say subh without any difficulty once is the minimum and the sky is the limit"
