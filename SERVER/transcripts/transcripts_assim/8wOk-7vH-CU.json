  "transcript": "the Muslims ask the same question they have a habit after praying Risha they pray two rakahs rawa type of Asia and then they pray three rock I Witcher some pray one raka with her so what's the ruling on that that's permissible then they wake up before Fechter half an hour one hour they pray 200 and they ask can we pray another whittier to conclude our tahajud answer is no this is prohibited the Prophet said Alice awesome there is no tool Witter in one night so as long as you have prayed it after Isha you can't pray it after tahajud but if you pray it or if you don't pray after Asia any Witter so you only pray Torah of the Sunnah tell Alisha then you may pray to write our night prayer Tunica write a night prayer and go to bed and wake up at the end of the night yes you can create a hatchet and conclude that with 1 or 3 records of Witcher this is totally legit"
