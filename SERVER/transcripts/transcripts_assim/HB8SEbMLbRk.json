  "title": "Using memes to defend Islam rewardable on social media? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Alhan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam to Allah. Sheikh my question is there are a lot of people who are slandering Islam and Muslims on the internet. So I'm using the memes and stuff to defend Islam because there is no one who is there defending Islam in these social platforms and which is causing fitna to a lot of Muslims in those platforms. So is it possible to use memes and such kinds of stuff and would I be rewarded for such actions? I don't know what these memes are about Alhan. These memes consist of cartoon characters and some kinds of photos of people, those kinds of things. Not those kinds of things that are exposing the aura, but it's just cartoon features of it. No still I cannot decide because if I understand correctly you're making fun of them. So you're putting memes that make fun of them or put cartoon that is ridiculing what they're saying and this is not appropriate. This is not the right way to respond. If you're going to respond scientifically by showing them logic and by countering their argument, yes. But to make fun of them is a waste of time and would harden and make your heart black. So the best is avoid them. When dogs bark, you do not fall on your hands and knees to bark back. You just ignore and walk away."
