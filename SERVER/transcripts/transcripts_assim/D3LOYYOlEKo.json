  "transcript": "Karabash. I know Karabash. Do you know Karabash? In Saudi we call it Karabash. Since I was very young, this is the only thing I know. I don't know what it's called. I can tell by the smell. Very strong smell. And when you have gases, you put it in your stomach. It relieves you. I don't know what it's called in Indonesian. I have to smell it. Anyhow, continue. First of all, Allah Azza Wa Jal did not create an illness without creating a cure. Some people will know it, some people won't know it. So how to differentiate between different types of medication? Number one, there is Shari'i medication. What is Shari'i medication? The medication that Islam came with, such as honey, such as black seed, such as cupping, such as Al-Qust Al-Hindi, such as Zamzam, such as Ruqya. All of these are healings from the Shari'ah. So you can do this, providing that the person doing it for you is Muslim and not doing Shirk. Number two of healing is natural healing, medical healing, which is known through practice. So physicians come, mix this with this, and you take it. Oops, he died. This is not good, this is not good. They mix this with this, oh, he's cured. Antibiotics is good for this kind of illness. This kind of medicine is good for headaches. So it is through experiments and medical reports and science, we know this is Halal. Now we come to the third type of forms of healing that is neither Shari'i nor medically or scientifically proven. And this is minor Shirk, such as wearing a copper bracelet. What is this? Oh, this is good for your knees and joints and rheumatism. And it's a very good Shirk. We go to the doctors, orthopedic doctors. Is this good? No, no, it is bogus. We go to Imam Masjid. Is this good? Nothing in the Quran and Sunnah. So believing in it is Haram. Wearing the disk of energy, something they have. Every time they bring something to you and they say that this ring is also, all of this is Shirk, minor Shirk. If you think Allah will cure you through it. It is major Shirk if you think it is a cure. So now we go back to the question. He says, I go to the healer. What is healer? Is he doing Ruqya? If yes, he has to be from Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah. He prays. He doesn't do any Shirk and you heal his Ruqya. I don't go to someone who says, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Maybe he's praying to the jinn. A real Muslim Raqi would be audible. And this is why the Prophet said, Let me hear your Ruqya so that I would know if it has anything that's against Quran and Sunnah or not. Because Ruqya is Dua, is making Dua. So you can, I can make Dua in Arabic, not from the Quran and Sunnah. But it would be accepted. But to mumble things without knowing what it means. No, this is not permissible. So I need to know what is this healer? What does he do? But I think the answer is comprehensive that he could figure out Inshallah."
