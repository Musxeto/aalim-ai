  "title": "Fasting Ramadan and celebrating Eid al-Fitr while traveling",
  "transcript": "if people are working in Saudi Arabia and or elsewhere when Ramadan starts they should fast the first day of Ramadan so if I'm from Saudi Arabia and I go on vacation to Cairo for example to Egypt or to Jordan and while I'm in on my vacation or at work they announce in the country I mean that today tomorrow is the first day of Ramadan if I'm able to fast well tomorrow I should fast and when I go back to my country I should also continue to fight until Ramadan is over and then I calculate the number of days I fasted so if I fasted 28 days then this means I have one day to go if I factor 29 or more then I'm in the clear because the minimum the Ramadan can be is 29. and what about celebrating the Eid in any country I'm in whenever they celebrate eight I celebrate eat with them regardless when I started fasting regardless how many days I fasted regardless if I started fasting in Saudi Arabia and now I'm celebrating Aid in Morocco but there are different uh days of aid from Saudi Arabia there's no problem I celebrate with them I eat because whenever I am in a Muslim country I stay fast with them and I celebrate with them they as well"
