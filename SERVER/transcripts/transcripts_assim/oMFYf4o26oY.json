  "title": "Items disappearing in house, can Jinn steal? How to protect our belongings from jinn Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "zeki says if expensive things like gold or cash is disappearing from the house and we're sure it's not being stolen we suspect it's jin what should we decide to protect our expensive possessions from jinn alhamdulillah i personally have not encountered this with the grace of allah yet had i not heard it from people i trust i would probably say that this is bogus but i've heard it from one of my students who is a very well-known daddy here in jeddah and she's my wife's best friend and she tells me that money has been stolen from her wardrobe which she received 10 minutes ago and there's nobody in the house she puts it in an envelope she puts it in the wardrobe and 10 minutes later it's gone not once not twice tens of times and not small amounts large amounts and this guy is well known for her ibadah for her ascar for everything so i did not know what to say but then it came to me that the hadith of the prophet when it is nighttime close your doors and say bismillah cover your utensils and say bismillah do this and say bismillah because shaytan does not open the door that the name of allah was mentioned upon it so i suggested that when she puts the money she says bismillah and she places it and subhanallah since she started saying bismillah not a single penny was stolen or went missing so is this jin the answer is yes why do the jinn do this it's a credit crunch probably i don't know ask them they just want to spoil your life they want to depress you do they want to sadden you and what saddens that person more than losing money and the problem is that the money they used to steal usually where sadhaka or zakat money that people give her so that she can distribute alhamdulillah it stopped so my advice is whenever you put something of value you play something you always say this and saying bismillah with every action you do is a blessed gesture and a form of ibadah that we should all uh try to uh adopt and insha allah that would be fine"
