  "title": "Can women pray Fard prayer BEFORE the Iqamah is given in the Masjid? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "fc tim says is it permissible that we women pray and obligatory before obligatory prayer before the epam what fz tim is asking about is a misconception especially in the subcontinent when women in their homes do not offer their fault prayer until the iqamah is called in the adjacent masjid so let's assume it's isha prayer the adhan is called that at eight o'clock and at 8 15 the iqamah is given in the masjid where the congregation will pray in the subcontinent on some other countries among the muslims they have this conception that women must not pray between 8 and 8 15. and this is totally baseless and is not related to islam women children elderly sick people people who are not praying in the masjid the prayer is due as soon as the time enters so as soon as eight o'clock that's an example is due and it's time for isha they all can pray even if the event is not given for one reason or the other if the electricity is cut off or the immune is home eating his biryani and late for adhan and nobody else to give the adhan or to open the masjid so now it's eight five eight seven that was called seven minutes ago there's no problem at all at eight o'clock sharp for you as a female to pray uh your asia prayer and las vegas"
