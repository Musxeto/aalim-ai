  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] the six men the Blessed men of Medina after spreading what they saw of the Prophet his DA they waited for a whole year till was The Following season of Hajj because they could not come in Broad day light under the watchful eyes of the pagans of qur and communicate with the prophet Alam without being attacked or killed so they waited for a legitimate occasion of Hajj on the 11th year and came and this time there were 12 of them five of the previous six who came last year and an additional seven so they came to the prophet Alam and this was the 12th year of prophethood and when the prophet talked to them further about Islam and they gained more knowledge they wanted something more something binding so the prophet Alat wasam said to them come and give me the Pledge of Allegiance and when they inquired about it he said not to associate anything with Allah listen carefully to what he's asking them to do not to associate other with Allah because this is the essence of Islam not to steal so you don't transgress against others regardless whether they're Muslims or non-muslims not to commit fornication and not to kill your own children as this was prevalent in some of the Arabs fearing that they would feed with them and fearing the financial burdens not to commit sins and this is in general and not to disobey me in anything that is right and proper and the prophet throughout his life had never ever ordered them or ordered us to do anything that was not right or was inappropriate the prophet says to them as a glad Tiding whoever among you fulfills that pledge his reward will be incumbent upon Allah but whoever commits any of those sins and is punished for it in this life in this world it will be an experation for him whoever commits any of these sins and Allah conceals it then it is for Allah to decide if he Wills he will punish him and if he Wills he will pardon him that was extremely logical so they accepted on the spot and gave and swore their allegiance to the prophet alai wasam on that basis now as they were going back and the numbers were growing and the basis of for Islam was potenti the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam sent with them a teacher so that he would teach them more about Islam which they could not learn in such short period of time and who would be able to convey The Message of Islam to more and more people so he sent with them His companion and he was one of the youth among the companions it's worth noting that musab was one among among the richest families of Mecca before Islam he was known to be a playboy and he wore the fanciest of all clothes and the best of all perfumes to the extent that people used to say when they enter an alley that they sniff the air and say m must have passed from here because there is this beautiful fragrance when he accepted Islam his mother his family all those around him were shocked so they tried to squeeze him out of it but he gave this whole life and this whole world for the sake of Allah so the prophet sallu Ali wasallam sent musab among the first to accept Islam to give da musab went with one of those dignitaries who came as ambassadors of their people to Mecca and learned about Islam and took it back to Madina he stayed with and he alongside with used to visit families and tribes in Medina displaying Islam to them and people accepted Islam and it spread in them like wildfire but in a positive sense's cousin was the head of Al tribe and as he was talking with one of the leaders of tribe he said to him what is doing with this man who came from Mecca they're spoiling our people and they're making them leave their beliefs for this new religion he's my cousin I can't say bad things to him or attack him or beat him up so us you go and talk to him and tell him to stop us went there and they knew that this was their chance he came aggressively and M said to him in a diplomatic way and this is how a D should be not conf from not confronting everybody and meeting people head on just wanting to pick a fight he said listen to me sit down and let me talk if you like what you hear alhamdulillah if you don't I'll leave immediately said that's fair he sat listen to the Quran and immediately it was apparent on his face that this is a moment of transformation he said to them what a beautiful religion this is what should I do if I want to embrace it so they told him to take a bath change his sold clothes and pray to that's it he said I'm going back to my tribe leader to if he accepts Islam you guys have got it made so he went back and the moment saw him he said to them by Allah came with a different face than he had left us with and he told him that I spoke to M and to as and they told me that they're going to stop but by the way I heard that the tribe or the clan of B were going to attempt on the life of your cousin Asad because they know that he's your cousin so s knew that there something was cooking and he took his Spear and went to check it out whether there was an attempt on his life the life of his cousin so that he could protect him or not and the moment he reached the place and saw them sitting he knew that it was a setup and they said the same thing to him sit and listen if you like what we have alhamdulillah if you don't we will leave in peace and the moment he heard the Quran and the display and the presentation about Islam he accepted it and reverted to Islam and went back to his tribe saying that I will not speak to any man woman or child until you accept the religion I had embraced and before it was sunset everybody accepted Islam this is how Islam was so quick and prevalent and excellent for the people the second Pledge of Allegiance took place in the following year in the 13th year of prophethood this time 72 people came from Y which is now known as Medina and they met in the darkness of the night so that the people would not know of them with the prophet Alat wasam and they also gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet Alat having done this and they gave the pledge of allegiance that the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam would be protected by them and they if he were to come to Medina would protect him as they protect their own wives and children and they accepted that wholeheartedly and invited him to come as soon as possible when the people of Mecca in these past two years saw a I wouldn't say The Exodus rather the quick fashion of migration of the Muslims packing up their wives and children and wealth and heading to Medina they started to feel the vacuum and Mecca was shrinking all the brains and the wealth and the youngsters are moving out because of what because of Islam because of the da of the Prophet so they felt I wouldn't say again the credit crunch they felt the financial threat and the political threat on their reign and power so they met in where they convened and H1 gave their idea one said we have to tie him up and throw him in a room and just feed him till he dies others said we have to make him leave Mecca and boycott him and exil him Abu jahal was with them listening when an old bedwin came in that no one knew and he identified himself as a wise man who would benefit them with a good advice and not deprive them of anything that's good for them Abu jahal came up came up with a devious idea and he said all of what you've said is not a good thing to do I suggest that we select a strong young man from each of the clans of Mecca different tribes different families and this group of men armed with a sharp strong sword with each one of them would go in the darkness of the night to assassinate the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in his house while he's sleeping on his bed so when when the tribe of the Prophet Sall alaihi wasallam asks for revenge and want to avenge their son they'd find that there isn't a specific person to pick on and his blood would be scattered and spread among the tribes and clans of qur so his people his family would accept to take the blood money and that would be the end of it Satan who was disguised in the form of this bedwin old man said this is the opinion that no other opinion would stand against it [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
