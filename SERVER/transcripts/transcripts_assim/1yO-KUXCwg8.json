  "title": "Is he Sinful for coming LATE to the Masjid (he always misses 1 or 2 rakat)?",
  "transcript": "but because of work related reasons he keeps on missing one or two most of the time so will he be sinful for this is it a must that he makes like he make time for so that he get the whole Jama every time is he sinful this is in Allah's hands because we are ordered to attend the prayer once the call is given and if someone deliberately Skips a raka or more he is sinful for that but if he is always preoccupied busy studying and the moment he hears the iqama he rushes through the Masjid to the best of his ability and he happens to miss arakawa too I pray to Allah that he's not sinful now being sinful or not does not mean he would attend attain the full reward someone who goes before the adhan and waits in the Masjid for 20 minutes for the iqama is definitely better than someone who comes after the adhan and waits for 10 minutes for a comma and both of them are better than someone who only comes after the iqama is given and the whole lot are better than someone who Skips a raka or more so the rewards vary in addition to the sin depends on the reason of this person being neglectful or late for the rakhanallah Knows Best"
