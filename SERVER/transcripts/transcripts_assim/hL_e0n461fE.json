  "title": "Hadith about dying on Thursday night or on Friday - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a Sanchez is the hadith there is no Muslim who dies on the day of Friday or the night of Friday but Allah will protect him from the trial of the grave from fitna til grave the answer is yes this is a Hasan hadith it was authenticated by many scholars and the hadith itself is a favour and a blessing from allah azza wajal it is true that some scholars rejected this hadith and said that it is illogical that allah azza wajal gives such a favour and blessing such a reward to a person who dies on a particular day which that person did not work hard to earn this so where is the wisdom and again this is something that we do not accept in the sense that we do not logic things that are from the Quran and Sunnah I could not come and say whoever dies while his last statement is that ilaha il-allah will enter jannah so one cannot object to this and say yes but this is not logical the guy was a kafir all of his life and at the last moment he said la ilaha line he enter jannah this is not logical this is not fair ahold of allah no muslim would argue like this or object to such a ruling like this because this is in Allah's hands Jenna is for Allah from Allah the torment of the grave is a punishment from Allah if he wills to exempt someone from it who dares an object to that what is the logic of it only Allah knows do we know the logic for fire being Taraka mother it being three raka and the rest of the prayers being four Rajas we don't so do we hesitate to offer them or do we refrain even from offering them until we find the logic behind that definitely lot not so the hadith is authentic and it is one of the signs of a good ending so if a person dies on a Friday this is a sign of a good ending insha Allah because Allah exempted him from the torment of the grave but this does not mean that he would not be accountable for all of his sins on the day of judgement and also this does not mean at all that if a disbeliever dies on a Friday he will be exempted from the torment of the grave this is only for Muslims and allah azzawajal knows best"
