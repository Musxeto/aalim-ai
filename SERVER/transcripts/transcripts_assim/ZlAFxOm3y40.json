  "title": "Why can men wear cologne or perfume in Islam while women cannot? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "salia says i know in islam it says for females to not put on perfumes azil will attract the opposite gender but what about males what if the cologne a male is wearing is attracting the opposite gender the opposite sex then shouldn't they also not be promoted to wear cologne the answer is no the rules of attraction between a man and a woman are not the same and i've said this so many times if a bombshell if a shockingly beautiful woman enters and there is a group of 20 men in the hall or in the way the vast majority of them will turn their heads and look because this is how men are created while if a handsome man one of the most handsome men around enters a room or a hall where there are 20 women only a handful would look and the rest would not pay attention i'm not talking about practicing women or practicing muslims i'm practicing i'm talking about generally speaking so the scent of a woman is 50 50 times greater than an impact than the scent of a man even if i wear the most expensive perfume i would not make heads turn among the women among the opposite gender but if a woman wearing her abbaya her neck fully covered from head to toe yet has a distinctive perfume of women passes by men men go crazy they can't see a thing but each one of them thinks that oh she's this tall she's just color she's this uh color of the eyes her hair is like this oh look maybe she's this maybe she's that they start to fantasize because men are sick this is how they were created to pursue beauty to pursue things that would attract them and this is why in the quran allah prohibited women from wearing anklets that has sound so that the men would not be lured and tempted by the sound of their anklets to that extent men are so attracted and tempted by women whether the sound of their heels or anklets or the smell of their scent and fragrances that they're wearing etc that is it's incredible while women are like not caring at all what is happening rarely you will find one in a million who would pay attention and elijah knows best you"
