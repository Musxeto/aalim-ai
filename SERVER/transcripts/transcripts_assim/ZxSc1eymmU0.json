  "transcript": "from sri lanka he says he's 20 years old he wants to get married he cannot afford it what to do the prophet said alai salzam that you should get married if you're physically and financially capable if not then you have to fast so fasting is the recommendation of the prophet and meanwhile you have to try and work hard find a better income look for a woman who would accept marrying you while compromising many of the things that young women may not compromise so you may find someone who's your age or five years old or 10 years older who's willing to marry without a lavish wedding or a lot of conditions that would be a burden on your shoulders and this would protect you from fitness allah"
