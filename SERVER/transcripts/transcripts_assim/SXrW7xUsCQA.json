  "transcript": "now um we mentioned you mentioned this briefly about the issue about intermixing between men and women at the workplace right so how do you advise us on placing these barriers of interaction or maybe let's start with this is it haram to have men and women working together yes that's a short answer how do you say it is haram well the prophet alaihis salat was salaam said to us about actually in islam which is salah he said the best role of men is the first and the worst role of men is the last and the best role of women is the last and the worst role of women is the first what does this tell you it tells you that the prophet is promoting the segregation of women in salat so the best role is the first for men and it's the last for women just to be as far as possible from one another now when a man sits with a woman do you think that he will be respectful and um chased and doing everything in his position uh in his power to stay away okay if i were to work with a woman i would most likely trim my beard i would most likely wear my best perfume before i go to work i would be as gentle as possible to the extent that my wife says hey where you going to work and if i sit with a woman for eight hours and she sits with me in the same office for eight hours she sits with me more than her father and brother and husband and i sit with her more than all of that and i see this everybody knows this maybe it's not the first week maybe it's not the first month but after six seven months of working together there has to be some form of um [Music] relationship so um fatima sister i don't call her fatima because there has to be boundaries i'm going to buy some lunch would you like some uh sandwiches oh thank you brother asim please can i have a chicken sandwich uh would you like it spicy no oh yes please i love it when it's hot what is this wait wake up oh we're just buying food i'm just being cordial this is what shaytan does bit by bit it happens even in dawa places i'm not referring to nakwa center i'm i'm talking about in general in malaysia i was invited few years ago by a dao organization to their conference and have the laughter that they've never invited me again so i went i went to the offices and i saw men and women working in this dawah islamic organization in offices together no partition subhanallah maybe it's the culture and after five minutes i started hearing laughing and joking between the bearded men and the hijab the women i said this is weird something is wrong so i was asking and they said oh yeah we had couple of marriages here after working together they got married yeah this is the halal but how many did not get married and and happen things happened so when i spoke to them after that they've never invited me again this shows you that free mixing it's bringing fuel next to the fire and say inshallah inshallah it would not ignite this is human nature even the most powerful man in on earth supposedly even the most powerful man who has a beautiful wife and a strong position the head of the strongest country in the world was tempted and seduced by a jew woman who was an intrin and you say that no no islam is too extreme islam is too rigid you always think bad yeah look what happened yeah so this is why we say no try to eliminate it now coming to the question if the country you're working in is a kafir country or it's a muslim country but there is no way to work in a segregated place you are as a man the breadwinner you can work with women with boundaries such as zero chit chatting zero socializing zero looking at them straight oh sure they will think i am rude yeah you're afraid that they think you're rude why don't you kiss them on the cheek in the morning and before you leave yes you need to be wake up what are you crazy let them think you're rude rather than try and think that you're doing well wow so so this is problematic as it's in our nature to flirt it's in a nature to show some of my charm and my power to crack a joke here and there and to draw attention this is what shaytan wants so you have to work with women you lower your gaze don't say good morning when you come to the office in the morning don't say hi good morning nope sit on your desk and do your job you need to sign something sign it and keep your eyes elsewhere don't socialize don't open a topic oh you were someone says why didn't you come yesterday i was sick don't say may allah inshallah none of your business keep it to yourself but this is how to remind all of you if you have any pearls of wisdom any brilliant nuggets of wisdom that you caught throughout these talks please do share them at the comment section and also in your personal social media posts uh put a hashtag tsp2021 and put a hashtag be steadfast i've already uploaded one at least so i'm gonna try and upload more mashallah a lot of brilliant points of wisdom so far even from these two talks masha'allah"
