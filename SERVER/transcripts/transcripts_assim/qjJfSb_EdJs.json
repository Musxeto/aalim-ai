  "transcript": "sarah from the u.s she says people are \nenjoying life after when we migrated to the u.s   i'm finding it difficult to pray as i used to \npray and enjoy reading the quran making dhikr   everything around me is filled with fitna even \nmy siblings my own brothers who used to pray   in the masjid and go to circles of quran \nmemorization and be students of knowledge   now they've drifted far far away from islam and \ni am worried what to do unfortunately sarah this   is the price you have to pay when you look \nfor a better life quote unquote underlying   exclamation marks when you look for a \nbetter income when you jeopardize your islam   by going to a kafir country like that, i get \ncounseling sessions every day alhamdulillah   and 40% of these counseling sessions about their \nchildren, how they drifted how they've deviated,   we get calls from parents weeping over their \ndaughters and sons, what happened? they don't   pray anymore they don't want to talk about Islam, \nthey raise their voices and sometimes physically   fight with us whenever we try to tell them to do \nsomething that is islam islamic or to stay away   from something that is haram and we don't know \nwhat to do, akhi how can i help? You are trying to   cure the symptoms while neglecting the core \nillness someone who has cancer someone who has   a chronic illness and complains of headaches \ngiving him tylenol or aspirin or panadol or   whatever would relieve him from his headache \nfor an hour or two then it reoccurs another pill   a third pill a whole box it would not cure the \ncancer it would only cure the symptoms which   is the headaches this is exactly what you're \ndoing living in such kafir country failing to install in your children from a very early \nage the knowledge of Allah the love of Allah   the commitment to the deen. We fail to do \nthis with our own children because we go   out of our way to feed them well, to clothe \nthem well and to take them to the best schools,   but spiritually culturally, they don't have \nan identity so they're torn between two lovers   feeling like a fool this is what's happening \nthey don't have a heritage to lean on or back to,   all what they see is kufur disbelief, temptation \nso they fall pray to it and they become the   victims you have to go to the core of the problem \nand solve it if it's not already too late so   unfortunately this requires a lecture but \ni hope you understand what i'm hitting too"
