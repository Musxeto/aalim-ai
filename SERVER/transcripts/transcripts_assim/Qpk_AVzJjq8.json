  "title": "Is it considered riba if a seller provides a written quote for a car, & buyer uses it to obtain loan",
  "transcript": "No hand from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'laykumussalam to Allah So the question is from a brother that sells newly imported cars Now they themselves don't provide any loan system directly If anyone wants to buy, they pay the full amount upfront But some people take loan from the bank to buy car Now the thing is the bank is not just going to give them a loan So they need a written quotation from the seller To seller to show to the bank to get their loan So if the seller give them the written quotation Will that be considered as helping in Riba? Giving a written quotation of the product I am selling is permissible And if it was used to get a interest-based loan The sin is on the person who got it This mug is being sold for $10 Someone asks me, can I get a quotation? So sure, here's the quotation Whether he gives it to his company to get an advanced loan Or he gives it to a bank to get an interest-based loan Or he gives it to his wife to approve it for him It's none of my concern I didn't assist him on haram That is his doing of doing it I just gave him a quotation of how much this mug I'm selling for would cost cash And this is halal inshallah you"
