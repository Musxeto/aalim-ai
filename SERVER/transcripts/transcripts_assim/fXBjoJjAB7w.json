  "transcript": "someone from the u.s i think isha from the u.s says if i'm praying and i see a bug in front of me can i break my prayer if the bug is bigger than you probably yes you can if the bug is a harmful animal or a harmful insect that may kill you like a scorpion or a reptile in this case you try to kill it in salat if not then you have all the right to leave the salat and try to kill it or run but if it's an ant or if it's a a cockroach that you can do this with your hand and it goes away it's not going to hunt you down and it's not equipped with special skills and it will come after you no it will run away then you have to continue in your prayer so we have to look at the outcome if you're getting a cobra or a black mamba coming to you don't play brave uh and and just continue salat because we'll do your funeral a couple of hours later no run or try to kill it but it's if something negligible that doesn't harm you that doesn't have any impact on you you shouldn't leave the prayer for that yes me"
