  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK. Is it possible for someone to get visions or some dreams from Allah that are actually from Allah or Allah speaks to them in their dreams or they can frequently see something that is of the future in the dream? Is it possible or is it just randomly that happens sometimes? That was my question. JazakAllah Khair. Wa Jazak. This happened with a former president who said, God came to me and told me to invade this country. And they invaded the whole country and killed millions of Muslims. Was he telling the truth? You tell me. Of course not. Who came to him in his dream? Satan. Without any doubt. Now this Shaykh who says Allah comes to me and talks to me in a dream, any righteous person, any person with credibility would be scared to the bones of saying such a statement that he doesn't want to show up, excuse me, that he doesn't want to show off and he does not want people to think highly of him and he would keep it with him to the grave. Okay, why did the Prophet say that Allah came to me? Well, the Prophet is talking about a revelation. This is Wahi. Was he boasting about it? Of course not. But imagine if I come on live TV and I say, God came to me and told me this and that and I should do this and that and the solution for people's problem in this country or that is so and so. What would people think of me? The diehard fans would say, oh Shaykh is a Mawlana, we should build a shrine on his grave. The haters would kill me first and then bury me and then build a shrine on me to stone. Nobody who is righteous in his right mind would go and say such things to people, usually. So in our times, such a person who does say such things, I would say that he is a big imposter. He is not righteous, he is not a man of knowledge or of piety and deen. Now is it possible that Allah can come and speak to you in your dreams? It is possible, but can you be certain? The answer is no. And most likely this is Satan messing up with your head. So if the vision you saw was positive and was good vibes and nice things and glad tidings, feel good about it, don't talk to anybody about it. You don't know if it's right or it's from the devil himself. And if it's wrong, Alhamdulillah, you kept a lid on it and Satan went defeated without achieving his goals and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
