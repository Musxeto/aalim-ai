  "title": "Is it a must to scratch off particles of dust, dirt or paint when washing feet in wudu Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "we have a question from Chester and she says when I make Woodill and wash feet towards my heel sometimes there are small black spots or particles of maybe dust dirt or paint etc during water do I have to keep scratching it until it comes off or such particles are negligible when making Moodle Moodle is evolution and there are six pillars of evolutions and one of these pillars is washing the feet up to the ankles now when we say washing this requires that the whole foot is washed which means that if there were to be a barrier on the skin then the water would not fully reach the skin which means that the Woodill is invalid it's not complete so if a woman has nail polish and she performs woudl her nail polish would prevent the water from reaching her nails so her Udo is invalid now when we come to these black particles dust dirt on your foot while you're washing it if this barrier is something external not from your foot and it is a an actual barrier that can be felt it has a mass to it and it is something like paint which can be scratched off in this case you must remove it but if it is old skin for example the skin is from your foot you're not obliged to remove it or peel it off if you had a an ink of a pen so if I draw a line on my hand this is not a barrier this is this is just a color so water can reach the skin unlike if I have paint which forms a layer on the skin this has to be removed so I hope you are the best judge of all of this and you can tell"
