  "transcript": "s from the US before asking my question I just want to see like the I split at the beginning of the program is very hard touching so if the admin can give us the name of the rec that would be good and my question is um I'm living in us and my parents are living in another country so each Ramadan they are paying Zak on behalf of me so is it okay or I should pay it on myself in us thank you so much as for the A and the recer I hope that the people in the control would be able to write the reciters names um in their blog or in their Zoom I don't know of the community they have if they have any uh as for your question if you authorize your family back home to give it on your behalf that would suffice you inshallah"
