  "title": "Must I Wash off cream or lotion before Wudu? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Creams usually are absorbed by the skin and it does not form a layer that would prevent water from reaching the skin. So as long as you apply your cream and then when you want to perform Wudu, you wash and rub the organ, this is fine Inshallah."
