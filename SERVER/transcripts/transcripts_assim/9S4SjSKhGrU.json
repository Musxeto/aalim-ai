  "transcript": "so sh I'm a medical student and I wanted to know if I'm allowed to examine and treat the female patient during my training period only with the intention to learn and increase my experience as a doctor and I may need to look and touch the female patients it is permissible for a medical doctor to examine the opposite gender when there is a need for that and the need unfortunately in medical uh colleges is that they have to do their rounds as medical students and they have to encounter different types of patients now it is essential that you're not alone or in seclusion with a female patient because this is totally Haram number two it is permissible for you to look and to touch what is needed to be looked at and touched so if she has a problem with her toe in her foot you don't have to touch and look at her face and tell her to unveil her face this is not logical so only the area that you have to look and diagnose and and and and examine is that which is permissible for you to look at and touch"
