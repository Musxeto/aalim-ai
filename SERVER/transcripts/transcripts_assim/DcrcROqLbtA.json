  "transcript": "from australia he says if we hear the name of the prophet isalam during the friday sermon should we offer salutation the answer is yes but you're not going to say muhammad and make a scene out of it you're just going to say it without verbalizing it by just saying absolutely that's it whispering it to yourself there's nothing wrong in that and it's not speaking inshallah i meant from india and by the way it's like saying ameen when the imam makes dua of course we don't raise our hands but we say and and this is not considered to be talking amen from india"
