  "transcript": "from Bangladesh asalam alaykum when I take a public transport for example Metro sometimes there a female there and if there is too much crowd sometimes I may have to collide with them unintentionally is there any sin on me if it's done unintentionally Allah does not hold us accountable for what was done unintentionally the issue is if there was a space where you will be surrounded by men and you chose that particular area or space knowing that you will may be in physical contact with other women then definitely you are sinful who knows Allah is the only one who knows what's in your heart"
