  "title": "Was Prophet ﷺ‎ given a choice to die or not? Did Musa punch angel of death? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um I wanted to ask about a Hadith that a lot of people have been quoting about it's about regarding the time when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was um passing away um the theth states that um when the prophet was on his death bed the angel of death came and gave him an option that um Allah has um granted you a choice to either stay in this world or come to the heavens um and the prophet preferred going to Allah then stay on earth and the prophet said that all the messengers are given this option I'm not sure of the authenticity authenticity of this Hadi I tried checking it and I didn't find anything re any anything um to prove that this is correct so I just wanted to ask you that is this Hadith correct or is it something that people are just saying what to my knowledge the Hadith is authentic there's no me not Prophet except he would be given the choice and this is out of Cur courtesy because all Messengers know that they're inevitably going to die as in the Hadith of mus when the angel of death came to him but he came to him in the form of a human being Musa was startled peace be upon him so he punched him and knocked one of his eyes off so the angel of death went angrily to Allah and said let me have my way with this man he popped my eye off and he said no go to him introduce yourself and tell him who you are and give him the choice so he went back and he asked M after introducing himself to whether he wants to live or die and if he wanted to live he should place if I if I'm recalling correctly if I'm not mixing up apples with oranges where he said okay how long if I wanted to extend my life he said put your hand on a bull and whatever hair your hands cover you'll be giving a year for each hair let's assume it's 5,000 hairs then you live another 5,000 years M said then what after the 5,000 years have expired the angel of death said then death mus said if this is the case then now now better than later on so it's out of courtesy that they're giving the choice and the prophet wasam he chose he chose to be in the companionships of the prophets the the martyrs and the righteous uh uh and Allah Knows Best"
