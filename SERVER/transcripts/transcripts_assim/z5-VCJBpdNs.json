  "title": "Questioning of the Grave for people who had a delay in burial or are not buried at all? assim",
  "transcript": "from the emirates it is said in a hadith that when a body is buried in the grave munkar naked angels come for questioning so my question is if there is a delay in the burial like three days four days so when will the questioning of the their bodies happen and uh what about the bodies that are not buried like drowned or in the sea or burnt oh okay from the emirates she says we know that munkar and nakir these are the two angels responsible for our interrogation in the grave where they would make us sit in our graves and ask us who is your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you so these are the three fundamental or principle fundamentals of islam if someone's burial was delayed for five six days due to autopsy due to transporting his body from one country to the other due to any reason when will the questioning take place when he's buried this is what we know what about then those who drown and are eaten by fish or lions or consumed in fire when would they be questioned well this is none of our business to tell you the truth what is a fact that they will be questioned how this is in allah's knowledge when most likely if they are dead and will not be buried it would be immediate because allah has the ability subhanahu azzawajal to gather their ashes to gather their particles to gather their little pieces and make the angels question them"
