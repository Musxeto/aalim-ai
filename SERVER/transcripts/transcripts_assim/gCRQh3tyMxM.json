  "transcript": "pods or gel will be on top of that person along with the others who are doing that sin so again I reiterate I did not say that I did not say that you may have good time with with intention and sin or be in a place of sin and say that Allah is merciful Allah is definitely most merciful but that doesn't mean that he will let people go without punishment for making sin so if a person kills someone said well I know your merciful hmm blow his head off what did he do say Allah Karim Allah is merciful yes but he will hold you accountable for what you have done to go back to your question if I remember and recall it correctly now you must not stay with the bad guys while they are doing their sin now what about if they're not doing their sin can I still you know go out with them and again if you don't draw the line if you don't influence them they will influence you you could not have it you know split and saying no they have their own sins and they have their own bad habits and I have my own good habits if you bring a very healthy and beautiful apple and you throw it in a box full of rotten apples you think that the rotten apples will become good again definitely not it will write with the rotten apples and this was that what would happen to you if you that's why we you know trim plants when they we have bad seaweeds around that we have to take it because it's going to affect it and you can sense this in water if you have a corpse if you have a dead animal like for 67 days near a lake or something it will affect the taste and smell of the water and that is the pier if you go out with someone that is a good person he will eventually affect you whether you like it or not because whenever he talks to you he recalls allah and remembers allah whatever you see something on the street you know people when when they see an accident they have this four letter word on their mouths you know the minute they see in action accident whether it starts with an F for with an S this is typical now it remember that if you say let Allah and this is the last thing you say you will enter paradise now what happens is in ninety-nine percent of the accidents you know when you're driving down the road and this truck comes to you the minute you see it you square your curse you don't say illaha illallah why because of the influence of your peers and who is your peer at the moment TV set video cables movies and you see this 24 hours and it affects you so the minute you are in trouble you don't say Ya Allah let a Hitler long while if you were to accompany good guys what whenever they see something they would say subhanAllah this sticks into your mind so whenever you see something you always say subhanAllah how are you yeah I'm a-okay but when you were the good guy who saved but I'm vanilla even if he's none at not armed it is it sticks to you so by being with them I definitely think that this is not a good thing for you to do because they will influence you therefore you should try your best to change them don't you know abandon them try your best to give them doua give them books give them leaflets bring them to good gatherings that teach them whatever you can with an open heart and with honesty let them sense your honesty that you love them it's not just because you want to dominate them or be on top of them just let them feel that you really love them and want the goodness to be for them as it is for you if you succeed and hamdillah if you don't if you don't succeed then you should look for another group that does this and I think this is all the time we for today's program I hope we have learned something extra and until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
