  "transcript": "[Music] as we know that it is not permissible to wear trousers or pants beneath the ankles but if we wear pants beneath the ankles because of winter when we put on shoes and the socks what shall be the ruling on this issue if this is the case and if the ankles are covered by the socks or by the boots or by the shoes in this case inshallah this does not fall under the same category and Allah Knows Best"
