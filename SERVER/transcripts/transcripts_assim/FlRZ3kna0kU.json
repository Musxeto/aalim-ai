  "transcript": "shadows from sri lanka he says what or what is the definition who are the hawaris so that we be careful from not being with them see nowadays with the media a lot of the youth are confused because the moment someone says something against a muslim government or a muslim ruler or a minister or any practice that he sees wrong and he says this is unfair this is wrong this is this or that immediately you will find an army of people accusing him of being and this is totally unfair on islamic because you cannot label someone to be a hypocrite or to call him as a kafir and these people know this that there are conditions to be fulfilled there are obstacles to be made sure they do not exist before we can label someone as a kafir or as a hypocrite or as a mushrik and likewise as you can't label people simply as such so this is why a lot of the youth are saying okay whenever i open my mouth they say what is this no khawaris is a cult it is a sect that was found at the time of the prophet and their main characteristics is one they see it is fit and permissible to rebel and overthrow muslim rulers this is a very prominent characteristic so all what you see among those who called for the arab spring overthrowing governments taking down muslim rulers just because they were unfair or they were tyrants they're still muslim this is a prominent uh characteristic of al-khawaris number two is giving takfer so you oppose me you're a kafir and this is found not only with the khawarij it's found also with other deviant sects you don't believe that the prophet was light and created from allah's light you're a kafir you're this you're that so these two main treats and characteristics if found an individual he would be from among anything else a lot if you study their literature and how they think they you will find that they have no problem in killing muslims and being in truth with the non-muslims you'll find that they have no problem in taking your money unlawfully or anyone else who's not with them because they think that all of them are kuffar and their wealth their blood is all halal for us and this is very dangerous and if you go through their websites you will never find a reliable scholar you will never find a scholar who's known as a person all what you will see is nicknames who are they i don't know and you will find articles pdfs pages and pages of quotations here and there you don't know who wrote them and they are made to deceive and to confuse the muslims it could have been written by the caa or the kgb or whatever who cares but it's definitely used to confuse the muslims so without referring back to the true real scholars of islam whom we have a lot and plenty of these youth are in great danger and allah knows best you"
