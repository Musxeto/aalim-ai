  "title": "Sue me for my pronunciation! Descendents of Qantura at end of times with broad faces & small eyes?",
  "transcript": "Allah I was reading an end times prophecy in which the prophet Muhammad El Salto salaam said and I quote some of my people will descend on low-lying ground which they will call albusra besides a river called the Tigris over which there's a bridge its people will be numerous and it will be one of the capital cities of the Muslims at the end of times the descendants of kantura will come with broad faces and small eyes and will descend on the bank of the river the Taos and habitants will then separate into three sections one of which will follow cattle and live in the desert and perish another of which will seek security for themselves in Parish and a third who will put their children behind their backs and fight the Invaders and they will be the martyrs end quote what I wanted to ask you today was who is his Contour of figure I've read online that Contours perhaps one of the concubines of prophet Abraham Islam it's just True by the way Sheikh um I say this with the utmost respect but you said the word prosecuted in an earlier description in regards to a boss being oppressed to an employee but that is not the correct word the correct word to use is persecuted not prosecuted thank you may Allah bless you for this correction English is not my first language not even my second language so I'm just Faking It prosecuted persecuted ah assuming I have to correct it and there's so many things that I've been saying wrong one of the sisters from the U.S she called me and she said every time you say not mug and it's not Meg that's right well this is a mug so I thought I always thought it was a nut mug so again I make lots of mistakes so uh for correcting me and I hope I do remember this uh and and not make the mistake again as for the Hadith it's difficult for me to hear the translation and relate whether it's Hadith or not and I need the actual uh original Arabic text so that I can check it out in my devices in my libraries to be able to know if it's authentic or not so the meaning of the word that you even described this is a descendant of Ibrahim or of Noah or whoever peace be upon them I don't know what it means if there is an invasion of Basra and being divided into three uh people and sex to Parish I have no idea about such a Hadith I need to see it the invasion we know of is of the moguls but this was recently like a few centuries ago not all that far so if you have it send it to me the original in uh my website and inshallah I'll look into it"
