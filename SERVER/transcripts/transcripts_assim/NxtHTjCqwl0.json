  "title": "Can we leave the body of the deceased out for 2-4 days so loved ones can come see the face?",
  "transcript": "When someone dies and they get disappointed, but here is a delay for some loved ones to come from far places. Is this allowed? Akhi, you haven't called your father in six months. Now you want to have the last look? Who are you fooling? Oh, he's my brother. He's this, he's that. Okay. This is the dead person. You love him? Yes. What do you want? I want to wait three, four days until I see him and then we bury him. So you are depriving him from going to Jannah, from meeting whatever he wants to meet and whatever he had worked his whole life for. Just to see his face? Yeah, he will send you a snapshot. What is this? So my point of view is don't wait even one second."
