  "transcript": "us who says is it permissible to throw money at weddings as this is something that has become extremely common especially in South Asia South Asian countries what happens is that it's become a custom among the people when the bride and the groom are hand in hand they seem to throw money over them or when they're sitting on their uh um Thrones or shares or when they're visiting and this is not part of Islam meaning that if you want to be generous if you want to give them a gift do that discreetly in Saudi AR I we have this custom that when we're invited to weddings we call it Rift so we put as much as we can afford in an envelope tuck it in and we when we come and enter the wedding hall we see the father of the uh uh bride and and and the groom and his family whomever we want to give the money to we just shake hands and hand it to them they put it in their pocket whether it's the bride's father or to the groom himself depending whom we're giving the gift to and this is done discreetly and this is done without any strings attached not that okay I'm going to give him this much so that when I get married or my daughter gets married he's going to return the same or more to me no it shouldn't be done this way but what we see in such South Asian countries where they throw the ma the the money on their heads and they have to fall down on their hands and knees and collect the money or the children do this or their relatives this is humilating you want to give me a gift give it to me in my hand why throw it on me oh it's a sign of happiness but this isn't done discreetly or with honor you're forcing me to go down on my knees and collect the money and maybe then we will fight me and my spouse over who gets what this is extravagance this is showing off and boasting about it as I said you want to give a gift give it discreetly in their hand and don't show off in front of the people as if you're throwing money that has no respect no value to you and this is a from Allah that must be respected and Allah Knows Best"
