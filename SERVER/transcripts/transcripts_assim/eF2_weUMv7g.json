  "transcript": "gives no stomping perfect with no flaws it all the laws of Allah a way of life a way of life away of NIH's assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh all praise belongs to allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are without do discussing the topic of magic sehen in witchcraft we have joining us check SML Hakeem from Saudi Arabia asylum Allah Murray from the UAE and chef Muhammad Ershad e from Canada may Allah reward you all for joining us now we've been looking in our previous episodes about magic and sorcery and all of the things that are forbidden in Islam the things that we want to be aware of so we can stay away from them however we do have alternatives for cures that are valid in Islam we mentioned medicine for example you know going to a doctor to take a tablet might be the solution to many of our problems however we also have the Rokia now for those who aren't aware of this matter I'm going to ask her share ask him to begin and introduce this matter what the rakia is and exactly how a Muslim goes about gaining benefit from it suleiman rahim hamdulillah salat wa salam ala rasoolillah he were here also having money today because there Who am I I do the healing process in Islam is masha'Allah second to none first of all Islam had indicated to us how to get this healing it's either physical or spiritual and the physical part of it is divided into two types physical means of healing that we were instructed by the Quran or by the Sunnah for example honey this is physical but it was recommended by the Quran and the Prophet as a ceramic for example cupping or future izing or something like that which is a hot piece of metal is used to cure eyes and cure certain parts of the body the HEPA soda the black seed all of this is part of the physical recommended means of healing and treatment by the whole Arizona there is a second type of physical healing which is experimental only scientists and physicians doctors come and say that listen if you take this antibiotic it cures a particular virus if you take this medical procedure or formula this is good for your stomach oh this is good for your headache something that scientists and doctors all approve and it's clinical and they find this scientific there is a spiritual side of it but before going to the spiritual side I think I believe that it is important to address the issue that nowadays there are so-called physical means of healing that are not proven scientifically so you have this disc of energy for example or a bracelet that cures from your rheumatism and pay and bone and joint aches we go to the doctors is this proven scientifically dr. C no there's nothing to prove that this kind of stone drains the tension and the negative waves and radiation from the body and this does not give you any healing or it doesn't give you any energy yet they sell like crazy on the Internet in Arabia we find a lot of the brothers practicing coming into the otherwise she's wearing these bronze or copper bracelets what is this wallahi once I wore it it drained all my back ache subhanAllah yeah he put an earring maybe the red drains your your headache as well Cindy good idea so the belief in such things that are not medically proven that scientific improvement is part of the ship and the ship is divided into acaba major and minor so if you believe that this is a cause by allah azzawajal to cure you this is shirk azure and if you believe it cures you by itself this is something that nullifies your Islam and explaining this just before we go here this could be what we call the possible a person is convinced that's going to help so their body might actually start curing at thinking but it's not actually laughing this might explain a lot of the I just want to explain the Percy beau a little bit there is actually very famous incident in the US where in the big stadium somebody became very ill so they announced on the loudspeakers that we think it was the fountain drinks so if you drank from the fountain drinks then you know just be careful so they said that the whole stadium erupted everybody's feeling sick and vomiting and they said it became a blaster the ambulance is going to the hospital and left and right because once you play with people's minds and they think something's gonna be healing or a harm and then they announced on the speakers in the stadium they said we found out it wasn't the drink and then they said people were magically cured so somehow NOLA this reminds me of a myth in the Chinese fables and stories it's said that one person had an association a friendship with a plague so he met him and the plague said I'm going to this village and I'm instructed to kill 500 and the man they departed and after a week he heard that in that village five thousand died so a week or so later he met the plague and he said why did you lie to me you told me that you were instructed to kill five hundred only he said I was instructed and I only killed five hundred the rest of the four forty five hundred were killed by illusion and they convince themselves of such a disease so this is possible now the spiritual healing even in Christianity and Judaism it's there but as Muslims we are only concerned with what is permissible we are permitted to make rupiah so when I tell you a do it appear this is spiritual healing what is rakia Rukia is anything that you recite over a sick person or a person who needs healing and the most preferred thing is to be from the Quran from the Sunnah and it's possible to be normal supplication providing it is audible it is comprehendible you are able to understand each and every word but if it's something that is camouflaged and you are not able to understand it it is forbidden to do it the best thing you can do for healing is a Fatiha and I've tried this myself on so many people and on myself as well of course this is part of the Rakhi as in the hadith of absurd the hood REE may Allah be pleased with them and it's not only spiritual the effect is physical in the authentic hadith abuzer Adel Qadri I don't want to take the whole session of yeah I would say Adel Hoadley I was saying hoodie was in an expedition with other Muslims and they were starving they ran out of food so they saw a tribe they went to the tribe and you know in Arabia if you have someone coming you have to host them but this tribe was not Muslim and they did not even have the courtesy of the Arabs the non Muslim Arabs to host them and they rejected them they didn't give them any food so as they were camping outside of that tribe not knowing what to do without any food a messenger from that tribe came to them and said listen does any one of you is capable of doing rukia because this was known before Islam can anyone give this spiritual healing because our tribes leader has fallen sick due to a sting of a scorpion or a snake so one of them said I can do that but what by Allah because you didn't give us food I'm not gonna do it until you give us something so they again on a portion of sheep let's say 30 or 40 of them so the man went to that tribesman and he was lying who's dying and he as in the hadith authentic hadith he only recited al-fatiha continuously and blew on him so he says alhamdulillah and like this once twice three five six seven times until the man stood up as nothing had happened to him this was miraculous so they were so happy they gave him the sheep the companion said let's inshallah bismillah start to eat and what I said what we did was it legal I don't know if this is acceptable in some or not by Allah we're not going to touch the food so they took the sheep and they went back to Medina managed some way or the other to manage without the food and they told this to the Prophet Alesana and the Prophet said masha'Allah how did you know it's Ciroc eeeh any who told you that it's a rukia it is by allah Autopia so this is affirmation from the Prophet it is the best locator to be done and the Prophet s Sam told them that is OK for you to eat from that sheep and give me my portion as your leader and messenger it is a concern I'm going to ask you Sheikh Salim we've seen from the Sun nada al fatiha is valid for a rope you now know that we have many other verses of the Quran sometimes you'll find people saying you know if someone has so-and-so read this order this many times or and you find many formulations brought up is there anything clearly from the Sunnah other than the reading of al-fatiha that we can use for the rakia or is it just any sword I mean what are the guidelines Tom de la salle salam ala rasulillah a disagreement wanna have regarding the suitors that we read as a cure the Fatiha one of its names is a chef Ian one of the names of al-fatiha Shafi at the healer and the Quran all the Quran is Shiva who knows alumina Brahma hua she found Rama so the Quran is Shiva anything of it you read it is Shiva but to start saying this surah if you read the serratus for this and surah that is veena unless it is proven otherwise and approved and they sanctioned by the law giver so we say the fatiha because the bluffs Allah Salim said so so anyone said this surah tell them what is your proof what is your proof that is there anything in this authentication Assessor so what we know from the in the authentic shouldna the pull will allow a horrible falafel other bra Fitness where the professor Salim used to read in Al Hasan and Husayn and in what the Imam Malik another hadith the children of Jaffa gonna be parted after the has their father was martyred the profs are Selim showed them they are in very weak and healthy condition said what is this they said this is the effect of the evil eye so why did it you see could appear why did it you read on them so the Quran in general is Shiva and there are certain sewers the mentioned the Prophet salah salem specified we read and put the your trust at the end of in Allah so Allah because Allah is the healer indeed now we're going to stop on this point may Allah reward you all now we're going to go to a very short break so we'll be back very shortly so dear viewers do stay tuned insha'Allah we'll be back with you after a very short moment assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome back to you viewers we are here discussing without the issue of the topic of magic witchcraft ahead and all things related now chef Salim before the break you were mentioning a few of the authentic evidence or the rakia for example the sorters that we recites you mentioned al-fatiha the three holes is there anything more than this and also I wanted to ask chefs Adam as well if you can give us a little explanation of you know for the mothers and fathers out there how do they do it ah clear how do they recite over their children if the child is like two years old one year old do they just read and touch the child or do they make the child read with them or do they blow on the child how do they do it hamdullah the Prophet Allah salami used to read owner Hasan and Husayn when they were small and you can put your hand then put your hand in the chart and you blow while you are reading you are blowing on while reading the sewers okay so that is what does that mean you're blowing like your site and then you go yeah like this okay and this also takes us that how about you what is called Maho okay this is another way how to treat the set okay that reading on water or Zamzam water or reading on sarin so the element they have mentioned these things and the Salaf they were using these techniques to nullify the effect of the set now on this point just while we've got it before we lose it from here a lot of people you'll see what they do is they'll take a page of the Quran and dip it in the cup or they will actually leave it in the cup and drink from it and I've even heard of some people going to the extremes of cutting the pages of the Quran and adding it to food and then eating it well this is obviously something which is that's not permissible this is deviant because that means you are if you're not respect to the book of allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala now on this point again i want to focus on a while we've got it you will find it of course the koran as you mentioned is a Shifa it is a cure however it doesn't mean like you've said that we eat it it doesn't mean that we drink it rather it means that we observe it we recite it now a common thing are a lot of people doing their houses is they will play Koran on the CD and they will say this is a protection however I've heard some others and I want to get your opinions on this some say that simply listening is enough however others say no you should read it for example reading surah al-baqarah they would say it means you read it and not just play it or whatever you know the opinions on this matter well actually I believe that it is a form of worship and playing it to those who are able to recite it it would not do the job it is like people nowadays call the Adhan by a tape recorder and they think that this is enough know that then is a form of worship it has to be done by an individual at that time otherwise I would bring a CD with extra days praying taraweeh hand played in the message then we all pray behind that CD this is not the case however I find or have found actually and I still do find that one of the best means of treatment for such saharan and witchcraft is to first of all relieve yourself from any connection to other than a large soldier just feel helpless to allah subhanaw taala from anything that connects you with this world and i have so many stories about this I remember one brother called me from Medina and I was living in Jeddah medina is about 400 and plus away kilometers from Jeddah 500 almost kilometers away from Mecca so the brother was crying on the phone I don't know him and he said Sheikh I have a problem what's the problem my friend he said that I've been married for a month until date I did not consummate the marriage I'm unable to approach my wife so I said maybe you should take a blue pill or go and see the doctor he said Sheikh I have nothing wrong I've seen the doctors in see there's nothing physically wrong with you so I said maybe you any you are weak he said sure I'm strong as a bull so I said ah in this case definitely you are a sinful person you means of recreation in your house you have sins that is impairing you he said sure I am a student of knowledge and I have circles in Medina harem for the Koran and I don't know what to do and the guy was you know crying so I said ok or like the only cure that I know that would help you a lot is to surrender yourself to Allah by saying that no one can cure me except you Allah o Allah I am helpless I have no where else to go you have so many servants other than me but I have only one Lord so I do beg you I pray to you o Allah and you do this with the intention to cure yourself first of all and do not doubt I said to him be sure because it's not something you're gonna try and maybe really it's not gonna harm us let's give it a shot do it knowingly your conviction that Allah will cure you and I hung up when you have trust in Allah soldier Allah cues you this is very important psychological when we are mentioning these things as means of pure the most important thing that you should know that a large the healer these are only means ok if you think the medicine will heal you that is  or the doctor would heal you that  and the Arabs before Islam the mushriks they would come to the prof salah salem and they would say oh a prophet of allah after the became muslims things we used to do or appears before islam we want you to check are they ok can we carry on so we said ok read to me then he said Lab at Cebu rocky MLM Tekken chica chica there is nothing wrong with there get as long as it doesn't involve any policy sticks believe so and another hadith they said in Osaka onion falafel Irfan whoever can help his brother by any means to help him do so so because of this Hadees that's why I find the stories I mentioned about reading when the green leaves or reading on water and things like this because the Sharia did not prohibit these things and they are not involving him and it down I've got a question because chef's awesome you mentioned are the advice that you gave to this way may Allah you for this before finding the solution you mentioned make on Marat make do our pray 2 rakaat now this brings to mind of course that we are protected from Shaitan when we're sincere to Allah now someone might come along and they might say chef I have a problem you know I possessed all witchcraft or something give me the solution meaning read some Quran or do something but maybe this person doesn't pray maybe this person does not make two hour maybe they don't fast maybe they're very far from Allah can rakia fix everything or do they also have to fix themselves there is one ship that used to help people in this regard and I was reading his book and he had a beautiful way of format he what he would do is he would tell the person that before we even do any Autopia we can only set an appointment for one month later and he said in that one month you have to get back in control with your Salah you have to you know for the sisters not what you need to wear hijab you need to start saying bismillah before you eat you have to do everything and then those are the natural protections like after a month of doing that then come back to me and he would say that the one of the first questions you would ask them they come back did you do that and make sure that they have a foundation on which to build up these other things then it might be that if I do it they might not even need to see him because maybe this was the problem I may comment on this in the hadith of abou say the hoodie when he recited the Fatiha was the patient Muslim he wasn't yet he benefited so to say that doing rukia for someone who does not pray or for someone who is not a practicing Muslim he has to become a practicing Muslim first no I disagree with this it may help yes but what usually I do when people come to me is like what Shara Hamid said I turned them towards Allah Allah because I usually ask the majority of them are sisters share do this do not and I say listen who is in more need who's more desperate me or you and she said I am and and then I say Allah says in the Quran I'm a huge evil Mutapa yada ha who is it that answers the call of the one desperate its allah azzawajal so whenever someone is more desperate Allah is closer to him I'm in my air-conditioned room in my house or in my office I'm not that desperate that you are desperate you are in need to allow the gel fuel so you turn to allah and allow an answer but the problem is the people want a straw to hang on to when they are swimming when they're drowning they want something so they think that okay let's go to the share or to the ship whoever's beard is longer but this is not the case it is the case of your belief now it's interesting just before we wrap up because well talking about before hell all of these things could actually be a trial for you now you've mentioned that some people might come and they might be a little bit far away as you've mentioned in this case and then as a reminder you say to them before we even begin make sure that you're praying make sure you're doing all of these things and we know that when someone has a calamity they turn to Allah so it could be that even though they dislike this melody this you know thing that has fallen upon them it may bring them back to Allah subhana WA Ta'ala indeed so main it is a way to make dour actually definitely so that's why the ship was used this as a chance because he's in need so whatever you tell him he is ready to do it yeah so rather than curing a small problem you end up solving a much bigger problem so just one minute before the evil eye the evil eye is true and two of the Sahaba they were bathing and one of them when he saw that other one is it wow what a beautiful skin you got and that one fell immediately on the ground and the prob salah salem came and he asked the one who said so to tickle will do and collected the water and pour it on that's happier and he better when you see something you think we have to you know give a whole session on evil eye and envy would you think allah will try to dedicate our next episode to this we have run out of time may allah reward you all for the contribution and may allah reward you our dear viewers for also joining us we hope insha'Allah that you've received a lot of benefit from this program and we hope insha'Allah that you'll join us in our coming episodes until then I greet you all honey come what happened to Allah he wore better cattle we are late for way of life away of snow strong"
