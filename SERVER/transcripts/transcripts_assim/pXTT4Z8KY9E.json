  "transcript": "I had a question about Drop Shipping if a service was provided where I could I could give the exact product description price uh delivery time and the the payment would be beforehand would that be a valid transaction despite the fact that there would be an ambiguity in the liability If the product wasn't perceived or not I wouldn't be able to deal with that situation so do they pay the money up front in full yes yeah this is permissible inshallah this is known as Salam and there's no problem in that inshallah whether the delivery fails or not this is your responsibility in returning the money back to them because you cannot consume the money this is your responsibility as a seller it's none of my business if you're dealing with a third party or not you took my money you gave me a date of delivery you gave me a exact description of the item that I bought so it's your responsibility to deliver it in the oproximity of that date and if something happens due to shipping problems or it's my responsibility I have to return the money back to you and Allah Knows Best you"
