  "transcript": "aisha from the u.s a person wants to recite the quranwoods before rokua are they supposed to do the techbead before starting the dua and is raising their hands to the earlobes part of this techbead aisha from the us she says is the kunut before ruko or after rukur and how is it done kunot is to be made only in witter prayer and not in farida and not in in the so unlike what the shaftery madhav says the vast majority of schools of thought and scholars say that one must not perform knut in fajr so this is point number one what they're doing is not in accordance to the sunnah the prophet did not perform it as islam the abu bakr umar uthman and ali did not perform it in fajr what may had happened once and then the prophet was prevented from doing it is nasila is the note when a calamity takes place and the prophet did that throughout the five daily prayers not only fajr and he did that for a month until allah told him to stop so nowadays we have calamities all over the world it is not for me as a muslim imam to come and say this has to be instructed by the muslim ruler not from any tom dicker harry shooting from the hip and calamities will never end if we have them in china the yoga being uh oppressed or to rohingya or to the muslims in syria or the muslims in libya or the muslims in conflicts all over the world in kashmir in palestine etc it will never end we keep on doing all day long and this is not from the sunnah it has to be instructed by the muslim ruler now in winter the vast majority of scholars and the authentic hadiths state that the quran is after the rukur so after you say allahu akbar subhana rabbil adam you rise up and say allah etc this is the vast majority of scholars some scholars say that it can be said before rukur i personally don't know a specific authentic hadith that the prophet did it is but because there are scholars who said it is legitimate we say it's legitimate and it is done as some schools say that after you finish the recitation of the quran you start with the dua and then you make takbir and you go for rukur some schools give takbir and then make dua then give another tech beer but i don't know any reference for that and allah knows [Music] best"
