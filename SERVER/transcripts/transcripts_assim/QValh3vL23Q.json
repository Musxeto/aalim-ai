  "transcript": "um I have someone who has been doing R for over two months and he's unable to recite now as result of the holding his tongue unable to speak properly like inability to properly read the Quran and also speak in native language prob and it also causes unexplained aches pain and stress last August my question is what to do to remove the pain and stone being by the when there are cases of gen possession there is no solution in my knowledge or to my knowledge other than R and if the r is not working most likely the person who's doing it is not doing it correctly because R is reciting particular verses of the Quran with strong conviction that this is a means of healing the last two verses of the last three suras of the Quran and reciting it multiple times some may add few verses ofah Jin some may add few verses from Surah yunus orah if there is black magic involved nevertheless these are all beneficial because it's from the Quran you do this directly to the person or to the individual or you do it yourself on over zamzam water or normal water and you drink multiple multiple times from it during the day and the night and with the grace of Allah it will cure that individual"
