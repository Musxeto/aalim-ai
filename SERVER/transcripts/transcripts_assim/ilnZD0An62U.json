  "transcript": "uh so she I'm uh I'm 27 years old and I was born Muslim but for a majority of my life I I spent as a drug addict and um I wasn't on my Dean I didn't pray I didn't fast and uh I'm wondering if there's anything that I should do to compensate for my past were you labeled as a cfir yes or no I was born as a Muslim I know but I knew better were you labeled by others as a cafir did you consider yourself to be a cafir and a disbeliever or you still considered yourself to be a Muslim but a sinful one no no I I always believed I always considered myself Muslim but because of my addiction I wasn't okay as for the prayers you cannot do anything about them they're gone as for the fastings if you did not fast the whole day from Ramadan intentionally from the beginning so since night I'm not fasting tomorrow and you wake up and you don't fast this day is gone it cannot be made up The only days of Ramadan that you make can make up are the those the are the days that you started fasting and maybe broke them after an hour after five after 10 hours not completing the day so any day of fasting you broke you have to make up but if you did not initially fast the day from the beginning this is gone forever you cannot make the those up most likely you did not fast any day from the beginning the whole month you just could not not even consider fasting and hence there is nothing to do except to repent have deep remorse and ask Allah for forgiveness and pledge not to do this again from now on and Allah is most forgiving most merciful but if you remember that oh yes there was a week where I was with my parents and I pretended to be fasting and at 10:00 I just went to the kitchen and had a glass of milk and some cookies then these days you have to make up may Allah forgive you and erase your sins"
