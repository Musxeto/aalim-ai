  "title": "What Islam Says About the Dua of Children (Innocent Angels)? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "me from the US there's a saying in Pakistan that uh little kids duas um are highly accepted because they're innocent little angels so uh how true is this from the Quran andah like are there dasas more accepted than adults this is not anything authentic neither from the Quran or from the Sunnah yes it's a statement that is widely spread upon the Layman those who don't have knowledge and they relate things to the innocence of the children and they think that they are as you stated wrongly little angels and this is not a good description because we're not allowed to give the description as such to Children sometimes when you see infants like two three months old uh children in their in their crib and they smile said oh they saw an angel this is talking without knowledge talking about the Unseen how do you know it saw an angel when in this age they don't react to sounds or to uh lights or they they can barely see likewise we can't say about the nurses that they are the Angels of Mercy this is totally prohibited and also it's even worse when we say that she the singer has an Angelic V voice this is not permissible so coming back to your question no there is nothing to back this up from the Quran and the Sunnah that the Dua of the children is more accepted than anyone else and Allah Knows Best"
