  "transcript": "Khalilullah from Nigeria I did not get your question. She fasted the whole day. When did she see the menses? Before sunset or after sunset? After the sunset, but she was yet to break her fast. Okay, if the Adhan is called and she did not realize or see in her menses, her fast is valid. Okay, and yeah now and the other one is she sees her menses when it's time for break, you know, to break her fast, but according to the previous day, it was five minutes after. Now you see, let's say for example, yesterday the Adhan was called around 6.50 and today she sees her menses 6.45, is her fast valid? No, it's not valid, definitely, because she saw her menses five minutes before the Adhan. So even if she sees her menses five seconds before the sunset or the Adhan, her fast is invalid. you"
