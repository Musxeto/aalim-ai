  "title": "Is it Halal to listen to \"Nasheeds\" Accompanied by Musical Instruments?",
  "transcript": "my question is now we have some some music they use islamic words like subhana life or sometimes they will send in a blessed all types of music whether accompanied by what they call uh uh as nat which is describing the prophet al-islam and his beauty and his biography or accompanied by praising allah or by vikar as the sufis do all of this is haram in islam why because the prophet is told us that musical instruments without any exception are prohibited except to the duff which is like a drum open from one side and close from the other side like a tambourine for example but without any metal things around it this is called the duff it's a big rounded uh instrument that people beat specifically during weddings read celebrations etc this is halal in these occasions but other than that all types of musical instruments were prohibited by the prophet and the four schools of thought of imam abu hanifa malik and ahmadinejad agree that musical instruments are prohibited we do not have anything personal against music and if it were not haram in the religion why would we burden people and say it's haram some people like classical music some people like hip hop r b some people like heavy metal or rock this is their preference why would we stand in their way and say it's haram or disliked or this or that if islam does not say anything about it do we want to annoy people from us of course not however this is the religion of allah we have no preference other than to follow the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations this is what we command it to do and therefore we have no other alternative no other choice but to tell the people music is haram as mentioned in three places in the quran as mentioned in the authentic hadiths and the other many hadiths in the books of sunan as it is agreed upon the schools of thought and allah azza knows best you"
