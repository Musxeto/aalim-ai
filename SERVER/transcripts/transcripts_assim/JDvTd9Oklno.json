  "transcript": "Yusuf from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaikumussalam I know it's a sound but when I finish my prayer I pass wind and I know this is passing wind Now what do I do? Nothing, your prayer is valid You cannot break your prayer that you broke your wudhu with an assumption or a doubt Some people say to me Sheikh I was in prayer and I heard a sound So should I break? I said what sound was it? Was it the sound of passing wind or farting as they say? He said no no no someone was cracking his fingers So I thought okay you've answered yourself Someone says oh Sheikh while praying I found this smell so should I break my prayer? I said is it the smell of your passing wind? He said no no someone was applying perfume I said okay what are you doing? So the hadith is crystal clear don't break your prayer until you find a smell which is offensive which is you passing wind Or you hear a sound which again makes it certain for you that yes I did pass wind and Allah knows best"
