  "title": "Can a woman put down to go to hajj or umrah as her mahr (dowry)? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says can a girl make her Mahar as Hajj like asking the man to take her to Hajj or for umrah as Mahar Mahar is Dowry and we know that when a man wants to get married to a woman he has to obtain the proposal of her guardian her father in the presence of two male Muslim Witnesses and he gives his consent in front of them part of the condition is that he provides her with a Mahar with a dowry so whether it's something Financial money a piece of land a property or anything that can be of value now when a woman demands going for Hajj this is something of value this is totally permissible however I would be more inclined to put a figure so if we are in year two 2023 or 1445 Hijra she should estimate or her guardian how much the package would be to go for Hajj and put that number of Euros or dollars or Dinars or whatever in the marriage contract why because 10 15 years down the line they may have their differences and she may file for color so the judge would say give back your dowry and she says I didn't receive any or I went to Hajj five years ago how much was the Hajj here we come to a crossroad because the husband says 10 000 Euros she says 2 000 Euros so we have to quantify it and put a figure to it and Allah Knows Best"
