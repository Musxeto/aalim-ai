  "transcript": "the seera of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam is his biography now uh um brother Sammy why do you think we should study the Syrah of the Prophet Allah in my point of view I think first of all that Allah the almighty said in the Holy Quran you as Muslims should take the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam peace and prayers may be upon him as their role model for you okay then we should uh so you know and and learn more and correctly throughout our Prophet Muhammad so this means that although we have the Holy Quran for us to read and learn from yet we need a role model an example to follow him in all his deeds in applying these instructions from Allah so this is a very great and important objective by itself to study the Sera of the Prophet Allah do you have any other reason yeah I think our Everlasting miracle in Islam is the Quran is the Quran the Holy Quran okay and how would we understand the Quran without studying the biography of the prophet he was the manifestation of the Quran and the wind said Allah peace with her as was asked about the prophet she said he was a woken Quran among the people okay so it's the only way to understand the Quran is to study his biography well to correct this uh brother Muhammad the Hadith was not as you have mentioned it because with her was asked about the morals the ethics of the Prophet so she asked this gentleman or man who's asking her do you recite the Quran so he said yes I do so she told him that the prophet salallahu sallam's ethics and morals were the Quran so he was not a walking Quran this was said about the companions being applying the Quran in their life as if they were walking Quran with this instructions manifested in their behavior so again this is a very valid point we need to study the zero of the Prophet because it explains to us the Quran in the best way possible whatever the prophet saws did was by the instructions and Orders of Allah so you will never ever find any conflict with the Quran and with the teachings of the Prophet salallahu which you can easily find out through studying the seerah of the prophet and again we have to study the Sierra so that we could inform others the non-muslims about this great man and if you ask anyone of the non-muslims about the prophet salallahu you would find the majority not knowing about him and this is partly their mistake yet it is mainly our mistake because we have not done our role we have not done our homework in sharing this vast and important knowledge with the others foreign"
