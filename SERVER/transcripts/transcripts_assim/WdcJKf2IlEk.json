  "transcript": "yes sir thank you very much sir I can remember my Arabic language teacher told me that it is not in every situation we know how to response to or we response to excellently it is Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that guides and help us to do the right thing we Muslims must pray and read the Quran and I also believe Allah subhah wa taala will never forget me is nearest to me than I think sorry sir please I I would like to have more advice on this this is a very generic topic and it's not be fitting a Q&A session Allah's subhah wa tala's ability control knowledge hearing and seeing of everything is closer to us than our juggler veins though we acknowledge that Allah is above all and he's above his throne over the seven Heavens subhah wa ta'ala so his ability and control of everything his knowledge of everything gives us the confidence and give gives us the comfort that we have Allah by our sides so we trust him we have full tle on him we Depend and rely en entirely on him and we have no trust on in other than him subhanahu wa'ta'ala and this is how every Muslim should be and your heart should be filled with such emotions as mentioned before the break once you have this then you conquer the whole world because your belief that Allah is by your side would make you the strongest person the most confident person when you have other things in your heart that would tarnish your trust in Allah and this is where you will have problems"
