  "transcript": "[Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Alhamdulillah. And welcome to our first workshop on a book that has the title of and is the plural of which is the ruling, the verdict. And that is why people ask what is the hookum on touching an impurity. So we say that it is forbidden it is depending on the situation. So is the main pillar the thing that most people look for and it is the main thing. So is a book compiled by Abu Muhammad Abdani ali. Sometimes they call him aldi. And this causes a confusion because there are a number of scholars great scholars with the name of Ibad Makdi. And that is why they sometimes confuse this scholar with the compiler of the book known as Al-Mi which is one of the greatest and largest and most informative books of especially on comparative though the compiler or though the author was following the hali mhab and both were halies. Nevertheless, has great value. And why is that? First of all, it's 400 plus hadith. And what does that mean? It means that it is purely hadith. It is purely the sunnah of the prophetatam. And this makes it far easier for us to relate to the hookum to the ruling to the verdict. I don't have to say this was backed by Imam so and so or imam so and so. I'm taking it from the source from the Quran from the Sunnah. And that is why the easiest way to give fatwa is to quote a Quranic verse or a hadith. You don't dispute. Some people ask me what's the ruling on a woman traveling without a maham. I don't have to say scholar so and so and scholar so and so said. All what I have to do is it is reported in the sah that the prophet saidatam it is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a mahab that the person asking the question says yes but sheh so and so says so and so I have no comment I'm telling you this is what the prophet said are you looking for someone else therefore this hadith gives you power because it direct directs you and it directs your thinking into what or how you should address questions regarding halal and haram which means that this book is in the field of and is jurispudent. So it tells us the rulings halal, haram, permissible, prohibited, how to do forms of worship, how to have different acts of transactions. This is it does not deal with so it does not deal with it does not deal with the hell and paradise. It does not deal with belief in general of angels of messengers of books because this is another field of this is what you believe in. This has to do with halal and haram rules, regulations, verdicts. It does not also deal with the Quran and the interpretation or the commentary on the Quran. It does not deal with with how to morally enhance your ethics in the sense that this is the etiquette you should follow and these are the things you should not do regarding etiquette. It deals with halal and haram. This book has been widely accepted throughout the Muslim world despite the school of thought because though the author was or the compiler was a following the however due to the nature of the book it does not involve anything of his own madhab it involves authentic hadith. And the question that may arise is everything in this book authentic hadith? Are all the hadiths authentic? The compiler said that they are all from the sah and the majority of the hadiths we're going to study are agreed upon. What do we mean by agreed upon? It was narrated by Albkari and Muslim. And we always hear this wrong impression or the wrong description. We hear people say the six books. This is wrong. There are only two books bkar and Muslim. And the other four Abu D and Maj they includes authentic and weak. And some may include even less than that. But the Bkari and Muslim the whole um of approve of them and accept them to have all authentic hadiths. So this book is one of the highest in degree of authenticity. Yet this is the minimum requirement for any student of knowledge. And that is why this is not an advanced book. People usually when they start studying hadith that is related to and one would say what is the difference between hadith and hadith is the source of Islam Quran and hadith is the understanding the comprehension the blessing and gift and favor of Allah upon those who are favored. The prophet said whomever Allah wills him good Allah would grant him the in Islam in religion. So if you see someone who has this understanding this comprehension not only that plus practice then this is a person whom allahel has favored whom allahel willed goodness for him. And if you see a Muslim who's rich, who's famous, but he is ignorant, he doesn't know the dean, then you know that Allah did not will good for that person. Now scholars differed in the way they acquire knowledge. Some of them focused only on so they collected the opinion of Abdah Mubarak allah all the companions Abbas on one schoolbar on the other school and all the seven jurors of Medina they differed but these people who concentrated on collected everything and they had a vast asked huge amount of knowledge. However, there is a lot of dispute and differences in these information they collected and without the test, without the equation that we can filter this information, we will have a lot of trouble. And that is why Allah tells us if you dispute in anything, what you do? Refer it back to Allah and to his messenger. meaning refer it back to the Quran and the Sunnah otherwise we will be in trouble. Why? Because what's the ruling on drinking? School A says haram. School B says halal. School C says not recommended. School D says it is highly recommended. I'm lost. What to do? Allah says if you dispute, refer to the Quran and Sunnah. Let me crossexamine and know whether it is halal or haram or recommended or not recommended. Now without the knowledge of hadith you're unable to do this because I can give you 100 hadiths and you can get all the all the rulings from them but if they're all weak or fabricated then you're building your religion on fabricated things. And that is why without the knowledge of hadith you will always find it difficult to know Islam properly. However with only the knowledge of hadith it will be difficult for you to understand the hadith without the the tools of so it is not a specialtity that you have to take one and leave the other. A proper student of knowledge has to have a vast amount, a vast quantity, a vast knowledge of all sciences so that he would be able to judge and to learn and to study. So to go back to where we started is at the lowest level, meaning it's for beginners, and we're all beginners. We have a break. After the break inshallah we'll continue on our topic between and hadith. So stay tuned. Asalam alalaykum and welcome back. So if you want to study alone pure you go to the hali school of thought theafi the maliki and select one of the summarized books of it tells you water is divided into three parts and they move on without mentioning to you where did they get this from what's the evidence behind it they only tell you that this is haram and move But this is not the right way of studying. Though it is one part for a beginner, it's good that he goes through one school of thought summarized book. Now for those like you and me who are interested only in the things that please Allah. Okay, this book of does not please Allah. It might be, it might not because I don't know if this is what allahel revealed or not. I don't know if this is what the prophetam taught or not. I believe that 80% of it is authentic. It's right. But 20% may not be based on authentic evidence. So they follow another school of thought and that is the school of thought of hadith. And this school of thought definitely all the scholars the great scholars they are followers of a particular madhab. But they do not let their madhab come first. They let the Quran and Sunnah come first following it through the guidelines of their madhab. And this hadith or this book is an illustration. If you open the book, you'll find that it's 420 plus hadiths and it's all based under chapters. What do you mean by chapters? Is based under chapters. Hadith usually is based under either chapters of or narrators. So like the books of Musnad Musnad Ahmed it's divided into narrators. So you have the Muslim of Abu Bakr the Musl of Omar all the hadith that Omar narrated it's in one chapter then he moves to Abu then you have you have an so regardless whether it's on subjects or not no but this is what he narrated may Allah be pleased with him the companion in the books of based on hadith no they all begin with purity They all begin with water, the types of water, utensils because this is what you carry water in and then they move into the second pillar of Islam which is salat prayer. So why did they start with water? Why did they start with utensils? Why did they start with uh water skins types of skins? Because at the time the water containers were made of what? Skin. So what kind of skin is permissible for me to put water? And what is the use of that? Because this is related to the second pillar. The first pillar deals with it's not our topic. The deals with the books of here we focus on. So we begin with tahara and this includes menes of women minstruation and this includes wudoo includes includes purifying your clothes your body after answering the call of nature. How do you purify yourself? All of this is an introduction to prayer. Then they move to prayer the second pillar of Islam and they talk about the five prayers. They talk about the voluntary prayers. They talk about the uh uh prayers that are the the eclipse asking Allah for water. And before all of that, they talk about timings. How do I know that the time of the prayer starts now or later? You have to identify this. And they go on until they finish everything related to prayer. How to pray it? Prayer in congregation. forgetfulness, sujud, prostration and a lot of things. Then they move to the third, fourth and fifth uh pillars of Islam regarding fasting, zakat and hajj. After we finish, which is the most important thing for us to learn. Why? Because Allah created us to do what? To do what? To worship him. I have not Allah says created the jin and the humans except to worship me. This is his command. Some may worship him. Some men not. Those who worship him will go to paradise. Those whom refuse will go to hell. So the book that deals with the five pillars of Islam is called the book ofat. Not that anything else is not part of worshiping Allah, but they're calling the forms of worship, the pillars of Islam to be forms of worship. And then they move on to the book of transactions. These are the categorization of books and they start usually with bu sales. What is permissible for you to sell? What is not permissible for you to sell? What is haram to deal with such as ribba, such as nash, and we will go to all of this inshallah to sell blindly to buy without naming the price anything that has disputes. Why they said because if you prayed and learned how to worship Allah, you need to eat and you cannot eat without buying. So they talk a lot about transactions, how to deal with others, how to sell in gold and silver, what is ribba, what is interest, what are the types of forbidden forms of buying and selling. And then after that some of them move and talk about foods because we have food, we know how to buy food. What to do? I'd like to know the foods. And this means the types of slaughtering, the types of haram food, the types of things that I can consume and things I cannot. And then after a person has prayed and learned his dean and bought something and filled his stomach with, what would he think usually about? Marriage. So they talk about marriage, how to propose, how to get married, how to get divorced. after you get divorced, how to have the waiting period and they move on and on and on and usually these things lead to fights, disputes. So they talk about chapters dealing with blood, talking about injuries, talking about murders, prescribed punishment in Islam. So everything is connected. Now Islam is huge but it is simple because it's from Allah because it's from our creator. It is extremely simple and as we inshallah we go through this great book you will find that it is extremely simple for all of us to learn. However this is as I've said for the beginners. So if you master this book you're entitled inshallah to go to stage two. And usually scholars say that stage two is the book of alam which was compiled by may Allah have mercy on his soul. See the beauty of hadith and the beauty of and the beauty of knowledge to students of knowledge is that the more knowledgeable they are the more appreciative they are to the other schools of thought and respectful they are to the other scholars. We have few minutes left. So we open the floor for any question related to the topic inshallah or a little bit off the topic is no problem. If I have the answer I will answer it inshallah. If I don't I'll simply say Allah. So who'd like to go for the first question? Yes brother Ashik. You mentioned that those a hadith that which deal with halal and haram that is the Jewish prudence does not include the adab. So is that the case that the adab the manners does not include the halal and the haram adab? Well the halal and haram adabs definitely have to be mentioned there. For example, one would say eating with my left hand or drinking with my left hand. What's the ruling on that? It's halal or haram. The majority say it is makru and the most authentic opinion it is forbidden. So by etiquate we meant to say that when entering a house how many times should you ask for permission three times the sunnah is to say may I come three times nobody answers you leave. So these are part of the etiquates that usually the books of especially these summarized versions do not mention. It is mentioned in the widely expanded books. Why? Because it comes through this process and they collect anything that deals with these things even or mustab and Allah knows best. Yes brotherhalamhikh as you said that we should respect the scholars who have difference of opinion but how to deal with those people who say that uh even after we show them a hadith they say you know our school of thought says this our school of thought says that. So how do we deal with those people? Well it depends on their ability and we always have to judge people in accordance to their ability not to ours. So if I go to someone who is unable to walk for 10 mters without resting, it is unfair for me to ask him to jog for a kilometer. His ability does not take him. It's it's wrong for me to go to someone whose job description does not have or does not include solving problems and I tell him I have a problem. do this, do that, something that's complicated. These people you're talking about usually have a limitation. They say and they believe I only follow my school of thought because if I go a little bit higher, I'm confused and I may reject Islam. Why? He says, listen, there's so many differences. I'm unable to know. You have to look at the ability. Yes. If this individual whom I'm telling him the hadith is authentic and he says I agree. I know is authentic but I don't want to follow it. I want to follow my mab or my im this person is ignorant. Pray for him and don't waste your time with him. But if someone is unable to distinguish what's right and wrong. So always remind him try to bring him to the authentic platform of Quran and Sunnah and tell him okay if you don't know this is what Allah said in the Quran and if you dispute in anything return it back to Quran and to the Sunnah if he agrees and complies alhamdulillah by time he will. I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time. [Music]"
