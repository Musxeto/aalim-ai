  "transcript": "i wanted to ask if it is an innovation if i do the morning and evening afkar institute during prayer and evening or morning in fajr or maghrib okay i will answer inshallah so solely is from germany's question is it an innovation to do the athkar of morning and evening during prayer the answer is yes why doing it not part of the atkar rather part of supplicating to allah praising allah glorifying allah this is okay in sujud but doing the atkar specifically at this time this is something that that the prophet did not do allah nor did his companions so you can't know better than them doing it would make it a an innovation allah knows best"
