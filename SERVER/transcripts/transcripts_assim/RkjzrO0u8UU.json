  "transcript": "or stopping an act of worship in front of people israel but is it only for obligatory worship or for the voluntary ones as well if you mean that you don't want to perform voluntary acts like praying sunna in front of others fearing of riya this is riya whether it's voluntary and if it is mandatory it is even worse than that one should do things for the sake of allah and should clarify or let's just rephrase that should purify his intention so whenever you want to do something always ignore what people would say when you do something let it be that what allah says about it is what counts whether people praise you or criticize you this has no value in your heart this is when you attain sincerity inshallah"
