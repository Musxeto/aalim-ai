  "title": "Bus driver lets me ride for free, must I insist to pay or can I ride for free? ￼￼assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu My question is, I get the bus sometimes and the bus driver, he's Muslim, and sometimes he just sort of lets me on for free, you know, just being friendly. My question is, is it permissible for me to accept that or do I need to insist that I pay? And because it's happened in the past as well, do I need to sort of now pay back the bus company for the times that he let me on for free? First of all, if this driver owns the bus, there's no problem in accepting his gift. But if he's not the owner and he's just a hired hand being paid to drive the bus and collect the fee, it is not permissible for you to accept his gift. This is not his bus. So you have to insist on giving him the fare. Now for what was in the past that you did not know the ruling, insha'Allah there is no sin on you, the sin is on him or on those who allowed this. And this is a serious issue that everyone should be concerned of. When Allah appoints you in a position and you're in charge, this is an amanah. And what you're entrusted with, there are so many verses of the Qur'an and hadith that highlights the importance of amanah. And a lot of us are oblivious and sometimes deliberately negligent and ignorant about it because they think that I am the person in charge of the restaurant, I can give free meals to my friends, I'm in charge of the bus, I can give free rides, nobody's auditing me, Allah is. And this is an amanah that you should be aware. And this cascades to all sectors of life where Allah appoints you as a person of charge, in charge of a division, of a person or persons of property, of wealth. Allah will hold you questionable for that and Allah knows best. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for all. you"
