  "transcript": "jihan says um spouse are destined for allah is this hadith true i always get this question and i wonder what is meant by it so after some pondering i think that a lot of the people try to comfort themselves when they say that a potential shooter came and left and we regret that he or she rejected our proposal so in order to comfort themselves that they they say that spouses are destined and by allah so this was not meant to be so it will not happen also when a woman marries a man and he's abusive or he's not practicing she goes to the elders and complains seeking advice seeking divorce and they comfort her by saying it's destined by allah you have to live with it and this is not entirely true in the sense that it should not be meant to accept mistakes and to live with these mistakes to the end of your life just because it was tested by allah no allah tells us to seek a cure and solve our problems if i'm starving if i'm hungry this was destined by allah but also allah azzawajal has told me to go and look for food and eat if a woman has an abusive husband or someone who does not practice or someone who oppresses her when it comes to religious practices we don't tell her it's destined by allah keep your mouth shut and live like a slave no you have the right to file for divorce you have the right to go to the police and complain about his physical abuse if you can back this up with evidences medical reports etc you have the right to file for horror if he is not suitable for you and to your family and your children so yes marriage is destined by allah your spouse is destined by allah but so is your divorce so is dying so is illnesses so is everything that happens in this world nothing happens without it being destined by allah"
