  "transcript": "i prostrated for sure in front of a leader that i admire that got appointed my intention was to do this because he got the appointment but those around him said i prostrated before him my sinful place i don't know if you're sinful or not because this is between you and allah only allah knows what's in your chest if you did this sincerely for the sake of allah azzawajal then yes you're not sinful but if you did this to show the leader that you're happy for him or to show others that you are happy and you chose this direction from all other directions to prostrate to your leader when you know that it is a cultural thing in your country to bow or to kneel or to prostrate now this is can be a sinful or shirk maybe if it it can amount to shirt but this is between you and allah i you don't need a a verdict from me as a mufti this is between you and allah and you know what is in your heart more than anyone else"
