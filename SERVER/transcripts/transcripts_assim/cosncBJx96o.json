  "title": "Daes say jobs are halal even if they contain some haram (Kafir countries) Is it true assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "say that if you are living in a cafe country it is very difficult to find a 100 adult job as you will most and you will as he will almost always find some Haram elements here and there so they say that if a job is mostly Halal and there are only small elements of Haram then it is negligible and the income is halal and they give an examples such as a person he stocks up shelves with food and at times he may have to put some head on food such as pork but mostly he is placing halal food so this group of chefs they say that the Haram is negligible and hence the income is halal but then another group of chefs they say that what is the correct approach in this specific situation okay the general trend is that we Muslims have a red line that we cannot cross so these a group of guys who say and claim that little elements of Haram are permissible this is too genetic and it has to be judged Case by case to evaluate the amount of Haram when they say that's permissible to put Haram items on the shelf and to handle them what would I do with the Hadith of the Prophet Allah when he cursed 10. in intoxicants wine whiskey Etc and among them those who carry it those who hold it so when I'm placing them and stocking them on the shelves wouldn't I be cursed by Allah definitely I would so there is no compromise in such issues when I sell it when I'm working as a cashier and 95 percent of what I sell is halal five percent is Haram lottery tickets pork intoxicants beer wine whiskey Etc so these group of Scholars say that it's okay it doesn't make your income Haram no definitely this is unacceptable and not true"
