  "transcript": "haslin says is it permissible to pray if someone is lying in front of us I kept Sutra between me and the person who is sleeping before my prayer rug it's just permissible even if you don't have a suit or even if the person is lying in front of you directly there's no problem the problem is is someone crossing in front of you while praying in the authentic hadith mother aisha tells us that the prophet sallallaahu assalam used to pray night prayer and our house was so small that there was no place for him to prostrate and me to sleep at the same time so she says that I used to sleep in front of him and whenever he wants to prostrate he used to pinch me so that I would pull away my legs after he finishes prostrating and stands up I would extend my legs back again so there's no problem in that inshallah"
