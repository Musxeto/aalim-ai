  "title": "Taweez with Quran ayahs, black dot, tie thread on wrists, blue eye to prevent evil eye, black magic",
  "transcript": "any type of um or as they call it in the subcontinent visa any type of things that people wear whether it's a blue eye or ayatul kursi or the kaaba or they hang or tie a thread around their uh wrists or they put a black dot here or there though the black dot has some origin but it's still we have to look into it all these types thinking that they would prevent from an evil eye from black magic from gin possession from envy all of this is considered to be minor ship the black dot has an origin but whether it's authentic or not this is an issue of dispute that some of the companions used to prefer putting a block dot on a newborn cheek or chin so it would give him something of imperfection especially if the child is beautiful and people oh look at him chubby nice beautiful so this black dot would draw their disliking a little bit but i i believe it's in mufrad i can't remember at the moment whether it's authentic or not either way if this is the intention one should not do it and allah azza knows best"
