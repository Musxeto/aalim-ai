  "transcript": "i in my in jeddah in where i come from a brother came to me asking for a meeting in my house which i rarely do all my counselling is online because when you see them face to face you don't know if you're going to get a gun or a knife or stab you so he said i want to meet you so i said okay come he came with his wife and his mother and they were newly married what's the complaint my mother is not happy with my wife and my wife is not obeying my mother subhanallah who is married you are your mom siddia but she has to obey my mom she has to ask her permission to no no she's not cooking sheikh she's not your servant she is not obliged to cook for your mother or for your sister only you and your children but sheikh my in the subcontinent and then the mother spoke who sounded like a reasonable person the moment she opened her mouth when i was young when i got married they mistreated me they made me work like a maid i had to serve 20 people and i said subhanallah were you happy he said no so then why are you treating your daughter-in-law the same fashion because i was treated like this subhanallah because they wronged you you want to wrong someone else fear allah subhanallah people don't think they only want what serves them the hell with everybody else i just want my water if you guys don't drink and die this is wrong this is not how things happen so if she wants to go to visit her parents allow her if she wants to go out for something that is halal especially if you're allowing her or be with her more than great if the prophet ali islam prohibited men from stopping their wives from attending the masjid so if your wife wants to go to the masjid you cannot say don't go the prophet says you cannot let her go so what's more important the masjid or her father's house that'd be logical number 11 10 who cares who's counting number 10 it's even worse oh yeah through masha'allah one of your wife's rights over you to be jealous what yes women love men who are jealous i thought that they don't like this no what they don't like is when you wake up in the morning you say you take the children to school i want to sleep how come they take the children to you go and bring the groceries you go and talk to the utility company pay the bills go to the bank she's going to deal with men so yeah it's okay i at least i get enough time to go and play playstation with my boys and watch tv you have to have jealousy this is one of her rights that you protect her that you are the man she's not married to another woman she's married to a man who protects her who takes care of her who is the guardian of the house but jealousy must be governed i know men who are psychopath he says to his wife whenever he comes to the room who are you talking to she is alina my friend let me listen for what i want to know if he's not a man what do you mean you you're accusing me after all these years i said did you see anything wrong no but you can never be sure you have to always you know maybe subhanallah this is haram this is jealousy that allah hates but if there are traces there are signs then this jealousy is within place what you're doing is sick so yes it has to be governed in the proper channels and there are ways of that but we cannot explain it now number 10 men have needs and so do women so you have to fulfill her needs intimacy her needs in bed i get problems for women my husband did not touch me for six months why maybe he's impotent he said no he spends all day long watching pornography and he does the secret habit oh this guy is sick why is that why is this and we talked to him i have a house i give her money i have everything for her yes but she needs a man this is what marriage is for otherwise we would have married by correspondence she's in australia and i'm in america this is marriage enough through skype how are you fine no this is it doesn't work like this she ha and this is why scholars say at least you have to have intimacy with her once every four days as if you had four wives so three nights with your wives the fourth is with her so this is the least that could be happening and this is why people must be considerate because you have rights and she has rights as well if your rights were little and you don't feel the need she may feel the need so don't force her to look for it somewhere else may allah forbid number 11 finally you have to be appreciative to your wife whatever she does when was the last time you said thank you rarely when she does a good meal do you say thank you it's an excellent meal you did a good job said no this is the norm why should i when she does a bad meal i would say this is bad this is not good the prophet says islam he who does not thank people does not thank allah so you have to show this form of appreciation to your wife when the house is clean when the kids are always tidy and with their hair clean and they're washed and ready to sleep and the food is good your clothes are everything is perfect what do you say ah there is dust on the cupboard what is this some brothers are like this i know my one of my relatives i would not call his relationship whenever he enters his home the first thing he does he goes down to the carpet and takes a small tiny little white thread that no one sees and he does everything is clean and sparkling he sees only the faults he's like a fly falls only on dirt doesn't see the good picture no this is not right now we move on to the rights of the spouse of the man of the husband but seriously i don't know the time frame we've spent one hour for the sisters so that they won't shoot me now now whatever i say alhamdulillah i gave you one hour what would you want more now we talk about men as stated earlier men have more rights than women why because allah azza made them superior and gave them more rights over women so they have equal rights but men have an extra level an extra edge this is what allah says in the quran so what does it mean first you have to as a wife obey him in what is considered to be natural whatever is ordinary or accepted allah says in the quran men are in charge of women by right of what allah has given one over the other and what they spend of maintenance from their wealth secondly so obeying him is a must secondly that she surrenders herself whenever he asks her for intimacy because the urge of men wanting women is far urgent and stronger than women wanting men this is why if you have 30 men in a circle and you get miss universe walking in the middle of them even if you have shaykhs they would turn their eyes because it's something here but if you have 30 women and you get tom cruise for example anyone who is extremely manly and handsome maybe five or six women would look and the rest would not look because they are based on being bashful being shy being modest while men are not this is human nature so men are exposed to fitna far more than women when you go outside this is this is why men are not ordered to wear the hijab because women can look at men not the other way around women men cannot look at women this is why they are supposed to cover the fitnah is greater so a wife must not refuse intimacy with her husband ah we'll curse her oof the prophet said allah whenever a man calls his wife for intimacy and she rejects him the angels will curse her until sun rise all the night may allah curse you may only curse you email the question she's sleeping in the bed and she's being cursed by angels because of this what does this tell you tells you that this is an important thing that women even if she doesn't love him even if she hates him even if he does whatever he does she knows that this is her responsibility to allah you want paradise the prophet says aslam a woman when she prays her five prayers fasts ramadan protects her chastity obeys her husband she will enter paradise that's it four things but men oh you have to pray in the masjid you have to enjoy and prohibit evil you have to provide for your wife or your children you have to take care of your mother and father you have to provide for them you have to so many things in order to get to an uh paradise but women have only four things to us men it's easy no it's not easy it's as difficult as jihad because she has to tolerate your bad breath when was the last time you brush your teeth your beard even if you have a beard why don't you put perfume why do you shampoo it why don't you put some balsam in it do something and your belly masha'allah is like two meters ahead of you when do you go to the gym why don't you work out take care of yourself but she does this all in spite of all of this seeking the reward from allah azzawajal number three she must this is the husband right protect his name protect his honor now we know that chastity is something between her and allah but there's an extra edge because she's carrying his name in the sense that she's his wife not that he she is taking his family name this is haram in islam allah says let's move on because we have so many number four one of the husband writes that she does not admit to my house anyone with whom i do not want so for example she wants her uncle to come and visit her and she knows i don't like her uncle and i tell her don't let your uncle come why i have my reasons whose house is it it's my house so the prophet says it is not permissible for a woman to admit any person in her house without his permission so this is something that is fixed you cannot judge any let's negotiate no i will not allow people in without my husband's permission number five she should take care of his money so i leave my wallet with my wife a big mistake but i trust my wife she should fear allah azza and not abuse this trust by taking money and going to the mall buying a wedding dress buying jewelry buying this and that without my knowledge the prophet says a woman is a shepherd over the house of her husband and his children and she is accountable on the day of judgement over them so she should fear allah azzawajal spent in things that she must in food in utilities in the house in medicine in education whatever but things that are extravagant are not permissible taking money from your husband and mother this is stealing haram yeah but my father is poor and he needs food yeah you take your husband's permission he doesn't allow me whose money is it his money you cannot take without his permission number six i hate it when people note down things like this this means they're serious about it it's just playing around don't take it serious so you have to take care of his children they are your children but at the end of the day imagine if you manage to get your five-year-old and teach him or her the fatiha every time when they're 60 or 70 years of age reading the fat you are getting rewarded so don't let your husband do it you teach them salah you choosing fasting you teach them you teach them hadith you teach them etiquette don't always think of this dunya of i'm doing everything what are you doing you're just sitting there on your mobile whatsapp instagram and i'm have to do the work i have to clean i have to wash i have to take care of the children i have to teach him for school no no no no this is your god-given gift because if you think of the future not only the the long-term investment i can put my money in a short-term investment put one ringgit get 1.1 ringgit but if i put it in a long-term investment and make a factory or a farm that will produce after 10 years but 10 folds then this quick investment i have to be smart your children are your investment so take care of them number seven remain home and we've gone through this you cannot leave home without his permission not without your visa card huh you cannot leave home without his permission so and when women you become agitated when they hear this is not cooperative he's not why should i beg from him what listen a man is a big child if you know how to treat children well you play with him like a ring in your finger seriously when your child you're feeding him you shove it down his throat no he said okay look look look at the airplane and he opens his mouth of course your husband you say look at this ferrari he opens his wallet so you have to try your level best to treat him as a wise woman don't go to his down to his level no treat him like a child whatever he wants you you say yes but you're the master you're the real master in the house and it brings me pain when i say this because my wife is the master i try to resist i can't she manipulates me she plays with me like a football and i'm happy she knows how to do it masha allah i hope she's not watching number eight one of the husbands writes is that his woman cannot fast voluntary fasting without his permission so the prophet says a woman must not fast without the permission of her husband as long as he is present but if he is traveling on a business trip for a month should i call him and say listen uh tomorrow is monday can i fast no he's not there so voluntary fast if i'm fasting ramadan making up ramadan you don't need his permission he cannot force you to break your fasting this is something that is known to all of you number nine a woman must show her gratitude and never ever show her in gratitude why the prophet said specifically for women but it can also be cascaded to men but the norm is women do have this a lot the prophet said o women give charity why for i have seen that you from the majority of the people of hell fire the women said why is that a prophet of allah why are we women the majority of hellfire so the prophet said you curse frequently and are ungrateful to your husband they are ungrateful to their companions the husband and ungrateful for good treatment the prophet explains if you are kind to one of the women for a lifetime then she sees one undesirable thing in you she will say i have never had anything good from you this is nature human nature in some women not all of them but i've seen this i've sat with so many counseling sessions and they the minute they pick up the phone or we start the session my husband did this my husband did that he never brought me a gift he never did i said okay i will kill your husband because he doesn't have anything good in him so no no no he has a lot of things that are good so you all he only mentioned the negative things he said yes because this is counseling session why should i tell you that he's kind that he's loving that he's caring that he is honoring my parents do you imagine he got my mother a present and he my father he gave him a hundred thousand ringgit as a loan and he made my younger brother work in his company he has a lot of good things but all what you succeed in saying are the negatives the shortcomings this is exactly what the prophet islam is warning from so a good woman does the opposite i know women in my family and elsewhere whenever the husband comes home she greets him at the door masha allah may allah give you wealth and health and bless your your money and bless your power and your children you know out of respect the wife calls her husband the father of ahmed for example bring you jannah the guy says i've been shopping for two hours and i have two big bags of groceries and it's difficult i'm going up and down up and down the stairs but the moment she says this to me i'm in paradise and the same thing happens when a man is served food and the husband eats the first what is wrong with you [Music] the food is wow subhanallah so delicious where did you get it from she said i cooked it said no no no don't lie to me no no way you cook this masterpiece i'm not going to finish it no no i'm going to put it in the guest room this is too much how would she feel would feel that she has the whole world in her hand it's diplomacy it's compassion it's what comes out of your mouth that makes your house a living hell or a paradise time i have guests in the house i have this tendency myself as a husband i don't like my wife to cook why because i don't like to see her spending two or three hours in the kitchen for what for guests i pay money i get one sheep for one thousand rails eat rice and cheap eat and we will have a lot of food left over but for my wife to go and spend three hours cooking and fixing so what do i do after the guests go i come to her and i say ya allah if you just heard the food they were shocked they said that this is the most beautiful food they have ever tasted and it is lousy but i'm lying because i cannot say anything else i lie see they said the food was good the food was great and they want their wives to call you to know how the recipe how would she feel tell us three hours gone down the drain so you have the ability to make your spouse happy whether you're a man or a wife or a woman but you have to train yourself you have to respect yourself respect your spouse also know that this is a teamwork it is not a one-man show and i conclude this uh lecture of mine with a story that i always mention about my wife may allah grant her long life and dies before me i don't know she's going to kill me definitely so i think i'm going to die first but alhamdulillah how many years do we have to live every time she cooks most of the time it's good sometimes you know human nature you make error the food is uneatable allah you cannot eat it this is some this is not even good for human consumption she puts the food salad and i eat only one course i don't eat rice and only one plate so i take one spoon two spoon three spoon and a lot of salad salad salad salad until it's finished and i said masha'allah photo is good and she's watching me like this and she's liar excuse me she said why do you lie why don't you say that the food is bad i said it was good said no it's not good it's not good for human consumption i was yeah she said about herself she i i did i messed up apologize but why don't you say the truth i said listen i don't take you when i travel i travel the world i never take you on my travels i never take you to restaurants i never take you to the beach side which is 10 minutes away from my home my kids begged me please you're stabbing me don't this is something wrong in me i don't bring you jewelry i don't i'm a bad husband the only thing i'm good is is lying so do you expect me after you tolerating all my shortcomings to come and say for food that you spent an hour and a half in the kitchen doing that it's bad well i'll be crazy this is how life goes this is how you feel the love that you have shortcomings she has shortcomings we're even alhamdulillah don't hold one against her she holds 10 against you and may allah grant those who are already married the best of marital life and those who are interested in getting married the best of the wives to be the coolness to their eyes foreign"
