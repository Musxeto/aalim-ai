  "transcript": "let her handle him alhamdulillah hello bill I mean sallallahu wa sallim wa barik ala aalihi wa rasuluh mean nabina muhammad in wasabi he has okay bismillah mandolin salat wa salam o allah rasool allah this hadith has been reported in the side so now is an audible move red part of the sahih yes or no no it's a separate book so hey Hal Bihari has many chapters in it one of them then chapters is called an atom but this one is a separate book called an atom Alma ffred which means that the condition of authenticity is not similar to sahih al-bukhari it is much lenient nevertheless it contains a lot of the hadith found in Albahari itself about la ilaha Fairy the one in this story is so Abu Dharr Allah fatty was one of the great companions of the Prophet are they sought asylum in fact he says that I was one of five only in Islam what does that mean he was very early nevertheless this statement is not entirely correct why because in the beginning of Islam we had three years of secret Dawa which meant that a lot of the Muslims did not know the others so Sodom never your costs may Allah be pleased with him one of the ten heaven-bound used to say I was one of three in Islam but there was hadiza there was Ali there was of a Bakr there was a demographer they did not know of each other because we were secret but nevertheless when he says about that I was five of Islam meaning that he was among the very earliest to accept Islam and he was not only a companion he was a scholar to the extent that he used to give fatwa at the time of Abu Bakr Omar and Othman which means that he was knowledgeable there are companions that are good companions but they don't have the knowledge to give fatwa of who that was one among of those and this would pave the way for you to see how the Prophet Elias Auto Salaam treated him now Alma reverse way it he saw Abu Dharr a love affair with a slave of his and each one was wearing half a garment what does that mean everyone was covering his top and the other one was covering his bottom no definitely not in the past the Arabs used to wear a suit like garment so they you know when you go for a Haram you have the waist wrapper and you have something to cover your upper body this is known as hula it's a suit like so my or saw a Buddha with this half suit on him and the other half is on his slave servant so he said I would then yeah if one of you wore it it would have been more appropriate it would look like you know a full suit instead of sharing it with someone and you're walking with this half and he's walking with that half so a Buddha explained and his explanation came to us from another narration what's the story there was a dispute he said between me and one of the companions and in another hadith we were told that this companion was Bilal I'd know raba the black Abyssinian slave who was among the first to accept Islam at the time of Makkah who was tortured in the sight of allah azza wajal a Buddha was a great companion Bilal was a great companion yet they had differences so he said once I disputed with him we were in a heated argument and at the moment I was not thinking straight so I slandered him with his mother what did he say he said you are the son of a black woman footnote what was the color of Bella's mother she was black so what's the problem did he lie he was the son of a black woman he didn't lie but what was his intention when he said it now what did bill I'll do nothing Bilal went to the Prophet Alistair son and complained so the Prophet I have summoned a Buddha come I'd like to see you a boozer comes did you slaughter him with his mother did you say that you are the mother that son of a black woman a Buddha said yes o prophet of Allah what did the Prophet respond Allah saw some he said you are a man with some ignorant in you a Buddha was quite old in his age not only that he is knowledgeable he is among the first to accept Islam to live Coover which is known in Arabic what jahiliya ignorance is Kjell so when the Prophet accuses him by saying you are a man with some ignorant with some jahiliyyah in you he said to him o prophet of Allah after this age you are accusing me of this and telling me of this after this age the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam yes and then he said this hadith now the hadith is crystal clear the prophet alayhi salaatu sam said your brothers are your charges they are your responsibility the Arabic word for used in here is hawa newcomb and honoka means your slaves now the issue is Bilal was not a slave anymore Bilal was a free man so when the Prophet al-assad is telling a Buddha your servant your slave is under your charge you have to feed him from what you eat you have to clothe him from what you wear you have to not assign things that are difficult and beyond his ability this is for a slave what is the slave a slave that you buy and sell what about belong belong is a free man so it should have been known to you that this is known as bab Allah what is the meaning of bab allah in islamic terminology sometimes allah tells us in the Quran about something and this is the bare minimum and whatever is above it is by default so when allah says to us do not say to any of your parents off what is off it's a gesture that you say it shows your discontent so if someone says I will never say to my mother off but if she tells me to do something I will push her and maybe beat her what are you doing he said Allah did not say do not beat your parents did he know where it is lamp or Quran in Sunna I follow for Ana's Sunnah Masha Allah to Allah you follow your Shaitaan is it show me in the Quran where Allah says do not beat your parents or in the pseudonym okay you crazy the Prophet this is known in firk but those terrorists those who only follow their whims and desires don't understand Quran Sunnah this is why it's very dangerous if you don't have the knowledge the proper knowledge studying it with you and understanding not blind following you have to understand Islam is a religion of nature it's logical but you have to open your mind to understand it the Prophet says Allah so some do not urinate in stagnant water then perform woudl correct basic hadith so once there's hmm do not urinate okay I will do it in a ball in a bottle and then pour the bottle in the water I did not urinate in it so I can do now would do okay what did you get this understanding should Haditha scream do not urinate I did not turn it in the water I just spilled urine in it someone else says okay I will not you turn it but I'll difficut the Prophet did not say do not defecate it only you relate this is Bab Huna the minimum and whatever is above it it's crystal clear in likewise here the Prophet is saying if these three servants of yours you have to feed them you have to if he is indicating this while addressing the issue of Bilal it shows you how Islam orders us to treat the slaves the Prophet is saying this hadith towards a free man whose belong then how should I treat someone who is under my control and under my servant I don't know if we need to go to this and I don't remember if I tackle this issue last year I don't think you even remember it but nowadays Muslims are intimidated whenever you speak they hold things against you so if I wear from the media and I would like to hold something against me I would say how he is promoting slavery his first hadith is talking about slavery and this is against the Geneva Convention and this is against human rights and this is against animal rights and they make an issue out of it first of all do not be intimidated are you proud of your religion understand your religion and know that your religion is not tailor-made for a region or a country or a tribe or a race this is a religion for the entire universe and not for a specific time it's for all times until the day of judgement so sure you mean to tell me that slavery is applicable today it's applicable until the day of judgement but what slavery are we talking about and I don't want to go out of the topic but unfortunately it is essential that you understand so that when someone comes to you and says your religion has this and this and this and this you don't concave on yourself and start thinking should I put a rope and hang myself or not no be proud of your religion slavery is the answer for a global problem we have nowadays wars happening either just or unjust no one who claims to have human rights ever commented on the wars done by the kuffar so hiroshima nagasaki halal Haram this is human rights don't bring this up world war one world war two don't bring this up Afghanistan Iraq the bombardment of these countries the killing of the millions worldwide don't bring this up what's happening to the brothers in ravindra in Raqqa Iraq on don't bring this up we have wars ongoing some are just some are unjust Islam deals with the prisoner of wars issue in the best of humane ways by enslaving them oh enslavement Haram human rights wait wait wait hold your horses tie them outside and there is a parking area you can have enough place for the horses hold your horses because first of all do we have problem of prisoners of war yes so how does this lump solve this because the issue of war is inevitable we at the moment the Muslims have no wars they're just defending themselves but what happens if there were a Muslim war or if there are prisoners that are non-muslims kill them all this is one option mentioned in surah Mohammed or ask for ransom option 2 or set them free they will become recruited again and they will attack us but it's an option for enslavement they become slaves by nowadays compare slavery in Islam to any other slavery I go to X Y Z country in Asia they're so poor devastated he says come by my son $400 he's yours he's a slave by my daughter for $200 she's your slave some tribes like in Africa before they used to come and arrest people who are free and shipped them to America and to Europe why because they're free we can do this so slavery in other nations has a lot of venues and channels in Islam how many channels do we have only one and this is when the Muslims fight in a just and fair war against the non-muslims ok then Islam encourages slavery no it doesn't how do you mean we have so many slaves ok look at the chapter of expirations in Islam share i swore by Allah tomorrow I will not have dinner with my friend but now he's serving a very nice Brioni what should I do expiate for your oath how free a slave Oh first thing free a slave one says Oh chef I made something wrong I had intimacy with my wife during the daytime of Ramadan and I broke my fast free a slave share I said to my wife you are Haram for me I didn't divorce her this is called mija you are like my mother or like my sister I will never have intimacy with you now I am regretful free a slave share how I was driving down the highway and I've overslept and the car rolled and I killed someone by mistake this is not my slaughter it's much mistake-free a slave and so on so the chapter of expirations all encourages you to do what to free slaves not only that why are you a Muslim because I want to go to Jinnah and escape Hellfire no problem free a slave ha the Prophet says assume whoever frees a slave Allah will free with each organ of the slave and organ of his from Hellfire so when you free a slave next time make sure he has two arms and two legs be careful and if you free to female slaves Allah will free you from Hellfire what kind of a religion is this it's a religion of global thinking of peace so it doesn't only tell you to have slaves it tells you how to free them and the channels of freeing them are far greater than the channels of keeping and having them so this hadith shows you the status of slaves in Islam I'm the master I'm the owner I can sell and buy like my horse outside in the parking a slave is like my horse I can sell him and by him I go to the market every Friday and I see the slaves and I buy whatever I want yet look what Islam tells you how to deal with them you close them from what you wear I would or did that you feed them from what you eat might seem food I'm going to I don't give brand names of restaurants XYZ restaurant and he eats with me and if I appoint a task for this slave you have to do this and this and this and it's too difficult for him the Prophet says give him a helping hand I don't give a helping hand to my servant or to my driver or to my coworker Islam tells you no you should if this is your slave this is a free man that you have to do this and allah azzawajal knows best moving on to the second hadith [Music] I see all of you articles and each of you is responsible for his flock man is possible for a man with the body of his family a woman is a shepherd of her husband's house and she's responsible as if the southern men replied to his master's property I heard those words from the Prophet sallallahu aleyhi wa salem and I reckoned that the prophets of once Allah also said and the man is responsible about the property of his father okay this hadith is scary because it addresses the question of accountability now we live free trouble-free we have no problem the Prophet says here no each one of us has a big problem the biggest problem of all is the problem of the Muslim ruler or anyone who has subordinates under him he is accountable to the extent that the Prophet Allah sosa the simul tude of a shepherd a Shepherd has sheep so I'm responsible for my ship the first one responsible for all of us is the Muslim ruler and this is why it is something entrusted to you you remember a Buddha a Buddha in an authentic hadith went to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and said o prophet of allah appoint me as a ruler over any district because the prophet there are districts an islamic a medina GTF etc so he said make me a ruler now a booter is knowledgeable a Buddha is capable maybe a Buddha is trustworthy definitely what did the Prophet say Allison he held him from his shoulders shook him up and said Abu Dharr it is a trust and on the day of judgment it is disgrace and shame meaning upon those who do not fulfill the requirements and you are weak meaning it's not good for you so he did not appoint any job nowadays everything works here with what we call wazifa you know what is wasa we in Arab the world we call it vitamin Wow it is not what you know it is who you know so I get appointed in the company in the government in any place the head because of who I know regardless if I can fulfil or not and this is why the Muslim world is going downhill because you have the people who are steering the ship cannot even swim so this hadith shows the gravity and seriousness of sin upon those who control who rule who legislate other than with the Sharia this is what they are going to be held accountable for one a person is responsible for those who are under him so if I have no government position I do not manage a company all what I have is my wife and children Allah will hold me accountable for whatever I did not do well with them is my wife abiding by her job are my children praying on time have I facilitated for them Haram things to see in their homes have i facilitated for them to go abroad and do sinful acts and turning a blind eye saying that their grown-ups their adults if they go and gamble if they fornicate if they drink this is their problem Allah will hold me accountable and the more you go up the more accountability you have so imagine the head of the state the head of the country how much burden he will come on the day of judgment the old rulers felt this Romar may Allah be pleased with him had sleepless nights and he's the second top man in the Muslim Ummah the Prophet Isis Salam is not included Abu Bakr then Rama Rama used to say by Allah he was in Medina if a mule were to trip in Iraq I am afraid that Allah will ask me about it may Allah have mercy upon your home are in Iraq we have not news humans falling in ditches dying out of poverty out of illness out of ignorance worldwide and the Muslims are unaware of it so this hadith is scary it frightens you especially if you are in a position to govern or to rule or to manage others and this hadith also tells us that the responsibility is not upon the rulers themselves it's also upon whomever governs something so even a woman is accountable in her house how she cooks cleans irons and that's it no she's interested with the food in her house so even if she goes and takes from the pocket of her husband and gives to the poor without his permission she is accountable if she sends food to her family without his permission she is accountable if she is keen and careful to take care of his children and of his wealth and of his well-being she's rewarded so it is something of great seriousness and also the servant is responsible for what he is being entrusted with being it financial being it tasks he's appointed to do with and this accountability is illustrated in the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he tells us that your feet the feet of the son of Adam will not move on the day of judgement until he's asked about five things so each and every one of you make sure that you will be questioned about these five questions number one the Prophet says Allah salatu salam your age where did you spend it in so you are 60 years of age 70 80 where was it spent all in prayer definitely not all in sin definitely hopefully not so you will be asked so prepare an answer the Prophet says Alyce awesome your youth and this is specific and why is it specific because age includes your infancy your youth and your old age but specifically you will be asked about your youth which is the longest period of your life when you're young and small this passes like a flashlight it's so short once you are young and youthful this lasts for 40 years 50 years you think it will never come to an end and that is why people are deceived by their youth they think they will stay young forever and the older they get they say we like wine the older it gets the more vintage and better we don't believe in wine so let's skip this edited and but any wine in Islam is not always intoxicating there is wine which is the juice itself it's called Nabeel this is an issue another issue the third thing Allah will question you about your earning where did you earn it from halal sources did you earn it from riba from selling something haram from cheating from stealing from lying this income allah will ask you about not only that number for he will ask you about where you had spent it so you may have earned it from halal but did you spend it in halal a lot of the Muslims don't care where they spend it as long as they have it they may be among those who commit is rough and they may be among those who commit tip veal and we will come in shala to discuss the difference between is roth and tab fear in islam and finally allah will ask you about number 5 which is your knowledge today's knowledge what have you done about it have you implemented it or you're just like a harddrive saved it and moved to another application this is something that you have to be aware that none of us will move his feet from in front of Allah until he's asked about these five things do you have someone to read the 3rd hadith Allah okay now this hadith is crystal clear correct we don't have to explain it alas we can finish the whole course in half an hour like this do you need to explanation for this let us see now this hadith illustrates the beauty of the ayah mentioned in Surat al Rahman Allah Allah says he'll Jezza all asani illness and Allah says is the reward of good anything but good so let us recap what does the hadith talk about the hadith talks about if someone does you a favor whoever is done a favor should repay it so you do me a favor what is your favor you brought me a coffee that is cold I missed example don't take everything literally what I say it is good so he brought me a coffee what should I say now I have to repay him type repayment has a number of ways one to do something in return someone gives me a pen as a gift so many times Muslims reject gifts and this is against the Sunnah why he said chef he gave me a gift and I know his food so I feel sorry for him I don't want to accept his gift this is prohibited in Islam top he support no problem except the gift and give him something better pay him for it do something at least to mend and fix his heart but if I'm poor and I give you something and you reject it you broke my heart twice by rejecting it and by not repaying me for it look at how Islam tells you to care for people's feelings feelings is something we Muslims fail to care about is it halal or Haram it's not harem I'm not doing it no this is not the way we deal in Islam the Prophet are they saw it was Salaam did exactly the same a man gave him an image ernia a dress that had thick or sari he gave him a hamesha and this hamesha had drawings in it the Prophet prayed in it in wall prayer he was distracted by the drawings not Haram drawings but too many decorations and colorful things so the Prophet said RA salatu salam this Cammisa has distracted me in my prayer send it back to a Boojum the man who gave it to him send it back and bring me another garment from him why so that his heart would not be broken I return your gift but I exchange it for something that would not distract me how would a Boojum feel good because I am the one who gave it to the Prophet Adam so this hadith highlights how to cater for Muslims feelings when anyone does you a favor do not think of your rights over him because this is what we usually do if Rizwan comes in does me a favor for example he brings me hot coffee I would not say this is his job no I have to repay him I have to thank him so how do I repay him either bring him a latte instead of my coffee or if I cannot find the means to do so then I should praise him how would I praise Him when I speak to the brothers of Allah brother is one did this and did that masha'Allah he's helpful he goes out of his way to heat up my coffee even if it's cold and he does I keep on you know praising him until he's satisfied because I cannot praise him financially why the Prophet says when he praises him he thanks him he's fulfilled by my praising maybe it's much more than what he was expecting if I do not praise Him nor repay him most likely that being silent is a sign of being ungrateful so many times Muslims are like this not with the strangers but with the closest people to your heart when was the last time you thanked your spouse those who are married those who are married raise your hands please among the men masha'allah Tabarrok Allah and the majority are not when was the last time you thanked your wife for a good meal when was the last time you praised your wife in front of your mother and father saying masha'Allah my love did this and that my wife managed to do this and you praise her we as men are professionals in complaining we go to our mother or mom she didn't cook the food she burnt it she I will never find a t-shirt that is ironed the house is always messy but alhamdulillah what my mother approached when she meets my wife she's angry and you're causing hatred never mention anything negative about your wife to your mom and never mention anything negative about your husband to your mother she will never forget a lot of the sisters spouses have problems inevitably you will meet your mom someday and you're not that on good terms with your spouse so you will complain after 10 minutes you will kiss and make up with your wife with your spouse nothing happened but the scar in your mother's heart will remain till the day of judgement be careful never involve your parents until it's the last resort therefore check yourself when was it the last time you praised your loved ones in the brakish ala half an hour take your phone turn it on send an SMS of love and compassion to your spouse and those who are not married eat your hearts out it is your problem you're not married do something about it I'll give you my number you can send me that SMS I will delete it each other therefore it is essential that we praise people anyone your your servant your janitor a Muslim is always down to earth if someone is cleaning my car I praise Him though I'm paying him money but I'm always sweet talking to people this is the real Muslim not thinking higher themselves know even the janitor even your gardener even your subordinate no matter what they do always praise them because praising gives you more and more when you criticize when you don't think you're ungrateful and this is what oops you know this is what they will think of you and hence they will not ever do a good thing to again then we come to so what kind of praising can I do mentioning a good name he did so so if I don't have any person to mention him to what should I do in another hadith the Prophet said as I make dora and dora is something that muslims have to always do to others and we will come to mention this later on sha allah imam ahmed used to say to a shaft his son i think he used to say your father is among 30 whom i make dua for every single night now you as muslims how many do you make dua for among your Muslim brothers or sisters every single night problematic because if you don't make dua for your brothers and sisters specifically by name I personally make du'a approximately 425 people every single night since the past Allah knows how long I always remember them Endora and there are a segment for the dead that who yeah affected my life positively I ask Allah every single night for them for a mother fear for expansion of the graves etc you look into your contact list and see how many do you make dua every single night for if you don't then you have issues that you have to address then we come to the last paragraph which seems unrelated is it the Prophet says as if someone adorns himself with something he has not been given it is as if he wear wearing false garments there is a mistake in the translation I forgot to bring this up the English text has a lot of not a lot of that is the exaggeration it has a fair amount of mistakes so sha Allah I'll try my level best to point it out I need to open it though to remember it here the Arabic hadith says as if he's wearing two false garments so it's not one it's two false garments and what does that mean it means that whoever now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is telling us that if you praise someone truly for what he had done to you you're grateful now the other flip the other side of the coin is that there are people who would claim favours from others that they did not do to them why I'll tell you why if I say brother Mihaly may Allah be pleased with him and may Allah have mercy on him did me this and this listen this so I can gain status if I pretend something that did not happen this is as if I am wearing two false garments what is the origin of this hadith the origin of this hadith is a woman came to the prophet alaihi wasallam and said o prophet of allah i am married to a married man meaning that i have a co wife he is married to two women sometimes I meet my co wife and I'd like to brag about things that are not real women are like this they are the majority in this room so if I am living I need escorting women are like this they like to pretend nowadays in the era of snapchat men are like this as well they like to claim things that they don't have so this woman says o prophet of Allah when I meet my co wife I say my husband my hoobie the decent that and he gave me this in that and I'm lying so is this permissible the Prophet said Ali solution whoever claims to have what he does not have is like one who wears to false garments meaning that he does not build these Brahmas do not belong to him why did the Prophet as I mentioned to false garments the reason is that usually when you are called to testify in a court of law if you go like this maybe the judge would doubt you especially if you're lying but if you wear two garments of high value the judge would look at you and probably say this man is rich this man is of high position he cannot lie so he accepts your testimony so whoever claims something that he does not have whoever pretends of something that has no reality is actually as if he's wearing two garments of falsehood some other interpreters said that it's like wearing two sleeves so if I wear a sleeve under this sleeve you will think that I'm wearing two garments where I'm actually wearing one so I'm pretending to be something that I am NOT and this hadith or this extension wearing two false garments is in all of us wherever we sit in a gathering I'd like to brag about knowing this billionaire and this government official and this influential person and this scholar I'd like to brag about knowing share so and so and so and we had dinner with chef so-and-so and part of these false garments is when I wear something that does not belong to me to pretend a certain social status so you know this black dress that the Arabs were you know with the golden straps in it we call it Mishler so imagine if I come here wearing it wearing the Saudi so been pretending to be among the Supreme High Council of scholars when you see me you will think that whoa this guy is mashallah look at what he is wearing this is false garments because I do not wear them in my country except in eight not even for Friday I do not wear it though I have it being a Saudi I can wear it but I do not like to pretend something which I'm not why would I do that thing I don't need this and likewise those who wear fake labels brand names whoa I apologize I did not mean to offend you seriously I could not understand why a Muslim would wear a fake Rolex and he is driving a Prius increase I think is expensive what's what Kia maybe or Hyundai or Chinese brand he is wearing a fake Rolex that cost maybe a hundred and fifty ingots originally it costs like a hundred and fifty thousand but he flashes it in Russia a lot of article on a key you know it's fake I know it's fake why are you doing this this is this hadith fits him correctly he is wearing false garments going and buying brands that are not original okay you don't have it you don't need it if you have if you can't afford the money to buy it buy only originals don't deceive the people because before you deceive them you're cheap you're deceiving yourself in the beginning so if you have anything false you'll find a box outside the shala you can put it in sha Allah may Allah reward you for that hokey I think it's understood the Shama we move on to number four and with this I think we need to finish he will give you one he went to that man who gave him amount then the man went back to the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam and told him of this he said whoever guides the good has the night off okay the hadith is a beautiful reminder what beautiful checkpoints we don't see anything except camels and mountain what a man came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam where the Prophet was treating one of his camels with tar you know there is a skin disease and well known in camels and this can only be solved by painting that disease with tar so he came to the Prophet he said o prophet of Allah I want to go for jihad but I don't have a right so give me some of the camels from sabaha from charity the Prophet apologized and said I don't have any I ran out of resources but go to Seoul so he's rich he's capable and he shoulder he will help you so the man went and surely enough the man was generous and he gave him a ride so the Prophet said alayhi salaatu wa salaam when the man came back and told him that he was given he said whoever guides to good has the like of the reward of the person who actually does it what does this mean it means Allah is the most generous even if you don't have the ability to spend Allah will find ways for you to get the reward how by indicating means of goodness to others so I'm poor hamdulillah in Saudi standards but your standards I'm handle the well-off till now I am poor I cannot give money in charity but I have a lot of things to get means of charity through so by guiding others to means of righteousness this is a door of charity by teaching you this is a door of charity also if you put this in mind by educating anyone around you about a Sunnah that was forgotten about something that he does not know about something that he forgot for example a lot of you hold bottles of water who has bottles of water with him mashallah almost all a lot of you drink with his left hand and we will come to this in short no no with his left no no no what is left I said a lot not all so a lot of you drink with his left hand if I say hey this is Haram try your level best to drink with your right I have means of charity if you comply then I have the same reward as you have done if someone comes and says I have extra money I don't know what to do with it and I tell you I know a brother who cannot pay his electricity bill and in two days they will cut the power off and you go go and give him he will have charity of 150 ringgit I will have the same charity without paying a single penny and this is why if you educate the ignorant if you help the one who's in need of help if you it's someone to someone who's willing to give and pay and support then you have the same reward and a lot of the smart people around us and among us know this so they cannot financially support others but they know someone who can so giving Dara through Facebook through Twitter through all these social media to guide people to do something good you have the same reward by just a click of a keyboard button but also you have the same sin as guiding people to sins with the click of your keyboard button and this is why people have to be aware of the goodness they can give don't hold back when you have informative knowledge you can share with others don't hold back when you have financial resources you can tell someone is in need of medication and you know some hospital that is giving it for free don't hold back always keep in mind I want reward if you know of a good lecture of a good teacher don't hold back call your friends and tell them there is a lecture of so-and-so so that they can gain a lot of reward while you are sitting home enjoying your biryani the following hadith he hath learned them and the group were in tears then the mighty and soldiers will be to him Hamburg why did you make my sleeves to spare the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam went back and told them we doing the good news follow the right path and try to reach to that if the hadith probably most of you have not heard probably most of you heard the first half and in a separate occasion the second half but the combination of two no most likely none of you have heard this let's go back the prophet alayhi salatu salam went to his companions they were having a good time laughing and enjoying and the Prophet had a salatu salam warn them from this and he said if you know what i know in the present tense I think he listened and in the past tense it should be in the present tense and there are different of things that needs to be change in the translation as well the Prophet said if you know what I know you would love little and you will cry more now we have to understand why the prophet alayhi salaatu son said what he had said a human being has two types of feelings overwhelming him fear and hope and this is what the scholars of test Kia say that a human being has to have three types of feelings in him love fear and hope so it's like a bird the head of the bird is love of Allah the wings of the bird our hope and fear if you don't have the head that the bird is dead anyone who does not have the love of Allah in his heart he's not a Muslim true who doesn't love Allah raise your hand Masha Allah Allah Allah I'm in love with all loving a lot there was a because if you raise your hand you'd have found someone sniping you i met a saudi brother he's in his sixties and he prays in the masjid he fasts Rama bond he gives the cat I was talking to him about Allah's love he said listen with all due respect I pray fast I fear Allah I don't want to go to hell but I don't love him I said you're crazy seriously you talk without thinking a lot of us do this we don't think and contemplate a heap if I were to give you this coffee which is cold would you appreciate it yes at least you can use the mug but you would appreciate it Allah has given you what everything you possess an own you have two feet to walk you every breath you take Allah has favors upon you your heart beats Allah has favors upon you your spouse your children your salary your health your wealth and you're not loving a lot people talk without thinking everyone loves Allah but we fail to sit back and reflect on Allah's favours upon us if you have the ability to walk look at those who don't if you have a car look at those who are driving motorcycles so Allah has so much upon us that you must love him now when we come to the wings the majority of people usually fly tilted because they rely a lot on the hope rather on the fear and that is why when I'm invited to Haram what do I think first of a lot forgiveness all are well Spanish meant I always think of Allah's forgiveness so let me do something Haram and Allah will forgive and another Hara and Allah will forgive I rarely think of fear of Allah that is why when the Prophet came to his companions may allah be pleased with them all the prophet sallallaahu seldom was afraid that they will be tempted to fall into Haram that is why he warned them and he said to them where by him who holds my soul in his hand if you knew what I knew if you were to know what I know you would laugh little and weep and cry more now look at the reflect that the reaction of the Companions did they google it and said no we should trust Allah's mercy and this and this and that immediately they started to cry because they felt the gravity of what they were doing and they believed the Prophet Allah so some in his serious warning to them however the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam whenever he speaks he speaks out of the divine inspiration and revelation of Allah Azza WA JAL and there are times that he speaks out of his own HT had 99.9% it's correct and according to what Allah has inspired him and this is why it is approved but whenever he does something that needs correction Allah corrects it that's why in surat a basa when a blind man comes to him and the prophet or some rounds in his face Allah doesn't let that pass he stops Prophet Muhammad as Salam and tells him rabbi said wa ta'ala you frowned in his face and you turn your back to him did the prophets in the man who was blind so even if the Prophet smiled in his face he would not see it yet Alonzo Gee is up bringing and raising the level to the utmost of human perfection of our prophet eyes of salaam even the frown in the face of a blind man does not befit you muhammad sallallaahu Selim so even that you should be you should eliminate it so Allah corrects His Messenger whenever he does something that is not appropriate for him as a Messenger of Allah as Noah so the Prophet Allah salat-u-salam was told by Allah Mohammed why did you make my slaves despair that's it so the Prophet realized that with the magnitude of a man in his companions hearts he should go and fix that so he went back to them he did not feel any sort of arrogance that I'm the Prophet I said something how can I retreat from seeing it now he's not like us he corrects it for the sake of Allah so you see he goes for them and said receive the good news I assure you you will get the glad tidings I'm giving you the glad tidings of Shu and the Prophet also says to them follow the right path said d-do meaning try your level best to follow the correct path and choose the middle way between going to excess and falling too short so the Prophet is telling them that laughing is not a big problem but don't exaggerate don't fall into the wrong concepts that laughing may lead you to so in short what is the ruling on laughing in Islam have five minutes is it permissible to laugh in Islam have it then we would have been in great trouble laughter in Islam is permissible but with boundaries and what are these boundaries one that you should not lie in order to make people laugh the Prophet said Alice Aslam woe to those who lie so that people would laugh woe to them woe to them so lying to make people laugh is prohibited and the Prophet himself alayhi salatu was-salam used to joke with his companions but he would never ever say something that is Haram or a lie so joking is permissible he comes to one of his companions in the market and he grabs him from behind and the man cannot see and he says who's this let me go and the Prophet says who buys this slave from me is he a slave yes he's a slave of he doesn't lie the Prophet doesn't like so he says who buys this slave from me when he knew that it was the Prophet and it was salam instead of fighting him who was holding him he started going back so that he can get in contact with the body of the Prophet at it's awesome this is how much they loved the Prophet Isis Salam they loved him so dearly that they just wanted to embrace him and he said o prophet of Allah no one will buy me who will buy me nobody buys a slave like me so the Prophet is to joke a taste a lot of syrup a woman comes to him old woman and she said o prophet of Allah pray for me that I go into Jenna said old women don't go to Jannah the woman went weeping sit come come come come old women do not go to Jannah Allah will turn them back to 33 years of age so he didn't lie the Prophet is our Salam a man comes to me said o prophet of Allah give me a camel to go for jihad he will he said I will give you a son of a she-camel so the profit what will I do with the son of a she-camel a son of a she-camel is maybe like five to six months old he said subhanAllah camels are sons of she camels I didn't specify that the age I just told you so the Prophet used to joke a little son but not as we do he used to give little humor with no lying included and also you can joke without making fun of others Allah Allah says in the Quran o you who believe let not a people ridicule another people perhaps they may be better than them nor let women ridicule other women perhaps they may be better than them in a lot of ethnicities countries there is always a country that they make fun of you go to America they make fun of the Polish you go to certain parts of Arabia they make fun of other Arabs you go to maybe India they make fun of the Pakistanis Pakistanis make fun of the Bangladeshis Bangladesh's make fun of the Saudis everybody make fun of everyone else and this is an Islamic it increases the hatred it increases the arrogance in Muslims and this is part of laughter that is not permissible among the rules where you have to observe when laughing that we do not frighten or intimidate a Muslim so many times we joke with others by frightening them ending up with a heart attack in his dead what are you doing children specially and grown-ups they hide in the dark or they stay in a refrigerator until they froze and died hoping to scare their mother or to scare their someone their loved one this is Haram you come to your friends and with the scorpion or with the snake plastic of course not really and you frighten him or you take something that belongs to him all of this is Haram in Islam the Prophet prohibited this sallallahu aleyhi where he was seldom and it should be in moderation so spend your day laughing is not acceptable the prophet alayhi salatu salam said to abu huraira o abu huraira reduce the amount of laughter because a lot of laughter kills your heart what does kill your heart mean now our hearts are dead or alive those who say dead raise your hands well my you have a problem my heart is dead seriously why how do I know if I turn on a soap opera or a comedy show or a stand-up comedy will I laugh I will laugh my head off but if I watch atrocities committed against the Muslims and their being butchered and slaughtered and killed if I find poverty and famine and drought in a Muslim country if I see something that breaks your heart an orphan or someone who's poor do I cry no if I listen to the Quran being recited and the hell and heaven is being described and I am envisioning myself in one of them do I cry no if I watch a movie and hero is being poisoned and dying and the heroine comes and she says what will I do without you will I cry yes not whether the way I said it may be probably Oscar winning film would be different meaning that our hearts are dead why are they dead because we so indulged in this life all what we care about is laughing so laughing is not Haram but so much of it to the extent that it becomes our prime objective look at what the Muslims are doing at the moment how much money is being spent on stand-up comedy on comedy channels on comedy movies billions from the Muslims why said we want to have good time we want to laugh okay then this laughter is halal or Haram it is taking you to Haram venues and this is what kills your heart our prime objective on this life is to revive our hearts so that we love for the sake of Allah we hate for the sake of Allah we laugh for the sake of Allah and we weep and cry for the sake of Allah and I pray to Allah that he gives us a healthy and alive heart I think we should break here insha'Allah you"
