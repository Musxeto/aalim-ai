  "transcript": "abdullah from pakistan he asked a question about a provident fund or retirement fund so his question was a little bit ambiguous but at the end of the day the result is clear whether the company gives you retirement money or gives you end of service indemnity or gives you a bonus a lump sum bonus regardless where this money came from if you take it and deposit it in a bank and the bank generates profit to you this is reba as long as the bank is a interest-based bank a conventional bank so you put in the time deposit or fixed deposit um account for six months or one year and it generates 15 or 10 percent and mashallah this is easy money i have my capital stored there's no possibility of losing and they generate this riba this is totally prohibited it's riba if it's an islamic bank a real practicing islamic bank with a sharia board that overlooks the transactions of the bank not a sharia board that meets once every two weeks for a couple of hours and they signed resolutions and they leave without knowing whether this is implemented or not and they come at the end of the year and take a million or two as bonus from the bank no this is not a real proper islamic bank there has to be a department that follows these resolutions and ensure implementing them in the transactions of the back if this is the case then yes putting your money for them to invest and give you return which is not fixed it's not a fixed amount of dollars or euros that they're giving you every month rather it fluctuates according to the profits and there is a possibility of losing those very rare there's no problem in that and this is halal"
