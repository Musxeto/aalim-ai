  "title": "Is it mandatory to FIRMLY put my nose & forehead on ground in sujood? #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "alayum so my question is uh when I do sujud is it okay to just touch the ground slightly with the tip of my nose or do I have to press every part of my nose to the ground firmly for my sujud to be valid the suud is placing the forehead and the nose on the ground the Sunnah is to firmly do this because this is the way you express your submissiveness and follow the Sunnah of the Prophet this is the way he used to do it but if a person touches his forehead and nose to the ground slightly we would say that he's doing sujud but he's not doing the full highly recommended and rewarded sujud as he's supposed to do and Allah Knows Best"
