  "title": "Can a maternal uncle be a girl's Wali for marriage, and is the Nikkah valid if this happens?",
  "transcript": "Abdullah from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Hasek. Wa Alaikum Assalam. Due to visa issues, they couldn't come over. So, we did our nikah in Islamic center and no one said anything about paternal uncle. So, now that I know about this, do we have to redo our nikah or is our nikah valid? While the Prophet himself said there is no marriage valid without the consent and approval of the guardian and two trustworthy male witnesses. And this is the opinion of the majority of the schools of thought including the students of Abu Hanifa may Allah have mercy on his soul. And the maternal uncles can never be guardians. Even the maternal grandfather cannot be the guardian of the woman. So, now alhamdulillah because this mistake was done honestly and it's a mistake. And it's attributed to the ignorance of such so-called imams of the Islamic centers who usually they're not qualified. This can be easily rectified with the grace of Allah. He says to you, I give you my niece Fatima, Aisha, Khadija, whatever in marriage and you say I accept her marriage in the presence of two male witnesses."
