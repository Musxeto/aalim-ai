  "title": "What is Fasting for a Muslim? Is it only to refrain from food? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so if we were to identify so fasting usually in the books of fact you will find that they identified as saying fasting is to refrain from the things that break your fast from the break of dawn till sunset but this is not actually the definition of fasting because if I do not consume or perform any act that breaks my fasting such as eating drinking sexual intercourse anything that has the impact to break my fast from the break of dawn till sunset if I don't do this but I do not have the intention for fasting I did it may be for dieting I did it because I was so busy working I forgot to eat and drink if there is no intention of fasting then this is invalid and it has no impact no value none whatsoever so this phrase is clearly important in most of our definitions"
