  "transcript": "sofyan says in some messages in London they have already taken five pounds for the cattle photo can I give another five pounds somewhere else as charity the answer is no problem you can give zakaat eight-footer five pounds here and there and everywhere if you want there's no problem that the issue is that you must ensure that they do not give the cattle further except two days at most before it giving the cattle photo today or in the 15th of ramadan on the 20th of ramadan does not count if you give them the money and authorize them to give it two days before 8:00 that's okay but if they give it now it is invalid"
