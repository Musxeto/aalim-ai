  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I got a job opportunity in an MNC in India and it is a project for US client company. They have 100 years experience in making the glass containers and they are selling the specially designed glass bottles for alcohol companies for wine and beer bottles and the food companies like ketchup soup bottles and pharmaceutical companies. I could see from the internet that 60 to 70% of their income is coming from alcohol companies. I will be handling the task in the back end. My role will be is taking the orders to pushing the cash into SAP finance application or any pushing position in between the order to cash process in the back end office. I may need to handle the alcohol based customers or customer orders and assisted queries like with regards to orders and finance and prices. Okay, Ibn Rahman, your question is crystal clear. If the company has 70% of her clientele dealing in alcohol, it is not permissible for you at all to work there and to assist them because the vast majority of your clients would be using it in something that Allah cursed anyone who's dealing with it, including you. So, definitely you don't want to have your income tarnished or soiled by such clientele. So, definitely you should not work there at all."
