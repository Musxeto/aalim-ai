  "transcript": "[Music] jake uh my question is as i was born and brought up in bangladesh and because of a better future we moved to u.s now we are living in the u.s but as compared to one of you know islamic country supporting friday's off spring in jamaa and we had a lot of opportunities but here we're facing a lot of issues cannot create a tumor prayer cannot play on time we're missing a lot of things and my question is really question in the adjustment why we were living in a cooperative country while we had the opportunity to live in a muslim country to live a better life as a muslim okay i will answer inshallah muhammad from the u.s he says i was born and raised in bangladesh and traveled to the u.s for a better job and now i'm residing there maybe he got the green card maybe he got citizenship but it's not a muslim country he cannot pray jumu'ah on time he cannot pray normal prayers at ease in the masjid because it's a kafir country so will he be accountable on the day of judgment for doing such a thing i don't know migrating to a kafir country is not permissible the suffering that the muslims face in such kafir countries is great they are prosecuting them softly in the media accusing them of terrorism accusing them of extremism they want them to [Music] leave all of their beliefs and conviction and follow their kafir way all over the country all over europe take off your hijab shave your beard you're not allowed to pray in the masjid and if you pray in the masjid there are rules and if you if we don't like you we're going to close your masjid and we're going to accuse you of extremism and defying the unity of the country i am a citizen of that country i'm like you there's nothing different between me and you same id card the same upbringing the only difference is that i'm a muslim not a muslim well tough luck you have to follow the way of our life this is a tyrant way of doing it a a dictatorship way of doing it i have my convictions i have my religion what do you mean i have to leave where is the freedom of religion so they're forcing they're shoving their way down our throats they don't want you to be a muslim you want to be a muslim you have to drink wine eat pork leave your prayer it's a must that you shake hands with the opposite gender why would i it's against my religion ah well then this means you're an extremist okay if i want to go a little bit further and kiss on the chic and maybe hug and maybe do something else oh no no no this is inappropriate why why shaking hands is appropriate and not the whole nine yards this is awkward this is weird but this is the disbelievers way of dealing with the muslims and the muslims they went to them so you left your muslim country you went there okay you go there for some time to gain money start a business and go back to your country no problem but to settle and live there and let your children grow as americans and live the american way and probably end up doing drugs or lgbtq and refusing islam and then you ask me will allah hold us accountable of course so i can't answer your question specifically for your case but if you have the ability to go back home and live among the muslims you have to do that you"
