  "transcript": "uh omar says if a person is working in a haram job like interest-based bank and he repents and wants to quit it and join a halal job what should he do with all his previous haram income savings must he give it away to the poor muslims or can he keep it first of all haram income is divided into two types as scholars say haram for the way it is earned and haram because of its essence so the haram that is haram because of the way it is earned like river-based interests working for a bank for an insurance company selling drugs selling intoxicants prostitution the income the money itself is haram for the way it was earned but the money itself is not haram for others the money that is haram due to the essence of it such as stolen money so if i took my neighbor's money this is haram for me because of the way it was earned and because of the essence of this actual money is haram so even if i give it to my wife or to my children it remains haram even if someone buys it off me and he gives me money and he takes the product the product is still haram though he paid for it because it was stolen so working in an interest-based bank is halam because allah says in the quran and do not collaborate upon etham and advan sin and transgression so collaborating cooperating with people on haram makes me part of it and makes my income haram due to that so what to do with the money scholars say that if you did not know that this was haram so you worked 20 years in a bank and you saved a lump sum and then you came to discover on the 21st year of your working there that it is haram the 20 years previous to your knowledge is halal for you because you did not know the ruling what about what came after my knowledge scholars say that you have to dispose of that money in order to cleanse your wealth because this does not belong to you it's haram you cannot benefit from it this is the majority of opinion of scholars there is another opinion which i'm inclined to which says that if a person is needy and if we come and tell him after he had repented o the million dollars that you have saved over the 20 years part of your repentance is to throw them away to the poor and the needy i'll be poor and needy then well this is the only way of cleansing your your wealth to him this would be a great fitna because most people would say tell you what i'll go back into living to sin if he was not a muslim he said i'll go back to kufur rather than suffer like this so sheikh al-islam may allah have mercy says no to encourage people to repent this is more more likely to tell them keep the money deal with it in a trade try to invest it try to make an income out of it in halal means so that you don't have to beg people you don't have to become needy and you would not compromise your uh style of living once you have repented and we're remorseful and if you make a lot of money and you can take this haram earned money that you knew that it was haram and cleanse it after you make money and you're well off that would be good inshaallah even temi even went an extra mile and he said that no even if he knew that it was haram and he repented he may keep that haram money why because allah azzawajal stated about those who deal in river what translates to so whoever has received an admonition from his lord and decess may have what is pass and his affair with allah so this is part of what has passed and now as long as he was taking the advice and he he has or he has been reminded with it and he stopped doing haram then what was earned in the past is forgiven and allah azza knows best"
