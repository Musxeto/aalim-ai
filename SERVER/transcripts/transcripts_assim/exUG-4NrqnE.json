  "transcript": "this is a question from a young brother from from high school he says many of my high school friends have girlfriends I am convinced and I know that this is not Halal what should I do as a friend to help him understand this Haram relationship if you have a box of coming back to the fruit Cil if you have a box of rotten apples and you choose the best health beautiful tasty apple and put it inside will it fix them it will become rotten in a couple of hours so it's sketchy so if you can make a difference without harming yourself go for it most likely you won't because everybody it's like swimming against a tide everybody is doing this and they look at you as a freak so no matter what you say especially if you talk to them in a group and you try to give them advice they'll all attack you like hyas so stay away yes I may go to a brother one to one and remind him of Allah show him the evidence from the Quran and ask him do you like your sister to to get involved in such relationships and try to give him da one to one but not to address two or more at the same time they will hunt you down they will break you down so you in the first place should not be ass associated with such bad company they're bad news go and look for the people of the nice guys who go five times a day to the Masjid those who are practicing and engaging in Hal activities and hang out with them Allah know best"
