  "transcript": "[Music] gelareh manova he and hamdulillah hello banana me sallallahu wasallam over Halima borussia rahmatan lil al-amin sayidina muhammadin wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajmain a man assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato this is a brief introduction of how our prophet alayhi salat wa sallam used to pray and this is collected and taken from the authentic Sunnah and this is extremely important because it was he sallallahu alayhi wa sallam who said pray as you have seen me pray I haven't seen you pray o prophet of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam your companions and the hadith that came to us are found in Buhari in Muslim in Sunan Abu Dawood thermal imager and NASA e NL mustard Iraq a Muslim am mad mode polymeric so many books of hadith you collect them you check their authenticity and then you implement it in your prayers now the issue of prayer is important because it is one of the pillars of Islam not only that it is a vast and huge topic because like any forms of worship it has conditions it has things that nullify it it has pillars it has mandatory acts and it has soon acts and without the knowledge of all of these things your prayer would not be complete and this is the cause where a lot of the Muslims have dispute argument they have hatred and enmity towards one another simply because you're not praying like I am brain simply because I follow a school different than your school and this is totally wrong so that was made to gather people together this is why we have congregational prayer this is why when the Prophet Elias I'm used to straighten the rows of the worshipers he used to say to them do not differ do not go against one another so that allah azza wajal would not differ your hearts and this is what we're having at the moment so this is a brief description I don't claim that it is the perfect description but at least sharing with you that I know would insha Allah elevate the level of our prayers to the level we want be evening la here as sahaja so first of all there are conditions and these conditions must be fulfilled and the definition of condition according to the jurors is that a thing without it the form of worship does not exist and if it is found and fulfilled that is the condition this doesn't mean that it has to be found what does this mean Sheikh I'm confused I'll give an example don't worry one of the conditions of salat is wudu ablution so if I pray without ablution my prayer is void simple as that because the condition was not fulfilled but if I make ablution this does not mean I have to pray I may pray and am I I may not pray so when the condition is there it doesn't mean that I have to perform the form of worship but if it is not fulfilled if it's not there this means that even if I perform the worship the form of worship it is invalid so what are the conditions of salat there are many among them is first of all Nia or intention and the intention some make it as a condition because it comes before the prayer and some make it as a pillar and it's more likely to be a condition so you have to know what you're doing you have to intend it and I will not go into the conditions of salt because this is a long topic but I have to know whether I'm praying for us or Malaysia or fudger I just can't say Allahu Akbar and during the prayer say hmmm what is this I think it's Whitter no this is not valid second condition facing the Tamila so if I know the direction of Kaabah I have to direct myself to it if I know it's there and I direct myself this way then my prayer is invalid third a condition is the entrance of the time of Prayer so I want to pray Maghrib and I can see the Sun is about to set or half of it is has disappeared and I say Allahu Akbar your prayer is invalid why because the Sun has to completely set and disappear for moderate to be due and you can't pray before the time is due condition number 4 to cover your aura so for a man I have to cover from the navel to the knees this is my aura this is the private part that must not be shown without it my prayer is invalid number five is to have purity and purity is divided into two types Woodill which is uplifting the status of impurity or Russell which is uplifting the major state of impurity the ritual impurity this is number one Moodle or osha number two purity of my body known as Jassa no impurities on it purity of my clothes and purity of the spot that I'm praying on three three types these are the conditions you can look for more details in the books of Phil but this is something you have to understand and know without it your prayer is invalid so be careful we come to the prayer I want to pray now what do I do I fulfill the conditions ok my era is covered I have waddle I'm facing the Qibla the time is due for prayer so what do I do I intend and how do I intend intention is in the heart it's not something that you verbally say so if I want to eat an apple I don't say I intend to eat this green apple in front of me on the table I just reach out and bite it this is the intention so my intention now in my heart I don't have to say anything verbally or mentally I just intend to pray the whole it is the whole time I'm a codel I come and I stand the intention is there I begin my prayer with a pillar what is this pillar you tell me wrong answer the pillar first pillar of salat is not technique the first pillar of salat is standing up when you're able to do so so for Fajr prayers you don't have the option of sitting down because you're lazy or you feel tired if you're able to stand up it's a pillar that you stand up this is pillar number one I'm standing up I do pillar number two which is known as takbir a tool a Haram the first inauguration takbir by saying Allahu Akbar so now I have started prayer the hadith of the Prophet Elisha Salam well Terry muha attack deal so it has to be inaugurated with takbir the first stack beer okay chef you said Allah who apparently didn't raise your hands yes raising the hands is not a pillar this is a Sunnah whoa I didn't know that well now you know this is why I'm here so saying Allahu Akbar means that I've started praying now the Sunnah is to say Allahu Akbar to raise the hands if I don't raise the hands Sunnah is gone the prayer is totally valid and correct okay when to raise the handshake you have one of three either before saying Allah Akbar ordering it or after it can you explain yeah sure a la a kebab Allah Akbar Allah Akbar it can be praised before during or after this is confirmed Sunnah of the Prophet that I sort of sir so we move on when I say Allahu Akbar raise my hands the Sunnah is to put the right hand over the left hand on the chest as per the hadith of WA LLL even Hajj or may Allah be pleased with him and this was a confirmed sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam to place the right hand over the left on the chest well the chest itself is an issue of dispute because some authenticate the hadith some don't and those who don't differ whether to put it on the belly or to put it underneath the belly but the most authentic is to put it on the chest it's from here to here so you put the right hand on the left hand on this chest while in the standing position underline highlight with yellow bold font why I'll come to discuss this with you because the hadith when describing the prophets prayer they saw to Salaam they used to say that he used to put the right on the left hand in the standing position so now I'm standing let's begin from scratch you look at the place of your prostration you don't look at the chandeliers and look at the people around you everything is no no no no you're praying who here where I asked allows messenger peace and blessings of Allah be upon him upon looking hither and thither in prayer he replied it is a way of stealing by which Satan takes away a portion from the prayer of a person Sahih al-bukhari narrated anas bin malik the prophet he said blessings of allah be upon him said what is wrong with those people who look towards the sky during the prayer his talk grew Stern while delivering this speech and he said they should stop looking towards the sky during the prayer otherwise their eyesight would be taken away narrated by Sahih al-bukhari you're facing allah azza wajal so you stand in submissiveness and humility expressing your poverty and you say Allah a kebab where do I raise my hands to Hadees one next to the shoulders one next to the ears so how drawing this and this it's very easy the palm is next to your shoulders the fingers are next to the level of your ears and this is how you combine between the two authentic hadees so it is not like allah akbar as people say or Allah Akbar as people do this is all wrong it is not Allah Akbar no it is this way so the palms next to the shoulders the fingers are next to the level of the ears facing the Qibla you say a law a cop looking at the place of your prostration where do I put my forehead I look at it whenever I am in the standing position just always like this then I place my right hand over the left hand on the chest and there are two ways of doing this look at my fingers this is my wrist my palm and my arm it's in between like this so this is one way of doing it the other way which is also authentic of doing it is grabbing my wrist like this so I'm grabbing it some people want to make something in between so they do this and this is wrong either you put the whole palm of your hand with the fingers on the arm wrist and hand or you simply grab your wrist left wrist like this so what people do like this is totally wrong some brothers from Africa do this and they tilt themselves what are you doing if they said we're preserving the heart when was the last time you took an x-ray maybe your heart is on the right then we have a problem where are you getting this from the Sunnah is to stand idle in the middle not to the left not to the right as a prophet used to pray Allah his salt or sir capiche move on do the takbir put the right on the left on the chest and you don't have to put it like some of the brothers do this this is extreme some of the brothers may be Allah who a kebab this is to loose some of the brothers say Allah this is too extreme follow the way of the Prophet Elias of son be moderate and don't make an issue of it some brothers say Allahu Akbar and they pray like this and you start what are you doing I'm following the school of so-and-so no this is wrong what is it but we're jib is it mandatory no is it a fart a rock on a pillar no it's a Sunnah so don't fight over things that are sunnah prayer is more important than fighting over such issues finished ok what do we do we move on to another Sunnah which is called dua or east if time so the analysts attack there are different variation one of the most easiest and popular subhana Allah Muhammad Atta Baraka smoked what an allergy Duke voila Allah has a rock very easy the is sooner if I skip it do I have any problem no problem another famous one is the door of Abu Huraira inside Muslim allahumma barik mania mania hop III come about terminal mosquito and mother even appear in a kimono a thought will a build a minute dennis.watson him in Hawaii will marry with a jewel but beautiful drop Sahih Muslim there are three for more you pick and choose if you skip it no problem then I begin with saying I would o be Lehi min ash-shaytani r-rajim or would you be Larry semi and a limb min ash-shaytani regime or there are a number of ways of seeking refuge in Allah from Shaitan mandatory no sooner then I say bismillahirrahmanirrahim mandatory no it's sooner sure give me a break what do you mean sooner in the quran if I open it I find bismillah r-rahman r-rahim number one this is a verse from the fatiha a recent issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion according to the solution that basmala is not a part of fatiha it is a dividing verse between the sewers of the Quran with the exception of Surat October chapter number 9 and the hadith is clearly stating this when Allah says I've divided prayer between me between me and my servant into two halves when my servant says al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen Allah says my servant has praised me al Rahman Allah in so and so on it goes on like this so Allah did not mention bismillah r-rahman over him which means it's not part of this of the fatiha but this is another topic maybe we discuss it later on then I begin in one of the pillars of salat which is al fatiha so I say al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen oh man your rahim I say each ayah and I stopped and I pause not al hamdulillah your banana me not what many me Malik yo media and our Buddha ye a canister I know he knows only must attain I ran out of breath if I were younger I would have continued the whole surah this is permissible but it is not the sooner a Sunnah is to stop at the end of each verse with a pause and this is why when we pray we don't find the taste and beauty of it because we want to rush things while if you say alhamdulillah you know Bernard [Music] manikyam do you find that that is tranquillity submissiveness sure in your salat you get closer to Allah soldier Finnish Fatiha this is a pillar you now I'm talking out pillars mandatory act and voluntary act once I finish the Fatiha I can go to the core whoa wait wait wait there's a sewer afterwards I know there's a sewer afterwards the surah is a Sunnah you're kidding me no I'm not there is a surah after the fact habit it is a Sunnah so if I say what up dog lean mean Allah Akbar in fazer my prayer is valid I didn't know that now you know if I say it in moderate it's valid if I say it in Asia it's valid the sunnah is to recite of a surah afterwards or a verse as a minimum and the sky's the limit mmm interesting so I decide to surah afterwards oh yeah you're Catherine I finished that then I go for record mmm one question shake yes after I say ladle model body model baleen and should I pause so that people behind me can recite the Fatiha so I say well of all mean oh yeah a Ujala Caffey rune oh why did you stop so that the people can recite the Fatiha this is how they do it in Mecca and Medina says okay how did the Prophet do it because he said pray as you have seen me pray my job is to come and check how the Prophet I am used to pray never ever was reported that he paused between the Fatiha no sir so this is clear he never paused okay so you say one on bowling mean earlier a you handcuffed your own just like that just like that okay we move on to finishing the surah we finish the sewer what should we do now after finishing the surah the Sunnah is to go for record so how do I perform record so I finish the surah I say Allah Akbar now listen I haven't said it yet raising the hands Sunnah or mandatory Sunnah so the raising of the hands is a Sunnah and when do I say Allahu Akbar mistake number one Allahu Akbar this is wrong mistake number two a kebab well if these are two mistakes then what should I do you should say takbir while moving not in the standing position and not after you reach your record so that is called the fear of movement so this is the way it should be Allahu Akbar so while moving saying the takbir what is the ruling of the takbir shake this is wajib mandatory meaning that if you purposely skip it your prayer is invalid and if you skipped it out of forgetfulness or an error you have to compensate this by Suzu the South so I go to the rock or position and what I do is the following um a kebab now in the required position I have to do the following number one my palms of the hands are spread and grabbing my knees like this so the the power the fingers are spread my back is straight so it's not like this and it's not stretching out downwards the Sunnah is to keep your back straight as if someone puts water on it it will remain it would not spill I don't know how bad I'm doing or how I'm doing this I don't see myself but I try my level best do it according to the Sunnah a head as described in the hadith should not be pointed up like this and it should not be touted down like this so it should be normal way of doing it so this is the rock or now you ask me where should I look shift its of dispute gee al albani says in the standing position we were told to look at the prostration spot but in the record there is no mentioning of that which made some scholars say you should look at the spot of your suit prostration like share happiness Amy but this would be proven to be difficult because if you do this when you grow cool and you're looking at the position of your frustration you will find that your head is a bit tilted so Shahana Bonnie says either you look between the area of your frustration and your feet so in the middle all you look between your feet like so and this area is something that is open the Prophet did not mention at a Hisato salaam any specific place the Companions did not describe any specific place so insha'Allah it is more than possible to do whatever you think is best for your salat now after finishing my rock or during it I have to repeat the liquor and what is the vicar I have to say Japan have a beer a theme which is mandatory and one is the minimum three is recommended the sky is the limit afterwards I can say super never be rowdy I can say subhanallah being will be handy I can say a lot of Malacca Ricardo became and will occur Iceland Sasha Alakazam me or boss are you album you movie must occur let me hear Padme different kinds of thicker you can say the minimal requirement is one subhanAllah beer having she's mandatory you cannot play with it so we say Japan arabiya naveen while I'm in the record among the mistakes people do is like this super honor of being a team so they say it while going down or coming up and this is not valid you have to say it when you are totally in rock or relaxed every bone is back to its place by saying Subhan Allah beyond avi or behind a once enough then while rising up you say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah and you raise your hands again so we raised our hands in the inauguration takbir we raise our hands when we go for rock or we raise our hands when we rise up from blue core and this is the Sun according to the hadith of Abdullah normal may Allah be pleased with the Messiah hell bhai he's describing the prophets pray rally salatu salam and we say sami allahu liman hamidah this is mandatory for an individual praying on his own for any man leading prayers for worshippers and I follow that by saying Rob bana lakal hamd or bana while I can hamd allahumma rabba nelec al hamd allahumma rabba nowela Kat hamd either one of these world does the job and this is said by the Imam by the individual and by the followers which means that if I'm praying behind any man and he rises from record saying Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah I as a follower do not say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah I just answer what he has said so I've reached or arised and I got up from record position saying some Allahu Liman Hamidah but by now what I can hunt there are a lot of car I can say afterwards but this is what's essential you can say mean a semi-auto milla or the aluminum a sheet a mache in back you can say a lot been aware I could Hammond Hammond ANCA theorem by even Mubarak and fee and do I place my hands on the chest or leave it on the side either way is possible what do you suggest share I personally follow the hadith of irrelevant hozier which says that whenever the Prophet has Sun rised from rock or whatever the profits amps stood up he used to put the right on the left on the chest so now after I've risen from rock or what is this position called this is Jude is it true core is it what is it it's standing up so according to the hadith then I should do this the majority of scholars say no you have to put it on your side but there is not a single hadith that stated that the Prophet used to put his hands on his side in any position so it's an issue of dispute but aji again this is a sunnah you put it on your chest you put it on your side there's no problem don't make an issue out of it don't label people or classify people or think that people are better than you or a worse than you know just leave it as it is this is the conviction leave them so I'm in the required position Subhan Allah be Redeemer be handy Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah Robin our look at how Monica theorem play even mobile confit small element Romina [Music] this is my standing up from the world what should I do now I should go for sujood now for sujood there are two ways a different of opinion among scholars should I land first on my knees or should I land first on my hands it's an issue of dispute and the reason of that is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he said that one should not go down like a camel does when the camel wants to sit rather he should put his hands first before his knees and understanding whether the hands of a camel are their elbows or they're the knees in his feet it's an issue of dispute either way is okay sha Allah so however you feel comfortable with you should do it I personally do to H due to praying on marble or stones wherever there are pibbles in the ground if you land from the standing position on your knees would surely injure yourself one way or the other for elders it's difficult to go underneath specially if they have knee problems it's always best to go first on the hand it's like a shock absorber it absorbs the the fall itself it eases the pressure on and the weight underneath so how to do this this is what will inshallah show you now so in order to do so you'd you will find that I'll take my glasses now I can't see you but alhamdulillah you can see me why do you take your glasses off share because it will hinder putting the solute spots properly on what do you mean by sujood frustration as a prophet said Allison I was ordered to prostrate on seven limbs he said face and he pointed to his nose meaning the forehead and the nose these are related this is one organ the hands the knees and the feet these are seven so I want to go to sujood do I raise my hand no I just say allahu akbar while falling to salute and this is what I do Allah a kebab this is the way of performing sujood what are the things I should paying attention to before I do the prostration I'm still in the standing position you have to know that first of all my hands should be pointing to the tabla so my hands are not this way and are not this way rather they are pointing to the Qibla now where should I place my hands I have the option either to place my hands next to my shoulders or a little bit close to my ears my knees are not so close together there are a part my feet they are close to each other erect with some toes not all of them because it's impossible to have all your toes pointing to the Qibla but the toes that are bendable can point to the Qibla my arms are wide and spread so my biceps are not close to my sides so I have to spread as I'm spreading my wings and my stomach is not touching my thighs some people just go very down and I'll show you in any quickly hopefully to the best of my knowledge and ability so my forehead my nose must touch the ground and these seven must touch the ground throughout the sejoon because part of the famous mistakes is having your feet dangling or some of the brothers having the left hand on the ground and the other hand while frustrating playing with his beard or looking at something in his pocket so he's hit him on six limbs and this brand is his sujood it if he does this without any legitimate reason so I was standing up now I'm falling into the sujood position and I'm saying Allah Akbar in between so let's look at how I make this route this is one of the ways of doing it so my hands and fingers should be pointing towards the Qibla my face my forehead and my nose are touching the ground I should have my arms apart and away from my body and at the same time my stomach is not touching my thighs some brothers do this and this is wrong and this is too much spread so the appropriate way is either having my hands next to my ears or to my shoulders I can have this one here and I can have this one here look at my feet they are touched together not far away they are touched together with my toes bent towards the Qibla as much as possible now if I'm praying next to people to my right and to my left if I do this I'm gonna annoy them and maybe harm them so it is permissible when you are in a tight position to put your elbows on your thighs or inside what is Haram and prohibited is to do this this is prohibited which I have my arms forearms on the ground like a dog and the Prophet said that this is totally prohibited what should I say when I'm prostrating subhanAllah ba Dada Japan or build a ladder we haven't sabore hampered douche-mobile maniacally - or who so many draws the minimum requirements of hand would be another can I make dua go ahead make drawn as much as I want as much as you want oh Allah pay my debts or Allah guide my children or Allah guide my wife or Allah gave me a second wife or Allah grant me health whatever in Arabic sure I'm Arab and I can't say it in Arabic no problem say it in your own language oh this is interesting yes the closest you are is when you are in Sioux joint position so if I'm in my suit position and I would like to sit between the two prostrations I say Allah Akbar and I sit on my left foot this is called if Dheeraj and I erect my right foot with as many possible toes towards the Qibla my hands are on my thighs and my knees so it's in between the area is possible you don't have to do this you don't have to do this it's here sit normally don't be so technical sometimes people are so technical they forget the prayer they forget what your every sight and just think am I doing this right am i doing this wrong be not follow the Sunnah acknowledge that this is a Sunnah the way of the Prophet and do it naturally and when I sit like this I say Rob bill Finley minimum is once I can say 10 times 10 20 times I can say 2 3 4 whatever well fairly arabel fairly issue of dispute is saying it'll be mandatory or Sunnah some scholars say soon I am inclined to say that it is mandatory because the Prophet is all always used to say any other do is there is a longer do our Beverley or how many are Finnish Borneo and in your fanny all of this is possible this is the prostration or the sitting between the two prostrations it's called if d-rush and if you would like to show it from behind I'm sitting on my left foot and my right foot is erect this is the snap chef I have problems with my right foot so can I put it down like this problem sure I'd like to sit with two feet on one another because this is the only way I feel comfortable no problem your prayer is valid you will lose the reward of the Sunnah what you press not really valid a hey no problem not only that of the Lautner may Allah be pleased with them at the end of its time he used to sit cross-legged and when some of his companions followed him he said no no this is not the Sunnah I'm doing this because of my knees you should sit like the Sunnah but the position is what sitting no matter how you sit little the thing but who are following the Prophet the better it is for your world I must do a second sujood and it's the same format I say Allah Akbar the same thing exactly subhanAllah we'll Anna now after I finished my sujood I have to rise up to the second dragon there is a Sunnah that is called jalsa to list ilaha where i stand up before i stand up i give a small pause and then I say Allah Akbar so you when standing up one should not stand with four fingers between the two feet like some schools of thought say and you go to the message and you find the people standing like this what is this if you want to answer the call of nature go ahead but don't come to the prayer when you're this tight so this is the way I'm standing is wrong some brothers when they want to come and pray they do this why he says the one on the right is far away from me and the one on the left is follow me and the brothers is doing this and doing this ok what are you doing this is done in karate and Taekwondo but not in prayer so how should I stand stand normally the width of your shoulders should be relevant to the distance between your two feet don't stand like this because this is not pointing to the table and don't stand like this because this means you have to see your orthopedic surgeon you have a problem with your knees but stand in a normal way either like this or a little bit part away part from each other make natural the way you stand so I rose to the second raka do I raise my hands nope I simply walk walk and resume my second raka exactly as the first struggle and I decided the Fatiha I recite an optional surah afterwards as according to the Sunnah now one thing that we need to pay attention to and 90% of Muslims are doing unfortunately it is a mandatory act of reciting the Quran of making vicar of making duaa is to move your lips what do you mean sure if you pray the fatiha like this I just said I mean in my head I did not move my lips I did not move my tongue your prayer is invalid both invalid yes it's totally invalid why see when I think of punching my cameraman in the face or taking the wallet of and sitting there and robbing him of his money I didn't utter it I didn't act upon it there is no sin on me whatever goes in my mind there is no sin likewise if I just simply recite the Quran in my mind without moving my lips with it it does not count it's just scanning things in my head I have to say you honest I mean I have to move my lips and my tongue and this is why when some of the companions of the prophet sallallaahu Selim came to him he said to him your tongue must remain moist with the remembrance of Allah which means that you have to move your tongue when reciting the Quran saying Allahu Akbar the people they do like this and they keep on their prayer without moving the lips and this is totally wrong one of the things that a lot of the Muslims also make a mistake in is keeping their eyes closed so what are you doing well I am daydreaming I think I'm an on the beach in cada zoo in a can or nice wow it's fun Allahu Akbar what this is totally Hara why are you closing your eyes he said oh sure I'm distracted whenever I keep my eyes open the man in front of me is moving and the next one who me is touching his pocket and the third one is picking his nose and every time I feel tempted to look at my watch and sometimes I say semi Allahu Liman Hamidah and I don't watch the chandeliers and the lights and the writing on the wall I get distracted so I I close my eyes this is not permissible why because neither the Prophet al-assad nor his companions had ever done this and they had more things to distract them than you now if you tell me that there's a child in front of you what praying sometimes you get these situations you get a three year or four year old child standing in front of you looking to you into your eyes and doing faces to you this would make you break into laughter so in order to avoid this you close your eyes for maybe five ten seconds until he goes away this is okay but to think that tranquility comes only through closing your eyes while doing this this is against this and it's not permissible also one of the common mistakes is that when you are in the record position and you say semi Allahu Liman Hamidah people think that this is time for the aqua Newt so they say send me I'm la who liman hamidah Habana with a cat ham ham Dinka theorem - even mubarak is wrong the raising of the hands should be same allahu liman hamidah if you want to make dua either put your hands to your sides or to what I have indicated to earlier put the right on the left on the chest and say Robin owada cat ham ham the athenian pie even borrowed and fee this is only done in root of Witter when you're making dua in root of Whittier not during their prayers as usual I bow and I prostrate and then I sit for the first - ah hood so when I rise up from the second sujood to sit for my first shot I'm in the position of ft rush I sit on my left foot with my right foot erect with my toes pointing to the Qibla and I begin to say at the Hyatt which is mandatory now my left hand is on my knee and thigh in here my right hand has two positions the first position is to grab the two pinkie and the one next to it finger to attach the middle finger with the thumb doing a circle like this and to point with my index finger like this this is position one which the Sunnah came with the second position is to make a fist with all four fingers pointing only with the index finger so either this or this now what do I do with the index finger the Sunnah as in the hadith of al-amin Hajer the Prophet whenever he sat alayhi salatu was-salam for tisha hood he used to point his index finger moving it making dua with it so the swing that is to point it like this shake it in its position not circling like some people do and not going up and down like people do rather than pointing it and moving it there is another hadith which is not as strong not as authentic which was narrated by Abdullah have Mizzou bear may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the Prophet used to point and does not move but the most authentic opinion is the hadith of Weyerhaeuser that he used to move it throughout so when do we stop chef's you begin by saying after here to lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat as salam alaika ayyuhan nabi warahmatullahi wabarakatuh a ceremony now yada-yada-yada him ash-hadu an LA ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah wash shadow and the Muhammad and I will do who wore a solo with different variations of this the shout and I'm moving my finger point out that I can say either one the hadith of Umar or the hadith of abdullah al masud assalamu alayka ayyuha n-nabi this is abnormal this is rumor maha pub and others or I can say that what I'm below even mustard used to say which is a sahih bukhari a salam o ln nabi warahmatullah wabarakatuh and he said that we used to say at the time of the Prophet when he was alive assalamu alayka you Hanabi but what after he died we used to say a ceremony Len Nabil warahmatullahi wabarakatuh so I can see say either one now this is the first a shout do I offer salutation afterwards by saying allahumma salli ala muhammad in wada edema no the most authentic opinion is that this is a Sunnah Imam Shafi said that if you add salutation upon the Prophet as in the first a shout this is recommended and the vast majority of scholars say this is okay but it is not perdition so you stop at when a muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh now then you go and stand up fort - a hood for your third rack up in Fechter i continue Muhammad Ali allah muhammad wa ala muhammad and i point out my finger throughout until i offer salah if i'm in Madrid or go her ass or Asia I stand up for the third raka I continue the third raka the fourth raka and then I sit for the for the last the Shahada in the last Asha hood which is in a prayer that has two tisha hood the first one and the last one I sit in the position known as terror look and - what means that I sit on the hip the work and I said on my left buttock this is called tawa rock and I erect my right foot as usual but my left foot which I used to sit on now comes underneath my right leg so this is called tawa rook the Prophet used to do this in the third raka in Muharram and in the fourth raka of Lahore acid and Asia now I place my left hat over my knee with it and sometimes it's erect so that I can lean on it because I can see that my hip and my side is a bit tilted because of this way of sitting and my hand is on my thigh pointing my finger and I'm looking and this is something important when I sit for the shot wait the hadith the authentic hadith state of pistol at index finger so I should keep my sight through you know what wiggling it or moving in its position taking it and this is the sooner some scholars say can also look at the position of your preparation but the hadith that proves that this doing it and that is looking at your I masala a wada a camisole a Tyrell rahim allah brought him in the coming of Messiah of Muhammad Ali Mohammed till the end and it is recommended to say or seek refuge in Allah from the four things Elohim and narrow to become inaudible Jahannam when developable in my heaven my mat and fitted in the sea had did Jan and then I can ask whatever I want same as sujood because this is a place where the Prophet told us RA salatu salam that you should select whatever you want from duaa in this position so I ask for Allah's forgiveness I asked for others provision I ask for Allah's health to guidance etc and then amended to conclude before Lam by saying oh and I think Iike what God or Hosni a bad ethic this dua of my either manageable some say it's before Salam others say it's after Salam I'm inclined to say it before Salam because this is the time of drop and then I offer Salam and how do I offer Salaam say as Salam o aleikum wa rahmatullah assalamualaikum warahmatullah if you notice I did not pause I did not say as Salam o aleikum wa rahmat allah assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah it's not this way and it's wrong to say it people say as more and then turn no it should be simultaneous as Salam o aleikum o la la assalamualaikum warahmatullah and the Sunnah is to make those behind you see your cheek so you don't say do this so they see your cheek as they reported it in the companions we used to see the whiteness of his cheek and a salatu salam to the right and to the left among the common mistakes your hands in that the shehad after you finish people usually do this this it's a sign that they have concluded who are you signing this for so while in the - I hope they finished it - shahad and the Imam is still praying so they say a lot of mine at the kosher pickle Hassan Arab additi Annie by the way guys I'm finished some of them in Salaam they would say as Salam o aleikum wa rahmatullah as Salam or aleikum wa rahmatullah as if they're living right indicator left indicator driving I think this part of driving lessons knows is wrong you don't have to do this you're not turning right or left so doing this is prohibited the Prophet SAW the Companions moving their hands while in prayer and he said do not do this like the tails of wild horses you know the tale of the white horse is always wiggling in an upright and the Prophet prohibited them from saying this and it is important to learn how to pray according to the Sunnah and that you're doing this for the sake of Allah Azza WA JAL some of the brothers in the standing position when they're praying and the end of the surah is mineral Jannetty when the imam is reciting huh and i'm praying behind him the moment he says mineral Jannetty he lets go what is this this is indicating that i know that this is the last verse of the Imam and that he's going for record and this is acknowledged in long sewers so if he's reciting from a long story that people don't usually know and I know that he's going to make record now I let go so people next to me said more mashallah is a half of it she's sure I didn't do this for that intention why did you do it then don't follow the Imam as long as they ma'am is doing this you do it the moment the mm says Allahu Akbar you let go but not fulfilling this and doing it before a man means that there's something wrong either you want to inform people that I know the surah and I know that he's going for the record I'm a smart man or there's something wrong I don't know what another thing that a lot of the Muslims failed to do is the moment that Imam says assalamualaikum warahmatullah you find the congregation doing this and if the Imam take his time to do the left one this come on man I'm with imam what are you doing come on hurry man my neck is hurting so they do this and this is totally wrong they should wait until the Imam says assalamu alaikum wa rahmatu allah assalamu alaikum warahmatu law now they say their first sleep a ceremonial messiah so it is wrong to do the slim with the imam when he first does his first know you have to only move after he finishes the Salam also a very common mistake is how you follow the enum what do you mean the companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us in an authentic hadith that when he used to pray with the prophet alayhi salat wa salam we did not bend our backs now they're in the standing position er their backs are straight we never bent our backs until the forehead of the Prophet Allah so son touched the ground whoa meaning that if the Prophet says Allahu Akbar they wait until his head touches the ground then they start descending the vast majority of people the moment the Imam says oh they immediately go and fall maybe they are fitter faster than the Imam so they race and they go to prostration before the amendment this invalidates air so be careful you do not move from the pillar you're doing to the following pillar until the Ummah teaches it so in record he says Allah you don't until he bends then you bent when he says Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah once he's erect and standing you stand up and you cascade this to all your crazy people ask when we stand in the direction of Qibla so how pinpoint should we be exact in our direction well the Prophet told us the answer the sisters say are our prayers similar or different to men prayers a lot of the sisters also asked about their attire when praying how do we pray a travelers prayer what are the conditions where tayammum is allowed in order to pray how to pray the missed raka there are people of who kiss their thumbs during a van and a AMA when ashhadu anna muhammadan rasulullah said is there any proof of the of this definitely no question can one pray Sunnah of Bajor after the false a lot [Music] [Music]"
