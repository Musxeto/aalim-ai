  "title": "Reverts afraid of declaring their Islam due to family pressure - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a lot of the reverts are under pressure living in with their kafir family and they're afraid of what measures they might take to reprimand them for such an act so they don't declare Islam now between you and Allah you can be a Muslim but between you and the other Muslim communities you're still at after if we fail to hear you declare la ilaha illaallah muhammaden-rasul allah then we cannot accept you as a Muslim which means that in this dunya if you were to die you are not to be treated as a Muslim you will not be washed shrouded preyed upon and buried among the Muslims in Muslim cemeteries so it is important if someone comes to assertion I'm a Muslim I believe but I don't want to say the Shahada this is a blatant kafir and it is not accepted of him"
