  "transcript": "and my second question was we are being uh financially supported uh by our uncles as we are uh studying uh me and my brother are we allowed to use the support that we are getting or we are supposed to do something on our own as well thank you yeah what do you mean by that uh like uh we are being financially supported okay so if he gives you allowance if he gives you an allowance what's the problem in buying whatever you want with it isn't it a gift okay i think i don't know we are being supported by a monthly not just allowances okay so what is your question uh my question is is it okay for us to uh use the uh money which are uh which is being given to us uh or not thank you okay i will answer inshallah now his second question is quite ambiguous to me if i understood it correctly his uncle supports him and his brother financially to go through college so he pays for their tuition and for their food and accommodation and he's asking is it permissible for me to accept or use this money the answer is yes as long as he's giving it to you willingly it's yours once it's it had reached you once you possess it it's yours whether you buy food with it or you save it and fast the whole of the year this money is halal for you to use you"
