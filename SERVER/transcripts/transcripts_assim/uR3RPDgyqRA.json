  "transcript": "a young man smokes weed to focus and says Allah is the most forgiving the most understanding I know the same example you use for the nightclub situation but what do you have to say for the scenario this is how Satan messes up with people's head so if someone came to this brother who's doing weed to focus and Allah is most forgiving most merciful and said to him listen I'd like to hook up with your sister so that we could have good time and we could focus together and and work uh late at night uh on our project at school so you okay with that said definitely not of course so so tou we have sh we have rules and regulations and dos and don'ts follow this and you're safe the more the the moment you get off track and follow Satan uh whispering and do sinful acts Allah will punish you for that regardless unless you repent and you feel remorseful and you quit and you ledge not to go back to the sin and you do do good deeds and ask Allah for forgiveness then Allah will forgive you but you don't say this upfront and say yeah I'm I'm going to indulgent in Haram and in sins and then ask Allah for forgiveness yes cuz they almost I think the issue is like why even the point of saying he all will understand it's almost Des to you mentally that I need this and the Shan plays with me he almost creates this image in your head that I need it so therefore it becomes okay if you needed something it has to fit within the Shar boundaries yes exactly in during fasting Ramadan I need to eat I need to drink goes back to the basic but I have to refrain from that until the sun sets in Canada you have little time uh very short days like in 19 hours or 18 hours so I have a great need to eat and drink but Allah says watch out"
