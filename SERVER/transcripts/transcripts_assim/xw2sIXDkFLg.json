  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen Fuad What about you? Alhamdulillah Sheikh Hayyakallah How can I help you Akhi? So Sheikh my question is If a person uses a toothbrush instead of CWAC Will he be entitled to equal the reward? It's an issue of dispute among scholars Whether this is sufficient or not And the most authentic opinion is That what is intended Is to brush and clean your mouth and teeth Now the best way of doing it Is using the Arak The Miswak made from this twig And I know people pay money for this But Alhamdulillah we are graced and blessed by Allah To find it cheap here and available If you can't do that You can use any other form of twig Or a normal toothbrush If you add to that toothpaste Even more better Because it gives a nice scent And maybe fragrance I don't know To it, it adds value as well So Alhamdulillah you will be rewarded for that as well Alhamdulillah"
