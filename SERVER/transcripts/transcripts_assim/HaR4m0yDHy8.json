  "transcript": "say from India actually in my country India most teachers in online tutions are non Maham and also not Muslims and are not fully covered so can I get classes from them okay so the issue is getting private tuition from anah from the opposite gender and the answer is no alhamdulillah there are many many Alternatives where you will find male to teach you rather than females maybe the females are more in number due to the fact that they have no jobs but there will always be male available and hence you must not opt for the opposite gender to teach you and you have to go for the same gender and Allah Knows Best"
