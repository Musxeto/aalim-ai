  "transcript": "Dhafi from Indonesia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. So Sheikh, I really love animals and I want to keep exotic species of my pets for example like tarantulas. So the question is are there animals that are prohibited to keep as pets? Jazakallah. Wa Jazak. Basically keeping pets in Islam is permissible and the hadith of Anas Ibn Malik in the Sahih where he says I had a young sibling who had a bird in a cage and he used to take care of it until the bird died. So he was saddened and depressed and the Prophet used to come and joyfully ask my younger brother, []? Nicknaming him by Aba Umair and asking him about the small bird, what did the bird do? From this, the scholars stemmed that it is permissible to keep pets in the house as long as you provide for them and feed them. The exception would be in pets that we are not allowed to keep such as mice. We're ordered to kill mice in Islam because they're harmful and bad. Snakes, scorpions and the likes that are harmful. So I've seen people taking pets with snakes, anacondas or a small python. I don't know if you can get a small python or not but depends. Or a tarantula. I think it's called a tarantula. It's a big hairy spider that is poisonous. Or scorpions and the likes. Some even may pet alligators. All of this is haram and prohibited. There are other exotic pets or animals or the likes that have no value. So basically speaking, if you pet a cat, a cat, this is permissible. If you pet a parrot, a bird, if you have a fish tank and you put exotic nice fish in it, there's no problem in that and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
