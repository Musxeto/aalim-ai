  "transcript": "Is it allowed to pay profits from fixed deposits in Islamic banks? Islamic music. In the last concert a month ago in Scotland, three Indonesian women came and played musical instruments in heavy metal and they were hijabi. A band in Scotland playing heavy metal and they were hijabis. What is this? Islamic heavy metal, Islamic rock. I don't know how they do it but somewhere. So this is ridiculous. Tomorrow we will have Islamic billy dancing. Now how is this going to be? It's Islamic. Sharia certified. So you have to look into the dealings of the Islamic bank. Is it real or is it camouflaging their transactions by the word Islamic? And nowadays unfortunately you can get so many fatwas for the price, two for the price of one, depending upon the bonuses. Yes there are Islamic Sharia that follows Islam and scholars who fear Allah but in the midst of DR, doctor, so and so, so many people are having the title doctor, so and so. The doctorate is not an indication whether they're saying the truth or not. But people are, we have four members on the Sharia board, doctor, so and so, doctor, so and so, doctor, so and so. This is kosher. MashaAllah. And no, you have to look into it. If the Sharia board is reliable and they're dealing in Islamic dealings, yes go ahead, put it in fixed deposit. There's no problem. This is mudaraba. They're taking your money and working in halal investments with low risk and they're giving you a little profit that is variable and if there is loss you're going to be sharing your share in that loss. There's no problem in that Inshallah."
