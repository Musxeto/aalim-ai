  "transcript": "sh my question is um we know that women's prayer is best at home which is in the bedroom where she gets most high reward and for prayers like janaza and J it is permissible for them to pray in the Masjid with the congregation but my question is these four prayer that I've mentioned to you what is highly recommended for women praying in the bedroom or in the Masjid with the congregation but of course like jum not jum in the home but Z I hope you understand first of all it was the prophet who directed his female companion by saying I know that you love to pray in my Masjid however your prayer in home or at home is better than your prayer in my Masjid and this includes all prayers including Twi janaza Friday Etc so this is the fatwa of the Prophet himself Alat wasam that women's prayer are or or women prayers are better in their homes not in the Masjid of the Medina where it is better than elsewhere by a thousand times nor at the Masjid of Mecca which the prayer is better than 100,000 times elsewhere so if this is the fatwa of the Prophet Alam no one has any extra words to say and we would say the same recommendation pray at home this is best for you if you insist and want to pray at the Masjid this is totally permissible because the prophet also said to the men do not prevent the Servants of Allah among the females from the houses of Allah if a woman wants to go to pray in the Masjid as a man do not prevent her or stop her and Allah Knows Best"
