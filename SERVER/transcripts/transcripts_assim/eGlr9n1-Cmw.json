  "title": "Is enforcing evil & forbidding good Kufr or Hypocrisy (must I remove profile pic)? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates Sheikh, is enforcing evil and forbidding good and acts of disbelief because I took the picture today after I think I did that, yeah, I did that and I thought maybe this is because I heard you saying it's like a major sign of hypocrisy so I took this picture and I have it as my profile picture. Do I have to remove it or not? First of all, enforcing evil and forbidding good is one of the characteristics of the hypocrites as mentioned in Chapter 9, Surat At-Tawbah and they collaborate upon this and they're allies one to the other, however, this is a style of life and a way of living, not a random act. A random act would be a sin but not a characteristic of a hypocrite. So I'm sitting in the living room or in the waiting room of somewhere and I look at the man next to me and I would like to take a smoke. So I say, fancy a fag, a cigarette, a joint? Fag in the old British way is a cigarette, not that fag. So fancy one? Okay, now I am enforcing evil, I'm advising, I'm endorsing it but I'm not a hypocrite, I'm an openly sinner which might be one of the characteristics of an initiative to be a hypocrite but it's not part of the ideological hypocrisy, rather it's a practical hypocrisy. So, your picture that you've snapped and put in your profile which is haram, this is sinful but you're not a kafir for doing that and you're not a hypocrite insha'Allah, however you're sinful, you have to be careful because such sins accumulate without you knowing it and just before noticing it's already too late. May Allah protect us all."
