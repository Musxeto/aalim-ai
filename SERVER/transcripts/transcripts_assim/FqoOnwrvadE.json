this studio I have with meim Alim it's a pleasure pleasure having you with usim glad to be here i' also I'd like to welcome my three participants on my left I have Mahmud who is a translator as well as t a student at the Academy of Art and on my right I have Abdullah who is a computer programmer Sheik hassim we're talking in this episode of Youth talk about prayer and especially for youth let's start off with something very very basic what is the importance of prayer in Islam it was said that any religion that does not have prayer has no value at all and this is basically true because prayer is the connection between you and your creator your lord and in Islam prayer has a very important role as it is the second pillar of Islam and Islam is based on five main pillars the second one isay prayer the five daily prayers and if you research Islamic Traditions though I don't like the word tradition if you research the Islamic law rules verdicts you will find that most if not all these rules and instructions were revealed to the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he was on Earth and it was revealed to him either by or through the arch angel angel Gabriel or through Revelation directly from Allah Asel with the exception of prayers the prayer was made obligatory upon on all Muslims in the seventh heaven when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had the miraculous night Journey to the seventh heaven in one night and came back and that was in the period of Mecca da and once you look into it and how it was revealed and and made obligatory to our Prophet sallallah alhi wasallam you be amazed of it at the very beginning Allah made it 50 prayers during the day and night and by far if it was as it is it was then if we were supposed to do 50 prayers per day and night I tell you that most Muslims if not all would not do it because they're so lazy and you know our our conditions when the prophet came back he was met by mosa Moses may Allah be pleased with him so he told him what what took place what happened so our Prophet said that Allah Asel has given me 50 prayers during the day and night that I should perform my nation and myself he told him Moses go back again to your lord and ask him to reduce it because I've been dealing with the sons of Israel for so long and man I know them they're going to cause a lot of problems for you so go back again so the prophet went back and Allah Asel reduced it and every time he went to Moses and he told him he he told him go back again and Allah kept on reducing them five five five until they became five daily prayers in the day and night Moses was not satisfied may Allah be uh May uh peace and blessing of Allah be upon him so he told him go back to your lord again and ask him for another reduction of these wife so the prophet said Muhammad wasam said I'm I cannot now this is too much I'm I'm embarrassed of going on and off to my Lord asking him for uh reducing the prayers so Allah declared that it things do not change whatever I declare they have to stay as they are it is five daily prayers but you will be rewarded for 50 so these five daily prayers are essential in our Rel religion they keep on regenerating our faith and they keep on reconnecting us with Allah throughout the day and night and that is why we have a lot of faith in our hearts when we preserve these prayers and we stay a away from a lot of the sins because we are always reminded of Allah throughout these prayers what about uh the one who always pray pray but he uh he he he almost do sin or almost uh make wrongs and he still pray so what about that again this is a different thing altogether because prayer is a pillar of Islam you have to do it if you don't do it then you are not considered as a Muslim you have to pray this prayer helps you in staying away from sin but it does not prevent you definitely does prevent so if you are weak by nature and you sin this does not mean that you should abandon prayer on the contrary We Tell those who pray abandon sin but they do contradict yet they can coexist to a certain period of time and Man by nature is sinful how strong is the role of parents in bringing up their children with the importance of prayer it is it's very important because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and if I recall correctly throughout my researching in the Islamic uh uh laws in the Hadith and in the in the Quran the only situation where the Prophet tells us Sall Ali wasallam to spank a child is only on prayer the prophet says wasallam order your children to pray when they're seven years old and spank them for not praying when they're 10 years old and nowhere else in the Quran or in the Sunnah where we're told to spank children for doing anything except for prayer so the prophet did not tell us Sall wasallam spank your children if they don't finish their dish mhm he doesn't tell us spank children if they don't do their homework or so on he tells us spank them and he does not tell us torture them or hang them from the chandelier for a day or two he doesn't tell us to you know cut their limbs or something spanking them in a nice gentle way but to show them that theyve yes they something that was wrong and this Hadith by itself is miraculous on its own terms of what in terms of the Prophet telling us to order them from 7 years old till they're 10 years old but verbally only to pray not to insult them not to criticize them not to do anything to make them stay away from prayer on the contrary to encourage them so imagine if you have a child for three years you multiply this by 360 days and then multiply it by five prayers per day and night you do the math maybe it's approximately 3,000 4,000 I don't know if you keep on saying and ordering this child for all this amount of time to pray I guarantee you when he's 10 years old it's going to be in his system it's going to be in his blood veins but unfortunately I know parents with kids that are 25 30 years old and they do not pray they do not waake him for feder prayer whenever I talked to his father he said he's still young he's 25 years old what are you waiting for until the guy is is is is 50 no this is the Islamic way of ordering and instructing and raising our kids how to pray abdah you want to say something yeah uh we have seen a lot of people who um while praying I mean while standing in prayer they just stand too long and other was just you know as if you were playing some kind of sport so um fabrication fabrication yeah so H H how could we um what should we do in per what is the period should we stand in in the prayer MH actually there isn't any fixed period that one should time himself uh in prayer the most essential thing is that you have to have this submissiveness in your prayer so a person could go on for an hour or two in one single prayer and another one could go on for 3 minutes or two and a half minutes for the same prayer both prayers are acceptable accepted and maybe the shorter one might be better than the longer one it depends on the contemplation the concentration and the submissiveness in prayer so it is not something that you can calculate by saying that this is longer this is better but that cause um you know debate between between Scholars and maybe between Muslim themselves because those say that yeah we don't have a lot of time we need to go back to work and stuff and and and others say all right we perform the the the Salah um in accordance with the I mean um more concentration yeah yeah I me is the importance it's not necessarily the importance in the length of the prayer itself but in the as you're saying being sub uh submissive well actually this is one of the greatest attributes of Islam that it is flexible MH so in work places for example when you have only 15 minutes break it is not logical for someone to come and say listen I'm a Muslim I'm going to take my time for the rest of the day for a couple of hours to pray and form a Bion and no this is not acceptable and it's extremely unacceptable when the guy goes back to his house and pray Isa prayer in less than F 15 seconds so it he should be consistent and it's flexible in the sense that if you're praying on your own you have the whole night for you to pray you prolong your prayer as much as you want the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam set the example for us regarding the length of prayers for example F prayer which is the longest prayer of the day he used to recite 100 verse so this is pretty long okay but in some instances in an incident the prophet s wasallam prayed both raas with a which is not more than three lines in the first and the same the same Surah so this sets the example that listen as a Muslim you have this short it is acceptable and you have this long is acceptable it depends if you're praying on your own you may prolong it as much as you want if you're leading the prayer then you should take care of those who are praying behind you because among them there is a sick person there is there are the elderly there are those who have lots of things to do after prayer so by prolonging your prayer you're going to cause a lot of enemies to hate what you're doing but forgive my question she do we pray because we are ordered to pray or is there some wisdom behind prayers actually there are lots of wisdoms behind it but definitely if Allah did not order us to pray I'm not going to pray say there's no Revelation for us that uh uh uh okay you pray you fast whatever we do we do it because Allah has instructed us to do it whether we can sense and feel the wisdom behind it or not and this is very essential because in materialistic uh countries and and environments people tend to logic whatever they see and in so many cases you fail your logic fails you in religion you may not apply this methodology because if you apply your logic to religion you end up in the losing end this is not logical is it yeah okay I'll give you an example when Allah created Adam he ordered Satan to prostrate to Adam Adam uh Satan made The Unforgiven mistake he applied his logic he said come on I'm better than he is you created me from fire and you created him from clay and the result was he in he is in Hell forever so you never apply your logic with the orders of Allah the almighty or with the orders of the instructions of the Prophet sallam having said that we as Muslims believe 100 well let me exaggerate a bit 120% that there is a wisdom and in 99.9% it's like the Arab uh elections okay in 99.9% we succeed in pinpointing the wisdom behind it anything just you name it I I can give it to you but there is always 01 per that Allah is testing your faith and belief in accepting it as it is without acknowledging or knowing the wisdom what's the wisdom behind uh uh making intoxicants forbidden it's very easy it makes liver cancer it makes you do things you regret doing it and so on and on and on so the wisdom is there fornicating the wisdom is there I can I can tell it uh um giving money to the poor zaka uh prayer fasting all of these things I can I can you know pinpoint the wisdom behind them but sometimes I I'm encountered with things that are test of my faith and belief without any logic and here we come at the fork of the road those who believe in Allah those who believe in the Unseen as they are described in the Quran would follow and say we have heard and we obey yes but those who apply their l would probably refute this and maybe newy their Islam for example and I always give this example because I like it it's very funny if someone comes to you and asks you about Islam you tell them that the pillars of Islam is blah blah blah and one of them is prayer he says what's prayer you say we pray five times a day that's cool how do you pray you say we perform ablution we wash our Limbs and face and three times in every single pray so this is almost 15 times a day so wow man your religion is neat you wash your feet 15 times I barely wash my face once a day only in the morning your religion is a religion of cleanliness how would you feel I would feel proud of course you know of My Religion yes thank you you're a non-muslim you're you're acknowledging that my relig religion is a religion of cleanness I am very proud I could fly but then he asks me a very simple question he says what happens if you don't have water so just simple I just hit the sand with my hands and wash my face and my hands with the sand what your religion is a religion of cleanness and what are you doing why are you doing this said well Allah instructed me to do this in the Quran dry Evolution said again I cannot understand if you don't have water that cleans why do you dust your face and hands the least you could do is nothing so well sorry this is my religion now if I apply my logic I would say du um there's something fishy you know I don't like this but as a Muslim I say yes I do do this and I believe that this is the ruing of Allah the wisdom there is a great wisdom behind this but I don't know it as I don't know a lot of things in this universe so I accept it as it is coming back to the question everything that we do and perform we are do doing it because Allah ordered us to do prayer is one of them now if I comply with the instructions and Orders of Allah by praying wonders will happen and I can see this in any Muslim that preserves the prayer observes the prayer and prays five times a day or more knows this by the Peace of Mind Tranquility uh uh uh the lack of depression and you know he's not depressed he's he's not sad he's always satisfied with whatever he is getting from Allah even if he's the poorest even is if he's the most uh uhh ill chronically ill person yet he is always praising Allah and saying alhamdulillah I'm in a blessing of Allah okay please go ahead there's um conditions or um steps that we should follow in order to feel um the um to feel that we are um before God and we are before Allah subhah wa tala uh and to make us contemplate in the Salah and not to be just uh performing actions without I mean without yeah without the spirit of the prayer this is a a standard question that a lot of Muslims ask how do we reach level of contemplation submissiveness and concentration in Salah because a lot of the Muslims pray and at the end of their prayer they feel that they've missed something or it was just a routine you know just praying without any Spirit behind it the answer is is very difficult it's a Lifestyle the most important thing to be able to feel the submissiveness to have the in your Salah in your prayer is to know who you are praying to if you don't know Allah then all what you're doing is in vain because why why are you praying I'm afraid that if the authorities arrest me they're going to you know whip my back or I'm afraid that if I don't pray something bad is going to happen my parents were going to not going to be uh uh pleased with me I don't know I'm just I I pray because my parents pray everybody I I don't know I pray because I'm Muslim but why do I pray don't ask me I'm just doing it for the heck of it if you don't know Allah you have a big problem because the knowing Allah loving Allah is the essence of your life and there were so many people that claim that they love Allah the Jews and the Christians claim that they love Allah and Allah loves them and in the Quran it's mentioned and Allah has made it a test to those who claim that they love Allah Allah says uh uh uh oh Muhammad say to them if you claim that you love Allah then follow me and Allah will love you so so if you know Allah which means that when you say allahar Allah is greater or Allah is great you know who you are standing in front of in the sense that I'm standing in front of the Creator I'm standing uh in front of the uh uh only one that supports me and the provider of all what I'm in when I stand in front of or uh uh in front of Allah Asel and bow to him I say oh praise be to Allah the almighty sensing that without him this breath that I take I cannot send it free he makes everything in my life perfect he makes the blood runs in my veins he gives me the blessing of eyesight he creates all this universe for me now imagine with in this studio with these spotlights it's very harmful right yeah it's annoying imagine if Allah Almighty all of a sudden when you are in the midst of the night the Sun comes out just like this everybody would be blind Allah is so kind to us that he makes the sun rises so gradually that our eyes are used to it now if you know who you're standing in prayer in front of then when you say allahar your mind will be focused you'll contemplate you'll have the love the fear the Hope in that who you are praying for it's a long process but it's worth working for it's worth working for of course okay we've got now a short break and we'll be back in a few moments [Music] uh the prophet s have informed us that we should not obey no one on the account of disobeying Allah subhana tal so the superiority is to Allah's command so the husband tells his wife that I want you to check hands with my colleagues with my business partners no even if it leads to divorce if the husband says to his wife that you have to party with me with partners and so on no you have to take your hijab off no by any mean commun with Allah subhanahu wa tala definitely Allah subhana tala knows your language and he will be very happy to answer your Dua [Music] [Music] welcome back I think we'll take a question from one of our participants Mahmud yeah uh at College days uh when we were in class and was called for some of our colleagues went up the class going to prayer at the due time in congregation so must prayers be performed in congregation and it's it's a pre take to leave work to leave study for going to the mosque to do prayers in on time and in congregation M the majority of Scholars say that congregational prayer is obligatory on those who it is obligatory upon such as men boys and so on but and uh women for example it's not obligatory on them to pray now the evidence that backs this up the authentic Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi am was approached by a blind man and this blind man put his case in front of the Prophet s wasallam by saying that oh prophet of Allah I'm a blind man a blind man and I live far away from the mosque and Medina roads are lonely and creepy especially at night and there are you know uh things roaming around you know insects scorpions uh snakes uh wolves wolves coyotes wherever and I don't have a suitable man to lead me to prayer now the man is putting justifications in front of the Prophet sallam so oh prophet of Allah do I have the excuse not to attend the congregational prayer so the prophet said yes so the man went away going out from the Masjid just before he reached the door he took told him come back so the blind man came back again so the prophet asked him can you repeat your question again so the man repeated the same question again so the prophet asked him do you hear the aan can you hear the call for prayer which means of course they did not have any loud speakers but at the same time they did not have any concrete walls uh uh or cement structures they didn't not have double glazed uh glass uh uh um windows or whatever so the sound of or the voice of a person calling for the prayer if he was on top of a building would probably reach a a circle with a diameter of let's say 2 kilomet 3 kilm which is not a big distance so the prophet asked him do you hear the aan do You Hear the call for prayer so the blind man said yes so the prophet saidat then answer the call call for prayer with the congregation I find no excuse for you this means that it's obligatory upon every single male who is capable of attending and who hears or with is within the vicinity of a Masjid a close a mosque is close to it enough to be able to attend the prayer that he attends it it's a must now with loudspeakers you could be living like 15 miles away from a mosque but still hear the aan is it obligatory for me to attend no it's not because the distance is far away uh uh from you that it's not obligatory to attend we go back to the second issue which is must those who are in college or in their work workplace leave their jobs to attend prayer the answer would be yes it's a must but attending the prayer is an elastic phrase you can attend a prayer which means that you open the mosque before the call for thean half an hour and then you wait and stay until the call for the aan then you perform austion and you pray voluntary prayers as much as you want in order to escape from work and this is unacceptable you are being paid for what you do mhm and you have to do it but also it's you it's obligatory for you to pray so you have to pray the thing that is obligatory upon you if your boss if your management allows you to exceed five or 10 minutes which is the usual stuff then okay it's understandable that you pray take a break a 20 minutes break for prayer but more than that would be an exaggeration and it would not be for the sake of Prayer there was something I wanted to ask um concerning the dress or the clothing that you wear when you go to prayer um is it different when you're in congregation or when you go to the MOs and when you pray at home that's okay regarding the dress code there is something that is the minimal acceptable level and there is something that is preferable so the minimal accepted level is that you cover the areas where where you uh uh uh no other person could see and and this is in the case of necessity if someone was stranded in the desert and he has only enough piece of cloth to cover from his belly button to his to his uh knee this is what he should cover now he can pray and his prayer is accepted but this is the necessity is is for necessity this is the minimal acceptable now can I go wearing this or wearing whatever to The Masque to pray the answer would be no because masks should be respected therefore you should dress normally and this is minimal you're not supposed to uh uh uh to put on a three-piece suit to pray no just wear your normal uh uh casual uh uh clothes uh uh uh providing that that they do not break any dress code in Islam in the sense that it's not seethrough it's not tight it's not imitating the non-muslims so if you wear your normal suit and go this is okay if you wear your trousers and a shirt it's okay now if you wear pajamas and go to a mosque to pray this is accepted but it is not highly recommended because you would not go and to meet a minister or a VIP uh wearing this so the least you would do is to be properly addressed MH but what's what's the you were saying that there's the least and there's like the optimum or something the optimum is the more you give attention to your prayer by you know dring in a nice so the prophet Sall Ali wasallam used to put perfumes used to dress neatly and used to pray but but he would not have something specially for prayer except for uh Eid Festival uh uh which is we have two festivals during uh the whole year yes or uh uh uh in Friday um prayer which the congregation is our weekly celebration every Friday the noon prayer Friday uh prayer the prophet used to have a special dress a special garment for for that and when you're at home you can wear whatever you want but again you coming back to abdullah's question if you want to have the submissiveness and uh concentration in prayer imagine yourself praying with your pajamas or with your th uh uh sleeping garment and imagine yourself praying and preparing yourself for Prayer by performing Evolution putting on your your suit or putting on a decent as if you're going out and praying inside your home you would find that there's one a lot a lot of difference because you're giving it more attention than just waking up I pray and go back to bed again it does not have any sense in life uh uh in it I see what about women for I I see girls who wear trouses and don't cover their hair but when the when the prayer is is called for they pick up a scarf and hide the and cover the hair and pray in their trousers what ruling on that their prayer is not acceptable it's it's not accepted the situation is not acceptable simply because women must cover their entire body and unfortunately trousers do not so when they bow of prostrate their thighs their uh uh back uh would would appear and and and this means means that as if they're not wearing anything so this is not acceptable even for men if they're wearing tight trousers and they pray and their their private area that must not be seen is exposed in size not in in in in the flesh then again this is not acceptable for sisters they have to cover their whole body with this garment or scarf that and and most Muslim sisters are used to this and that's what they're doing and that's uh that again where that's wherever they're praying whatever they're praying whether they're praying home or they're praying in public and this brings us uh to a question that a lot of the sisters um might ask saying that okay I cover my hair I cover my body if I'm praying in public if I'm praying in front of men but what happens if I'm praying home in my own room no one is watching MH why should I cover my hair we say that this is Allah's ruling she says this is not logical said okay then undress and pray nude would this be acceptable no no no this this is too much I just want to uncover my hair so okay who draws the line who says this is acceptable and this is not turn off the light you're not you're you're not going to see yourself so if you pray nude it's like praying fully dressed in in darkness it is the ruling of Allah he tells you to pray in this format wearing this special type of clothings he tells us to pray in this format wearing the special type of clothing that covers the body and we have to comply see Abdullah please yeah um someone might ask why should men um uh uh perform prayer uh collectively and the women's should not so what what is the wisdom behind that it's not the women should not they don't have to but if they want they can't pray in congregation women are not ordered to do this so we cannot say they shouldn't no they don't have to the reason behind this is that in Islam the normal position for a female is in her house MH and the normal position for the man is outside his house because he spends most of his day outside trying to put the bread on the table so he has to work he has to go to the farm he has to go to the factory he has to trade he has to take the kids to the hospital he has to attend the congregation and see how the community is doing by meeting others in the in the Masjid why while females are supposed to stay home provide the man with all what he needs ensure that their children are uh brought up in an Islamic and nice way so each one has his own individual role this does not mean that women cannot pray in the Masjid on the contrary the wives of the Prophet wasallam used to pray with him in the Masjid that did not prevent the Prophet Sall wasallam from saying that it is best for a woman to pray in her house because a woman came once to the prophet and told him that I like to pray with you in the Masjid so he told her I know that you like to pray with me for in the Masjid but praying in your house is better better than praying in my Masjid and praying in the hallway is better than praying in your house and praying in your Chambers is better than praying in the hallway and praying in your own individual room isay better than than praying in your Chambers so the more you're away from men and their exposure the better that is even than praying in the prophet's MOS actually she how can I respond to somebody tells me that uh until here is white so it's a good communication between me and my and God so it doesn't make any sense to to pray or not if he's pure inside and the faith is inside it doesn't necessarily have to be accompanied by prayer yeah well this is we can tackle this through different uh uh uh ways but the easiest to say is again sense and logic do not apply to our religion you order to do something you have to do it if you apply your sense and logic and you find otherwise then you are in deep trouble the prophet says wasallam that it is the partition between us and Them the meaning the non-muslims is prayer and whoever abandons prayer is a cafir is a non-muslim and this was reported in so many uh ways also in the Quran Allah tells us that if they repent pray and give zakat then they are your brethren which means that if not then they're not the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that I was almost this close this is the prophet saying I was almost this close of ordering someone to call for the prayer and deputizing someone to lead the prayer and then take a group of men and myself a whole bunch of firewood to the houses of men who did not attend prayer with us so that I would burn their houses to the ground see the punishment for not praying in congregation not period the prophet says the only reason that prevented me from doing so is the presence of women and children in these houses otherwise I would have done so so he did not burn the houses to the ground simply because there were women and children who prayer in the congregation is not obligatory on them so this tells you that prayer has a very essential and important role in Islam without prayer then a person is not a Muslim a person that does not pay zaka is sinful but he's still a Muslim a person who does not fast Ramadan is sinful it's a major sin but he is still Muslim a person who does not perform pilgrimage though he is capable financially and physically it's sinful it's a major sin but he is still a Muslim but a person who does not pray the five daily prayers is not a Muslim so those who int who who claim that they have Purity and whiteness in in their soul and therefore they don't see any reason for them to pray we tell them you are not the judge of that it's Allah who is judging you and that is why our Prophet s Alam told us that Allah Almighty does not care does not look at how you look or your financial status Allah does not look at your bodies or at your color or at how much you you you you own and possess but he looks at your hearts and your Deeds so if you claim your heart is pure and clean then you have to look to at your Deeds are they in in correspondence to your heart or not because if you in claim to be pure and and and and and fresh and white from the inside and you don't pray I guarantee you that it's all black and blackim for people or for for people yes who do not pray um and they have the intention to do so or they want to but sometimes they feel that they've um as we mentioned before that they've committed some sins or that they're far away from from God so they feel ashamed to do so how can you start to bring somebody into prayer is it something that will happen like overnight for example in a second somebody has said oh I've been doing things bad I'll start praying right away and then he'll just keep on doing it or is it something that takes a bit of time for example yeah especially and does companionship your friend do they affect that in any way yeah and also especially how how could we when when we um know that someone doesn't perform prayer so how could we just deliver yeah to tell him that yeah this is this is a major this is a major sin you might be a disbeliever because of that how how could we you know in an an intelligent way to deliver a message like this to first of all to ask someone to pray is a straightforward request now to have him pray needs a little bit more of convincing there are different ways of of of convincing people depending on your relationship with them for example if it were my child if it were my boy I would order him in a military fashion go and pray end of discussion so he would not come and say well convince me okay I'm not GNA give you your pocket money I'm going to I'm not going to give you a car I'm not GNA you're grounded for a whole week so well prayer is a nice thing to do I'm going to pray so this is different now if I'm talking to a colleague if I say this to him he's going to say the hell with you I have different colleagues I can go out with I can you know socialize with I don't need you anymore so you're instructed to behave with him in a different way by uh uh tempting him by telling him how kind Allah was to him by showing him that all these blessings he's enjoying are because of Allah so the least you could do say thank you and the best way of saying thank you is by performing Prayer by showing him how many times Allah has protected him from going into trouble trouble and and and I I could myself I could you know write a whole book about this and it it's the grace of Allah so the least you can do is be thankful now if you're talking to someone who is above you a boss parents uh uh someone in a higher position it's going to be far different than this so everyone has his own way of calling him into Islam calling him to to pray and it depends on the situation it's there is no one size fits all uh uh coming back to abdullah's remark the best way is to recite the verses of the Quran and the prophets saying you know you could countlessly say that scholar so and so says so and so and the book I read says so and that encyclopedia says so without touching his heart but when in the majority of of of of Muslims when you go to them and say Allah the almighty says the prophet says and imagine inah the people of paradise go to the people of hell and ask them what threw you in hell why are you in hell the first thing the people of Hell answer the people of paradise the first reason they say we did not pray they give four reasons the first one what threw you in hell they say we did not pray the first reason so when you tell someone that does not pray listen man the money you have is is not going to do you any good you're going in your grave for nothing the the wives the the kids the the the the power it's all in vain if you don't pray it's hell forever if you do it's Heaven forever you have the choice and the majority of people would comply it's been a pleasure having you with us thank you for joining us on youth talk I'd also like to thank of course mm and abdah thank you all for joining us that's it for this episode of Youth talk we will be back again with more topics on the program until then asalam allum
