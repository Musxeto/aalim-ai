  "transcript": "um Amir from the US says what is the best time for boo ha prayer now boo ha prayer is the prayer which is voluntary and it is prayed between after sunrise by 10 minutes till 10 minutes before the event of the horn so it's quite a long time what is the best time to pray it the Prophet had stated so Allah who are you while you salem that the best time for eight years when it's close to the whole time when it's really hot and why is that it is not explained however some scholars say that the virtues of doha prayer lie in the fact that this time is time of negligence so the morning time which is from like 7:30 or 7 o'clock a.m. till just about 12:00 a.m. this is a time where a 11:59 a.m. so it's just before noon this time is a time of negligence because people are either asleep in their homes such as many house wives who had finished taking care of the children preparing them for school cooking ironing cleaning they take the rest of the day a break so that when it's noon time they pray Lahore they prepare the food for the husband and the children and they work until the end of the night they're entitled for that or those who are at work and when you at work time flies if you're doing your job as you're supposed to so you are engaged in research working writing filing meetings and all of a sudden it's the more time so people really miss this time and this is why at just before noon this is the perfect time as the prophets allah salem said when the small camels are unable to sit on the hot rocks so this is when they stand this is the time which is best as the prophet had stated at his salat wa salam"
