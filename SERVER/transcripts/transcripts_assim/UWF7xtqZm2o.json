  "transcript": "Hasson says does one have to pray to Hagar to Masjid if he's praying outside the Masjid because of the Masjid getting filled now this usually happens in on Fridays so you have a small message it we know that in order for us to enter a message we cannot sit down until we pray 2 rakaats greeting they call it the scholars of the Masjid though this was not ever mentioned in the hadith of the Prophet I saw Sarah but this is something that the scholars came up with the name any toric as you pray with a soon will anything you pray even The Fault itself this surprises you from praying an extra two rakahs the hidden message so now the brother Hassan is saying that if I come late so the Imam did not come yet but the Masjid is full house there is no place inside and people are pray praying in the open area outside of the message and some people are praying on the seats so if I were to put my mat and I'd like to sit down can I sit down or I have to pray to hate and message it if the rows are continuously and and connected but you are actually outside the gates and the fences of the Masjid in this case you do not need to create a hate and message you can sit immediately"
