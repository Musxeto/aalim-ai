  "transcript": "okay shake elected start with a question from brother Killeen he's asking about ticket is it the cat the same for both males and females in Islam she's never him undeniable I mean sallallahu wasallam Ivana comedy hero Surya I mean nabina muhammad in why daddy he was a huge main the general trend is that women are exactly the same when it comes to forms of worship as men unless it is specified otherwise therefore women are exactly the same in ehtekaf as men the only exception is that it is more recommended for men to go for ehtekaf in messages but it is much less recommended for women because they are recommended to stay home and a lot of people think that it is not permissible for women to go for ehtekaf and Masjid and this is not true the wives of the Prophet Hera salatu salam did make a decaf in the message in his life though he did not recommend it but he did not prevent them in a sense so it is permissible for them to go but it is not recommended and it's also wrong to say that women can make ehtekaf in their house houses you know this is not true ehtekaf can only be performed in mosques"
