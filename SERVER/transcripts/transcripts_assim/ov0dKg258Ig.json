  "transcript": "Gule from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Yes, so some people when they are astonished or surprised or afraid they do not call or ask somebody to somebody who is dead what they do is that they just say, they just utter or say the name of a famous person who died or their grandfather and they say that they do this to follow their culture and they don't believe that he can help them what is the ruling on that? This is minor shirk, as long as they don't believe that they can help them and they insist on saying it and they say it's a cultural thing that whenever we're shocked or we're frightened we say, oh my grandfather oh my mom, oh my this oh my that and we say, why are you doing this? Why don't you say, oh my Allah I don't believe in it but it's just something that slips on my tongue and comes, this is minor shirk, may Allah protect us"
