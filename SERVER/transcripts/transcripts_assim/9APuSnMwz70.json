  "title": "Can we listen to Quran that has an echo? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign recitation in which an echo is heard is prohibited to listen to is this correct how strong is the echoing if the echoing is going to cause the Quran to be intermingled together and you don't know what is being said because of one word is being inserted in the other right this is not befitting of the Quran but if it's normal echoing volume [Music] this is okay there's nothing wrong in that this is the type of sound effects found in the vast majority of masjids but to put such sound effects into effect where the Quran is intermingled and you aren't able to focus when the Imam is reading because once he's reading live the fourth word you're listening to the second word being echoed so this distracts you from understanding the Quran this is totally prohibited in Haram and Allah Knows Best"
