  "title": "Investing in so-called Islamic Crowdfunding | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "nor Hidayat says I'd like to know whether we can invest in Islamic crowdfunding websites such as so-and-so they claim to their methods of investment is Sharia compliant I cannot answer this I have to look into their investments anyone who comes to say I'm Islamically Sharia compliant etc you won't believe him if I come and say I'm a neurosurgeon come let me cut you up you will not believe me you have to see the credentials their Sharia board you have to see the dealings so you cannot just simply throw your money to anyone who promises you with quick profit this is how we lost our money when people with beards and committed Muslims come to you claim to you that we have this project this investment we are the best in the field and you trust them you give them money in the hope of getting profit and then you lose the whole capital this is not the right way of doing it and I advise you not to go until you scrutinize them well"
