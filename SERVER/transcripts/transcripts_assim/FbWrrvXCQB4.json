  "title": "How to prove your love for the Prophet ‎ﷺ? (Eat with right hand & grow beards) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "You will learn that we are not implementing the sunnah in our lives. Yes. Do you love the Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? How do you prove that? You have to believe me Sheikh. No. I don't believe you. I have to see with my own eyes. So if you say I love the Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Hey. This is your left hand. So yes. It is haram to drink with your left hand. Why did Allah create two hands? This is what people say. Subhanallah. I tell you that the Prophet said Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Do not eat with your left. Do not drink with your left. Because shaitan eats and drinks with his left. And you say why did Allah create two hands? This is someone who's thinking like shaitan. Sometimes I tell people you have to grow the beard. He says why? Because the Prophet had a big beard Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. And he ordered us to grow a beard. He said okay then why do we have to remove the underarm hair? Not logical. Grow here, remove here. Say Subhanallah. Who told you to do this? Who ordered you to do this? Allah. This is Islam. It's not logic. It's you know rock? Stones? In Mecca there is a black stone. What do we do with it? We kiss it. We rub it. Because this is sunnah. But few hundred meters away also in Mina there's another stone. We stone it. Bismillah. It's the same thing. Stone, stone. Why do this? And why do this? Because the Prophet told us to do this Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. So it is not logic. It is following. And this is why in Ibadah, in Islam, in Sharia, we only follow. Alayhi Salatu Wassalam."
