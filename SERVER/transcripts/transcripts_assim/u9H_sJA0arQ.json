  "title": "When should we put up our index finger for Tashahhud & when to put it down?",
  "transcript": "so muhammad says when should i lift my index finger when sitting in tashahud and when should i put it down from starting of the yet itself should i raise or while saying the issue of raising your index finger in is a confirmed sunnah of the prophet as per the hadith of in allah be pleased with him where he said that the prophet saw whenever he sat down he used to point his index finger and move it supplicating with it this is all what was mentioned so scholars looked into the hadith and some of them said many different things according to their understanding because it's not specific it's just stating pointing it moving it supplicating with it so some of them said that okay we should only raise it when we say ash and some said and move it again upwards when you say washed and some said that you should do that without moving it as per the hadith of abdullah and some said that you should move it whenever you supplicate which means that whenever you mention the name of allah so whenever you say was ishtihad because there's nothing specific however if you look at the hadith itself it simply states that he used to point his finger from the beginning of the sitting position till the end moving it not going up and down rather moving it and moving it in its place as if it's shivering or shaking and you do this throughout the hood if you want to stand to the third rakah you go ahead and stand if you're in the last to you continue to do it before until you go for the salam this is what appears and at the end of the day even if you don't raise your fingers finger at all from the beginning till the end the prayer is valid because this is a sunna an act of sunnah if you don't do it it has no impact on the validity of your prayer and allah azzawajal knows best"
