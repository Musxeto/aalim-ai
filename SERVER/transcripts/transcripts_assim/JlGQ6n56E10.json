  "transcript": "my friend wants to accept islam but the only thing holding him back is his sins he says he smokes marijuana and does other sins and wants to accept islam when he stops what should he do this is a common trick satan plays with people who are interested interested in entering islam now we do not condone or endorse sinning this is totally prohibited and islam is is a package deal that you have to accept it all allah says oh you who believe enter in islam wholeheartedly it wholesome as a whole you have to accept it all this doesn't mean that all those who accept islam are infallible or do not make mistakes or do not make sense on the contrary we all make sense the prophet sallam told us that this is a human nature every son of adam is sinful yet the best of those sinfuls are those who often repent so we do not endorse sins nevertheless if someone were to say listen i'm willing to accept islam but i have some baggage with me that i'm trying to leave i don't know how long it would take me so what is best to wait few years until i am clean from such things or accept islam immediately and remain doing such sins until allah forgives me the answer is the latter definitely you see if you don't accept islam if you are a very kind caring generous person yet you do not embrace islam by saying the shahada the testimony i bear witness there is no god worthy of being worshipped except allah and that muhammad sallallahu alaihi sallam is his prophet messenger and servant without saying and believing in this testimony no matter how good you are you will abide in hell for eternity hell and heaven do not belong to me they belong to allah the almighty the creator of the heavens and the earth the creator of everything that exists so it is up to him who enters and who does not and he told us in the quran and his prophet told us that no soul shall enter paradise except that of a believing soul so for me accept islam immediately because you don't know when death is going to arrive and once you accept islam and you start to practice to the best of your ability you're safe no matter what sins you do you're safe in the sense that you will be held accountable for your sins don't take it as an easy ride whatever your sins you do in this life as a muslim you will be held accountable on day of judgment and this is up to allah azza to weigh your good deeds and bad deeds if your good deeds overweigh your sins you're safe and if they're equal hopefully you're safe by the mercy of allah but if your sins overweigh your good deeds you have to be cleansed purified in hellfire maybe a couple of days a couple of years couple of centuries thousands of years allanos inevitably and eventually once you're purified you're going to be taken out of hell dipped in the river of life and then admitted to jannah for eternity but if you did not accept islam none of this would happen immediately you will be thrown into hell for eternity no questions asked so i would ask and and and urge your friend to definitely accept islam on immediate effect and hope that allah helps him to quit and stop these sins but not to delay his islam"
