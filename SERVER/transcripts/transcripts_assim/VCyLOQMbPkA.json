  "transcript": "by means we know of such as medication such as rukia such as herbs and possibility that people are cured and healed without any of these things so it is allah the almighty who cures the ill and it's all by allah's pre-decree when people fall sick and others in the same house don't fall sick though they ate from the same food though they mixed with the same people but this is according to allah's preordainment according to the qadha and khadar of allah and when they are cured that's also one of allah's blessings and favors upon them and it's not the doctor and it's not the medication these are causes so many doctors prescribe medication it doesn't work so many patients consume medication it doesn't work so it is all in allah's hands subhanallah who says as ibrahim peace be upon him said in the quran and when i am ill it is he who cures me and curing and healing is not only physically but it's also mentally it's also for the illnesses of the heart allah says o mankind there has come to you instruction from your lord and healing for what is in the chests and guidance and mercy for the believers so your chest your depression your sadness your grief needs cure and the cure is in the quran the cure is seeking it from allah the almighty mentions a beautiful fact that when the heart is connected with allah the almighty the creator of the medicine and the illness itself then the heart would benefit tremendously because it's connected with the main source but when the heart is negligent and is far from allah azzawajal a person would lose interest would be fragile and weak and the medication would not help so the more you have trust in allah the more you have reliance and dependence upon allah the more knowledge that allah is your cure and allah is your healer then this would effectively cure you with the grace of allah as a widget"
