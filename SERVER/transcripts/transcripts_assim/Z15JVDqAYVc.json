  "transcript": "she my question for today A Woman made an online bank transfer payment to a company to buy a gizer she transferred the amount on Thursday and the product was to be delivered on Friday after Salah time to which she said okay but she insisted she wanted it as early as possible during daylight so the time between 2: and 4:00 p.m. was confirmed please note that the Juma time probably lasts till around 3:00 p.m. the product was delivered just during Juma time that is at or before 2 p.m. for which she left she felt guilty because when asked their Rider if he had offered his Juma he said he couldn't and when she asked if it was because of a delivery he said yes although he could have come between 3 to 4 p.m. to but he says the time wasn't communicated to him by the company Personnel now the woman feels the product may be Haram and they may be know burka was she wrong in stating delivery time 2: to 4: rather than 3 to 4: p.m. upon saying that he could have offered his prayer on his way he said something like if the product was stolen from the car it would have taken him a lifetime to be able to compensate for it no there is nothing Haram or nothing no reason to feel guilty the transaction was done a day earlier if the transaction of selling and buying was done at the time of jum that would have been uh invalid for the one who's doing it not for her as a woman she's not obliged to sell uh she's not obliged to attend the Juma so she can sell and buy and the transaction took place a day earlier the delivery doesn't count what counts is the transaction of selling and buying transferring the money the contract writing so there is no guilt on her inshallah the guilt is on the driver himself you"
