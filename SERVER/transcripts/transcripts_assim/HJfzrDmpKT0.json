مُّبِينًا بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين وأصلي وأسلم على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين سيدنا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين أما بعد dear brothers and sisters in islam one of the ways of dealing with mistakes and errors our prophet used to highlight that this is wrong sometimes we do things and we're not mindful that this is wrong and we don't see anything wrong with it a lot of the muslims do many many wrong things and the moment you point it out to them you say you see their eyes widened and they say wallahi i've never heard of this before so to show people that this is a mistake is one of the ways of the prophet to handle such mistakes errors and sins and this is cascaded in all of his dealings not even once he saw something that was wrong that was wrong and he let it slip he's the teacher he's our guide he's our mentor sallallahu alayhi wa sallam he has to show us what is right and what is wrong may Allah be pleased with him says that whenever we traveled with the prophet the muslims used to disperse in the valleys in the mountains here and there so whenever they set camp they used to disperse and go around being alone rather than being together so the prophet opened their eyes and told them that this is from shaitan and he said to them you're dispersing in these valleys and mountains is from shaitan why because when the congregation the group disperse they are weakened they're weak everybody is looking at them and see in them an opportunity to be taken and seized and look at the muslim countries little little countries without any power without any voice without any voice because they're not united and when they disperse like this the barakah is taken away and this is why the prophet told us alayhi salatu wasalam whenever you eat do not eat isolated and on your own rather join on one plate and eat from it from the sides and not from the middle because the barakah descends on the middle this also was given as an advice to the companions because they did not know what was wrong they came to the prophet alayhi salatu wasalam and said the food is not enough we eat and yet still hungry so the prophet said to them you are eating dispersed all alone like in an open buffet you take your food and you go sit somewhere alone rather eat from the same plate say bismillah eat from the same plate and avoid eating from the middle and eat from the sides they started to do this the food was more than enough because there is barakah and barakah is not a tangible thing that you can see and touch it's a blessing from allah azza wajal when allah gives you this blessing you'll feel the transformation in your life this blessing disbelievers don't believe in unfortunately some muslims even don't believe in real believers acknowledge that the blessing is from allah blessings in times blessings in places blessings in actions blessings in certain matters and things the blessing of dhikr at the end of time when people would starve there would be no rain no crops nothing to feed upon the companions asked how would the people survive the prophet answered alayhis salatu was salam by saying subhanallah alhamdulillah allahu akbar by saying dhikr and this would suffice them for the food and it would nourish them so the prophet saw alayhis salatu was salam the mistakes and errors and he told them how to how to avoid that and how to correct it and this shows us how keen the prophet sallallahu alayhi was and how careful and compassionate and kind to his companions that he wanted them to avoid such mistakes satan is doing this why how would it it benefit satan because when they disperse they're not united hence they're weak and this is when satan throws fear in their hearts oh the enemies can defeat you now because you're little you're scattered all over the place but when they're together they're strong and nothing can divide them the companion said after the prophet told them to do this sallallahu alayhi was salam whenever they set camp they were so tied together if you were to put a piece of cloth on top of them it would have covered them because none of them was going left right or center they were all in the same place now it also shows us that whenever the prophet said something alayhis salatu was salam the companions were the first to adhere and follow they would implement it on the spot and such mistakes and errors could be limited to the person doing it and it can be transgressive it can be affecting others so as an example of mistakes and errors that can harm only the one who's doing it in the authentic hadith a man once who was with the prophet alayhis salatu was salam on a windy day started cursing the wind and this happens people sometimes when it's hailing they would curse the hail or the snow or the heat or the sun or the storms and the prophet said alayhis salatu was salam alayhis salatu was salam said correcting that mistake do not curse it so now this is a mistake we have to explain it and show you that this is a mistake do not curse it for it only does as it's commanded who commanded it Allah azawajal commanded the wind to do what it's doing and if a person curses something that does not deserve to be cursed his curse will come back upon him how many times do we curse our days and nights unaware that our curse is directed towards Allah azawajal because Allah is the one who created such circumstances so as if I'm complaining of the day the circumstances and cursing it well actually I'm cursing Allah who caused this to happen how many times do we curse our cars the streets a bump on the road our bosses our neighbors and they don't deserve to be cursed it's just because we are frustrated the prophet says that the consequence of such a mistake it will deflect and come back to you and you will be cursing yourself sometimes our mistakes and errors could have a profound impact on others though we have a good intention but as we've mentioned before intentions alone are not sufficient they have to be associated with a good deed so you have to walk the talk having an intention a good intention without complying with the sharia without complying with the sharia doesn't help Allah does not accept deeds unless two conditions are fulfilled number one sincerity and good intention number two that this deed is in compliance with the sunnah and the way of the prophet alaihi salatu wasalam so how could my mistake impact others negatively Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him said once a man who was sitting with the prophet alaihi salatu wasalam complimented and praised another person and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam rebuked him and said woe to you you have slit you have cut your companion's throat you have cut your companion's throat he repeated it twice or more than that or more than that and this is to bring the attention of everyone present to the gravity of this mistake what mistake I said this guy is a righteous person he's a generous person he's a smart person I praised him and complimented him what's wrong in that so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasalam said explaining to us if any one of you insists on praising his brother let him say I think so and so is such and such and Allah knows the exact truth and I do not confirm anyone's good conduct before Allah but I think him to be such and such the prophet says alaihi salatu wasalam if he knows that this is the case why when I give praise and a compliment to an individual without putting this condition this would cause that individual to think highly of himself and this is where satan infiltrates his defense mechanism and starts to tell him that oh I must be a righteous person I must be a renowned scholar that Muslims benefit of of I must be a person of value and this is one of the biggest problems people are facing today celebrities dais scholars when you praise them or even people of authority people in the government rulers when you praise them in their face and they tend to believe that so many times we go to conferences and lectures and they introduce you oh the renowned scholar one of the most this and that and that subhanallah yes some of us enjoy it they enjoy the right some of us believe and like Sufyan ibn Uyayna said he who knows himself is not affected by praise but not all of us know ourselves so they can be negatively affected Abu Mihjan al-Aslami he says that we once were in a masjid and the prophet alaihi salatu wasalam saw a man praying bowing and prostrating so he asked who is this so we or I the narrator Mihjan al-Aslami said I started to compliment the man and praise him oh this guy oh he's a almost a monk or prophet of Allah he worships Allah so many hours and he's a good pious righteous person and the prophet said alaihi salatu wasalam rebuked me saying quiet lest he hear you and you destroy him be quiet tone it down because if he were to hear you this compliment of yours would devastate him would destroy him would make him feel worthy of what you had said and maybe shaitan would mess up with his head and this is why we must not compliment people in their faces without putting this disclaimer and I don't praise anyone in front of Allah I think and Allah knows best this doesn't mean you do not encourage people when they do something good no this is totally not the point the point is we have to refrain from praising people like this in their faces yes if they're not present and we say this to others we still put the disclaimer and we praise them but we have to put this disclaimer I remember once one of our great scholars Sheikh Abdul Aziz Ibn Bazmi Allah have mercy on his soul and also Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen so many times in the lectures you hear it the emcee saying and now we have our lecturer Sheikh Mohammed bin Saleh Al Uthaymeen who does not need any introduction meaning that he's a well-known celebrity Sheikh scholar blah blah blah on the spot the Sheikh took the microphone and said no one does not need an introduction everyone needs to be introduced and no one is exempted from this who are we so that you say we don't need any introduction we are just like everyone else stop praising people and this is not befitting let's go to the lecture directly Ibn Baz used to say the same he used to stop them whenever they start to praise and say that he's a righteous God-fearing scholar who benefited the ummah who did this he used to stop them on the spot and he would say that this is not permissible to be said unlike so many people who call for it and when the emcee starts to introduce them they would say yes yes yep nope yep I'm more than that I'm even I have so many things I could tell you but I don't want to boast about it this kills people destroys people it goes against people's humbleness and being down to earth when you start to praise them and compliment them and they ask for more because this is what Shaytan is doing to them and again this is the way of the Prophet ﷺ of highlighting what is wrong but at the same time giving the substitute so the Prophet ﷺ told them that dispersing is wrong come together gave the substitute likewise don't praise okay I'll refrain and he did not say that and stopped he gave them the alternative say I believe so and so is such and such and I don't praise anyone in front of Allah knows the best put the disclaimer and this is the method that we should all follow offering a sound alternative Abdullah bin Mas'ud may Allah be pleased with him he used to say that in prayer whenever we are praying with the Prophet ﷺ we used to say in our prayers peace be upon Allah Azza wa Jal from his servants peace be upon so and so and so and so and when the Prophet ﷺ concluded the prayer he said do not say peace be upon Allah for Allah is the peace rather you should say rather you should say and the tashahhud you all know so the Prophet ﷺ corrected the mistake Allah is the peace don't say peace be upon Allah this is not permissible so what should we say gave them the alternative another example Abu Sa'id al-Khudri may Allah be pleased with him said that Bilal once came to the Prophet ﷺ with a high quality dates a burni so the Prophet asked where did you get this good quality dates I don't recall that we had any of this so Bilal may Allah be pleased with him said I had two Sa' of bad quality dates so I replaced them with one Sa' so now this kind of transaction is clear riba it's like having 200 grams of gold and you exchange it for 150 grams of gold the weight is different the quality is different this is totally prohibited in Islam because gold versus gold silver versus silver dates versus dates wheat barley salt all of these categories six of them is considered to be riba based material so the Prophet ﷺ said this is something we say when we feel the pain and the Prophet ﷺ said do not do this because it's not right this is exactly riba sell your dates first then buy whatever dates you want so the Prophet ﷺ highlighted the mistake then he gave the alternative it's like women going to the jeweler's shop with an old bracelet and she says how much is this and the shopkeeper says x amount of money she said okay take this gold bracelet and I'll take that one and I'll give you the difference in money this is riba it's not permissible she should say to him how much would you buy my bracelet for he says y amount of money let's say a hundred dollars said okay she gives it to him cashes the money puts it in her pocket the deal is done she could leave if she wants another deal now she makes another deal the money is in her pocket no strings attached how much is that bracelet it's 120 dollars so here's a hundred and twenty dollars and she buys it this is the Islamic way of doing it so giving the alternative when correcting a mistake is one of the Prophet's sunnah and ways ﷺ and this is where we da'is and students of knowledge and scholars make the error we point out to people this is haram full stop without giving an alternative and failing to give alternatives would make people hesitate in complying and the sharia always generally speaking gives an alternative when Islam prohibits fornication no illicit relationships what can I do it gives you the alternative get married I can't I don't have money fast until you're able to get married when Islam prohibits usually interest riba it permits you to buy and sell and have a halal way of investing and increasing your wealth when Islam prohibits swine meat pigs dead meat it prohibits lions and tigers and all these wild animals it permits you to eat whatever you want from livestocks camels cows sheep goats rabbits deer anything that is halal and so forth whenever you fall into a sin it's prohibited it's a mistake it's an error Islam gives you an alternative repent ask for forgiveness express your remorse and Allah will forgive you so this is how we should roll when we speak with the public about the wrong things they're doing try to give them an alternative this is haram this is haram this is haram then what shoot ourselves well we'll try to give you a halal alternative within our capability because sometimes our hands are tight we can't find an alternative either because there's not enough time for us to give you alternatives or because we don't have alternatives we cannot think of alternatives I can't find out an answer to every question this is something that requires the collaboration of the ummah to give halal alternatives to things that are haram sometimes I don't have the capacity or the knowledge when you come up with financial transactions I can say that this is haram this is haram okay what's the alternative sheikh I don't know what do you mean you don't know you're a sheikh yes but I'm not qualified to give you an alternative this may require qualified people in that field I can point out it's haram because I have the knowledge but what alternatives and possibilities can be replacing this haram this requires the collaboration of the scholars and the ummah and generally speaking the divine methodology the way of Allah in this beautiful religion always finds a way out and an alternative with the grace of Allah we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
