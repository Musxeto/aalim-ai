  "transcript": "uh shihab from bangladesh my question is all these are innovation okay inshallah she had from bangladesh he's asking about shabi bharat and shall be something else which is celebrating the 27th of rajab considering it to be the night of the miraculous journey israel and celebrating the fifteenth of shaaban considering it and they do salat all of this is not part of islam neither the prophet had ever done anything in nor his companions nor the taberean nor the tablet trust me when i say this if you do what these three generations did companions to have in integrity and not add anything to that well he you will go to paradise with them trust me but if you innovate if you invent things that were not done by them then on the day of judgment the angels would prevent you from approaching the pool of the prophet alaihis al-assam and you will not be allowed to drink from it and when the prophet sallam calls allah my um he will be replied to by saying you don't know what they've innovated after your death and the prophet would say destruction may be upon those who innovated after me if you want this dharwa then be my guest"
