  "title": "Is fear of Jinn a form of shirk? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "dia says his three questions are all related to confusing whether the fear of jinn is something that constitutes shirk or not this is a very vague issue because it depends entirely on how you feel if i'm sitting on in a room and i have this fear of jinn that either pushes me to call them to seek refuge in them to offer sacrifice for them to avoid things that may alarm them as many people say tomorrow i have a an interview knock on wood hey why are you knocking wood so that the gin would not hear the jinn would not disturb this good thing that's happening to me this is shirk normal fear that is a human nature is not shirk so if i see a jinn in front of me standing in front of me would i be scared or not hell yes if i see a lion standing in front of me will i be scared of course would that be no this is natural fear so natural fear is when you see a snake when there's fire when you feel drowning like me if you fear heights and you look down as whoa my knees are not working anymore some people are like am i committing ship no but the real shirk is when you are in your room and you fear an individual and you fear someone who has no power over you yet you're still afraid and you do things in their absence when they're not watching just to avoid what may happen if they were to be there and this is shirk so most likely all of what you have mentioned and the confusion some people say i'm afraid that the corona virus that covered 19 i thought that it was from the jinn or i thought that cancer was from jinn so what is it this shirt no it's not sure it can be a cause we know that the plague as the prophet told us is the pinching of our brethrens from the jinn so it's caused by the jinn we know that and there is a big possibility that the jinn can also cause cancer maybe maybe not but it is not sure to believe that because this is part of allah's decree there are means for things so we believe that this can be one of the means if we don't have evidence that to back it up the thought of it would not take you after the fall of islam so all of these questions are related amen"
