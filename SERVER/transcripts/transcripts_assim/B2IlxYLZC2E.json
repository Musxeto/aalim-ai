  "transcript": "awesome says how to reply to the idol worshipers if they ask us about Blackstone being kissed by Muslims Idol worshipers worship their idols Muslims do not worship neither the black stone nor the Kaaba so you have to first open their eyes to what they're doing when they're worshiping a cow or a statue or a tree or a rock what do they think of such things they think that they benefit and bring harm by themselves that's why they worship these things and they have great honor and glorification and praising to them they have this fear and hope in these things this is worship while the Muslims do not have these feelings to the Kaaba and to the black stone you've seen so many Muslims climb up the Kaaba and stand on its roof there's no problem in that we know the statement of Omar may Allah be pleased with him when he used to go around the Kaaba in tawaf and come to the black stone and kiss it and he says to it while addressing those with him I know that you are a stone that brings no benefit and protects from no harm had I not seen the prophet salallahu sallam kiss you I would have not had kissed you or touched you so he is showing and teaching the people that this is a stone we don't worship it we don't have any form of thinking that it brings benefit or protect us from harm and I hope this answers your question"
