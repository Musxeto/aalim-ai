  "title": "Can I mix how many times I wash in wudu? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mona says is it a must to be uniform while doing ablution for example three times or once or you can mix once with two times etc it was reported in an authentic hadith that the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam used to perform Moodle once twice or three times so the minimum times of washing is once and the max is three so I can wash my face once I can wash my face twice or three times all of this is Sunnah so there's no problem in whatever you do but a lot of the people ask okay if we for example focus on washing our limbs three times which is the max so if I wash my face three times but I wash my arms once is that permissible or I have to be three throughout all my washing limbs the answer is no you can mix because this is this was also mentioned about the Prophet Alice awesome so if you wash your face twice and you do that once for your arms or three times and you wash your feet once this is permissible there's no problem in that you sha Allah"
