  "title": "Time between prayers is short, he canâ€™t  pray on time due to work, can he combine prayers?",
  "transcript": "Ryan from Belgium my question is so in Europe um the prayer times are only a couple of hours apart and it's only November so let alone December and January and the part of February it's two hours between and so on so I'm asking for a student and the student he wants to earn some extra money and he wants to go to work and he knows that since he lives in the cafe Country 99 sure or 90 sure he's never going to find a job that's going to say okay go on you know when it's time for us so we can pray we can set your break so you can pray because you know it's a cafe country so is this student if he does his best to ask for a break so he can pray on time is he allowed to if he knows he is not able to pray on time is he allowed to still go for a job but combine prayers or is he not allowed to work until uh the prayer times are more spread out so until March and after anyway Allah give you the best in us all unfortunately you gave me two options while there is a third you said either he works and combines prayers or he doesn't work and waits until the prayer times are a little bit more flexible but the first option is not a necessity and there's no hardship in it and between Maghrib and Asia when he was not traveling nor there was rain so the companions asked why then did he do so and even Abbas said so that he would not have any burden or hardship on his ummah Scholars explained this because we cannot understand it for ourselves we have to go and check with the scholars they said he did it only once secondly if there is real true hardship and not something that is done occasionally and frequently so in November maybe December maybe a little bit earlier you find yourself that I have very little time let me combine and this is every single day no this is not a form of hardship and there is a third option to what you had mentioned this third option is that you unlike what most people think you live in a Catholic country some people say we have to go and pray in the Masjid that will take half an hour of your working uh schedule and if two prayers is a full hour even if that person was a Muslim he would the shopkeeper or the owner of the of the business he would not allow this to happen so you can have a win-win by praying on time in the office or in the shop at work and that would take maybe five minutes six minutes at most and you don't have to ask for permission as when you go to the toilet you don't ask for permission most offices allow you to go and prepare some coffee or tea you don't ask for permission so discreetly go and just pray and come back in an isolated area that would not take a lot of time if they were to speak tell them I'm willing to add another 20 minutes after the end of the day so that I would compensate for whatever time that was lost and Allah Knows Best foreign"
