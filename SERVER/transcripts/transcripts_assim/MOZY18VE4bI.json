  "transcript": "Brother Fahim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. A Muslim man passed away leaving behind his wife and a two-month-old daughter. His unmarried younger brother married the widow to take care for the child. However, a year later the brother engaged in an extramarital affair, so he sent back to her parents and they didn't show much interest to solve this. But the wife never wanted divorce, but he ended up divorcing his wife without paying Mahir till now. He said that if she needs the Mahir, then she has to apply through the court. A week after the divorce, he married the woman with whom he had the affair. So the question is Sheikh, since except his elder sister, all of his siblings accepted that, as a form of protest, his elder sister refused to acknowledge the marriage and cut off kinship with her new sister-in-law forever. Are the elder sister's actions justified and whether the marriage is valid? JazakAllah. This is none of anyone's business. This is none of anyone's business. The man divorced his wife who happened to be his widow, the widow of his brother, and then he divorced her. What reasons? It's not to us to judge. We don't know what happens behind closed doors. He divorced her. He didn't pay her the Mahir. He is sinful, committing a major sin, and Allah Azza wa Jal would punish him in his grave and on the day of judgment. All what he has to do is wait, and then he will find what he had committed in his grave. And of course, he will find that much earlier when Allah takes away the blessing from his business, maybe grant him some illnesses that are incurable because of his dhulm. Do you think that Allah created you on earth to transgress and wrong people without being held accountable? Freebies? No, wait, it will come. Now, as him marrying this woman, the second woman, no one has the right to accuse them of having a relationship unless they bring four male Muslim witnesses testifying by Allah that they had seen the male organ in the female organ. Audhu Billah. How would anybody do this, Sheikh? Well, this is what's mentioned in the Quran and in the authentic Sunnah. Failing to provide such four male witnesses means that you're slandering this Muslim, which is punishable in Islam by flogging 80 lashes for whoever dare and say such a statement. Reputation of a Muslim is protected. You can't go around and say, oh, he committed zina, he had a relationship, he had an affair. Because this is slandering. Now, what the sister does with her brother, whether not acknowledging his wife or not, this is up to her. This has no ruling in Islam in saying that, oh, you did this or you did that. This is normal behaviour that people are held accountable for. You don't want to see your friends anymore. Up to you. You don't want to communicate with your sister-in-law. Up to you. There's nothing wrong in that. As a Muslim, if you see them face to face, you have to exchange salam. This is the minimal requirement. As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah. That's it. If you don't see them for 10 years, you don't have to pick up the phone and give them a call. They're not your kinship. Total strangers. So I hope this answers your question."
