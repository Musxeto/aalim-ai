  "transcript": "our first question for tonight is for from nudge bun and the question says is there any recommendation to recite the Quran at the time of a person dying can reciting help the dying person is it true that at the time of death Shaitaan attacks with its level best if so can reciting Quran keep Shaitaan away from the dining person and ease him to be steadfast in Eman now this question is an issue of dispute and it has a number of branches so at the very end of the question is it true that Shaitaan attacks the hardest when a person is about to die there were stories narrated on such a topic among the most famous is the one that Imam I met even humble may Allah have mercy on his soul while on his dying bed he used to faint and his son Abdullah was next to him and then wakes up and shouts no no not yet not yet and faints again so he did this a couple of times and then his son when he woke up and was conscience asked him Oh father what is it that is making you say not yet not yet so he said my son did you hear that I saw Satan biting his hand and saying in regret oh I met now I cannot lose you I cannot deceive you I cannot trick you because you're about to die and I'm telling him not yet no I'm not dead yet I'm not saved yet once I die you have no control over but now I'm still alive and I have to be aware of what you might be doing or attempting to do so yes this is true that Satan attacks a person the hardest when he's about to die because this is the last chance and we know that the prophet alayhi salaatu said in namilama we'll have a team verily deeds are by their conclusion in the sense that you whatever you die upon you will be resurrected upon so if you die drinking wine you will be resurrected drunkard if you die in the form of a Haram and you are in hatch saying labbayk allahumma labbayk you will be resurrected on this as well coming back to the first question is it recommended to recite the Quran while a person is dying this is an issue of dispute among scholars the enough the Schaffer is and the Maliki's let me rephrase that the Hanafi the Shaffer and the humbly school of thought recommend reciting Surat Yasin and the Maliki school of thought say that this is not permissible so who do we choose is it the majority the majority rules or is it according to the Quran and the Sunna definitely it's according to the Quran and the authentication the three schools of thought that said that reciting surah yaseen is recommended they based their allegation and verdict upon weak hadith in the virtues of Surat Yasin and none of these hadith is authentic and hence the way we deal with difference of opinion among scholars is that we follow whatever follows the Quran and the authentication and the opinion of Imam Malik is the strongest because he has the justification for not reciting the Quran first the hadith SAR all week secondly it was never done by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and his companions and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
