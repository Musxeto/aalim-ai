  "title": "Imam Raises Hands for Qunoot in Last Rakat of Witr, is this according to the Sunnah?",
  "transcript": "Duwaib from Kashmir In our Majid we pray with the three rakat. In the third rakat after Imam says surah Ikhlas according to the Sunnah, he raises his hands for dua and does congregational dua. Is this the proper way of praying with in congregational prayers? The jurors have stated that it is legitimate and part of the Sunnah to make dua of qunoot in witr before ruku and after ruku and the hadith are authentic so we don't have a say in it. What the Imam is doing is part of the Sunnah and a lot of the companions used to do this before ruku so there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah. If you cannot, you are entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they are poor, I will give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
