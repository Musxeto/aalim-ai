  "transcript": "oh [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] [Laughter] alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in number 114 is in the chapter that deals with tum and we have 304 hadiths inshallah to conclude this chapter and uh um most of them are not authentic yet we have to go through them and tell you which one is not authentic and if there are any issues uh connected or related to this hadithi 114 brother naras regarding the explanation of the words of Allah and if you are ill or on a journey handfuls of water on your head okay this Hadith is not authentic now IB Abbas as you all know is the cousin of the proph alham and he was one of the great Scholars of Islam the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam prayed to Allah to make him one of the scholars of Islam and he became indeed one of them he is telling us the reason of the verse of this verse why was it revealed but because it is not authentic so we should not go uh uh through it and explain it it's enough for us to know that not only when a person is injured or fearing death that he's allowed to perform AB uh dry Abu tum no even if he's not fearing death if he has uh uh something that prevents him from using water such a such as in the case of a person uh uh with Burns or with injuries and he cannot wash them then it's okay for him to perform uh the following Hadith 150 please narrated by Ali May will be pleased with him one of the bones in my forarm was broken so I asked Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam concerning purification in this condition and he ordered me to wipe off the bandages now this Hadith is regarded by Scholars as which is not even weak this is completely out of the question it's regarded as unauthentic at all now Al Talib is the cousin of the prophet and his son-in-law and he asked him about the time that he had a broken arm and what to do the prophet as in this Hadith he told him to wipe over the bandages the Hadith is Battle it's not correct so does that mean the verdict itself is incorrect no the verdict itself is correct Scholars say that in the case of a bandage or a cast that you put on your broken arm or foot you may wipe over it other Scholars say no you have to perform tum why they say because this area cannot be washed so whenever there is we cannot wash a particular part of the body then we have to go or refer to tum but this Hadith Falls in line with other hadiths and it's authentic that is when a person has a bandage or is wearing a cast and he cannot wash what's under it he may perform a bution noral bution when it comes to the cast or to the bandages or uh uh to whatever covering the body he may rub or wipe over it and this suffice and it does the job now Scholars when talking about the subject said that it's resembling wiping on the H wiping on the socks and shoes and actually there is no resemblance in the sense that there are many differences for example uh brother Zaki how many days can a traveler wipe over the shoes in who get travel or when he's traveling in three days three days and three nights and a resident could only wipe for one day and one night in the case of a cast you may wipe over it for a as long as it's there a month or two so there is a difference right okay now can I wipe on my shoes or socks if I wore them while not on the state of ation Tara I have to perform ation and then wear my socks or shoes on the state of Purity so that I can wipe over them whenever I need to in the case of cast I don't have to be on an state of evolution of Tara because it's not up to you when to break your arm or break your leg it's an emergency it took place it happened and they put the cast and fixed my arm or leg but I can't tell them wait before you put the cast I want to perform ablution cuz this is a necessity it's a different story alt together in the H socks or shoes it has to cover the whole foot in the case of cast it can cover half of the arm which means that I have to wash the uncovered part and wipe over the covered part in SHO and shoes or socks I cannot do this because I cannot wipe on the slippers it has to cover the whole uh uh uh foot and so on so the scholars say the Hadith though it's not authentic but the verdict is correct because there are other hadiths that back it up and this is what all Muslims used to do you have a problem you have a bandage you have blasters you have a a cast on your arm or your your foot you have to do this instead of referring to tum the following Hadith Hadith number 116 brother Mustafa narrated concerning the man who had sustained a wound in his head and took a bath and died Allah's messenger sallu alai said it would have been sufficient for him to perform tum then bind a bandage over the wound and wipe over it with wet hands and then wash the rest of his body okay this Hadith is uh uh Scholars have different opinions regarding it some say it's unaccepted unauthentic some say it's Hassan and what appears to me and Allah knows best that the Hadith is not authentic because it tells us to do three things which is tum Evolution and wiping over the cast and this cannot happen it's either this tum or Evolution and wiping but you can't join both as the Sunnah did not bring us any other examples similar to this so what what appears is that you either can perform a bution or you cannot so if you cannot then it's enough for you to per perform tum let's assume that a person has his whole arm God forbid uh covered with Burns severe burns you cannot put bandages you cannot put cast on it and at the same time you cannot put any water to it so what to do according to this Hadith you should perform tum and then you should wash the other limbs of woodo that you can and if there are bandages on it then you should wipe on the bandages but this is not the case because if there were bandages then that would have been enough for me to wipe no Forum therefore it's either tum or Evolution and in this case because you cannot perform complete Evolution then tum would be uh uh sufficient and would be enough for a person to do this and inshallah this is the most authentic verdict of the scholars regarding not joining tum and evolution at the same time it's either this or that uh the following Hadith Hadith 117 narrated by Abbas may Allah be pleased with them it is the Sunnah that a person should not pray more than one prayer with one tum then he should perform tum for the next prayer okay this Hadith is regarded as it's weak now but is the meaning correct is is the meaning correct do you think the meaning is correct why is that because they can perform more than one prayer at the same time okay he can perform more than one prayer at the same time as long as he keep we and we mentioned this uh uh a while ago and we said that it is completely substituting for w if you don't have water then tum exactly takes the the place of tum in all means so once the minute you perform tum then you are in the state of Pur that allows you to pray as long as you did not nullify this state you may pray one two or more prayers with the same previous first tum you have done the Hadith itself is not authentic so you don't have we don't have to waste our time uh studying it now we move on to a chapter that is one of the most difficult chapters of f to some Scholars which is the chapter of menstruation and why is it so difficult simply because it is not a man not a man's job yeah it you know there are things that okay I can figure out things like this or that but when it comes to menstruation I could base my thinking on the hadiths that I have before me but then there are things that I can not realize therefore usually generally speaking women are the best to advise each other in this matter you know we get sisters calling in and saying that I have this and I have that and I did this and I did that and it's not embarrassing because this is religion you have to ask about religion but at some point one has to refer to his his wife or to his sister to ask them what do you think because it's a handful of hadiths and Scholars have so many different verdicts regarding this subject so many it's beyond you know sometimes it becomes beyond recognition it's confusing sheh may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the greatest Scholars of of our recent modern time said that it's very easy always go back to the basics don't confuse yourself don't put and indulge yourself and the differences of Scholars just put the hadiths look at them try to understand them and try to stem all the verdicts needed from them without going into details that like they say the devil is in the details you put yourself with the details you you confuse yourself and confuse all the others with you put the five or six hadiths covering this issue look into them studying them and then try to come with a verdict that fits all we have a short break stay tuned and we will be right back inshallah her TV is launching a

and welcome back just before the break we talked about the new chapter and it's a horror chapter you know you should be really careful when uh walking this mine field but uh inshallah it's it's not that difficult once we read the Hadith we try to get all the knowledge from the Hadith and restrict and limit ourselves and thinking the Hadith we have inshallah no problem the chapter of menstruation menstruation in Arabic means must and originally which means that the valley is flooded with water it's running water so from this Scholars say that has to come in flow it's not a drop or two it has to come in flow it has to come in large amounts this is and this helps us a lot when some of the sisters call and say I had a dropper two so should I refrain from praying and fasting the answer would be no and this is the fatwa of may Allah have mercy on him he says no because mination means to come with a flow and if it doesn't if it comes a drop or two then this is not considered as now why do Scholars mention the chapter that deals with with menstruation after Purity simply because it is considered to be one of the things that nullify W and for you as we said that all that we've studied is connected to the second pillar of Islam which is Salat so the types of water the containers of water and if it makes it Pure or impure and the uh the types of water as regarding n the how to perform ation how to perform obligatory bath what to do in the absence of water tum and uh what to do when answer the call of nature uh how to clean oneself the manners of it all of this is connected to prayer and of course menstruation is also connected to prayer but it's not connected only to prayer there are so many issues regarding menstruation can we try and think of few just brainstorm one uh a man cannot have intercourse with his wife when she's so this is marital relationship there's no intercourse while a woman is having uh her monthly period what else no fasting fasting no fasting so they don't pray and they don't fast while having the monthly period reading a holy book raise your hand so that we would know exactly who to check RI uh forbid to touch and read Holy Quran she is forbidden to touch and read the Holy Quran but we've mentioned this uh three four programs ago and we said that this is uh an issue of dispute among Scholars IM albani says it's okay for her to touch it as the evidence is not that strong the it is not that strong in implying that which did he did he mean so it's an issue of uh uh difference among Scholars [Music] Zaki to okay think of another one while we go toik and this is not correct a woman on her menstruation can perform pilgrimage as in thei of may Allah be pleased with her he told her that the the woman in her menstruation can do everything that a pilgrimage a pilgrim does except for ta so that's the only thing that she should refrain from ta but she goes to Mina she goes to she goes to mifa she spends the night there she goes and cast throws the stone on the 10th day ofid and she Slaughters if she has sheep she uh cuts her makes the but she does not perform ta she doesn't enter the Masid is true because is compr made of and and they have to be done inside the mosque with the difference among Scholars regarding s is it inside or outside but she cannot perform uh om in this sense um anything else or should I I I give you what I have yes so as you said that uh it's forbidden for her to go inside MOS M yes that's true it's forbidden for her to enter a mosque okay there are few things that I've listed here that uh uh where menstruation comes handy in the sense of Islamic law so we've mentioned that she is forbidden to pray she's forbidden to fast she's forbidden to make ta around the Caba she is uh uh of course there's an exception in the case of uh uh if she is traveling if she comes from Europe for example and today is her last day in Mecca and she has to perform form the pillar of Haj which is yet she has her monthly period so what what can she what can she do if she goes back home then she did not complete the Hajj and the H is Hajj is void and if she stays she cannot stay because she she is related and uh uh she's going with a convoy and they have to leave the country and at a certain particular time this is a different case Scholars say that this is an exception she she made perform ta while she has her menstruation and leaves one of the issues related to uh a woman with on with menstruation is that does not become obligatory on her so if a woman performs everything from for Haj and the only left thing that is left for her to make the farewell ta she is Exempted and she is allowed to leave without any compensation on her side she may not stay in the mosque she may not have intercourse with her husband she may not be divorced so it is forbidden for a man to to divorce his wife when she has a menstruation she has to finish her menstruation take a bath make Gul and then once she once she is ready before any intercourse he may divorce her if he wishes and this is a deterrent now Islam tells you if you want to divorce your wife you have to wait until she gets the monthly period is she's purified then divorce her now this is not the case you know when I want to divorce my wife I hope she's not watching when I whenever I want to divorce my wife I want to divorce her because she's nagging she's been nagging at my head she's doing this you should do that do that do this I'm angry with her she's saying you're not a man and that triples my anger she said you you're not doing this you're not doing that then I Shan comes to me and I say you are you are divorced divorce takes place Islam tells you wait wait wait wait cut this is unacceptable why she's aggravating me she's she's on my temper she no no no no this Allah does not approve of this okay what do you want me to do I want I just want her to shut up said well you're in the wrong place you're a man Allah gave you the right to divorce you should be responsible so what should I do shut up and wait until she is pure for her from her menstruation she she doesn't have the period her period is about two weeks from now so you have to wait so you wait two weeks she gets gets her period for a whole week she's purified from her period She takes a bath she's ready for you now divorce her divorce her after 3 weeks you're crazy who wants to divorce her and you wanted to do that three weeks ago that was three weeks ago we we we we were not on uh equal terms we didn't we wasn't okay now everything is fine and this is one of the great aspects of Islam it teaches you how to control yourself it tells you that shitan comes and asks you to divorce her now Allah tells you do not do that wait and if you wait half an hour she comes running to you you come running to her you kiss and makeup that's it but if you were to respond to your your anger you would have divorced her and then you would have had lots of divorcees worldwide but alhamdulillah Islam tells you no she has to have her menstruation first then she has to bathe and get herself ped and and clean and she's ready whether for you to have intercourse or whether you have uh uh uh to divorce her choice is yours so again also you may not divorce a menstruation woman the menstruation is good for us to know the the period after the divorce okay divorce took place I can remarry her again she's still my wife and until she has three menstruations if she has three menstruations then she's a stranger to me she may marry again I cannot marry her again unless I propose to her as if it's the first time for us she becomes a total stranger menstruation gives us the verdict that there's no baby inside because a pregnant pregnant woman usually does not menstruate and uh uh uh there are are so many things regarding menstruation among them is that menstruation usually and generally speaking it's about six to seven days average woman this is normal thing six to seven days 99% of women have it this uh uh long and it comes once every month that's why they call it the monthly period but what month are we talking about the lunar month or the Gregorian month we're definitely talking about the lunar month in Islam everything is connected to the lunar month such as fasting of Ramadan such as the months of pilgrimage even the the the the the month itself if someone says there's a another there's an oath that I would fast a month should we ask him to to fast 31 days or 29 days or 30 days no the month is either 29 or 30 days and this is the lunar month and all the things that are connected with Islam depend entirely on lunar months and this is one of also the beauty of Islam if you're stranded in a a desert can you tell which month of the year you're in no impossible you cannot if you look at at Sun you look at the Moon is it June or July I don't know but okay if I'm I'm in the middle of the month or in the beginning of the month or the end of the month I don't know in Islam lunar months you can you're able to know the beginning of every month by just looking at the moon you see the Cresent the Cent disappears it's the end of the month the Cresent is born again it's a new month you can know when it's 13 14 15th the middle of the month and so on I am afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time [Laughter] oh [Applause] [Music] uh"
