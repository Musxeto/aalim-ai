death will someday snatch away our life here on Earth but glad tidings are for the Believers Allah has promised a life filled with ultimate joy and a never-ending Paradise in the afterlife Allah says in the Quran [Music] alul their call therein will be exalted are you oh Allah and the greeting therein will be peace and the last of their call will be praise to Allah lord of the worlds our speaker

radio and television programs on Saudi radio channel Saudi channel to Huda television channel and peace TV besides this he holds the position of human resources and public relations director at one of the leading companies in Saudi Arabia brothers and sisters please welcome she Dr aimim for his presentation on the topic Paradise the final Abode of peace ald usually in strategic planning experts say that you have to first first of all set your objectives because if you fail to set your objectives you will fail in planning each and every Muslim has an objective his soul objective is to avoid Hellfire and to be admitted to jenah may Allah make me and you among those who enter jenah now J has been described in the Quran in two places inah Inus Allah described it Asam the Home of Peace as they translate it but why was it called as such some say that it Isam because Assam is one of Allah's beautiful names and it doesn't mean peace when we attribute this to Allah it means that Allah is Exempted from any faults or defects or shortcomings Allah is the most perfect so he is Salam but this is a weak opinion because it would then be permitted for us to call jenman [Music] or any of Allah's beautiful names and this is not the case other Scholars say that it is called because the Angels constantly all the time come in and greet the Believers who are admitted to by saying so they always hear this greeting ofum and this is also not that authentic because in this dun in this life we also exchange Salam the Believers when they meet one another they sayam and in reply they would hear so it would not be something only specifically made for Jenna the third and most authentic opinion is that it is compared to this D because Paradise has no shortcomings has no defects has no harm in it it is the final home and it is the Perfection that Allah has created it is Allah's Mercy as was described in the Hadith when Allah the almighty said you Jen you are my Mercy this Jenna is the land of peace that each one of us long to be admitted to and to live this is a transitional period that we live in in Jenna it is the land of Peace Allah described Paradise to have eight Gates and the prophet told us that the distance between the two doors of the gate is a distance that a traveler would need of 40 Years Journey the prophet said Alam one day it would be filled one of the gates no the whole eight Gates so many people will be admitted to Paradise with the grace of Allah Asel and all the gates of jenah will not be closed they will be always open so you do not need a permission to exit and re-entry you don't need a visa by the way all what you have to be is a Muslim so you can come and go as you wish the Angels come and go every time with the gifts from Allah you can go anywhere you wish and you don't need to lock the doors on yourself because no one will break in no one is going to come in and take something it's a place of security if you enter Jenna you will be shocked to see these great mansions and palaces they're so perfect made of bricks one would say what are these bricks a brick of gold and a brick of silver and in between the C that binds them is musk you have Mansions you have palaces you have Chambers over chambers that extend as far as the eye can see there are tents there are Furnitures there are drugs and carpets and pillows and cushions and sofas and things that we cannot imagine made of silk the prophet wasam was given once silk hand and we know that men are not allowed to use or to wear things made of silk and the companions touched it and they said mashallah it is so soft and the prophet Alat wasam told them that by Allah the handkerchiefs that s one of the great companions who died on the fifth year of Hijra his handkerchiefs that he cleans himself with are much softer than this so how would you imagine imagine your clothes to be how would you imagine your furniture to be these homes you have it's not a single home you have homes to go to the Archangel jiel peace be upon Him came and gave the Glad Tiding to Khadijah the mother of the Believers and he said oh prophet of Allah greet her with the greeting of Islam and tell her that Allah is giving her the Glad Tiding of a house in Paradise made of a pearl imagine living in a pearl how would that be and you do not need a GPS in Jenna it is installed by the manufacturer so you know exactly where and how to reach your home the prophet says Al by Allah each and every one of you knows his home in jenah more than he knows his home in this Dill every time Shan comes to me and I have a big Shan he's knowledgeable he did a lot of years in in college and he did mallah may Allah take him away every time I think of Jenna I'm lost Ya Allah if I enter Jenna how would I reach home what to do do I get a guiding book telling me this is a protocol you have to do don't worry about this if you set foot in jenah Allah would guide you Allah would Grant you everything that you've ever wished for Allah would reward you because of your patience in Jenna there are rivers and believe me coming from Arabia this is something we long for we long for distilled water to drink let alone having rivers coming and flowing and gushing and springs and Subhan Allah the main major Four Rivers a river of water so pure and beautiful a river of milk unchanged a river of wine that is so tasty and nice it's not bitter it's not bad and a a river of honey that is pure and from these four rivers all the different rivers of Jenna come out of now imagine yourself sitting in Jenna in your Palace you don't have any appointments you don't have any obligations you don't have to take the kids to school or to the hospital the wife is not nagging on the contrary the wife is singing wow she didn't sound like this man she has changed she sings beautiful songs with music she or with D no with music this which was Haram here it will become Halal for you and you hear the waterfalls from these Rivers so relaxing so refreshing not only that you hear the sounds of the Angels greeting you and above all of that Allah asael addresses you and speaks to you what Mor there be as for the things they're adorned with the jewelry is it a Rolex SWAT what are you talking about the jewelry that Believers wear are so bright and beautiful and glamorous that the sun if there were to be a son but there would not be a sun in Jenna if there were to be a sun the brightness of the jewelry would take the light away from it the beauty of the people in jenah is astonishing it blows your mind when you listen to what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has to say he tells us that every Friday the men leave to somewhere they call a so they go to a place a big mall to together there is no Friday prayer there are no days and nights in Jenna but they long for the things that they used to enjoy in D Allah gives it to them perfect in Jenna so they go there and they meet and they chat they don't have anything to buy but they just go to meet one another and remember the old days and how Allah has rewarded them they remember their patience and all of a sudden Allah sends the northern wind that blows on them and on their families so it increases in their beauty and the men they become more handsome so they go back and Retreat to their homes and the minute they see their wives they say Subhan Allah you're more beautiful than we had left you and the women say by Allah you're more handsome than when you have had left and this goes on every Friday till a thousand years a million years a gazillion years no this goes to Eternity There Is No Stopping Us Now as they say it is forever and if you look at what they eat I cannot describe it because it goes beyond your imagination Allah tells us that that the fruit has different types and sizes and variations and when you look at a tree that has fruit and you desire it it comes right to you I don't think Microsoft has reached that level of innovation to do this to you but in Jenna it is perfect it comes right to you and you eat one bite and it's different than the 10th bite and it's different than the 1,000 bite every single bite is different but it is more delicious than the previous one and it never ends there is meat in Jenna but what kind of animals would we get this meat from we know for example that the prophet told usat wasam that we inshallah if Allah admits us to Jen we will eat from the liver of the whale we will eat from the Sheep because the Sheep are among the animals of Jenna we will eat from strange type of birds that are so huge they have necks as big as the camels but their meat is more tender than anything that you have ever thought of all of this would come to you without a price you don't have to ask after having the meal should I do the dishes nothing of that sort there are animals as the prophet had told usat wasam a man asked oh prophet of Allah are there horses see horses to the Arabs is like a sports car to us the Arabs I have a Suburban or a yoken a big family car but I always want to have a small Ferrari or a small Porsche in Paradise this companion is asking okay can I have this sports car are there horses what was the answer the prophet saysat you will have a horse made of a red ruby now what kind of a horse is this and this horse it takes you wherever you want to go in Jenna wow look at the form of transportation and it's fun it's just to think of it it blows your mind away what about sleeping patterns Sheikh I often stay awake until F I pray F and go to bed how would our sleeping pattern be in Jenna first of all there will not be day nor night in Jenna but there will shine light from underneath the Throne of Allah Asel to signify the beginning of the day and the end of the day but it's all light and there won't be any sleep in Jenna and one would say um come on yeah I wake up for f every single day at least I could sleep like a week or two no there's no sleep because if you sleep you will not enjoy what's in Jenna and the prophet told usam that sleeping is the Brethren of death and there is no dying in jenah on the Hereafter there's no death neither in general or in hell but they are being punished while we inshallah will have the time of our lives it's Eternal happiness you will have the immortality that has no end to it okay now if we enter Jenna what will happen how would we look our Prophet told usat wasam that we will be on the same same form that Allah has created Adam and by the way Adam was 60 Cubit high so you do the math and creation has been decreasing since as the prophet told usat so on the day of judgment when Allah admits me and you to Jenna we will be really big and we will be 33 years of age and and we would never get older not a single day in jenah youth is forever the clothes never worn out we never get sick we never get depressed we never get hungry we never get thirsty we never get tired the men of Jenna would be m m meaning that they have no beards so what I've been saving it will all go away inshallah in Jen and then I'll be rewarded for that every single Tom they can Harry your beard is long your beard is this can't you shape it can't you put some Gill on it can't you like put a hair dryer or something do something you know braid it zzy top anything I'm doing it for Allah I'm following the Sunnah of the prophet in J I'll be rewarded inshallah as long as you will and they will have no hair on their body so no need to do waxing and body care py care Min care whatever care you have it's all alhamdulillah legit it's all from Allah the almighty and the funny thing is you will not find any old people in Jen alhamdulillah they're all young a woman came to the prophet she was like 70 80 years of age and she said oh prophet of Allah without any teeth ask Allah he admits me to Jenna says no an old woman cannot enter Jenna and the women fled weeping and crying and the prophet said come come come come Allah would not admit you to Jenna like this he would turn you back to being 33 years of age the age of Youth Eternal youth people in Jenna different status in levels and the more higher you get closer to the throne of Allah the more light the more favors and blessings of Allah you get people are giving the blessing of praising Allah glorifying Allah as if they breathe they don't do it because they're obliged to do it they don't do it because if they don't they'll be thrown into hell no they do it because it is like breathing to them in Paradise there are no impurities the people they eat like crazy huh they feast and they party all day long they do everything they want to do a je came to the prophet said you claim that the people in Jenna they eat and drink say yes he said okay those who drink and eat must go to the toilet said no there is no toilets in what will we do ah Allah makes everything that you eat and drink to come out as sweat oh this means I have to shower she I shower only once every couple of weeks in here so now you want me to shower even in Jenna no don't worry your sweat would be the smell of musk so the more you sweat the more beautiful people can find this fragance so make a long story short in order for you to reach the peace in Jenna you have to first reach the peace in D so it's nice it's glamorous but you have to do that hereb t says in D there is a j who does not enter it will not enter the Jah of you have to acknowledge you have to submit you have to believe in Allah because the prophet Alat wasam told us that no one who's not Muslim would enter Jenna if you're not Muslim you'll not enter Jenna the people at the time of Noah were Muslims they believed him they'll enter Jenna that people at the time of Ibrahim the people at the time of Moses of Jesus at his time they were Muslims they submitted their will to Allah after the message of the Prophet wasam if you listen and hear carefully about Islam and you know Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam our prophet and you don't believe you'll be deprived from entering Jenna this life is beautiful it's like a beautiful rose you smell it you touch it but it soon Withers away and dies what is with Allah Never Dies so are you selling it for cheap are you wasting your time in J There is No Malice there is no hatred or grudges it's all all love and peace and if you are unable to attain this in this life you will not attain it on the day of jenah the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said all of my umah will enter Jenna may Allah make me and you among them all of my um will enter Jenna except those who refuse and the companion said oh prophet of Allah who would refuse he said who obeys me enters Jenna and who who ever disobeys me has refused this means that how would someone who terrorizes people who blows up innocent people children women elderly in this life claim to want to attain the peace in Jenna this is unacceptable no peace in dya there's no peace in Hereafter how is it that those who deal in Usery in riba in interest banks financial institutions Etc they want peace what peace are you looking for Allah has waged war against those who deal in riba Allah says in the Quran and if you do not do it this is refraining from riba then take a notice of war from Allah and his messenger those who are fighting Allah do you think that they'll have peace in Jenna how are you with your parents those who are disrespectful and disobedient to their parents the prophet said will not be admitted to Jenna how are you with your next of kin those who civer their next of kin will not be admitted to Jenna when was the last time you spoke to your uncle to your brother to your cousin to your aunt you have a problem how are you with your neighbors how are you with your wife your children the prophet told us that he who is not in safety from his neighbors harming him and abusing him he will not be admitted to Jen the prophet told usam a man with an antweight of arrogance would not be admitted to Jenna how are we are we arrogant what are you you're below me I'm a Saudi you're not then I will enter hell from the biggest Gates because of the arrogance I have we have to be humble to our brothers those who deal with sorcery black magic soothsayers priests and fortune tellers and they believe them they will not be admitted to Jenna and a lot of the Muslims unfortunately now enjoy entertainment of sorcerers and magicians they attend concerts they look and watch programs weekly not knowing that this may deprive them from attaining the peace on the day of judgment in this life Allah Asel has forbidden us from things and he told us that if you do them you will be deprived from them in Jenna men cannot wear silk nor gold and if you do you'll be deprived from enjoying it in Paradise so be careful men and women are not allowed to eat in silver and gold utensils you go to five star hotels everything is in Gold you say wow fine I put this in my pocket no a room service they don't give you gold and silver utensils they give you stainless steel so even that you cannot eat with spoons forks or knives made of gold or silver because you'll be deprived from doing that or having that on the day of judgment also intoxicants if you drink wine in this life you will not drink it in the paradise the prophet Alam cursed 10 those those who grow it those who make juice out of it those who sell it those who buy it those who carry it those who serve it those who drink it anything connected to intoxicants not necessarily wine it can be Scotch it can be Jin it can be bourbon it can be vodka it can be tequila the sky is limited also drugs are compared to intoxicants in the part of it so you're talking about hash you're talking about marijuana myth inferent cracks heroin cocaine opium and the list goes on and on at the very conclusion before they drag me from my th I cannot do Jah Justice and that is why the prophet saidat Allah the almighty says I have prepared for my righteous slaves that which no eye has seen no ear has heard and it has never crossed the mind of man so whatever you think of Jenna this is just a glimpse and what awaits you and what awaits me with the grace of Allah asael when we die is far far greater than what we think with this I conclude my talk [Applause] we'll have the first question from mic number one here from the brothers your name your profession and please make it short brief and on the topic assalam alaykum I'm Dr had I'm a pediatrician in India I've come just to attend this conference there is a Hadith that Allah subhana tala will not talk with three types of persons the third type is those who over their ankle bones some say it means those who have takur and it is not the literary meaning of the Hadi there are few people who wear short trousers but they cover the ankle bone with socks there are others who wear normal trousers and fold during Salat time may I have your opinion on this had this please okay uh I need another lecture can I have another half an hour I don't think so so in a nutshell a I'm going to give you the juice the fruit of all of this it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that Allah has placed two punishments for those who extend their garments below their ankles and I'm talking about males and not females of course I don't want sisters to come wearing short uh uh dresses saying above the ankle no they have to cover the whole thing so the first punishment is the ankle bone and the heel this area is punishable in fire if you extend your garment depending on the extension that's it so your whole body is not in fire but this particular area will be punished in fire of course the prophet told us that the least in hell is a man who has a stone of fire put into his sandals now he's not literally being punished but this is the only thing but because it's extremely hot his brain boils so this is a little bit similar to that the second punishment is something which is a sin that pride is accompanied with the prophet said three Allah would not talk to them would not look at them would not purify them and would punish them severely the first one the one who drags His Garment below the ankles and in another Hadith the prophet told us about that specific sin which is pride in addition to dragging the Garment below the ankle so these are two different punishments and to someone who extends and prolongs His Garment below the ankle to claim that I am not doing it out of arrogance he has to prove that because Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him stood once when he heard this Hadith he was terrified and he said oh prophet of Allah I'm a skinny man I try my level best to have this waist wrapper as tight as possible but whenever I walk it falls blow the ankle so I immediately pull it up so am I among those whom will be punished he said no you are not doing it out of Pride so if you have someone like the prophet Alat wasam to give you this certificate of Pride free garment go ahead otherwise you should be like everyone else as for prayer okay I'm sful from 9 to 5 I have to go to work I'm working in the corporate management and wearing a suit they will laugh at me when it comes to prayer I will not do anything I will pray with my trousers below my ankles no you can fold that then it would mean that you have like 15 minutes free time from punishment but then you will be the rest of the day in punishment and Allah knows best thank you we'll take the next question from the sisters asalam alayum sh it's my privilege to be here and meet you and I'm a big fan of your program um and thank you for the opportunity I am a born Hindu I'm Riv to Islam few years back but I am facing issues with my parents and my family thinks that I have made the biggest mistake by reverting to Islam and I believe the one and only God is the almighty Allah we came from him and will return to him and I want to convey this message to my par parents and I'm struggling to speak to them uh because they are my parents and on this topic I want my beloved parents to enter jna and I said at a situation to my mom like you know don't worship the Creations instead worship the Creator so I need your advice and to have the courage to go and speak to my parents uh to enter into jna thank you you're quite welcome alhamdulillah may Allah the almighty make you steadfast on Islam and it's only few moments that is keeping you away from entering Jenna once you die on Islam once you die while maintaining and observing your prayer five prayers a day nothing would hold you back from Jenna inshallah now for your fear from advising and calling your parents this is from Shan any fear that you feel to humans this is Froman this is Shan who is making you intimidated from his servants from his allies so this is definitely from Shan now how to motivate yourself and to get this encouragement to talk to them I'll give you an example you're a Believer alhamdulillah you believe in hell and heaven and you want them to be with you in heaven if you see your father or your mother holding a glass with venom and poison in it and you know the minute they take a sip they will go to their graves they will die instantly would you advise them or would you hit the glass and throw it away fearing that they may harm themselves definitely in D you would do whatever you can to save them now life and death is something that everyone is going to pass through so if I die today or if I die after 100 years the end result is death but hell and heaven are for eternity so would you want them to suffer in Hell definitely not so you have to encourage yourself you have to as stated in the beginning of the talk make a strategic plan set your objectives because when you have a plan you don't give every in 10 minutes maybe you have to say something today a week later something else a little bit more a month later but have a long-term plan have a short long-term plan have your objectives try to figure and think how they think so that you can Counterattack that but never ever give up hope every day that passes reduces your chances in saving them from Hellfire so may Allah Asel guide them and all of your family to Islam and make you steadfast on this Dean inshallah next question from the brothers Mich heyam alayum aome it's uh Ramsey Weber I'm a sales engineer you may remember me from Saudi for the great speech my son was so excited he wants to die now and go into Jenna uh but real quick she I mean many many times we see on the TV uh many kids from non-muslim countries dying as we saw last week in the news with the fairy disaster almost 200 kids dying uh as a coping mechanism that I use when I see such things I always think that these kids have been picked to go to heaven because they die before reaching puberty um can you just elaborate on that maybe really quick about this thought process which I go through and I imagine many other Muslims uh might use this as a coping mechanism also uh that these kids in non-muslim countries that pass away before puberty are in heaven um it's an issue of dispute and this is the easiest way of getting out of trouble whenever someone asks me what's the ruling on this it's an issue of dispute alhamdulillah so I'm Saved by the Bell no actually it is an issue of dispute and in a nutshell we as Muslims can cannot say that this individual is in Jenna or this individual is in hell not even XY of a cafer country or a leader I cannot say I do not have card blanch to put people in Jenna or in Hell otherwise I would have been much richer than I am I wouldn't be here speaking to you but the fact is we can only say that Abu Bakr is in Jen Omar is in Jen is in Jen Ali is in Jen is in Jen etc those whom the prophet told us we're hopeful and Wishful that people who died after being righteous and Pious that will be in Jenna but we cannot affirm that say yes definitely he's in Jenna so from this general rule Scholars differed when it came to the children whether of the Believers or the disbelievers the the Believers the majority say that they're in Jenna why because they follow their parents and by default they're Muslims they admitted to Jenna but there is a Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her and other evidences that restrict us again saying this we are hopeful and Wishful also for the disbelieving children who did not reach the age of puberty Allah asael did not hold them accountable yet so how can Allah punish them we do not say that Allah will punish them and yet we do not say that Allah would admit these specific individuals XY Z into Jenna however we can simply say all children are in Jenna Believers or disbelievers who did not reach the age of puberty they are in Jenna okay what about Tom the son of John the son of Mark Luke Etc I don't know about Tom he died when he was four or five years of age but generally speaking all children are in Jenna so you see the difference I don't specifically say abdah the son of my friend fared died who was 6 years of age he's in Jenna no I do not say this because it's not my right I say all children who die under the age of puberty insh all are in J we'll take the next question and perhaps the final question for this session from the sisters umum what happens um to people between death and Yama I don't know okay if I understand the question I think that you're asking about between this life which is death after you die and the day of Resurrection yes what happens in between the phases are three one is this duny we live in each individual has this duny his lifespan he enjoys and he suffers he enjoys things to be enjoyed food drinking Etc and he suffers from calamities illnesses and the suffering and enjoyment is done on the body and partially on the soul once you die you move to the second phase which is called Al it's a transitional period between the two worlds and it's also temporary as this life in in this phase the enjoyment or the suffering may Allah keep suffering away from us is done totally on the soul but with a small connection to the body or what remains of it and those who are destined to Jenna those who are believers Allah would open a window for them overlooking Jenna and they would get from the fragrance it's you know when you're feeling hot when the weather is and you come to a building and the doors are opened and you get some of the breeze and wow I could pay money for that because the air conditioning is blowing on you it's the same thing in your grave Allah would open a window to Paradise you see how beautiful it is you get some fragrances we know that it would be an easy ride for the Believers in their graves with the grace of Allah the Third third phase is when the trumpet is blown and then everyone is resurrected now it is the day of judgment either Hell or Heaven the enjoyment is 100% full to the body and to the spirit and the Calamity is as well 100% full to the body and to the spirit may Allah make us among those who go to paradise and who would attain the peace in this life and in the [Applause] Hereafter for your very knowledgeable presentation on the topic Paradise the final Abode we ask Allah subhah wa T to grant us Jenna in the saying of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam as he taught [Music] us oh Allah we ask you to grant us paradise and we seek Refuge with you from the fire he created the universe to him belong the heavens and the Earth the ever living He is the first he's the owner of Mercy he sent his Messengers to war his [Music] creatures of the great danger of worshiping other than all there is none greater than the Creator Allah Allah [Music]"
