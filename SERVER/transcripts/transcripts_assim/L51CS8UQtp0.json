  "title": "If there is no space in the row of congregational prayer, can I form a new row alone",
  "transcript": "[Music] my question is if a worshiper enters the masjid and finds the congregation praying and there is no space in the road should he pray standing alone behind them or get one of the worshipers in the row in front of him the full last row had no gaps he tried to squeeze himself in no social distancing nothing complete shoulder to shoulder foot to foot not a single gap what to do can i pull someone so that he would retreat and begin and you line with me the answer is no this is totally prohibited because then you would be cutting the line and whoever cuts the line allah will cut him then what to do simply form your own role and pray but i heard the prophet say allah that there is no prayer valid for a person who prays alone behind the robe that's true the hadith is authentic may allah have mercy on his soul explained this and said that this is for a person who's arrogant and his pride does not allow him to squeeze himself in a row there is gaps but he doesn't want to so he'd like to pray alone this person's prayer is invalid but for a person who did his level best and the full row is without any gaps in this case he had feared allah to the best of his ability and allah says to the best of your ability so he may pray alone behind the line you"
