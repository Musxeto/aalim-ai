  "transcript": "Shifa says my father uses interest money from the bank for household expenses and he works in an insurance company and his salary is haram does this affect us and what about the others who invite who are invited to our house for meals and feasts and the gifts he gives us and them with this Haram money first of all we have to understand that the income one gets from Haram sources is divided in the two types Haram by itself and Haram for the way it is earned what do you mean share if I take this mug and I steal it from someone this mug after stealing it is not mine for sure enough I give it to you it's not yours for sure because this belongs to another person so it is Haram because of its self not because of anything else and such wealth cannot be use or utilize or accepted if a person is a burglar he's a he's a thief and he steals people's money the money is belonging to others even if he gives it to me as a gift the gift is Haram once I know I have to dispose of it or give it to the lawful owner or give it in the cause of Allah so jail but not to utilize it because it is stolen so a lot of the people say Shaykh people brings us bring us stolen goods can we buy them it's cheap it's good so the answer is no I remember once ages ago I was in Miami Florida and I was coming out of the bank and this brother comes to me he says listen you want to buy some expensive watches and he shows me a list a collection of watches and it's original I can tell Rolex is etc and he's selling it cheap but I'm sure indefinite like this is stolen I cannot buy it buying it is haram for me then there is the second type of income Haram income which is how I'm due to its earning so if a person sells drugs or intoxicants or cigarettes or movies or indecent magazines if a person works in an insurance company or in a financial institution that deals with rivers such as banks or credit cards if a person works in the media and he produces movies etc all of this is Haram his income is Haram the money he makes is Haram for him to utilize but if he gives it to someone else such as his wife his children if he gives gifts if he cooks food and people eat from it the sin is on him but it is permissible for me to benefit from that so the actual wealth and money that he had gained is haram for him but the actual money is not Haram itself like the stolen goods so if he stole a watch and he sold it and he cashed a thousand dollars these thousand dollars are Haram by themselves the watch is haram by itself but in the Haram income that is Haram due to the way it was earned this is a different story therefore whatever he gives to you your pet your father as provision as cool fees as clothes as food presents it's all legit for you and thus in is on him you reap the benefits and he will also be punished for it in his grave and on the day of judgment may Allah who shall protect us all"
