  "transcript": "what's the importance of lending people money with interest-free loans when they are in need and for how long should we pardon them if they're unable to return it is one of the highest recommended good deeds to do in islam is to lend people money of course interest free and this is known as al-qard al hassan where you don't want anything in return the prophet said alaihis salatu whoever lends money twice it is equivalent to the charity of it to the sadhaka of it once so if if i give someone five thousand dollars then he returns it then i lend him again five thousand dollars and he returns it this is equivalent to five thousand dollars given in charity while the money is in my pocket so in terms of investment this is one of the highest not only that in another hadith the prophet said if the man who whom you had lent and you set an appointment a date if he doesn't return it on that specific date and asks for an extension in this case you will be rewarded for the same amount the same in charity so instead of ten thousand equals five thousand in charity now five thousand equals five thousand and if the second date comes and he still asks for an extension then when once you give him let's say a month every single day you will be accredited five thousand as charity multiply by 30 this is 150 000 your return of investment over the 5 000 which you will get at the end of the month if he fails for the third time to return it and asks for an extension the prophet says al-islam for every day you get twice the value in charity so for your five thousand dollars whom he's still keeping with him and is unable to pay back every day it is accredited to your account ten thousand dollars that's charity nowhere you can get such a return of investment so this is a no-brainer that we should give money to those whom we trust and to be patient until they pay it back"
