  "title": "Joining someone who is already praying fard, sunnah, or nafl (stand to imam's right side)",
  "transcript": "Hammond says is it permissible if some start the obligatory prayer after a person who is performing a lone prayer maybe obligatory prayer sooner or Never of course in the sahih and the line at best may Allah be pleased with him said I slept in my aunt's house my muna pretending to be asleep but I wasn't I was just simply monitoring the way of the Prophet s salaam in sleeping and praying so when he woke up in the middle of the night and started to pray toric eyes I stood up made woudl and I stood to his left in prayer now the point is that the Prophet started his prayer alone intention to pray alone intention is to pray Sunnah nephal whatever night prayer and then even Abbas joined him if joining him was not permissible the Prophet would have pushed him away but the Prophet did not do that the Prophet instead took him in from standing to his left and pulled him and made him stand to his right like we should do when praying with an imam just alone just right to stand to his right so this indicates that my intention to pray alone or to lead the prayer is not counted it's not of great importance you can join any one who's praying also the intention whether the Imam is praying followed or voluntary prayer is not of importance so so many times I enter a message I see a person praying I've skipped I'm late for the congregational prayer so I want to pray my prayer and this man is praying and I'm assuming that he's praying his fault or he might be praying his volson so I join him he actually was praying Caracas soon after Lord but there's no problem I pray with him whatever is there when he offers Salam I continue and complete my fault the difference of opinion between us is not an issue"
