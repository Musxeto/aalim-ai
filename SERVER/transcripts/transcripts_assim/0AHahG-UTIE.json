  "transcript": "madiha says lizards should be killed is it so the answer is yes the Jacob not uh this Serbian jejokovic the tennis uh player no the the the house lizards that you see on the walls these lizards are to be killed and the prophet said Aslam if you kill them in the first strike you get a hundred Good Deeds if you don't manage to fill it in the first strike because they're too quick and fast and they uh run here and there but you hit it in the second and you kill it you get lesser good deeds and if you killed in the third strike you get lesser and lesser and there was a Hadith that when the idol worshipers built a huge fire to throw Ibrahim peace be upon him in it all animals and insects try to put it off except for the lizard it helped them ignite it so our enmity and hatred to the lizard is religious not because it's a repulsive insect which is but because it helped against Prophet Ibrahim peace be upon him and Allah azzawajal knows the best"
