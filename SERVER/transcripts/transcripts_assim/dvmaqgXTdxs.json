  "transcript": "lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim [Applause] [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam Al IM Ahmed andn maah may Allah have mercy on their souls reported in the mus and in the Sun that Abu anari may Allah be pleased with him said that a man came to the prophet Alat wasam and he said oh prophet of Allah advise me but be brief the prophet saidat wasam when you stand to pray pray like a man bidding farewell do not say anything for which you have to apologize for and give up hope for what other people have last time we met we discussed briefly the meaning of when you stand to pray pray like a man bidding farewell and this was explained in the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam when he said remember death in your prayer because a man once he remembers Death In His Prayer Will will surely perfect his prayer and pray the prayer of a man Almost sure that he will not pray another prayer therefore if we look and analyze these Hadith you will find among other hadiths that the prophet Alat is instructing us to remember death in so many hadiths such as in the of go and visit the cemeteries because visiting the cemeteries remind you of the day of judgment and we are instructed to remember death every now and then because the prophet says Alam remember death as much as you can and whoever remembers death in poverty he will feel that he's rich and if he REM remembers it in richness he will feel that he is poor and so on one would argue why does Islam promote remembering of death is it a religion of life or a religion of death well it goes beyond saying that Islam is a religion of life yet without remembering death one would not be able to Value life remembering death is divided into two types negative and positive remembering death negatively leads a person to sit idle unwilling to work unwilling to be productive unwilling to cooperate with others and whenever someone objects to his attitude or behavior he he justifies this by well I'm going to die so what is the point remembering death negatively causes a person to be depressed causing a person not to be able to function properly or to think properly and this is something that is negative and Islam definitely does not promote this however Islam promotes remembering death in the positive way in the sense that as long as I'm going to die then my final destination is either Heaven or Hell For Eternity which means that I have to do all the good deeds that I can so that when I die I would have achieved my Target and reached my objective Ive and that is why whoever remembers death in a positive way would be a productive person he would be a person willing to cooperate a person willing to add value to the community because he knows that the more good he does the better it is for his reward on the day of judgment and that is why any person remembering death in a positive way would never ever embezzle or accept bribes or lie or cheat or does anything that compromises his dignity or compromises his achievement of the higher grades and levels of paradise therefore prayer has a great value in Islam every Muslim when he prays he should offer his prayers with an empty heart that is empty for his Lord to fill with his love fear and gratitude when a person prays he should achieve all the mandatory and recommended acts and rhetorics in prayer when a person prays he should be calm in his prayer he should be submissive in his prayer and he should always remember that he is talking to the lord of the Lords subhanahu wa taala the almighty whatever he says from Vick from supplications from invocations or from Quran that he recites he should remember that he is talking to his Lord Lord the Almighty he should be humble to Allah when he stand up when he bows or when he prostrates he should remember that the prophet Alat wasam told us that Allah the almighty said that I've divided the faat into two parts between me and my servant so when whenever my servant says alhamdulillah Allah would say my servant has praised me Allah would say my servant has complimented me Allah the almighty says my servant has glorified me the almighty Allah says this is half between me and my servant and when the servant goes on and says Allah the almighty says this is between me and my servant and my servant will get whatever he asks for this is the prayer that we have to achieve and this is the level we have to reach so that we would be close to Allah our prayer is nothing like this it is always missing something and it has no blessing of Allah the majority of Muslims don't pray where Allah instructed them to do so in the masjids and the prophet told usat that the first thing to be uplifted from this nation is submissiveness is you will almost enter a Masid and could hardly find a as the prophet said said sallam this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim [Applause] [Applause] alhim [Applause] [Applause] is"
