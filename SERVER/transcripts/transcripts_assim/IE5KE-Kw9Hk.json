  "transcript": "was narrated by mother Juwairia \nBint Al-Haarith people say what   her name is juwairia one of the beautiful names   and by the way this name was chosen by the prophet \nAllah because her original name was the righteous   one and the prophet used to change names that had \nself-praise in them so he changed her name from and one of my daughters name is Juwairia \nand whenever I tell people that her name   is when registering or going to the hospital \npeople say why why so horrible name because   they don't know that this is the mother of \nthe Believers the wife of the Prophet is the prophet went to Fajr prayer early \nand came after the sun had risen   while mother Juwairia was on her position making \ndhikr so approximately an hour and a half maybe   a little bit less so when the prophet entered \nthe house he said I said a number of phrases   a number of words that are more in the weight of \nthe scale than what all what you have said while   sitting this hour and a half what was these words \nthe prophet Allah taught us to say in the morning how perfect Allah is and I praise \nhim by the number of his creation   and his pleasure and by the weight of \nhis throne and the ink of his words   and the Sunnah is to say these phrases or words \nthree times in the morning not in the evening   and it's an issue of dispute but \nthis is the most authentic opinion   so imagine subhanallah this is \nnumber this is description this is the ink of his words which has no end \nthis incubates all of the previously   saying this is a form of exaggeration meaning \nthat I'm saying how perfect Allah is I'm saying   glorify be Allah and praise be to him without \nan end because the number of his creation   is not known to us the pleasure of himself is \nendless the weight of his throne is beyond our   imagination and the ink that is used to write \nhis instruction and commands and orders are   endless so I am praising Allah I \nam glorifying Allah to that extent"
