  "transcript": "as Hara says some people distort the hadith where the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said if someone started something good and people follow them in that they will earn the reward for that these people link this with innovation and they call it bida husana a good Buddha a good innovation can you enlighten us on this please okay first of all we have to set the ground rules the prophet alayhi salatu salam is the most articulate arab ever to walk the earth and he was given the concise of speech and his words are counted and full of meaning and nothing is said just like that without intending what's in it every time the prophet has i'm used to give grand sermons like they heed like it's the scar like fridays he used to emphasize that everything that is innovated is a Buddha it's an innovation and every innovation takes you astray and everything that takes you astray would lead you to Hellfire he always reiterated this every innovated things is a bidder every he didn't say but he simply generalized every so anything that is related to religion and it's innovated the Prophet didn't do it as some he didn't direct us to do it the Companions didn't do it we know that this is an innovation Who am I who are you to come and say yeah yeah yeah but there is a good innovation so are you telling me that the Prophet when he said as I'm every innovation is bad and takes you astray so are you telling that his statement is wrong and you know more what is this are you a Muslim how dare you reject the words of the Prophet as some as simple as that the I know I know there are scholars who said that subhanAllah we're talking about the Prophet of Islam some but lord I sell them and you're telling me that there is Tom Dick or Harry who said otherwise and you want to follow that again are you a Muslim how is it possible he said ok what do we do with this hadith ok we move on to clarify a misconception what is the hadith whoever guides people to righteousness or something that is good he will have their reward and the reward of all those who followed him without it being missed on the day of judgement so this is a clear statement of good innovation ok let's assume that can you please trace the origin of this hadith hmm this is interesting and challenging I will do my research so he goes and he comes back with sahih al-bukhari and the books of hadith ancestors this is a hadith I found it can you please tell me the incident that took place is it ok the incident was the Prophet was in the Masjid so a large Salem and people from mother the great tribe of mother went or came in to the Masjid but they had clothes that were torn and signs of poverty were apparent on them so the prophets change of face are unchanged and he rose the pulpit and he addressed the people and he read a verse or two of the Quran and then he encouraged them to take a visor between themselves and Hellfire through giving in charity even by half a date not a full date half of it it will help you and the Companions were sitting there listening to the sermon did not react one come and the Prophet ended his sermon who was waiting for the result so one of the Companions rushed out of the Masjid came back with a big bag almost unable to carry it because of its heaviness and placed it in front of the Prophet I race a lot for cinema so it was full of clothes charity food etc and the moment companions saw this action they immediately rushed out and came back with whatever they could carry and they piled a big pile in front of the Prophet SM the Masjid and the prophets face changed and became bright like the full moon and he said and this is what he said man sin fill Islam is Sunnah 10 hasana whoever initiates in Islam a good deed those who follow him will I credit him with good deeds without them losing any of their good deeds so he will take like a rain check because he's the one who started it and the people followed suit now this hadith is a clear indication that there was no bidder involved 1 the Prophet is the one who encouraged them Salalah awliya Salem to donate and give in charity to the companion the Prophet asked him to do did he invent something new into the religion nope did he innovate a new prayer a new form of Vicar nope what did he do he gave in charity is giving in charity mentioned in the Quran yes is it mentioned in the Sunnah yes did the Prophet order it yes allahumma salli wa sallim ala muhammad then do with all due respect will you come and say throwing a Mawlid for the Prophet Allah so salam is a good bidder a good innovation and I say okay did the Prophet ever do such a thing nope did the Companions ever do such a thing no did the tabie a never do such a thing nope but still it's a good innovation subhanAllah you will have all the sins of those following you if you innovate something in Islam now remember that innovation deals with rituals with forms of worship it doesn't deal with wearing a watch or using a PDA or riding a car or flying in an airplane these are normal things that have nothing to do with rituals and forms of worship but when you come and say well after the the prayer is over it is recommended that you put your hand over your head and read dua or after saying that ask are you open your shirt and you blow inside of your shirt or after fajar prayer is concluded and you do your ask our and you're about to leave it's good to offer a separate frustration to thank Allah all of these are bata innovation and how many people would follow you you will get accredited with their sins without them losing any of their sins you will come on the day of judgment and find whoa what the heck what is this I didn't do all of these yes you did you guided them or rephrasing it you misguided them so this is a serious issue that we should really be careful not to fall into an Allah knows best"
