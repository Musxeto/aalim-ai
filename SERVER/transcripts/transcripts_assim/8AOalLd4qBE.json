  "title": "Taking a patient in the ICU off a Ventilator or Life Support  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Apple Yusuf's first question about someone who is in ICU and they put him on ventilator and they put him on continuous dialysis and maybe a pump for the heart to work so and they're charging money and the patient is 99 percent deceased well this is not for your and my estimation this is for the estimation and the verdict of trustworthy and I underline trustworthy doctors what they have as do not resuscitate Dana D and R which some patients acquire or ask for this can be implemented if the trust were the doctors said that this patient is like a vegetable he is in a vegetative state his brain cells are over with no way he can be revived or return his consciousness because he is dead but he remains alive because of the machines and the devices that we hook into him in this case yes such a person can be terminated because he's actually dead but if someone is alive conscience he can speak but without the ventilator he dies we can never take this off him for example this Superman Christopher Reeves when he had his accident and he broke his neck while riding a horse he was rushed into hospital once he broke his neck his spinal cord was torn and cut all the functions of his body failed so they had to put something for his lungs for his heart and he was trained for like six months to be able to work with the machine and have the ability to breathe and control it if they took off the machines he would have certainly died but he's a human being he's alive and he needs assistance in this case we cannot take the machines of a DC of a patient who's in that category so I hope this answers your question"
