  "title": "How to know if a Scholar is trusted one? How to differentiate between Student of Knowledge & Scholar",
  "transcript": "very important question was which is how do we know a scholar from a student of knowledge and I'm not sure if this is his actual question because it might be how do we know that this particular scholar is a trusted scholar there are so many people around us that have the title of scholars and we see people rising and fallen we see people we used to point at them and say masha'Allah they are the best of scholars of Islam there's this and they're that and subhanAllah may Allah keep us all steadfast on the Sunnah on the truth on the straight path after a few years they flip they change their colors they change their teeth their men has they reject the synonym they reject the man has over hello signal Jumeirah so if this is what the lives question is about this is more difficult than the other one how to differentiate between a scholar and a student of knowledge a scholar is a category of very few selected people not due to the race nationality color or authority it is due to their knowledge so these people are knowledgeable in Arabic and it's Sciences they're knowledgeable in Quran and the tough seer and obligated from what is not and they are knowledgeable in hadith and the different sorts of hadith the Sahay and the behave and how authentic and how not authentic the explanation of scholars about this hadith they are knowledgeable in fact and they are knowledgeable in a soulful among other bits and pieces here and there of knowledge so these people this caliber of people when they have an issue they give the answer from their knowledge which is based on the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the favorite generations the three favorite generations they do not shoot from the hip they do not bring something none of the previous predecessors have thought of rather they follow and they give us their HT hat these are the scholars the students of knowledge are greater in number than the scholars they have bits and pieces of what scholars have but they don't have the power to come up with an opinion of their own and they have to select from the opinion of the scholars and tell you that this is the most authentic according to my research so they bring you the different opinions of scholars and they select one not due to their whims and desires rather to their intellect to their knowledge of the Quran and the Sunnah and due to their research and they come up with a conclusion so this is how you can differentiate between a scholar a real scholar and a student of knowledge so when people look at me or other Diaries and they say oh they are scholars of Islam this is wrong we are not scholars of Islam we are soon as of knowledge we are preachers we convey to the masses what we've learned from the real scholars and back it backing it up with the Quran the Sunnah and explaining it to the masses this is why they consider us as scholars but we are not scholars now how to know which one is to be trusted or not this is a different issue we have to look at the conduct of the scholar or the of knowledge we have to look at those who praised such a scholar or a student of knowledge because appearing on it on your TV screens does not make a person a scholar it makes him a lucky person he got a chance to come and address you but you have to scrutinize a person so if you see someone free mixing with women flirting with women listening to music doesn't have a clear path or man has when it comes to akkada everything is okay it's a cocktail let's go ahead and do it this is not someone you should follow if you see someone who does not have consistency so ten years ago he was calling to the method above a man has Ovilus uno a JAMA and the appeal of a set of a Salah and he flipped he changed to the dark side as they say and he is no longer promoting the man has of the Salaf and he thinks that he is better virgin and more knowledgeable or his introducing Buddha or he is collaborating with the people of bida this son is someone that you should leave aside if you see someone who is a super trooper and he thinks that no I am the only one around who's right everybody's wrong this day I would will he is not on the man hatch this guy is an innovator this guy he is probably from the his B's or from this or and start labeling people like you have mentioned in your third question which we will come to then again this is bad news and Allah knows best"
