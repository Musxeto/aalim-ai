  "transcript": "inah you go to Filas for your service I wanted to say that I don't understand a word of what you said ABD Malik I say inshah you go to because and you as well inshallah we'll go together inah my question is is it permissible for me to work in it cyber security uh for PSG is the football club for know for p PSG the football club okay so a football club is a Halal place because they play sports they may compete hopefully they don't have any gambling in it and the footballers all of them run after a bowl of leather filled with air poor for them but this is their choice of life so the club itself is halal working in it to prevent any hacking in cyber security and the likes would be also Halal in this as long as there is nothing Haram in your job description and Allah Knows Best"
