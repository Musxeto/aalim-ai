  "transcript": "she says are we allowed to use beer shampoos that are on the market nowadays this question has to be dissected in order to answer it first of all beer used externally and whether this is halal or Haram first of all wine intoxicants in general are different from alcohol alcohol is a separate substance though it causes intoxication but it has no ruling for itself to being intoxicant because it's a substance and most likely if someone drinks pure alcohol that he would harm himself if not died so alcohol itself is not our topic our topic is intoxicants whether it is wine red or white whether it is whiskey whether it is any other intoxicant is it nudges or not is it physically impure or not because this would affect a number of other things so if I apply it externally do I have to wash it before praying or not so it is pure alcohol and I have it in a swipe and I swap and I clean my wound to pray do I have to wash it there's no so some say ok because this is not wine I understand this is alcohol what about physical alcohol that is wine someone pours a glass of wine on my trousers or a drop of vodka falls accidentally from the passenger sitting next to me on an international flight which I have no control over and turbulence and it falls on me can I pray it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that intoxicants are not physically impure but rather spiritually and there are evidences proving that among them is that the Prophet Alice or some ordered the Companions to spill out their savings and whatever they had stored of wine when the prohibition was revealed to him and the rivers of wine was pouring in the streets of Medina and no one considered walking on that to be impure and would affect their prayer in the Masjid among other evidences so it is not physically impure and this is why when we have a bottle of perfume that has alcohol in and you apply it on yourself and your body you go to pray with that there is no problem in that so using it externally is okay if there's a need to it as in the case of perfume going back to beer not all beer is haram so we have beer that is prohibited and they have beer that is Hallett how do we judge we do that through the end result if we have a beer that is called non-alcoholic and it has point three or 0.5% alcohol in it doctors and professionals say that if you consume a six-pack it would not intoxicate you hence it is holid because the Prophet gave us the parameters Ali Saleh - Salam of what is halal and what is Haram when he said in an authentic hadith whatever intoxicates in large quantities then little of it is Harlan so if someone drinks a glass of champagne and he's not intoxicated he does not have the right to say it's halal for me I'm just a social drinker they were throwing a toast so I just drank half a glass and it did not intoxicated ahi if you drag a few drank or if you were to drink a large quantities of it like five or six glasses would you become intoxicated definitely I'd become wasted in this case a drop of it one single drop is haram for you this is the measurement tool that the Prophet gave us how is salatu salam so we have to look at the shampoo the the the beer itself if it's not intoxicating and it's added to shampoo there's no problem using it okay sure what about if it is intoxicating what of it what if it's a Miller or a Budweiser full full throttle as they say the real deal it's definitely Haram to consume what about if it's mixed with shampoo using it externally in your hair is permissible though it is not juice but if you use it externally like perfume and you wash it then it's okay the trick is not here the trick is in buying it so when you buy shampoo that is alcoholic beer based then you are buying alcohol we are buying wine you're buying intoxication and the profit Alice Oh sir I am cursed in wine ten among them is the one who buys it so those who buy it who sell it who manufacture it who grow the grapes or the plants used for it who carry it who it is carried to etc so many people are cursed when it comes to wine which is the general terminology for intoxicants therefore buying it is totally prohibited using it is something that is abhorred is not recommended for a Muslim but at the end of the day it's not Haram because one is using it externally and not consuming it but buying it is totally prohibited and allah azzawajal knows best"
