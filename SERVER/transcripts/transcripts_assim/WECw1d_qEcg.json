  "transcript": "Yasir from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum My question is if an imam does a mistake like stand mistakenly after fourth rakah but I did not do the mistake, should I perform the shahoo siddah? Please answer in two scenarios, if I was from the beginning of the jama'a or I joined the jama'a late after some rakah Jazakallahu Khairan Wa Jazak If the imam makes a mistake and you are not aware of it or you did not do it and he offers sujood al sahoo and you're with him from the beginning, you have to follow him. So for example, the imam let's say sits after the first sujood thinking that it is tashahhud time. He does not perform the second sujood. So you guys say subhanAllah, subhanAllah, so he goes for the second sujood and you prostrate with him. You did everything right. You didn't make a mistake. He made the mistake. Yet he is supposed to offer sujood al sahoo before the salam and you have to comply with him. If his sujood al sahoo is before the salam and you've already missed one or more rakah then definitely before offering salam he's going to prostrate for sujood al sahoo. You have to follow him. But if you missed one or more rakah and his sujood al salam is after the salam, once he offers the salam, you stand up to complete. Okay, now he's offering sujood al sahoo. What should I do? Complete your prayer normally. If you didn't do the mistake with him or you were not witnessing the mistake, the mistake happened in the first rakah which you missed. You didn't notice it. So you don't offer sujood al sahoo. But if you witnessed it with him then you offer it as well after you conclude your prayer. And Allah knows best."
