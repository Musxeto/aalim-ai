  "transcript": "sfia has a question is she she says how exactly should a person behave when she goes to give condolence upon the death in any house generally we find people sitting and gossiping is it permissible to eat if they serve you food if not how should I refuse what am I supposed to say to them first of all it is not part of the Sunnah to gather for accepting the condolences J abdah may Allah be pleased with him the companion said that we the companions used to consider gathering for condolences or for mourning and gathering on the food because of the event of uh uh the death of a person we used to consider this as wailing and nah which is a major sin when a woman starts to wail and says oh he's my husband and she cries she slaps her face and tears her hair and tears her clothes all of this is part of a which is a major sin and J pleas with him says that the companion used to consider the notion of just gathering for mourning and for accepting the condolences of people and to eat food as we or some Muslims do unfortunately this is a major sin so if if you hear about someone's death what to do it's very simple you try to meet them in the Masjid you try to meet them at the workplace you try to meet them anywhere uh uh you see them and give them their your condolence but if they do not allow this or they are confined to their houses the 3 days of morning there's no problem in going but try to avoid the certain time so go in the morning go in the afternoon not between M and as the culture here in Saudi Arabia which is an innovation without hanging lights and and putting chairs and and making a reception outside and blocking the roads so that people could come all of this is an innovation and you should not stay for eating you just give your condolences a give and go even if they hold you to eat or to uh uh stay don't do that because as stated before it is part of uh what because it is part of uh an innovation as stated by J abdah abdah"
