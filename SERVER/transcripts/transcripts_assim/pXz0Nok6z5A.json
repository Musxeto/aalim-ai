  "title": "Being alone with a Non-mahram in an elevator? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[], she says, I live in a building \nwith 15 floors and while taking   the elevator sometimes there's a man in the lift. And I have to get in, otherwise I'll have to \nwait for a long time for the lift to come back. Is it permissible or will it be \nKhulwa, which means seclusion. What if there are two men, \ncan I take the elevator then? First of all, seclusion between a man and a \nwoman is totally prohibited by the authentic hadiths and the consensus of all Muslim scholars. They all agree that a man being alone with a \nnon-mahram, a woman, in seclusion is prohibited. And what is the definition of seclusion? So if I were in an elevator or a lift that \nhas glass walls, [ ] view, and everybody can see us, or if I were with a woman in a \ncar and the windows make everyone see what we're doing inside, would this be seclusion? scholars say yes because seclusion \nrevolves around what goes between us which a third party is unable to listen \nor monitor what we are saying so I could be doing anything or saying anything and \nnobody knows what is happening. This is what Islam had prohibited when the \nProphet ﷺ no man is in seclusion with a non-mahram woman \nexcept the third person with them is Satan and what do you expect when Satan \nis present he would not tell you to read the Quran or learn from her the Hadith \nhe would definitely do his thing so this generally speaking answers your question \nif you're in the 15th floor the lift comes or the elevator comes and there is \na man inside you have one of two choices either to go in and disobeying the \nProphet ﷺ saving some time with a possibility of the \nlift does not work or it's stuck between floors as in so many cases that took \nplace and is still taking place and after two three four hours maybe more \nmaybe less it works or the emergency authority comes and rescue you with \ntelevision and radio and cameras and they're shooting you and this \nnon-mahram man in this that elevator with a report that you have been there for \nthree four hours. This is not good for your reputation let alone for your \nreligion. Option two is to wait and this would waste a few minutes. You will \neither have it empty or if you had two men inside you can go in. This is not \nseclusion. If there was a man and a woman or more this is not seclusion. Seclusion \nis when you have a man without anyone he may fear or be ashamed of to be with \nyou. So if he had an infant for example three-year-old, that would be still \nseclusion because this three-year-old would not deter this man from saying \nor doing anything and Allah Azza wa jal knows best."
