  "title": "They get offended when I give them Dawah, should I keep trying or stop? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "A man from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is that I am a very self person and I am a very private person. I don't like to suggest people the things. And for the sake of Allah and the reward, I suggest people when they do some haram things or wrong. And some of them just feel arrogant and they just ignore me or they see me as a kid and they treat me as a kid. So should I continue concessing about the wrongdoing of them or I just stop them? As long as you have done your due diligence and warned them and clarified to them the ruling in Islam and they rejected it, stop. As long as there is no benefit from shoving it down their throat, rather it's going to backfire and may cause more harm than good, no need. I did my duty in front of Allah. It's time to move on and focus on people that would benefit and learn from my teachings. Why do I insist on talking to my cousins or to keep on insisting on my siblings when they don't want to, when they're ignorant and negligent and not interested? Rather they're offended by it. No, might as well leave them alone and move on with life. www.mooji.org"
