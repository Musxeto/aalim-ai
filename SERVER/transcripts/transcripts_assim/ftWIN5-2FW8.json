  "title": "Dealing with those who speak about Allah without Knowledge | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] said says i'm asking about how one should cope with the innovation someone who interprets allah's book and sunna with enough little knowledge and lack of qualification i don't understand the questions it but if there is a person an individual who does this with little knowledge and qualification he should be forced by the authorities not to speak knowledge is like medicine you can't have someone who's a rookie or someone who just comes and gives prescriptions and and diagnoses illnesses and operates on people without any proper qualification religion is far greater than medicine because medicine deals with the human body in this life while religion deals with the human soul and its connection to the hereafter"
