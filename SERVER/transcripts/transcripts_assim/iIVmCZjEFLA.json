  "title": "Memorise Quran without understanding or memorise bit by bit & implement in our lives Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is what's better for a person to memorize the quran the traditional way of going from nasty bakara or that a person who memorizes this with the help of the teeth while implementing it bearing in mind that while doing the traditional way he's gonna finish finish within one one year or two years but probably doing it taking a long time so what's better it depends on hala upon where you find your heart in some folks find it easier and more more convenient for them to memorize the whole quran so once they start on their trip they do not rest until they finish it so they just say bismillah and they go ahead with memorizing the quran until they finish it in a year or two or three some folks find this sometimes a bit time time-consuming not being able to comprehend what they have memorized and they would rather focus on the quality and saying no i'll take bits and pieces of the quran memorize it understand the meaning of it implement it in my life like the companions used to do they used to memorize ten verses of the quran understand their meaning and their tafseer and implement it in their lives then they move on to the following ten so it depends on where you find your heart this is the most important thing not to force yourself quantity versus quality it depends where you find its best of interest to yourself not to others because what works for me may not work for you and allah knows best"
