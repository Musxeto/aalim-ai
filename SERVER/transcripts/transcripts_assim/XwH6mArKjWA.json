  "transcript": "[Music] and we have halima from france yes i need your advice can listening to quran 24 hours with my headphones make me deaf i do not understand what you have said i can listen to koran per okay with my headphones make me deaf can listening to the quran with your headphones make you deaf exactly what is the connection if you put it on 100 volume whether it's quran or music you will become deaf but if you're listening with a moderate volume even if you listen to it for the rest of your life quran or otherwise it has no impact on your hearing so i don't see the relationship okay thank you barakallahu fikum you"
