  "transcript": "s sent us an email and he says in some Muslim countries there's a concept that the rights of people he coached hopefully that take precedence over the rights of Allah is this correct for example delaying Salah to attend someone's need the example you gave is is not that accurate see Allah Azza WA JAL has rights and the creations the people around us also have rights whenever there are conflicting of these rights it depends on the issue there the conflict is in for example if the rights of work conflicts with a las Rights of Prayer on time who should I obey without any doubt you have to pray on time this is an obligation now there are very minor and limited cases where we will tell you oke you can delay you can skip congregational prayer at this and but to not pray at all this is not something to even contemplate upon when it comes to financial rights so my friend demands ten thousand dollars of me am an amount that I've had borrowed from him a while ago and there's a possibility of coming to hatch which I had never done in my life and it costs me $10,000 or let's say five thousand dollars so I would like to go and perform this pillar of Islam which is Allah's rights we say no here you cannot allah azza wajal obliged you to perform hajj only when you're able and you cannot be able when people want money from you so give the $5,000 to the one who wants from you $10,000 at least you paid him half and then pay the rest and then think of going for Hajj so you have to balance between the two and you have to judge each case by case scenario it's time to pray fetcher your father tells you I want you to come with me to the fish market and this means that you're gonna miss Federer prayer you say no I prefer Danica I'll catch up he gets angry ullas right has precedence has a priority but you want to pray a night prayer or taraweeh and your mom says stay with me I need someone to help me go to the toilet and make will do and come back and cook food for me and care for me and he said yeah but this is Ramadan I have to go to the Masjid no stay with your mom because this is voluntary though it is Allah's rights it's good for you but it's voluntary and obeying your mom taking care of her is mandatory and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
