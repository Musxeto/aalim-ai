  "title": "Committed apostasy behind closed doors, take Shahada publicly or privately to enter Islam again?",
  "transcript": "Sister Elizabeth says, if another convert is not practicing and does not believe in Islam anymore, if she comes back to it, does she have to say Shahada publicly or can she do it privately? If a Muslim commits an act of apostasy between him and Allah, everyone else still consider him or her to be Muslims. So this is something between them and Allah. If they go back and revert to Islam again and embrace it and they're remorseful and they're regretful, they do not have to expose their sins and go to others and say, listen, we've committed this and that, we have apostasized. Rather, they just say the Shahada and express their remorse to Allah and that would be sufficient, Inshallahu Azza Wa Jal. And apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, Inshallah, within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
