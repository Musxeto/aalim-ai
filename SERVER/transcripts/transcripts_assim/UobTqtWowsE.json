  "transcript": "after finishing the recitation of the whole Quran in prayer in mid majority mjid make a long congregational Dua for like 15 to 20 minutes before the W now the problem is that I'm not supposed to be involved in such vther and should come out of the place but the same time I have to complete my prayer with the IM otherwise I will lose the reward of praying the whole night so what should I do there is no problem there is no problem inshallah in praying behind them while resenting this this Innovation the Dua ofran is an innovation and the types that are done at the end or the last day of Ramadan and the prolonging of Dua for 15 20 minutes all of this is an innovation not from the Sunnah not from uh uh the way of the Sala but to gain the reward as you've clearly stated you have to pray with the Imam until he finishes so you resent it you hate it with your heart but you continue until you conclude your night prayer with the Imam to gain the reward of the whole night"
