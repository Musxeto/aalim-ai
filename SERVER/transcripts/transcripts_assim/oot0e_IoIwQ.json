  "transcript": "It's not going to be that easy. There is one hadith in this chapter. You find it in English. I don't think it is in Arabic. Is it? No. It's only in English. So Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, one of the companions of the Prophet ï·º. See, if I want to spend the whole day speaking about this hadith, I can, with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Talking about Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud by itself is sufficient. What do you know about Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud? Anyone? Because I can see people are sleeping. We have a long day ahead of us, so no time to sleep. It is very possible that I will point at you and I say, please stand up. You say, I paid money. Stand up. Who cares you paid money? I come from Saudi Arabia. I don't care about money. I will tell you stand up and I ask you a question so that I guarantee you do not sleep during the process. If you sleep, I'll sleep. So what do you know about Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud? You raise your hand. The brother. Second row, third. You raise your hand. Oh, you're doing your hair. Ah, watch out. What do you know about Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud? Anyone? Of course, he's a companion. That's a good. Yes. No, is it close? The Prophet said, learn the Quran from four people. Ibn Ummi Abd, Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud, Salim Mawla Hudhaifa, Ubay Ibn Ka'b, Zayd Ibn Thabit. These are the four people whom the Prophet told us to learn the Quran. One of them is Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud. Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud said, I took 70 plus surahs of the Quran straight from the mouth of the Prophet, peace be upon him. So only 40 left. He took 70 plus. So this man is knowledgeable."
