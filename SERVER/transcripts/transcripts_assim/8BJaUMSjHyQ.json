  "title": "Any difference of opinion among people of Athari Aqeedah (Salafis Did Sahaba differ in Aqeedah Assim",
  "transcript": "um are there differences in akita within ethere uh i think he believes within the ethereal there are claims that ethere that the ethereal ethereal of today is not the same as the akita back in the time of ahmed ibn rahim allah malik and so on this issue of difference of opinion in arcadia matters is a very sensitive and delicate issue so people say did the companions differ on issues of alpeda the vast majority say they did not because when you speak about akida the first thing that comes up to people's minds are the essential differences today whether the attributes of allah azzawajal like the asharis believe in are limited to seven attributes of allah and everything else is not which is definitely wacko all these attributes mentioned the quran the sunnah that is coming say no this is not what it is meant this is metaphoric this is this this is that which totally changed is so when you say that companions differ than issues of either our salafi people immediately grow up horns and want to attack thinking that we're talking about ashari or murtazili all of these the companions different no no no definitely not the companions that never ever had any issues of this when you come down a little bit then you start to have these issues coming up but what is the use of it only to preoccupy you in argument and debates that have zero benefit to you or to islam or to the muslims the issues of al-qaeda that the athari or the people have different over are negligible and they're not in fundamental issues like in taheed like in the beautiful names and attributes of allah like in belief in khadar or belief in the um or the six spirits of islam in general they differ whether the dead can hear you or not they differ in issues that are similar to that but not of great importance so to come today and try to make an issue out of it or to occupy muslims by asking questions that are irrelevant i would definitely ignore and move on because this is not helpful at all and there is no use of it why go into yeah the selfie is different the athari different issues of aqida blah blah blah who cares follow the quran and sunnah with understanding of the righteous predecessors to the best of your ability and if there is a difference of opinion over whether for example seven on the day of judgment are shaded in the shade of allah where there is no shade other than the shade of allah does allah have a shade some scholars say no this is metaphoric among the salafi movement because this may imp uh insinuate that there is light that allah gives shades to blah blah blah and some say no this is like the attributes of allah we have to believe in it as it is so others say no no no it's not the shade of allah it's the shade of the throne of allah it's a shade that allah creates and not history this is trivial in a sense issue to compare it to the difference between our akita and the arcade or or etc so don't preoccupy people with such things and follow the quran and sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors"
