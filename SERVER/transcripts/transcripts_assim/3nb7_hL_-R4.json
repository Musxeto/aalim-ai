  "transcript": "under wish she says while in the state of fasting during prayer if some mucus comes to my mouth what should I do should I break the Salah go and spirit as swallowing it will break my fast first of all if mucus is coming from your throat this does not break your fasting if you swallow it because it's not an external thing its internal second of all the Sunnah is to spit it during prayer because it is not healthy to swallow it so if you have a handkerchief a tissue even if you can spit it to the left left side below your foot or in a piece of cloth of your own cloth and then wash it that would be sufficient insha Allah but swallowing it does not affect your Salah"
