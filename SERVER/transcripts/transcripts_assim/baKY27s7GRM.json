[Music] in [Music] assalam ladies and gentlemen my dear brothers and sisters welcome to the 13th edition of the message my name is tan Amed and I'm very pleased to be back on this stage on this platform which I believe has become a household Name Across the Nation over the past one year this August Gathering began with a beautiful recitation of the Holy Quran by alhf Sultan Muhammad Latif it was back in January 2015 that the Islamic Ministry pioneered this initiative and since then we have had some of the most well-known International Islamic scholars from all across the globe from the United States to Sri Lanka from Zimbabwe to Malaysia and tonight is no exception before I introduce Our Guest let me tell you something from my own experience so it was yesterday that I got a call and I was informed about this event and my immediate reaction was to reach for the not control switch on the TV and switch to PE TV because that is the one place that I knew that I would find Our Guest for tonight let me get back to the podium so it was the only place that I was sure that I would find a glimpse of him I would catch a glimpse of him and I was right he was there he was giving a very powerful speech about how to deliver the prayer call and I was mesmerized you know why because he said two sentences that have stayed with me and inshallah will continue to stay with me in the future and it goes like this if you have Allah Almighty with you you have everything but if you look lose Allah Almighty you lose everything ladies and gentlemen our guest tonight is none other than Sheikh aim al-hakim Sheik aim Al Hakim is one of the most prominent Islamic speakers in Saudi Arabia he graduated from the prestigious um Al qu University in Makkah in 1998 and since then he has been tirelessly engaged in promoting and spreading The Message of Islam using authentic sources for his instruction and lectures he's a very familiar face not only on peace TV he's also on Al Huda Huda I believe and igra channel and other various radio stations delivering lectures in both Arabic and English and and is also on social media on both Facebook and Twitter uh and I'm also a follower so I'm I'm really excited to see him tonight tonight you know we have had speakers speaking on various themes and various subjects but tonight we go back to the basics we go back to the very Foundation of Islam the very Foundation the very basic principle that separates us Muslims from the rest of the world and that is ladies and gentlemen Ted the Oneness of Allah Almighty there's no God but Allah who created the heavens and the earth and the universe and everything that is contained in the universe now before we move on to his speech the lecture I want to tell I have some good news as well and now I believe for members of the audience you have been given coupon When you entered this Hall this area and after the lecture we're going to have a lucky draw so we're going to select three names three winners lucky winners and the first winner gets a digital Quran the second gets a riy the third winner gets a fig ladies and gentlemen I will not take much of your time I'm sure that you're very excited to hear more from our distinguished guest tonight so ladies and gentlemen let us welcome Sheikh aim Al [Music] Hakim Al the topic of tonight's talk ised and as an introduction and a disclaimer the disclaimer would be that is not a storytelling which usually captures the hearts of people it is not about it is not about Quran it is not about rules these topics usually grabs the attention of the audience what we're about to talk about is something much much higher so it might be for some of you a little bit technical a little bit scientific but you have to understand that the value of a science is measured by the content so if you study the science that deals with gold is different than the science that deals with diamonds we are about to study the science that leads us to the greatest thing in the universe which is Allah every single one of you here has a single desire a single objective a single Target in his life and that is to enter Jenna you're born you live you grow old you get married you have children you work you gather money you build a house then what throughout the whole process all what you want is to attain Allah's pleasure and to enter Jenna but Jenna cannot be entered without keep Keys it has one key and the key for Jen is so if you have you will enter Jenna but you have to understand whated is see a lot of the Muslims unfortunately do not understanded 1.7 billion Muslims and growing they do not know whated is a lot of the Muslims say I'm a Muslim my father is a Muslim my grandfather is a Muslim I pray I fast I knowed but Allah tells us that they do not knowed Allah says in the Quran and most of them believe in Allah while they are in the state of of shik most of them believe in Allah yet they are in the state of shik you go to any Muslim country except a handful and you will find that there is a grave in the Masid and people are praying to the Grave alass so many names s khad all they make Dua they want them to intercede this is shik you go to Muslim countries they're going to daras they're going to Graves they're worshiping them they believe in them they sacrifice for them so the majority of Muslims do not believe in Allah except while associating others with himed is not something little is the message that each and every single messenger of Allah was sent to their people with it Allah says all the messengers gave the same message to their people worship Allah you have no God worthy of being worshiped except him and this is the definition of there is no God worthy of being woried except Allah why do we say worthy because there is Buddha there is cows there are statues there are power and wealth there are desires that people worship these are Gods but they are not proper Gods so they're not worthy of being worshiped the only one who's worthy of being woried is Allah and this is why a lot of the Muslims when when they come to identify or to Define Allah they say that he is the god this is not enough so the messengers of Allah came to draw people to worshiping him our creation if you ask your children if you ask your friends if you ask your loved ones why did Allah create us they would say to worship Him Allah says this in the Quran Allah says about himself I have not created the Gin nor the humans except to worship me so Allah wants them to worship him those who comply will go to jenah may Allah make you and I among them those who refuse will go to hell and to worship Allah is the ultimate right for Allah mu jabel the companion was with the prophet Alam on the back of a donkey or a mule and he said mu he was a learned man mu do you know what is the right of Allah upon his servants what did say now look at the source of learning he's attributing knowledge to whom not to philosophy not to my intellect this is knowledge I cannot get except from Allah or his messenger so the prophet saidat the right of Allah upon his servants that they worship Him and not associate others with him after a while the prophet asked him do you know what is the right of humans upon their lord who are we to have rights over Allah if Allah wants he would in less than a second end up and annihilate the whole Humanity imagine this we're afraid of North Korea they have a nuclear bomb they can kill us they can kill only a few of us America has nuclear bombs Russia has nuclear bombs all of this is nonsense Allah who created us Allah can remove us this is that you fear only Allah that your heart is connected only to Allah so the prophet said do you know what the rights of the humans over their lord he said Allah and his messenger only know he says that if they do that if they worship Allah without associating others with him he will admit them to jenah so it's rights and obligations it sound very easy the right of a human being upon his Lord that if you worship Allah he will not put you in hell he will not torture you he will not torment you this is the right the obligation upon each and every one of you to learn firsthand it's more important than learning English huh nowadays all the Muslims are taking their children to learn English in international schools this happens in my country in Saudi I my daughter herself has two children and she puts them in an international school why to learn English do they know Arabic no how is their Quran very bad how is their Sunnah this is not the right thing to do so the first thing each and every one of you must learn is you have to understand it unfortunately not a lot of people talk about it and the majority of Muslims are ignorant about it why because deviant sects all over the world are making money if I call to if I teach you I'm actually telling you do not follow me follow the Quran and the Sunnah don't come for me for repentance or for forgiveness or for intercession go straight and ask Allah other deviant sects tell you that Allah will not accept anything from you except if it was through me I'm the shaman I'm the Manana I the uh Grand priest so you have to every everything do Through Me Your Money cannot be accepted in charity except through me clarifies all of this and this is why we have to understand the meaning ofed to clarify is our religion based on the Quran and Sunnah is our religion what pleases Allah or not so what ised linguistically in Arabic is to make something one this is why when the prophet in Salat saw someone in praying doing this moving both fingers he put his hand on the left and he said make one so comes from the word which is one now technically is to worship Allah and to acknowledge his Oneness in in and and I will come to explain this because I believe you don't all understand Arabic so you have to worship Allah you have to make of now what is is derived from and is one of the names of that's why we have and we say alhamdulillah who so Allah is the lord of the whole worlds so comes from the word r and basically without going into details because I can speak with the grace of Allah from now to but I don't think they will offer Us in the ministry of Islamic Affairs dinner will they they the people of Islamic Affairs are not even looking at me they're talking to one another so let's skip dinner what is meant [Music] by basically it is worshiping Allah by Allah's actions meaning Allah is the one who gives life can anyone of you give life no Allah is the one who takes life Allah is the one who gives us provision and risk said no I bring my own risk I work hard 8 hours 10 hours no this is not true when you came out of your mother's womb you had no knowledge you had no hearing you had no sight who gave you all of this who made you mashallah now with a PhD and a good position and a nice bank account your strength your wealth wealth your intellect no it is the provider the generous of Allah so Allah is the creator no one can create Allah is the giver of life and death Allah is the provider Allah is the facilitator who facilitates everything we do so many times you sit back and and contemplate Subhan Allah if I did the other thing life would not have been like this it is Allah who guided me to do this it is Allah who directed me to do this there are so many choices in life but you always find that Allah made you take the best choice and Allah made you live the best life and that is why it is very awkward when someone is asked if you were to have another life who would you like to be said oh Superman said no ninja Turtles no a Batman Spider-Man this is wrong if you were to have a better life I would only choose to be me because this is what Allah chose and this is the best that Allah has chosen for me I believe in that and I'm content with that because he's the facilitator he's the provider and he's the one who gives risk Allah says in the Quran say who provides for you from the sky and from the earth or who owns hearing and sight who brings out the living from the dead and bring out the Dead from the living and who disposes the Affairs all of our Affairs Allah disposes it Allah facilitates all of them they will say Allah say will you not then be afraid of Allah's punishment who will say Allah the idol worshippers this is addressing the idol worshippers and they believe that their Idols cannot do anything for them they believe that in so this is shared by us and also by the idol worshippers they believe in Allah is the one who gives rain it is Allah who gives provision so have no problem in that so this is part one of can you repeat please behind me because you will forget the word it comes from so this is worshiping Allah by his actions now we go to and this comes from the word and istically the most authentic opinion is the one that is worshiped by the actions of the servants so what is is devoting all forms of worship only to Allah so you worship none other than Allah by your actions rub was different I worship none other than Allah by his actions so I would not say it is this uh uh Idol that brings me risk I would not say it is the stars and the zodiacs that put or send the rain I would not say it is this priest who knows the Future these are only for Allah to know these are only Allah's actions R is me what worshiping Allah such as my prayer My fasting my R I cannot make R to a human being she in Tokyo they do this in Japan this is Haram a Muslim does not bow to a king or to a priest or to a statue or to a flag these are all parts of worship only devoted to Allah so you have to worship Allah with your heart with what you say and with what you act upon even the heart has forms of worship fear hope love dependence on Allah seeking Refuge this can only be attributed to Allah if you attribute it to someone else then then you become a mushk meaning that if you go and say Subhan Allah this physician is an excellent physician why he saved my son my son was about to die but he saved him you say say Allah saved him so no he saved him he's a doctor this is shik he went out of the fold of Islam because his heart is not connected to Allah is connected to this individual and Allah said in so many ayat that you should only worship Him Allah has declared that you must not worship other than him so any form of worship whether it is by heart or by rhetoric or by action can be only devoted to Allah this form of is the issue of dispute Among Us Muslims and the other religions when the prophet came to sallallahu alaihi wasallam to the idol worshippers of quray they knew that Allah was the creator yes they knew that Allah was the facilitator the one who gives Reign the one who provides everything they say Allah Allah Allah so what is the problem almost they're Muslims you see yes but when he told them you should only pray to Allah you should only sacrifice to Allah you should only fear Allah you should only make Dua to Allah they said no this we cannot give you and that's why they fought him and that is why the people of all Messengers of Allah fought with them because of this issue of and Allah says and and we did not send any messenger before you Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam but we inspired him saying so worship which is none has the right to be worshiped but Allah so worship me alone and none else now Allah identifies to us that there are other Gods who are being worshiped at the same time but he says subhanahu wa taala in the Quran that is because Allah he is the truth and that which they invoke besides him is falsehood Al is Satan and all other false deities and that Allah he is the most high the most great so whoever acknowledges and we have a lot nowadays who do this they say I have a friend who believes in Allah who believes in the Oneness of Allah who believes in all Messengers of Allah okay that's good but he refuses to pray or to accept Islam or to accept that the prophet is the messenger of Allah is he considered to be a Muslim he believes in rub but he does not believe in he does not devote his worship to Allah the almighty as was revealed to the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam in this case he's not a Muslim the third type of is of Allah's beautiful names and attributes and this is a very very long topic but in short it is to worship Allah through his beautiful names so you acknowledge and believe that Allah is all hearing that Allah is all seeing when you are in your room and nobody's watching and you take your stupid phone excuse me your smartphone and you browse and you go through Haram websites watch Haram Clips listen to Haram music and you know Allah is watching you and you know Allah is hearing you but because your belief in this is so fragile you you seem to neglect this fact or ignore it or forget it which means that youred is not solid is not real and this is based on two things to affirm Allah's names and attributes and where do we get Allah's names and attributes from where do we get Allah's beautiful names and attributes only from the Quran and the Sunnah can someone today come and say mashallah I found a new name for Allah mashallah where did you get this name from I found it in a cave in one of the islands said go to bed and sleep early and try to skip dinner so that you won't have any nightmares because this is not a name of Allah the names of Allah comes only from the Quran and from the prophet Alat wasam not even the companions can give us names of Allah and attributes because they don't have any Revelation and the second foundation so you have to affirm the names and and attributes of Allah through Quran and Sunnah the second is to negate anything that is a deficiency a defect anything that that is disgracing or degrading or not befitting of Allah anything that does not befit Allah you have to stop so with these two foundations these two pillars if you have strong belief in them you have inshallah [Music] full and to believe Allah's beautiful names and attributes this has to be without any Distortion what is the me the meaning of distortion the meaning of a word you manipulate it and give it a different meanings that the Arabs don't know of this cannot be we have to believe in it as it is so the word isawa some of the Deviant sects made the meaning of it into to conquer and this is wrong you are manipulating and distorting the meaning also you have to believe in the meaning of the beautiful names and attributes without twisting without false interpretation so you say Allah like in the Quran how did Allah create Adam with his with his hands so Allah has a hand we have to believe in this and Allah has two hands we believe this it is mentioned in the Quran it is mentioned in the Sunnah some people come say no no no this is not be fitting Allah does not have hands now you want me to say that the Quran is not true Allah says in the Quran to Shan oh Shan oh Allah says what prevents prevented you from prostrating to what I have created with my two hands Shan said I'm better than him him you created me from fire and created him from clay Shan believes better than us he didn't say oh no no excuse me Allah you don't have two hands he didn't say that because he believes in that he has strong in this but he has lousy in this is why he's a cafir so what does mean in Practical life okay beautiful sermon she now we know is divided into three types then what where do we go from here you have to know the importance ofed in your life and you have to see and find out am I implementing it or it's just talk because if it's just talk Allah will punish you on the the day of judgment this is what the Hypocrites used to do when the Hypocrites come to the prophet they say we believe and we believe that you are the messenger of Allah Allah says Allah believes that Allah testifies that they are liars you are the messenger of Allah but they are lying so a hypocrite says what does what he does not believe in so let us look at some of the importance of in our lives first of all is so important because you have to believe you have to have the conviction that Allah did not create you to play around Allah did not create you to swim like a fish or to eat like an animal or to mate and have children or to have a house or to go to school Allah did not create you for this this is a byproduct Allah created you to worship worship Him part of worshiping Allah is to get married is to have children is to invest in your Society is to uplift your community is to give Daw is to play sports is to enjoy life but it's always there that I may die tonight and I might I may die after 10 years each way I am worshiping Allah Asel and when death comes I'm ready so if you're doing this then you are worshiping Allah as you're supposed to and you are fulfilling the concept ofed part of the concept ofed is that no messenger was sent and no book was revealed except to establish but we are diverting a little bit by little from the main objective which is do we live oned brothers and sisters seriously do we live fored is what drives us I have a choice right or left let me think no what does your say this is what you have to apply my wife wants me to do this and that what does Allah want you to do ah what what what what do I do if I don't listen to her she's going to my head off until I die so maybe Allah will put me in hell for one day or two day but here hell is five 5 10 years 20 years I've been married for 30 years and she's not willing to die people are diverting from they're losing their track so if you know that Allah revealed his books Torah injil zabor and the Quran to guide the people to the people are not implementing it in their lives they have a problem Allah gave us the Glad Tiding that with all of your sins are forgiven a brother called me from UK this morning complaining about the sins he is repeatedly falling in and he's only 20 years of age and he's complaining and feeling that he is going to kuur though he is a of Quran almost maybe 3 four months and he will complete of the Quran he used to be a practicing Muslim 20 years because of his ignorance of what is he's giving up he's feeling despaired Allah says in the oh son of Adam if you come to me with bags filled with sins all of the whole earth filled with bags of sins but you come to me without associating other with me and you come with right and correct I will forgive them all now if you know Allah's beautiful name alur the most forgiving or the other beautiful name Al far the frequently most forgiving then you know who you're dealing with so when you fall and stumble you rise up again and walk with your head up high knowing that you have a lord who forgives the sins we are all humans we make mistakes we're not perfect each and every one of us has tons of mistakes the problem is where are you at at the moment are you at the shore or are you in the middle of the ocean every time I come to Malik my hand is on my heart I'm not a good swimmer and it's a long distance about 10 15 minutes and I keep thinking if the boat sinks and it's night and there are sharks my escort says no no no sharks and malds are very friendly she yeah if I see one I'm going to kiss him what do you mean sharks are friend friendly you have problem with dentists they don't have teeth they're sharks so I keep on thinking Ya Allah I have so many sins Don't Let Me Drown now once I reach the shores I forget and I only remember when I go back again to the Sea so now with all of your sins are you in the middle of the ocean or are you at the shore always remember that Allah forgives all of your sins so come to him go to him approach him and Allah does not care about your sins Allah is the wealth and the rich richest of all he doesn't need us we need him he has billions of servants he has trillions of angels He has uncountable number of creatures who worship him alone but we have only one Lord to seek his forgiveness so if you acknowledge Allah if you go to him he will accept you the first thing that you will be asked about in your grave is youred the prophet told usam that when we are in the grave two angels horribly looking they some say their name is they will make you sit in your grave you're dead but this is the life of Barak it's a different life than our life here and they will ask you first of all who's your lord three who's your lord what is your religion and what is or who is your messenger this is they would ask you about if you succeed in answer you pass the exam alhamdulillah and what dictates the answer your life in this world what did you live on oh I lived on party I live on drinking and lived on having fun having relationships not praying on time fasting Ramadan every 20 years I don't know where the is somebody say here somebody says there I'm been living a sh my life I was a very happy man now you know your answer who's your lord huh who's your messenger what is your religion he says all the prophet tells us he says in the grave huh I don't know I saw people saying it I said with them and they will hit him with a stick that is so hard he will turn into dust into salt and then Allah would resurrect him again and they would hit him again and he would shout so loud that every creature on Earth would hear it except the humans and the gin and this is why Scholars say when we have a bad animal who's not ready to Be Tamed we take the animal to the graveyard and keep the animal there at night time in the morning he's fixed he hears all the shouting and all the punishment and torment in the grave the animal that he's frightened so this is something that you should uh uh look into inshallah uh is a precondition for entering Jenna no one will enter Jenna unless he's a Muslim not Muslim the follower of the Prophet Alam because the followers of Jesus at the time of Jesus were Muslims the followers of mosa peace be upon him at the times of Moses were Muslim the followers of ibraim are Muslim Islam is a general terminology to submitting your will to Allah all the followers of Messengers are Muslims but after the message of the Prophet all other religions are cancelled anyone who does not follow Muhammad s alai wasallam will not enter jenah toed brings you happiness in this life Allah says and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared Allah we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the Earth but they denied The Messengers so imagine if the Muslims truly believe truly fulfill Allah says this in the Quran I believe in this that Allah would grant us blessings from the heavens and from the earth and we will be the happiest people on Earth but we don't and this is we why we have calamities is a source of guidance in this dun and a source of security on the Hereafter Allah Asel says they who believe and do not mix their belief with shik or Injustice th those will have security and they are rightly guided the companions when they heard this Ayah they were afraid because they said all of us had Associated some injustice with our belief he said no the injustice intended in this Ayah is devoted only to shik so if you believe in Allah and you don't have any shik you will be guided and you will have the tranquility and the security as well and this Tranquility this guidance comes only to the believer The salaf Used To Say by Allah if the Kings the sons of Kings were to know the happiness and Tranquility we have in our hearts they would fight with us with the swords trying to take it from us andb T says may Allah have mercy on his soul there is on earth a paradise who does not enter it will not enter the Paradise in the heavens where is this paradise this paradise is content is happiness and Tranquility in your heart the believer when anything happens to him he's always saying alhamdulillah the disbelievers or the Believers who have weak Iman why me I visited an old Uncle he was 70 plus years and he was bid readen so I visited him and I said oh Uncle may Allah make it easy for you and forgive your sins inshallah you'll be healthy soon he said my son I have no complaints but I have one question said what he said Subhan Allah my neighbor for 50 years I've never seen him in the Masjid once yet he's as healthy as a bull and he has money and he never gets sick and me I pray five times a day for 50 years and look what is happening to me the man has erased all of his good deeds in one sentence they because he does not have he does not have content he's complaining he's objecting on Allah why me why are you doing this to me immediately he got out of the fold of Islam by saying this and alhamdulillah I gave him and he died now inshallah to a good death but the problem is when we are ignorant when we don't know how to worship Allah then we have a problem in da what is the first thing you have to call people for shorten your thpes your garments huh make it to the middle of your foot like mine or put a tree in your pocket this is Da or prolong your beard all of this is Sunnah all of this is good but is it the first thing that we have to call people for no the prophet when he sent mu to Yemen and they were Christians he said Let It Be the first thing you call them to is to make to believe in the Oneness of Allah who has no associate who has no Offspring and who has no father so this is the first thing that we have to give da to people to purify our IM and to try to clarify to them the concept of now I believe that the time is running out uh where do we get from I've answered this question before from the Quran and from the Sunnah why do we emphasize on Quran and Sunnah Quran and Sunnah because if you open any TV station other than peace TV or Huda TV not because I come there but these are the two stations that you can learn your religion from properly on actual there's no hanky panky there's no shik there is no uh uh uh anything that you associate with Allah other than that if you open other stations worldwide you will find a Manana and he's calling people to other than with his intellect where is this in the Quran where is this in the Sunnah no no no I have direct link mashallah DSL or Wi-Fi or what what direct link we have only Quran and sunah no no no my heart always tells me about my Allah I get Revelation mallah this is deviant put him in the garbage he's not good stay away from him so it is important to know that you do not learned except from the Quran and from the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam of course from the scholars who tell you this is the evidence you come to me and say she where did you get that Allah has two hands I'll show you from the Quran in Arabic if you don't know Arabic you go into the translation I'll show you to it from the Sunnah I'll show it to you from the consensus of all Scholars of and you will believe other than that we have to also acknowledge that Allah and his messenger protected when you have valuable things what do you do with them we don't have any valuable things under the mess under you know the the the the pillow where you have expensive things where do you put them usually you put them in a safe right so that no one can come if you have big things you build a fence sometimes you build a double fence and a third fence and security cameras and dogs and bodyguards if you look ated you will find that the the that Islam protected even in verbal things things that you may not pay attention to Islam protected in your heart Islam protected in your acts so in verbal things Allah prohibited that you swear by other than him in Arabic our brothers in Egypt for example they would say wnbi what is wnbi I swear by the Prophet this is shik in Syria they would swear by sh AB or ABI by the head of my father or the honor of my father in Saudi we would swear by by your honesty I'm asking you is this true by your honesty all of this is shik the prophet said whoever swears other than Allah has committed an act of shik the Prophet has prohibited us from praying let me finish the sentence huh people will say alhamdulillah tomorrow no the she said the prophet prohibited us from F I didn't say that let me finish the prophet prohibited us from praying in the graveyard if I go to a cemetery a graveyard and it's time I'd like to pray your prayer is invalid unaccepted why I'm praying to Allah yes but the Place may lead in the future for someone to pray for the grave and this is why Islam protects this is one of the big walls and it's well known in Islam that you your your prayer is unaccepted in a graveyard at all except one prayer that is what huh funeral prayer because funeral prayer prayer does not have any R nor so if you go to a a grave of a friend of a relative you did not offer Sal Jan it is permissible to stand next to the grave and say four times allahar and perform the janaz no problem but to pray any F any voluntary prayer totally prohibited the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam prohibited us from praying after F until the sun rises and after until the sun sets why I'm praying to Allah he said yes but this is the time when the idol worshippers pray and Shan is at the sun when it sets and Rises so whenever you pray he is camouflaging it and telling look at this Muslim he's praying to me it is prohibited to prostrate to other than Allah a lot of the people who play martial arts you know Judo karate they bow to each other and they say we have to this is part of the sports it's Haram bowing cannot be to Allah she yes I know but I'm not doing it to worship my Sensei or my master or my trainer no I'm doing it haram is Haram when mu came from Yemen after he was sent with the from the prophet the minute he entered he made sujud he performed sujud to the prophet the prophet am got angry mu what are you doing what is this suud he said oh prophet of Allah in Yemen I found the people prostrating to their elders and to their priests and Kings so I wanted to honor you the prophet saidat if I were to order someone to prostrate to someone I would have ordered the women to prostrate to their husbands now take these husbands and go back home and say listen woman this is what the prophet saidham yes it is a very serious issue when women do not respect do not obey their husbands because the right of a husband is so high if the prophet were to order someone to prostrate he would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband now I would not go into the rights of women because also the rights of the women is so great so sisters if your husband tells you what I had just told you tell him the prophet said the best of you men are the best to your wives so if he's not the best to you in this fashion then he is a fake this is not our topic also the prophet Alam prohibited us from making statues from drawing pictures what's wrong in that they call it now modern art art is beautiful does Islam hate art no it doesn't Islam hates sins and this is what caused the people of n to commit shik by building statues over the graves of righteous people after one generation the new generation came and saw the statues I don't know why they build statues but probably because these are the one who cause rain to fall down so they worship them these are the five righteous people and they are the idols that the people worshiped after so many times finally to conclude to those who are still awake because I know that half of you are asleep mallah but they you sleep like the wolf with eyes open um to those who are still awake is the most important thing in life I'm not joking if you fail to teach your children and your wife and yourself though you have a big beautiful PhD and a diploma and uh uh MBA and whatever all of this is worthless the prophet told usam that the Jews have divided into 71 sect and the Christians have divided into 72 sects and my will be divided into 73 sects all of them are in Hell except one so the companion said oh prophet of Allah which one are you talking about he says whoever is on my path and the path of my companions may Allah be pleased with them soed is the only thing that combines and joins us without you will fail fail the route to Paradise you will fail the road to Paradise 72 are in hell are they the H are they the Hani who put their hands in prayer are they the shaf who do this are they the one who do no these are all issues they're not part of the 72 or 73 the issue that divides them is the so you can be a Hani you can be a shaf you can can be a Maliki you can be a h this has nothing to do with the 73 or the 72 sects what has to do with it is do you believe in Allah's beautiful names and attributes or you distort them or you twist them or you deny them do you believe that only Allah is worthy of being worshiped or you say yes but I have to depend on my uh uh doctor to cure my illness cure can only only come from a good doctor not I'll conclude with this story IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him he's the cousin of the Prophet Alat wasam and he is one of the greatest uh um Scholars of Islam he said about a scenario I have a house and there's a neighbor of mine who has a duck you know a duck the bird qu quack quack alhamdulillah I hate illustra when I'm doing but sometimes people don't know Ducks so he said no problem he said that the one talking about himself IB Abbas says whoever says that had it not been to my neighbor's duck the burglar would have broken into my home and stole the the things what happened a burglar came last night wanted to break into my home but then the duck started quacking making sounds the burglar was afraid and he ran away so I woke up and I said oh if it weren't for this duck I would have been robbed IB Abbas says may Allah be pleased whoever says something like this he has committed shik this is very serious I worked in management for a very long time corporate management alhamdulillah but now I lazy and retired so I don't think about it anymore I'm enjoying life in management so many times you see managers you see general managers you see CEOs you see businessmen attributing the favors and blessings of Allah to their own so you get the CEO
