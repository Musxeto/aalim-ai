  "transcript": "Sana from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I wanted to ask a very important issue that concerns me a lot So I came to France from Afghanistan to pursue my master's degree given the current situation for women in Afghanistan Like where we are not allowed to work or travel freely or move So I sometimes feel inclined to stay here. I mean in France However, when I reflect on the Akhira and the reality of death I feel that this life holds on no real benefit for me, especially in non-Muslim countries So this often leads me to accept the situation in Afghanistan and decide to return regardless of the political or financial Challenges that I will face there. So what do you recommend to do? Like I should do in this situation also and what's the ruling of for Muslims who live in non-Muslim countries? I really wanted to discuss this issue with you in a consulting session But given the fact that I'm a student and I cannot afford it. So I brought it here first of all the Prophet alaihissalatu wassalam Prohibited the Muslims from living permanently among the disbelievers in their countries and He encouraged us as mentioned in the Quran or also in the authentic Sunnah to migrate and be among the Muslims Of course Muslim countries are not all alike Some Muslim countries the Muslims themselves are oppressed either due to political regimes or to their misunderstanding of the Sharia or extreme Extremism as simple as that So and this is rare Unfortunately, unfortunately, alhamdulillah. This is rare However, the vast majority of Muslim countries the amount of tolerance is there a Person can eat halal food. Here's the Adhan Attend Salat in the masjid practice his religion without any fear and without any problem. So it is ideal for a Muslim to run with his religion with his Iman with his chastity as Soon as possible now if a person has a legitimate reason to stay in such a kafir country for example to pursue studies that cannot be pursued elsewhere or To make money through investing or working where he could not do that or for medical Purposes and seeking treatment or for dawah People go there to make dawah to Allah Azza wa Jal and teach people Islam in these cases if you're staying there for a limited period of time and There is no danger on your chastity you have Righteousness and fear of Allah that you won't fall into haram in addition to there is no fitna in your own religion you're not prone to doubts and whispers of missionaries and The likes in this case this is permissible and you have to leave as soon as your Errand is over and Allah knows best"
