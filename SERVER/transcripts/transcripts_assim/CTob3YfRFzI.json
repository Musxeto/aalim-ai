  "transcript": "Aban from syag there is this sect in my country and a portion of them says that their IM or leader Exempted them from praying and fasting so I was wondering what is the ruling on them and the IM who expect who Exempted them from it anyone who changes the fundamentals of Islam is a disbeliever cfer and anyone who follows such exemptions is a disbeliever cfir so when someone comes and says alhamdulillah five daily pray prayers no more says who well says my Sheikh my Imam he said you're Exempted all you have to do is pay $5,000 and alhamdulillah you don't have to to pray for life that's cool I'll pay $10,000 if he can take Ramadan as well said done whoa I got a bargain this is kufur this is apostasy this is changing the religion anyone who takes anything of the ESS essence of Islam pillars of Islam pillars of Iman anyone who says I don't believe in the day of judgment but I pray and I fast and I go for Hajj I give charity I'm a good person you're a cafir you're an apostate anyone who says well 114 chapters of the Quran I think they are 112 I don't believe in two chapters you're a cafir I think there's a chapter missing in the Quran by the name of chapter of Ali you're a cfir regardless of what you do Islam is not a charity organization that collects garbage like you and your Sheikh Islam is defined Quran is Pres preserved for 15th centuries unchanged not a single letter the Sunnah is preserved the whole religion is preserved because it's Allah's religion you come and change it you leave it"
