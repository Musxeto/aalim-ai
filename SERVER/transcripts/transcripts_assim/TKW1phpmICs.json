  "transcript": "a brother says what is tower rook position and if the rush is it the same for both men and women the answer for the second question is yes it is the same for both men and women but what is the Warrick and what is if to rush these are two ways of sitting during prayer generally speaking throughout the prayer whenever you sit down on the floor whether it's between the two tashahud let me rephrase that whether it is between the two sujood or in the first asha hood you always sit in if t rush what as if cherish means it is sitting on your left foot with your right foot erect so I put my buttock sitting on my left foot this is called if Josh and it's done throughout the whole prayer the word Rock is only done in the last - ah hood when the prayer itself has - tisha hood the first one and the last one as in the case of a sir Margaret risha and the hole so what is the word Rock The Rock is sitting on your work and it is sitting on your left buttock straight to the ground so if tirage I was sitting on my left foot now I'm sitting straight to the ground with my left foot underneath my right leg so it comes out like this and my right leg is erect with the toes as much as possible pointing to the Qibla this is the Sunnah now if someone is finding it difficult it's painful it's this or that it is okay to sit in any fashion you want but the Sunnah of the Prophet SM was to sit in this way"
