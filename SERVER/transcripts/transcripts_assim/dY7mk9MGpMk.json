  "title": "Can a woman travel alone if there is a great need",
  "transcript": "Our first caller is Sister Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. If there is a great need or generally speaking a good reason for traveling, can a woman use her non-Muslim mahram who is trustworthy for traveling? I did not get your question. So can a sister who has a great need for traveling use her non-Muslim mahram for traveling? So someone who is oppressed in her religion and fears fitna or on her honor and chastity, someone who is in great danger, if she does not travel she may fall sick and ill and die and she needs medical attention, she has to travel. and there is no one to accompany her but if she stays, the evil of staying is far greater than the evil of traveling without a mahram, then it is permissible to travel. She should try to travel with a trustworthy women companion to reduce any evil that may happen and Allah knows best. Thank you for watching."
