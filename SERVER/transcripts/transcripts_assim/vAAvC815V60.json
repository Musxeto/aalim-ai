  "title": "Have some decency, don't ask indecent questions! Repented from zina, nikah valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is for my sister that states uh me and my husband had Zena and other Haram actions but at the time of Zena we stopped I thought that full penetration did not happen so it was not Z but I considered everything else as Dina and we repented for it before marriage and I said in my prayers that Allah forgive me for the sin we have committed after repentance we still had Haram communication and intimacy but did not commit Z and I did not repent for this but now I came to know even if slightest penetration occurs it is Zena so my previous repentance does my previous repentance counts as repentance from Zena and is my nikah valid because I did did not know at that time that it is Zena but later we still engaged in sinful acts that I used to think were Z and did not repent for them okay first of all seriously as Muslims we do not entertain or we should not entertain such questions on live TV yeah people should have the uh um etiquette the decency to ask privately alhamdulillah the scholars are all over the world and they answer your questions on the phone freely you can go and visit them in the masjids so I see that it is indecent to entertain such questions on live TV like this but this was a mistake probably may Allah forgive you and for your sister the marriage is valid tell her to put a lead on it and not to keep on doubting unless she wants to be divorced if she doesn't want her husband this is a different issue but she must not entertain such doubts and the marriage is valid and she should put a stop to all this nonsense"
