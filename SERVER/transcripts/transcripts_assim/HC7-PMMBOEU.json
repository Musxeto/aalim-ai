  "title": "If parents are sick & I don't have enough money, can I take an interest based loan? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question is uh related to the parents uh duty to the parents and in islam it's very important uh that you're supposed to take care of your parents when they're older and how critical it is like literally you can do everything right but if you don't take care of your parents you can end up in hell um so that's clear to me but the situation for example financially taking care of your parents for example if my mother or father is sick and i don't have enough means to take care of them and they are getting upset with me that i'm not able to give them additional money to take care of them for their medical needs do i borrow the money on interest or do i just apologize what's the best scenario i guess what's the best route in this case okay i will answer inshallah it is without saying that allah says allah does not hold a soul accountable for something that it cannot bear allah would not burden us with such a thing and yes we have to be dutiful to our parents but within reason so if my parents or one of them need medical attention would it be permissible for me if i cannot financially afford it to borrow the answer is yes within limits but if there is no one to lend me except with interest and in this case it is totally prohibited to borrow for such a reason why my father needs a surgery well if you have this surgery performed can you guarantee that he will live no but most likely he would again can you guarantee that he will be recovered most likely yes but in this case no the scholars say that dealing in reba is totally prohibited it's totally haram and for a medical situation there are no guarantees because healing and curing that person or disease is in the hands of allah so you seek the cure and healing from allah azzawajal not through haram means so yes if you can borrow without any haram and it is within reason you have to save your parents you have to try to help them and be dutiful to them but not through haram means allah azza knows best"
