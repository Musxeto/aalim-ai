  "title": "OCD about urine drops | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "second thing which is very important that you block the means that shaytan would come to you so usually if you feel that there is a drop or two coming out after urinating ask yourself do i have you you're in incontinence how do i know sheikh if you are dripping urine 24 hours seven days a week a week it's always dripping dripping no matter what you do this means you have a problem but if you don't you simply have this feeling after urinating performing we'll do one while doing prayer 10 15 minutes after prayer you don't have any feeling until the following prayers then this is a great sign that shaytan is messing up with you what to do when you urinate while sitting just relax don't squeeze yourself don't squeeze your private part don't even do anything just relax and once it stops you pour water on your private part you wash the area without squeezing without contracting your muscles nothing you just pour water on it and sprinkle some water on your underwear so it's a little bit damp a little bit wet once you stand up perform mordor and go to pray if you get the feeling that oops i feel something came out ignore it and convince yourself that this is the dampness the wetness of the water that i had sprinkled if you fight this over and over again in three or four days you will not have this feeling at all it will stop for about a month or two shaytan is giving you a pause and then afterwards he will try again you follow the same process and believe me you will never ever complain from this again inshallah"
