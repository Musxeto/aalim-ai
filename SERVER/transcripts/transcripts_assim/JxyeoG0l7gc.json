  "transcript": "is there any restriction in counting money every day or often what's wrong and getting your wallet and counting your money what is wrong in calculating how much I have in my bank account and whether I can manage to the end of the month before the next paycheck or not there's nothing wrong at in that at all on the contrary to calculate your expenses so that you could have a better grip on them and to manage them more efficiently is a recommended thing it's part of wisdom to be able to manage your daily expenses and monthly expenses so that you are not surprised or shocked to find that oops I've done a mistake I miscalculated it I need to borrow now what seems to be confusing to the questioner is a number of narrations for example be pleased with her said that when the prophet died I had some barley placed on the Shelf so I used to consume so she takes from The Barley she makes bread she cooks she mix food and I used it for a very long time and then I thought whoa this has been too long let me weigh it and see how much it weighs she said the moment I waited it was over a couple of days and it's finished and also in the Hadith when he was handing the prophet Allah some meat from a small goat or sheep so he kept on handing the prophet and the prophet is giving it to his companions and feeding people until the prophet said to him hand me the shoulder or the arm s said how many arms does a sheep have the only two arms and the prophet said uh had you not said this you would have continued to give me meat endlessly but because you said this now it's over the supply of meat will be finished in a third Hadith one of the companions said I asked the prophet Allah from for some help so he gave me some barley like you know an amount or a bag or whatever and my wife and I kept on eating from it for a very long time until I waited to see how much is left and then it was over so this may confuse people thinking that if I open my wallet and count how many dollars or Euros I have this would take away the Baraka and it will run out but if I don't count I'll keep spending and spending and spend this is not true the issue is that was a Karama for mother is or a miracle with the prophet or for the other companions this Karama this gift and blessing from Allah is to indicate that we're looking to whatever Allah has blessed us with with gratitude and looking at it's a blessing from Allah the moment we count it or weigh it this makes our greed kick in and this is when the blessing if any would be gone and it would be like everyone else so there is no problem in calculating or registering your monthly expenses in order to be safe rather than sorry and this has nothing to do with the Baraka as long as your heart is always looking to Allah azzawajal and identifying and confirming that every blessing you have is a gift from the almighty Allah"
