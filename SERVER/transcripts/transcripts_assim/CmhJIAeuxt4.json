  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Last week I have asked you about the mobile accessory shop selling printed packages like Superman and any other human beings and you said that it is not permissible. However, previously I was working in a mobile shop where I stick mostly sticking the screen protectors, but sometimes I may need to sell the printed packages. Once a Imam came to my uncle's shop and told him that we can't sell big teddy bears and keychains due to the images. So I thought it might be permissible to sell the printed things. What's the Islamic ruling and what about the salary and any remedy Sheikh? Whatever was done in the past when you thought it was permissible is halal for you. So don't visit that place any longer. Don't go to the past and start to dig up things from the past. So she tore it into pieces and stuffed it into a pillow. So there were no images anymore. So this is different than what you're talking about and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
