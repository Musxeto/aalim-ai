  "title": "Hating things due to sins and offenses to Allah assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salat. And today, we'll talk about the things he hated. And this is not strange because as human beings, we tend to love and hate. We tend to be pleased and angry. And the Prophet ﷺ is indeed a perfect human being. But when we look at the things he hated, it was not for personal reasons. It was not for his own ego, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, as we know that he was the most humble person on earth. Rather, the things he hated were attributed to being sins and things that offended Allah Azza Wa Jal. And that is why he had this hate to them. So, let us look through some of the things that the Prophet ﷺ hated and learn from these things."
