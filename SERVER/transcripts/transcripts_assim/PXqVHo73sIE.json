  "title": "If the next athaan is called while performing a prayer, will that prayer be valid? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "zeyneb says a few months ago I would sometimes pray some prayers 10 minutes before the next prayer or before midnight in the case of Risha and then the Adhan for the next prayer would go while I had one raka or in the tisha hood are these prayers valid this question has two parts is what zeyneb doing correct and are the prayers valid or not as whether it's correct or not to delay the prayers till this extent definitely this is not correct in the hadith above the live in my suit may Allah be pleased with him as an ascender so he he said I asked the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which deeds are most beloved to allah azza wajal a straightforward question so the Prophet said alayhi salaatu Sam in the first choice and first reply he said to pray on time Ocelot wala wok Teja and in another narration he said to pray at the beginning of the time a Saleh to a warlock Teja this indicates that the quicker you are to pray the better phoronix with an exception of two prayers the first prayer is Lord in summer when it is burning hot the Prophet told the Salah salatu salam in order to ease it for his companions who come and attend the salat in the masjid he said delay it until it cools down and scholars say that delaying it until before our time is best for the Companions because it's too hot nowadays women in their homes should pray at the beginning of the time because whether it's in the beginning or at the end the temperature is the same in their homes with the air conditionings now alhamdulillah we don't have to delay it until it cools down because it's already cool in the message with the air conditionings number two salat Elisha the prayer of Aisha because the Prophet told us at Aslam it is best to delay it until the first third of the night has gone so approximately we're talking about 10:30 p.m. approximately give or take to 11 and this is for women who pray at homes but for those who pray in congregation this is not applicable because most people pray 15 minutes after the event of Asia maximum of 20 minutes other than that pray the prayer at the very beginning of the time just after the Methvin gives the Adhan give 10 minutes 15 minutes for sunnah prayer and to get prepared and then call for the prayer now delaying it just before the time ends is dangerous and not only that it is a sign of hypocrisy the Prophet told the Salian salat wa sallam that the prayer of a hypocrite in subhanAllah a hypocrite we know that he is evil and that he's in Hell yet they pretend to pray where actually they have their intent is corrupt they lack sincerity and as a sign of that they pray on their own but they choose to pray just right before the time ends in case of a sir just right before the Sun sets so the prophets tells us that they sit idle they do not pray as a prayer until they see that the Sun is just about to sit the Sun is just about to set they go and pray it in a very fast fashion like when the roaster takes a grain from the ground they just do this as sujood this is what the Prophet tells us that is a lot of Sun so it is very dangerous now coming back to the validity of salat is it valid or not the Prophet told us Allah Allah - sir whoever offers one raka which is a complete raka before the Sun sets he had prayed in the right time so if you finished one full unit of a sir and while you were in the second unit reciting for example the fatiha the Sun had completely set your prayer is valid but if you began your prayer and you did not finish a full Recker a full unit and the Sun had set this prayer was not performed on time therefore zeyneb you should be very careful and you should ask Allah for forgiveness because what you had done in the past is extremely wrong and dangerous the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam by the way whenever he was among his companions he used to say an address Bilal and banal was the one appointed to call for the prayer so he used to say Bilal are a Nabi ha Oh Bilal comfort us with prayers call for the prayer so the profit viewed prayers as a comfort to the soul nowadays we are hastened to pray not as a form of comfort rather as a form of relief so instead of saying Oh Bilal comfort us with it we say Oh Bilal relieve us from it quickly come on let's get it over with we just want to take the burden off our shoulders and this shows you the difference between them and us you"
