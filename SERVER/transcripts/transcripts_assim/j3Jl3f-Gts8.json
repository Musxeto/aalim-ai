  "transcript": "decorating the house getting ready for Ramadan posters for kids maybe puzzles games this kind of stuff is this allowed to get them in the mood for Ramadan okay it's it's a cultural thing now we have to differentiate between culture and religion if it's if it were to be something in connection with the religion it's an innovation but if it's something that is connected with the culture then it's okay personally we don't do this I'm talking about myself and my family we don't do this we do this for the eight so on the night of eight we put decorations and balloons and so on we're happy we're joyful it's a an occasion of celebration now for you if you want to do this for your kids posters cards and so on just to put them in the mood and to put in them that this is a month to be celebrated and to direct them to prayer fasting and accepting the this month to be the month of patience I think that this is okay but to connect with this month these lanterns and so on that and think that this is only for Ramadan well this is part of custom part of religion for me I think especially for a sister coming from the West and trying to up bring her children in the same way that she was brought up I think it's okay providing that she doesn't tell them that it is part of the religion to have these posters and cards and so on just like Latasha for this beneficial advice"
