  "title": "If I attend a Mixed Marriage Function with no segregation hall am I Sinful? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh I live in a non-Muslim majority area and we have a functional here. Most of the marriages that take place are non-Muslim marriages so we made it, we did not make any segregation hall. So are we sinning? Are you participating? Yes. No you are sinning. As a Muslim there are red lines that you cannot cross. So if the marriage celebration is of Muslims then there is no excuse. This is not something that's mandatory. Make it segregated. Throw a party for women only. No men attending. Or throw a party for men only. No women attending. But to have them freely mixed and saying that this is the only hall we have, no this is not permissible at all. If it is of a non-Muslim throwing a party, a wedding party, and it's freely mixed, don't attend. It's not permissible for you to attend. So I hope this answers your question."
