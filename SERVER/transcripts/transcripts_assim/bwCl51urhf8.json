  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh, Sheikh there is this influencer, I don't know if I should take his name or not, is it ok if I take his name? Nope. Ok so there is this influencer, he launched a meme coin and trading it's related to trading and stuff, he launched a meme coin and he gives us signals whether to buy and then he pumps the coin and then everyone makes money and stuff, so it's big risk and big reward, so I was wondering if it's halal to invest in that? No, no Akhi, it is not halal to invest on such coins and I've said this like 4-5 years ago about cryptocurrency and Bitcoin and the likes, so stay safe, avoid these influencers because they don't care about you, they care about fame, they care about money, they care about how many views they've got, how many likes, some so-called Islamic influencers or da'ees or the likes, Akhi they go out of their way and it is repulsive, the material that they publish and the views that they air just to get people to speak about them, they're controversial, they don't care whether this pleases Allah or not, all what they care about is hmm, if I say this or that, would that stir the pot? Would I get many views and people would forward what I say? What do you need with such trash? Focus on those who get you closer to Allah, avoid those who want recognition and fame, avoid those who ask hmm, what do you guys want to listen to today? I've got a whole different menu for you. No, look for those who would help you get closer to Allah, to improve your life, to better your Islam rather than to follow those who just are interested in how many followers do I have, how many likes do I have, may Allah protect us all."
