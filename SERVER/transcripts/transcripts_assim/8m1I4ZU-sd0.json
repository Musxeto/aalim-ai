  "transcript": "does the deceased the one in the grave hear what we say to him when we visit the cemetery the answer is it's an issue of dispute the most authentic is that he can only hear the salaam or someone relays the salaam to him but he doesn't hear anything else so if you tell him well your son passed the exams and masha'allah we bought him his new first new car and he was so happy i wish you can see the pictures i'll try to email them to all of this he does not hear it as allah says you will not be able to make those in the graves here whether literally or to be guided but what you tell them as they will not benefit muhammad"
