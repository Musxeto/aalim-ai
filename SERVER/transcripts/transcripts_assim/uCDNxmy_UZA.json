  "transcript": "question is related to raising hands and making dua between athan and i understand that it is from the sunnah in my place after isha athan people individually pray for akka in the mosque i pray only to raka so i normally finish my prayer before theirs and when i raise my hands to make dua few seconds later the other people around me finish their prayer of for aka as well and the wedding will do some loud recitation as an innovation and then he will say al-fatiha and everybody recites al-fatiha silently on their own and they also raise their hands while doing that if somebody enters the mosque at that time they would see me having my hands risen just like those other people around me who are innovating and the person who enters the mosque would have the impression that i was involved in those innovations too but in fact all i was doing was making my own dua between athan and ikama my question is should i not care about this or should i stop making my dua before they raise their hands for reciting al-fatiha if you are recognized and known among your people to be imam hamza then maybe you should not do that so if you recognize to be a celebrity a well-known practicing salafi upon the sunnah imam then you may fear that people would see you and then they will think that this is sunnah but if you're one in a thousand if you're a drop in an ocean and nobody knows who you are and everybody's raising their hands in their innovation and you're doing it for the sake of allah and for the sunnah who cares so don't pay any attention to these thoughts unfortunately this is prevailing in turkey in albania and bosnia in macedonia in where people have taken these customs these well innovations from turkey and elsewhere maybe other beijing i don't know the issue before fajr they give uh nasheed in the microphones and praising the prophet islam italkursi i want to pray i want to read the quran what are you doing shut the microphone off sit down and and shut up but the guy keeps on saying beautiful uh anashid or quran and all of this is innovation what are you doing you're innovating in the religion of islam anyone who looks at you says this is not islam oh yes he's recently reading quran show me in the quran or in the sunnah or in the doing of the companions or the tabernae or in that they used to do these practices no they did not do it but it's a good thing subhanallah you know more than them you're more righteous than the prophet sallam said no for allah then you are innovating in the religion and whatever innovation you're doing is rejected allah will not accept it allah will punish you for it sheikh i'm reciting the quran allah will punish me for that yes if you recite it in the toilet allah will punish you for that what are you doing this is all innovation you are creating this is part of today's program the basics you are going out of the basics you're innovating in the religion of allah and allah would not accept that from you so achi hamza going back to your question if you're not a well-known imam there ignore it and keep on doing your job"
