  "transcript": "Peace and from Jordan. Sheikh, I had a problem with my manager. I am a teacher in a school. My manager refused to advise the student to follow the religion. And I tried to do so, then she did something very very harmful to me. She tried to let other students talk about me in a very very bad manner and tried to talk about me something that didn't happen or I didn't do that thing. She tried to talk about me that I don't have a mind and I tried to do something wrong to the student's girl. So I think you understood me, Sheikh. How old are the children? The children are in the seventh grade, so they are adults. Eight years old? Yes, they are adults. Second grade? No, no, seventh. Seventh grade. Okay, so I get your question. First of all, free mixing when the children are in the seventh grade, this is preposterous Islamically. Even if they are in the sixth grade, this is too much. These are grown up boys and girls. When you put fuel next to the fire and say, Inshallah, nothing will happen, you are insane. There is something wrong in you or you are deviant. You want something wrong to happen. At this age, when they are in the seventh grade, this is something that is not heard of. Unfortunately, for you as a teacher, you have no control to segregate such a class. This is the responsibility of the authority. And my advice to you is not to teach such boys at that age and not to endorse being in such a place. And this headmaster or school manager, whatever you call them, is definitely sinful for making up such lies against you and plotting against you and telling the students to lie and formulate lies about you saying that you are insane, that you are extremist, that you intend harm to the girls. Nevertheless, this is what anyone on the straight path must face. The enemies of Islam, the enemies of Allah, it's a habit of theirs to attack the believers and those who are on the straight path. Therefore, you have to be tolerant and you have to be patient and ask Allah for compensation. But my advice to you is definitely to leave such a job."
