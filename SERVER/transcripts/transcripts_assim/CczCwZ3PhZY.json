  "transcript": "Filip from Brazil Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I became a Muslim last year so I have a lot to learn Alhamdulillah And researching I found two affirmations that First, we received an option to come to this world or not And second, when we die, all of us will have 33 years old So my question is, when we die, we will have only the memories and learnings That we gained this life or we have some extra memories before life for example Because we received an option, right? I don't understand your second question. The first question, were we given the choice Before coming to this world? The answer is no I don't recall any choice given to me And if I were given the choice, I would not have chosen But this is not something we can pick and choose No one can say that, yeah I was given the choice and I took it And another says, no I didn't, I said I don't want to come but I was forced to come So I don't know anything that states that we were given the choice Maybe our father was given the choice, I don't know So to my recollection or knowledge, no we were not given the choice We were told to worship Allah and this is in our fitrah Your second question is regarding 33 years of age, I could not understand But in paradise, we will all be of the age of 33 So those who died 100 years of age will be resurrected as youngsters In the age of the youth, 33 years of age Will they have recollection of the dunya? Yes they do They know the people who they were with and those who oppressed them And those who were kind to them But this would not have any impact on their enjoyment in paradise Because all hatred and grudges would be taken from their chests and thrown away Cleansed and they would have good time in paradise for eternity And Allah knows best"
