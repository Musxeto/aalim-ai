  "transcript": "Al [Music] it is a blessed night indeed that Allah has favored me to be among you in this blessed Masid for all praise be to Allah who facilitated it because with our own powers and strength this would not have been possible our topic is how to reach the peak of Iman and IM is very essential and when we talk about IM we don't mean that it is the six pillars of Iman mentioned in the Hadith of jel peace be upon him which you all know we talk about IM in general the Iman that increases and decreases and we will get into this point because there are sects and Cults in Islam or claiming to be from Islam that claim that Iman does not increase nor decrease it's a whole package deal but we when we look at ourselves we see our Iman fluctuating going up and going down some days you wake up in the morning and you feel that I can make a difference in this whole world and sometimes we wake up in the morning doubting are we Hypocrites or not we look at our prayers sometimes we are so happy if someone gives us a million din we would not take it in exchange for the happiness we find in our souls of one prayer and sometimes we pray for days without end and we don't feel any Taste of this so what is happening what is happening is that we are in this life to be tested Allah says in the beginning of do people think that they will be let alone to say and claim we believe our IM is high without them being tested this is not the fact they will be tested and Allah would know those who are saying the truth through their claims and those who are liars therefore it is extremely essential to work hard on our IM now to work hard on our Iman does not mean at all that we have to do something out of the ordinary on the contrary Islam is how to build your IM Islam is based on how to increase your IM and does Iman increase and decrease yes it does and there's no doubt among who defer the and the both are opposite sides totally how is that say that no matter what sins you do your IM is intact and those Sinners those fornicators those who consume intoxicant and deal with riba and do heinous things their IM is equal to the IM of Abu Bakr and Omar how is that they say because Iman is a package deal it's full it's either there or it is not there and it cannot be not there unless you commit sh and kuur but do whatever you want I remember about 15 years ago I saw a program on Dubai TV there was this shh and he was communicating with the youth and he was listening to what they had to confess some of them were saying I'm sinful I have a girlfriend another one is saying I have a boyfriend and the third one says I don't pray on time the fourth says well I have disobeyed my parents and we're going to help and then he commence he said all what you have said is rubbish and I don't like to hear this beard is quite big I wish that they got knowledge measured by the length and the the the the size of the beard I would have been a great scholar in Islam anyhow so he said listen either you are not sinful and Allah would admit you to Jenna or you are sinful and Allah would admit you to Jen with his forgiveness and if you have sins and Good Deeds they're equal Allah will admit you to jenah with the intercession of the Prophet so do whatever you want what kind of a religion is this if you open the door and tell the people that whether you're sinful or righteous you will enter Jenna what are we doing in the Masjid my friends it's a Saturday night or is it Friday Friday night we should go to a disco or nightclub and you know get wasted and then enter after this is the wrong concept of religion now this is on the Other Extreme there is the and the say if you make any major in your C so if you lie you're C you steal you're cff you're for ever in Hell give us a chance said no chance at all why and they give you quotes from the Quran which they misunderstood and they neglect the rest of the Quran which they do not want to understand so they're fixed so why are you doing this because IM is a bulk if you commit a major sin this means the whole IM is not there and you're a c followed the same footsteps in in in in the Hereafter not in the dun in the D they say you are in a place between the two not a not a c but in on the day of judgment you're in Hell forever so it's the same conclusion see this is the benefit of being a follower of everybody claims nowadays is from who are they so that we can travel to there are anyone in this world who follow the Quran theah with the understanding of the three favored and blessed generations of Islam so you don't understand the Quran because it looks nice I think this is the interpretation of the Ayah how do you know has anyone from the previous uh uh uh predecessors Rous predecessors ever said this no but I think it's good you think it's good whatever so through this we follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the companions generation one generation two the generation number three why do we follow them because the prophet himself told us that the best of generations ever to pass on this Earth the best of generations are my my generation and the generation that follows and the generation that follows he told us this so someone comes after 1,000 years and says I think there has been a mistake why say is to is four is four is four only is three let's add one and make it all even what are you doing he said it's not mentioned in the Quran how many so I'm doing you are deviant and you going to hell because you've changed the religion of Allah so what does think and believe about IM they say it increases and decreases how they say it increases with good deeds and decreases with sins can you give us examples Allah mentioned so many places in the Quran but I'll give you one Ayah Allah said and whenever a Surah is revealed there are among the Hypocrites those who say which of you has this increased Faith as for those who believed it has increased them in faith while they are rejoicing the Believers suras of the Quran increase their faith and Iman also the prophet saidat in the wellknown Hadith that belief or Iman is 70 plus branches the highest of these branches are or is and the lowest is removing harmful objects from people's way and bashfulness or shyness is a branch of IM what does it mean the highest the lowest means that there are categories of Iman branches and if you follow little your IM is little if you follow all your IM is at its peak and you are at the fullest and also the prophet told us that Iman wor wears off Iman is worn off it it disappears like a a or a piece of cloth that loses color that wears off you know when you have a colored cloth and you wash it frequently after 6 s minutes the color Fades out so Iman in your heart has the same problem so what to do the prophet says ask Allah to renew IM in your hearts and we have a problem as such because we work hard on our bank accounts ask Allah to increase your bank account we work hard on our healths and bodies ask Allah to increase the size of your biceps and the amount of uh bench press you can work out we have problem with the number of wives ask Allah to increase your wives and you get spank from your wife don't ask Allah for that it was reported that a man was calling for a friend of his who is not married say may Allah Grant my friend so and so a righteous wife and he got a punch from his wife said what do you do he said I know what your intention is you know that there's an angel saying and for you as well and so you ask subh Allah sometimes wives are like this sometimes not all the time a word of advice don't ever mention any Dua for a stranger for a CAF about marrying a second wife or even a first wife just to be safe so ask Allah to renew IM in your heart this is one of the ways of increasing your IM the companions themselves used to sit with one another Omar may Allah please with him used to tell his companions come let us increase in IMB he used to also say the same and he used to often ask Allah in his Dua oh Allah increase in my IM and in my knowledge so they're asking Allah for this now seriously do we do this no because we take our IM for granted we think that we have inherited it and nothing can divert us from our IM while the facts show that so many Muslims are falling into Haram they're losing their IM and a small percentage of them are abandoning Islam alog together those atheists those which very small minority but it is there so do not take this for granted because it is scary Iman has sweetness it has a taste when you eat honey you find the sweetness of Honey the prophet said he has tasted the sweetness of a man who accepts and who is satisfied with Allah as being his Lord with Islam as being his religion with Muhammad S alaihi wasall as being his prophet and messenger narrated uh reported by Muslim so if you have this satisfaction this is translated into a sweetness of IM how do I have it by your conviction you don't have any doubts those who have doubts will never ever find the taste of a man so they say Allah is there or not I'm not sure you're not sure you'll find the answer in your grave when the Angels come to you and with a big stick in their hand turn you into a pile of sand who's your lord I don't know people said it's Allah I said it's Allah what's your religion I don't know who's your messenger I don't know but those who are satisfied when they hit thean they answer it and then they say this Dua then they will get Allah's forgiveness for their sins and they will find the sweetness of IM in their heart however the sweetness of IM is not something you can buy it is not something that you can beg for or be awarded as a gift it is something that you have to work hard to achieve and you have to be blessed by Allah some of us work really hard Allah says Allah in talks about faces that are submissive some Scholars say that this is in terms of the Ku and this is why Omar may Allah be pleased with him when he passed by an old Jew who's just about to die so old he cried and he said look at this poor thing his face is submissive he works he works and he gets tired at the end he goes where to Hell Fire other Scholars say that this is in the those who innovate who make things in religion which is not part of the Sunnah they work hard I've seen a video of you've seen this of some of the Muslims may Allah guide them that they make VI by swirling like a fan in the Masid and they're doing it in a crazy way what are they doing they think that they're worshiping Allah but like this this is part that fits the Ayah so you cannot beg or attain it from your own self you have to be blessed by Allah to guide you because what we are in at the moment is Allah's guidance we could have been somewhere else we could have been following another cult or sect or doing Haram or innovation but Allah favored us from all the people that we know to be following the Sunnah of the Prophet so this sweetness of IM is a gift from Allah some of the scholars say after feeling and tasting it he says if the Kings and the sons of Kings knew the pleasure we are in they would have fought Us by with the swords they would not let us enjoy it they want to take it away from us and some say how this happens when we pass by and Drive by big mansions and palaces and see people R driving fancy cars some of us may feel heartbroken I wish I had this and some of us would think and convey his gratitude to Allah by saying these people do not even know Allah they cannot taste the beauty of praying at 3:30 or4 to 4: or 4:00 who would wake up at this time only those who have tasted the sweetness of IM the rest will continue to sleep and the first week week first month this the second year they sleeping you're a Believer where are you it's too early you want to go to Jenna yes inshah in the first row maybe before the prophet maybe after how will he do this you're not working hard I have was Subhan Allah this is problematic now in order to aain and achieve the peak of IM you have to work your way from down to up and there are so many ways and by the way the fluctuation of IM is not for you and me only even for the companions Muslim Abu says may Allah pleas with him that Abu Bakr met a a companion called H so he said Han how are you said has become a hypocrite abak was shocked how can you say such a thing and you're the companion of the prophet he said when I with the prophet and he reminds us of heaven and hell we feel like we are in a different world the moment we leave the prophet and we go to our houses we sit with our wives and children and in our Farms we forget a lot Abu Bakr scratched his head and said I feel the same way there is a problem in your IM and my IM let's go and check the Doctor Who who knows the the medicine for our hearts so they go to the prophet and this is Muslim highest degree of authenticity and the prophet said what brings you here andak says the prophet of listen to H so H what do you have he said oh prophet of Allah and he repeated the same message that I have become a hypocrite because of this and this and this the prophet saidat if you were with your wives children and businesses like you are here with me when I remind you and you are engaged in VI by Allah the Angels would descend and would shake hands with you in Broad day light in front of all the people because you would have reached a level of IM that is second to none but this is not possible the prophet said and therefore an hour for remembering Allah for for engaging in this High Caliber this high voltage of a man but there has to be another s another hour where you attain worthy matters you have to work for your bread and for your family you have to sit with them so this problem we are suffering from it is normal however we have to do our level best to increase it so how can we increase our IM do you remember the first Hadith I mentioned Iman is 7 plus branches so the logical thing is to attain these 70 plus branches however the scholars differed in mentioning them and specifying them because there is not a single Hadith that says 1 2 3 4 70 so so they tried their level best first of all they categorize these branches into acts of the heart acts of the tongue acts of the body so first of all the acts of the heart you want to attain IM they say you have to believe in Allah and this requires a workshop not a lecture what do we mean by believe in Allah believe in the of lordship of worship and the of Allah's beautiful names and attributes and their divisions and their counterparts the things that hold against them to believe in Allah also requires you believe in the other five pillars of IM which is to believe in his angels his books in the uh uh Messengers in the destiny and in the day of judgment and and believe in day of judgment includes what the grave the beginning H the grave then the day of judgment itself then the the mean the scale the the straight path the heaven the hell all of this is beyond imagination the belief in it increases your IM when you know that there is a scale that would not let away an ant weight of good or bad you think twice before you do something bad you think twice before doing before not doing something good because you know that this will come in your scale on the day of judgment and so on part of the acts of the heart loving for the sake of Allah hating for the sake of Allah you have to hate for the sake of Allah and you have to love for the sake of Allah my brother who comes and prays with me I love him for the sake of Allah the Muslim brother who drinks and fornicates I hate his actions for the sake of Allah not because he is local or an expa likewise when I hate the disbelievers not because they have blonde and uh uh blue eyes but because their action and belief is kufur if they come to Islam immediately I will love them for the sake of Allah also the issue of loving the prophet praising him mentioning in him offer salutation all of these are in the heart when you love the prophet if someone comes how do you know if someone comes to you and tells you don't do this you why he tells you because the prophet said not to do it if you have love in your heart you immediately Implement if you don't have love in your heart you say this gesture itself shows you have no IM I'm telling you the prophet say you say or I know a she says otherwise Subhan Allah so all of this interprets what your Iman level is also in your heart is sincerity why do I pray for the sake of Allah who knows this it's in the heart your sincerity your repentance it's in your heart your fear of Allah hoping in what Allah has promised us in Jenna your gratitude and sh being thankful to Allah your patience your acceptance to Allah's decree my son is sick how do I act I bang my head in the wall why me my neighbor doesn't have any problems like this I pray for you I visited once an uncle he was over 70 years of age he was very sick well this is a true story not reading this I he's a relative of mine may Allah have mercy on him so I visited him so uncle be patient Allah I reward you so so he said my son I have no complaints not whatsoever except that this Masjid I've been praying in it five times a day for the past 35 or 40 years and look how sick I am while my neighbor has not prayed a single prayer and he is as strong as a bu and I said my uncle you have erased your for years of why because there is no sincerity there is no appreciation there is no content of Allah's decree so many people when they are fine their salary comes on time their wife is pleasant and not nagging mashallah they're very happy the minute something changes allahar and this shows you that we have a problem in our heart not in our bank accounts maybe we do not in our wives definitely we do but we do have a problem in the way we consider how Allah is treating us Allah is so generous with us if you lose your wallet how do you feel five six years ago on the first day of Ramadan I went to break my fast of the first day of Ramadan prayed M went out and my wallet is gone with all my IDs with my money but luckily I paid the hotel in advance otherwise I would have been in trouble how do you feel I felt alhamdulillah I said alhamd and everything came came back normal after one month I couldn't find anything I got the driving license the ID the credit cards the bank accounts Mah and all the millions were saved and inact alhamdulillah alhamd how do you feel if you Miss fure of today you did not pray oh I feel horrible sh how do you feel if you're leaving your office and there's a flat tire ah which is worse no f is no flat tire is worse I can miss for one week or two week is hot in summer and the flat tire would mean that I have to work and sweat there is a problem in prioritizing things in how we deal with Allah now when it comes and there are so many things of the heart this is not the time to mention it when it comes to the tongue Scholars say that saying Shah saying the okay reciting the Quran learning knowledge like we're doing now teaching it like I'm doing it now making Dua making VI all of this is happening with the tongue corresponding to the heart but mainly speaking you have to speak it out when it comes to the body There is almost 38 branches and it will take us for the rest of the night and this is not why we are here we this is a warmup for the lecture this is not the lecture this is just a warmup to how to increase our Im so we go to the means of inre inreasing our IM how do we increase our IM how do we reach the peak there are so many things listed by Scholars I'll mention a few because if we manage to implement this few we are winners and if we mention all of these and not Implement one we are losers wasting our time so the first thing the prophet said ask Allah to renew in your heart in your ask Allah oh Allah increase my IM oh Allah make my heart steadfast on Islam you have to ask Allah if you don't ask Allah if you feel that you are independent then you have a big problem in in the corporate where I used to work tens of years ago whenever we the board the CEO the GMS directors we have our uh uh annual meeting we talk about our forecast we talk about our achievements so in a PowerPoint I manag to do this and to achieve my targets exceeding it by 55% and I will do this in the future my vision is to do this and this all of this is sh you know that because I'm not attributing it to Allah I'm attributing it to myself when my child Falls sick what do I do doctor save my child cure my child I give him medicine I try to treat treat him after I finish everything I say h let me do let me ask Allah you have a problem because you got things reversed you do not do anything without attributing it to Allah okay abas Allah be please with him said whoever says that had it not been to the duck of my neighbor the burglar would have broken into my home and robbed me what is the situation a person sleeping in his home a burglar wanted to break in the duck of the neighbor started quacking the burglar felt scared he ran away so now he's attributing not being robbed to the duck where he should have AB says whoever says this he has Abbas the C of the Prophet so we have a problem first of all we must be dependent 100% on Allah in every single thing you want to go for work you have trust and on Allah you want to do something ask Allah in your sud oh Allah make my son pass the examination oh Allah pay off my debts oh Allah I need to be guided when I come and make do I depend on my muscles I ask Allah sincerely oh Allah prevent me from doing a mistake and expand my heart and let my tongue say the right thing that you are pleased with because no matter matter how knowledge you have without depending on Allah you are the poorest person on Earth you need Allah he doesn't need you the moment you feel that you are independent or you're strong or I can do this on my own you are a failure the more you are dependent on Allah the higher your IM goes up and this was found with the old folks the new generation don't have this old old folks the old gers believe in Allah the bedwin when they told them the the Brits are coming to invade you he said no problem he said they have airplanes that fly and throw bombs and the bed on say airplanes fly who's above the other Allah or the ples so they said Allah said Allah will suffice us this is how you trust Allah not to put obstacles and obstacles and obstacles and then you find that you are not dependent on Allah so asking Allah number two in order to increase IM follow the way of the Prophet 13 years in meca what was he doing no fighting no Jihad no prayer no Z no fasting what were they doing playing around they were in the best form of IM of how they had the Quran being revealed to them to the prophet and other companions said that we used to learn 10 verses of the Quran we would not learn anything else until we memorize them understand them Implement them then move on and this is problematic nowadays because we are so ignorant of Quran we know everything and we will come to talk about Quran later on but let us talk about it now let us see how much we know of the Quran compared to what we know about the players in Barcelona or in the Real Madrid we know the bench the the bench uh uh those who are in the bench on the reserve we know the results of last year 2015 and 200 uh before that we know everything because we have great love for that but if you come to the Quran how much do you memorize in the Quran alhamdulillah the last three chapters I know three chapters of the 114 yes and I exciteed every single Salah what does it mean I don't know but I recite what is I don't know but I know somebody he sells sweets and it's a good shop Subhan Allah then what is your problem your problem is that Allah's words the most beloved to Allah it it is what came out of him which is Allah's own speech and it will return back to him this is what we should spend time a great number of Scholars used to say by Allah to recite one Ayah with contemplation understanding and belief is more beloved to me than reciting the full Quran how many times have we finished the Quran I know that among you mallah like the majority of Muslims finish the Quran once every month this is the minimum most of us do this if not all inah I see people laughing I don't know why you're laughing am I saying something wrong this is a message right we do this the prophet told abdah ask who had a problem what was his problem he used to finish the Quran once every night that's a problem yes the prophet said don't do this finish the Quran once a month this is a minimum he said I can do more once every 20 days I can do more once every 10 days I can do more once every week and don't do it in another narration once every 3 days and don't do it less than that so we have to finish it once a month but when we finish do we know what we're reading or we're just doing the homework finished house what did you read I don't know what Surah I have to check you know you just read it no I I forgot then you did not read mother used to pray night prayer with one a repeating it repeating it and she weeps and cries for one what has she done this is belief if you have the while reciting the Quran you're in good hands if you don't you have a problem Allah says indeed those who recite the book of Allah and establish prayer and spend in his cause out of what we out of what we have provided them secretly and publicly can expect a prophet that will never perish so the first thing that Allah started before the reciting of the Quran first you have to recite the Quran this is what the companions used to do in me 13 years and this is why after hij Whenever there was a problem the prophet used to refer to them they were their they were his Rock meaning that in h when they all fled away he ordered AB call the and the muaj first of all called the muajin they immediately came back these are the the people that the prophet hand picked them one by one and raised them accordingly secondly or thirdly in order to increase your IM you must take real good care of your of your obligatory forms of worship and complete and fulfill that with the voluntary it is need needless to say that when you have a problem with then you have a problem in your IM you may find someone praying and night prayer and weeping and crying and skipping F or in in Ramadan they skip what because I don't know what's your working hours in in KU 10 n so you delay it by 2 hours like s this is the worst thing that could happen when we give the people the excuse to consider Ramadan to be a month of laziness and sleeping and it should be a month of agility and power and strength begin your working hours from 6:30 after fa and finish it at 11: or before act normally but when you ask the people and the students if they have school to come at 10:00 I taught in high and public uh uh uh high schools in Saudi Arabia for 15 years at 10:00 we used to begin the first class was first session with the teacher putting his head on the desk and the rest of the students following suit alhamdulillah we had strong Bells so whenever it drings we wake up and we move to the second class and we continue our session this is not the right way of doing it we are giving the wrong impression about Ramadan is the most ultimate thing listen to thisth The Prophet said Allah the almighty says who soever shows enmity to someone devoted to me I shall be at war with him if you express your enmity to someone who's devoted to Allah to a will of Allah Allah will be at war with you then Allah says my slave draws not near to to me with anything more love to me than the religious duties I have enjoyed upon him so the most beloved things to Allah are the things that Allah enjoined upon you your pray and this is why when The Nomad came to the prophet said what did Allah enjoin upon me he said praying five times a day he said anything else he said no unless you want to offer voluntary he said W I will not increase a single thing the prophet said he will enter J so what Allah en joined upon you is the most beloved to Allah and it draws you closer to Allah then the prophet then Allah says and my slave continues to draw near to me with voluntary works now let me try to say this and I don't know if I'm going to read it or not Superior works is it right well I don't know okay so it's voluntary it's a very long word than I'm too old to read this part and it says so that I shall love him the more you offer of voluntary Deeds the more Allah loves you after establishing what the if you do voluntary Deeds without the Allah will not accept it so essentially just do the I've managed to do that now add as many voluntary works as you shall because when I love him I am his hearing with which he hears his seeing which with he sees his hand with which he strikes and his foot with which he walks were he to ask something of me I would surely give it to him and were he to ask me for for Refuge i' surely Grant him it so you want to increase your IM observe the far and you try this because so many people tried it whenever the Adan is called come to the Masid say do we do this no no there's 15 minutes before no there's 5 minutes before there's 1 minute before I think I can reach before the IM goes first I think we can manage to the third or fourth I think we can manage the I thinking we can manage the second jam and now third Jam and later fourth four was established in this m while I was here so these people keep on delaying and delaying and delaying until they do not fulfill this Hadith by getting nearer to Allah fourthly among the things that would get your IM boosted is VI to remember Allah and Vick does not mean that you say Allah you know the people they doing this this is Stevie Wonder no this is not the case VI is in the heart you can move your lips no one knows you but you're growing in IM by just remembering Allah I remember one of the years ago he was leading Us in and he was weeping like a baby a and he's crying and you can hear that of him what kind of a man is this when you pray in I don't pray I don't cry except when I pray behind then you're not praying because of you're not crying because of Allah because the voice is nice or because the location is making you cry that is why among those who will be saved on the day of judgment and be shadowed in the shade of Allah is a person who mentions Allah alone when was The Last Time You Prayed alone in your room night prayer or made VI on your own and you saw a deal coming out we have a problem so VI is essential the more you make vick and remember Allah what do you mean by Vi I met couple of weeks ago in Nairobi Kenya beautiful place it's beautiful weather you should go there I made a full lecture on and Dua and I benefited a lot from it because when you do a structured lecture you have to research a lot and then you find out things you did not know so I think it's on my I I posted it on my YouTube couple of days ago you can watch it for free you can make Dua I I I'll charge you for that as much inshallah Vick is a broad term that includes your prayer your recitation of the Quran whatever Good Deeds fasting H it's part of VI but what we know that th is something that you do with your tongue or with your heart when you keep your mouth shut and your lips sealed the dicket is not counting I've seen so many brothers in here and elsewhere when they pray they say Allah abbar I'm reading F I said I I'm reading theah their prayer is invalid their praying is invalid when you sit in the mid reading Mah one J or two J and you're like this you're scanning it with your eyes your prayer is not rewarded I used to do this few years ago and then I was told this is not permissible and I got crazy and I said no way I said no you're not rewarded I spent so many hours researching all the books and references that I have just to see one single scholar saying that it's valid all books of of of I spoke to on the phone and great Scholars of Islam not a single one said it's okay you must move your lips and it's silent but you have to say you must or it will not be counted so watch the video maybe you will like it so is very important you walk from here to the car what do you do I sing songs I remember things no say the the most beloved th to Allah say it now memorize it it's very difficult but memorize it the most preferred and beloved to Allah you can ever say it's very you can write it down if you wish Allah loves the most people how many times do we say it today we don't say how many times you seek Allah's forgiveness I need a job sh I need a wife don't say this edit it edit it you don't need a wife be happy with what you have sh I need wealth I need rain I need this I need that Allah says [Music] in all of this comes from seeking Allah's forgiveness so constantly during the day and night say and repeat it endlessly and you will find the blessings of Allah open to you so VI is important the prophet said and listen to this one Hadith well I I'll make it to the prophet whoever fails to pray night prayer he goes to sleep he doesn't pray and whoever is stingy that he does not spend money in the cause of Allah and whoever is a coward that he does not make had in this case he must make VI plenty of Allah he must make a lot of VI of Allah if you fail to pray night prayer to give money for and to make Jad then do not leave making a lot pleased with him he said that I the last advice I got from the prophet was when I asked him what is the most beloved Deeds to Allah this is the last thing I've heard from the prophet then he died the prophet said that you die while your tongue is moist with Allah this is the most beloved Deeds if you don't work no pain no gain if you don't train to remember Allah you cannot come moments before you die and say I will start making VI is over but if you live on remembering Allah when you die you die on remembering Allah see it's like brainwash but in a positive sense if you watch movies TV series listen to music that has only songs that have only curse words when a 16 wheeler comes to hit you while you're driving and you know you are going to die what the f and you die because this is what you hear and you repeat but if you make subh alhamd and you see this and you're going to and this is the last thing you say so this is why VI is so important for us and how much time do we have 5 minutes are you okay with more time okay there is a very important concept here now what is most more beloved to Allah Quran making or making Dua y the floor is open don't be ashamed we we just asking so definitely we have three opinions Dua Quran so three opinions Dua okay no this is out of scope I said it's not one of them so all okay all three see may Allah have mercy on his soul draws our attention to a problem people are divided into two types habitual worshippers meaning that they worship according to their habit and worshippers according to Allah's desire so what do you mean explain a little bit I'll tell you most of us are accustomed to a habit or a routine in our forms of worship we would never ever allow anyone to divert us from it even if he's diverting us to something that is more important because we are putting blind holds and we're like horse race you know when they put these sign things they don't see anything except what's in front of them they fail to see what's around them this is what we do so if it is time to fast Mondays and Thursdays I would never break Mondays and Thursdays no matter what happens if my father tells me eat I love you to eat said no if my work demands me to break my fast because it's better for the passengers I'm flying or for the patient I am opening his guts he said no I don't have to fast this is a problem in priority while those who worship Allah according to what Allah desires they're flexible Allah loves this I will go Allah love this more I will go why do we give this example Quran is the most beloved thing to Allah but it cannot be read in places where it is forbidden for example I'm in what is better to to recite the Quran or to sayh definitely subh if I recite Quran I'm sinful because the prophet told me not to recite the Quran ah I always thought that the Quran was better it is better generally speaking but when it comes to be implemented in a place that it is not required to then know after Salah is finished Dua or Quran Subhan alhamdulillah my son is sick and I would like to ask Allah for cure and healing better or viick so no no I'm not ask Allah for healing Subhan alhamdulillah know Dua is better so each location each position has a priority once you understand this then you can utilize it is the 27th of Ramadan it is time for prayer my mom says let's go and visit your uncle it is it is connecting to your next of K what is more in waight no Mom going to and getting the chance of night night of Dee maybe is more valuable to Allah than connecting the next and I can connect my uncle later on tomorrow the day after after it's there it's not going to go it's not going to leave so you have to know and evaluate so we have I I'll just list it quickly among the things that increase your IM to contemplate in Allah's favors upon you when you see someone smoking in the street what do you do may Allah curse him may Allah destroy him may Allah give him cancer and high blood pressure and and blockage in the arteries and diabetes and from being take cold yellow this is extra bonus the prophet said whenever you see see someone who who was or is tested by Calamity whether he's sick or he has a SI you say [Music] [Laughter] alhamdulillah this you say not only when you see someone who's sick you praise Allah that he granted you health or granted you safety from such a sin and favored you upon so many people do you feel like this you feel like you're blessed and favored or whenever you're driving your uh beautiful Camry 2018 full option with the navigation and you see a Porsche 911 GTS 4 passing through you said well Allah didn't bless me don't say this because even the driver of the Porsche gts4 doing so much acceleration says the same thing when he say sees a Veron coming next to him bug and even the Bugatti owner says the same thing when he sees his neighbor flying his G4 to Paris to have cr s and even the one with the G4 going to Paris for CR s feels sorry when he say sees Air Force One it goes on and on if you don't have content if you don't have the Gratitude to Allah over the little things that so many people are deprived of then you will never ever increase in IM man but the more you see things and you relate it to yourself say alhamdulillah I have my feet to walk on people may be paralyzed I have my health I have my wife maybe this is not a blessing but yeah aldah it's I have my children I have this I have that w we have so many things that you are ungrateful the more you contemplate the more your IM goes Skyrocket High when you appreciative when you are content with Allah what has given you among the things that would increase your IM and this is a wellknown fact to most of you night prayer when everybody's asleep and you wake up make W and I try this the prophet whoever wakes up in the middle of the night and he says [Music] and then asks Allah will answer is so many times I've underwent calamities problems in life and I keep on waking at a specific time in the middle of the night the first thing I say is this Dua and then I ask Allah to relieve me from my Calamity W it's just like this oh sh you're a righteous person you don't know me I know me I know me very well it has nothing to do with how good or bad it has to do with the first thing that comes out of your mouth when you wake up it took me almost 3 months to manage this by the way every time I wake up I end up finding myself in the toilet looking in the mirror I did not say the Dua y tomorrow 3 months until I got it into my system once I got into my system W the first thing I wake up I make a list of Dua list a long list for Allah to cure people for Allah to do this for Allah to do that and I do it with conviction that Allah will respond and will Allah does so you have to appreciate night prayer the prophet says the honor of a Believer is night prayer and Ahmed was told this person does not pray night prayer he said he's an evil one believer doesn't pray night prayer this is the thing that the prophet had never left and even if he over slept or was sick he would make it up in time instead of 11 he would pray 12 so this is something that would yeah definitely it boast and increase your IM way up of course this adds more value when you stand in contemplation concentration knowing what you're reciting when you show and express your submissiveness in suud there's no one running after you there's no one behind you there's no one timing you because I've noticed this in myself when I pray on my own I do this from 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds but if I'm praying in the Masid it takes me half an hour people are watching no when you pray night prayer always remember that Allah is watching and Allah is accepting you so when you do this the first thing you do is what brushing your teeth what I'm not going to kiss my wife no you're not going to kiss your wife but the prophet tells us that you should begin with misak when you wake up for night prayer why the prophet tells us that there's an angel that approaches you while reading the Quran and he puts his mouth on your mouth and whatever comes out of your mouth ENT how would you pray night prayer tonight when you have this concept and you sayd and you imagine that there's an angel coming and receiving what you are reciting of the Quran would you be distracted no you won't try it and you will find that your IM is being [Music] among the things that increase your Iman is when you visit the sick people when you appreciate those who are Bid whether in a hospital or a relative when you see them in agony and in their pain and you make Dua for them you feel your heart is stof this is normal unnormal is that when you go haha look at you you're sick you got to die soon listen sick no that normally whenever you see people in pain and Agony sometimes we get clips of atrocities here and there I cannot see them not because I'm afraid of blood or I have a weak heart but I cannot see people suffering it kills you so I decide not to watch these things and visiting sick people there is a vast amount of reward and I can tell you theith but this would take us endlessly to nowhere so much reward in visiting the sick people that uh uh we should think and consider among the things that increase in our IM is thinking about death visiting graveyards contemplating on those buried in it the prophet saidat I used to forbid you from visiting the graves now I'm ordering you to visit them because it reminds you of the herea W whenever I enter a grave I cannot hear a thing it's so quiet and I contemplate how many kings how many ministers how many CEOs how many actors and actresses how many wealthy billionaires what what have they gained nothing and then I think of myself I'll be next what do I have nothing so I remember okay now I have to uh uh shape up I have to do something I'm still walking tomorrow I'll be carried into a graveyard or a cemetery rather than walk into it so whenever you remember death your Iman increases because it gives you a reminder that listen I'm going to die soon most of us if not old don't think like this ah sh how old are you I'm 95 years old mallah so how long will you live I think hopefully another 800 years yes I heard that no Liv 950 years so I'm hoping no one feels that he's going to die tomorrow and the more you get older the more your roots are fixed in the ground When We Were Young we used to drive recklessly like crazy Maniacs we used to not fear death no matter what happens I'm going to do this I'm strong the more you get older you get closer to the wheel you put on your seat belts and the passenger seat belt again just in case you know and you drive you know like 20 30 kilm per hour and you don't want to look sideways because people will point fingers at you or say things you want to be safe you want to live more when you think of death positively as we mentioned in today's if you were there when you think positively of death you think that it is your way out so you start doing good things you start avoiding Haram you start avoid blind lying or backbiting or evil things and you expect it to come if you in a Calamity once you remember death you find that This calamity is not serious if you are in prosperity and wealth and you're happy and you're arrogant once you remember death you become small and say well I have a problem all of this I'm going to be held accountable for let me spend something in the cause of Allah let me help full people let me do this in that so remembering that is uh uh very beneficial among the things that may increase your IM is this Circles of knowledge the and this is noticeable the more you attend Circles of knowledge the more your IM is elevated why Allah says in the Quran that no one among Allah's servants fear Allah more than the scholars which means that the more you learn the more fear of Allah you you gain and the more Iman you get increase in your heart also sitting with righteous people when you sit with righteous people you will inevitably gain benefit if I sit with the share he's righteous God-fearing do you think we're going to take talk about real estates and buying property or stock market no he will tell me ath he will tell me I read this so beautiful and this is the right this is how righteous people talk when they meet they don't talk about nothing they focus on what gets them closer to Allah I have a widow I know that uh uh needs money for uh medicine for her children we know this refugee camp in so and so there is a lecture in inas called this and beautiful name I don't know what it means the Arabs make fun of it but this is beside the point so we have this we have that and you get more and more IM building up in your heart and on the contrary also you have to avoid Bad Company you have to avoid sinful people and places of sin because this decreases your IM drastically W he one so OA half an hour or one movie I was in London once and the brother who was taking from the airport to my accommodation who they were arranging a conference and we passed by so many Billboards and I looked at one I said I was reading I'm very it takes me a lot of time to read English I don't read English so I was sh this movie is hilarious haven't you seen it I'm over I was looking at the you know they drive on on the right so I was looking at the brother said what what are you talking about said yes yes and move on we have split personalities we think that we can come to a lecture to increase our Iman and go back and watch a movie or listen to music or um free mix or uh do Haram things why are you doing this I have credit this is not a mobile company you have credit yes I made so this gives me credit to sin I have alhamd 6 month credit I can sin then I will make another om you're recharging your mobile you're recharging your Ean there's nothing as this the more you watch Haram the more Iman decreases until you do not notice it until you are so engaged in sin that you make sin and why are you looking at me there's nothing wrong with that I'm doing you don't recognize that you are falling into sin and this is why Allah ordered the highest person in IM who is he Prophet Muhammad Alam and Subhan Allah when we read the Quran this Ayah we read it every single Friday and it is mindblowing this is an instruction and a command to the prophet and to us as well Allah says and keep yourself Patiently by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his countenance the Arabic is uh uh seeking his face so that Allah has a face translating it into continence this is problematic when it comes to attributes of Allah it should be translated as it is but and let not your eyes this is to the prophet and let not your eyes pass beyond them Desiring adornments of the worldly life and do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose Affairs or whose Affair is ever in neglect we are totally opposite to this person who do we associate ourselves with with no why whenever I sit with them they scare the hell out of me they're Hellfire you're going to die you're going to hell you're sinful you're bad you're a hypocrite you're evil I hate myself I want to come out of my clothes whenever I sit with them but when I sit with my friend so and so allahar he makes my head explode of laughter he cracks jokes and the best time is when he talks about dirty you know jokes below the the belt oh he's hilarious I like I love to sit with him Allah says keep yourself patient by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning in the evening seeking his face and do not exceed the way you look don't look elsewhere and this is what we're doing even in Salat there was a colleague of mine he used to pray and once his mobile rang rank so he took his mobile in Salah he did this well he did this and then he said he texted during Salah text and when I finish this what were you doing I said this I was confused and and I had to and some of the scholars say that if it's going to distract you in Salah you have to attend itah why did you attend it by verb we have a problem we look everywhere but not to Salat not to what Allah wants and before the last we have one of the things that increase your Iman is when you attend people needs see among the those best in Iman those who do charity and I know people who are not very much practicing but mashallah in secret they know 60 70 homes they bring them uh uh flour they bring them uh milk they bring them frying oil every single couple of weeks secretly and they collect and they say w we I know someone who has chemotherapy and cannot afford it I have this I have that a friend of mine a neighbor his wife was struck by cancer and the people in Saudi Arabia told her she's a hopeless case why W doctors told him your wife is dead why are you bringing her so he took her to somewhere else and started treatment of in in yeah Europe and mallah this has been for 2 and a half years and she's improving but ups and downs the guy is not practicing he came to my house uh do you have people that need help I told him personally I do not accept any charity and no no one because I'm an IM of a Masjid imagine the amount of people coming to me from all different parts of jeda asking for and I cannot verify I don't have the time to cross check anyone who comes to me is say I have a hearing problem okay what's wrong with your eyes oh this is a different problem she I don't have time to verify this so I told him but my wife does my wife has enough time to check with these uh immigrants with so on so he immediately took from his pocket 100,000 R he's not a Saudi by the way 100,000 real how much is that about 9,000 KDs huh he said give this in charity may Allah help and a week later he brought me 40,000 I thought I would not be able to spend this except in a year well it took me almost 8 Days wasted people are in need and when you know and verify the need of the people and you give it to them you'll find that your levels of Iman are skyrocketing why because you're helping people and Allah is rewarding you and finally and this by itself requires a lecture one of the best things you can spend your time in after reciting the Quran is learning the of the Prophet you cannot help it w I cannot help it I've taught the SE of the Prophet Alam so many times in Arabic and in English in Huda TV you find a long series until the Battle of H in Arabic I finished it twice or three times in zad TV I finished a number of different topics on the prophet especially sh the story I know by heart but whenever I go through it and read it wah I cannot hold my tears the stories of the Prophet you feel so emotional you cannot camouflage it you cannot hide it you cannot fake it even if you're on your own when you read his suffering when you read his love to Khadijah allahar a necklace that khad gave to Zab her eldest daughter khad is long dead the husband of Khadijah who were was still with her in Mecca before the separation between Muslims and nonm Muslims was obliged he was captured so the prophet requested Ransom she sent from Mecca the necklace the prophet when he saw the necklace he felt and remembered the love he had for Khadijah and he asked the people if they were to let him go for his sake and they said yes we accept that and he returned her him to Mecca with the necklace a story like this you read it hundreds of times but whenever you read it again or say it you cannot but feel the love the prophet had for you cannot control yourself the the more you read the S you will find your Iman is being increased the more you read the events that took place in the life of the Prophet you cannot hold yourself back you have this great love for him and you want to be with him in Jenna this boost of Iman is required the more you learn the more you get benefits also if you read the life story of the companions of Abu Bakr of Omar of of Ali of of ABD of of or all these great Companions and so on you get close to them abdah muak may Allah have mercy on his soul was known to be in Hadith he's not a companion but he was one of the great Scholars of Islam His companion said why after praying is you don't sit with us he said what do I sit with you for you back bite Muslims I go and sit with the prophet and his companions I go in my home I read their life stories I lead I I read their biography and I get more Iman so this is some of the issues some of the points and it's only the tip of a Iceberg so many things that would increase your IM but you have to work in order to get your IM increased good lecture beautiful points how many will we Implement will we be able to at least do the obligatory things and get closer to Allah with voluntary things would we inject in our daily routine one ju of the Quran will we be able to pray night prayer will we be able to quit listening to Haram music or watch Haram things and occupy ourselves with Subhan ald would we be able to invite others and frequently attend lectures and Circles of knowledge if we succeed then definitely inshah we will find the difference between before and after in terms of"
