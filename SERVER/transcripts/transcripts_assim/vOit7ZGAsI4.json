  "transcript": "Mehwish from the U.S. [Questioner: My question is,   is it permissible to spy on children? Yani, \ncan we put apps on their electronic devices   in order to monitor what they're doing? \nJāzakAllahu Khairan.] [Sheikh: Wa Jāzakum.]   So [Questioner] from the U.S. says, what's the \nruling on installing programs that help parents   spy on their children and know what \nthey're browsing. Spying is prohibited.   Whether you're doing that over your children, your \nspouse, your siblings. All types of spying are   prohibited in Islam. Allah stated that clearly in \nthe Qur'ān. وَلَا تَجَسَّسُوا۟ [Al-Hujurat 49:12].   However, with the progress and the evolution of \nSocial Media and Internet influx in our homes,   there's nothing wrong in informing the \nchildren, or the spouse, that 'I will be   installing a program that tells me what you browse \nso that you have to be careful. If you go to   a harām site, I'll be notified and I'll know, and \nthen I will admonish you, or I will reprimand you,   or I'll do whatever I want.' So you give them \na heads up. And this way, there is no spying   because you told them that you're going \nto do this on them. and Allah knows best."
