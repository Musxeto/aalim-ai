  "transcript": "what is the ruling about taking test-tube baby I think that the question is referring to IVF and this is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is one if you don't have children at all condition one that you don't have children someone who has one or two children and would like to have a bit more or he has only one girl and he'd like to have a twin no this is not permissible you have a hamdullah and been blessed blessed this is sufficient so you don't you must not have any children condition number two the sperm is from the man the husband himself condition number three the egg being fertilized is from the wife herself condition number four the fertilized embryo or fetus what have they called it is to be planted back in the womb of the mother so there is no concept of surrogate mothers this is totally prohibited you cannot borrow an egg from a donor or a sperm from a donor this is totally Haram and not permissible condition five the clinic you are being treated in is run by trustworthy hopefully Muslims or people because I remember reading in the news about three months ago of an American couple going through IVF ending up with a Chinese child so definitely somebody goofed somewhere either the sperm wasn't his or the egg wasn't hers or both that fertilized embryo was neither one of them and by mistake they got it Islam pays a lot of importance - such issues and if these conditions are fulfilled in Sharma it is okay"
