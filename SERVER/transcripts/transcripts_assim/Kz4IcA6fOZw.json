  "title": "Reciting Ayahs of Sakeenah (Tranquility) at times of distress - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is from shazia she says i'd like to know if reciting the ayah or the ayat the verses of sikhina the verses of tranquility which are in surat al-baqarah verse 246 surat verses 26 and 40 surat al-fat verse number 4 17 and 26 is it at times of stress is this authentic now these verses of the quran include the word asekinah tranquility and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to ask allah azza for example when he used to dig with the muslims the trench in preparation for the enemies before they coming so they were digging the trench he would say oh allah reveal and make the sakina descend upon us and the prophet told us allah when people gather in a masjid in a house of worship of allah remembering allah or studying the quran that the sekina surrounds them so these six verses mentioned one in surat al-baqarah two in surah these verses were never mentioned in the authentic sunnah of the prophet but they are part of the quran and some scholars used to find tranquility in them when recited may allah have mercy on his soul said that whenever our sheikh and he's referring to ibn tamiya may allah would undergo something that was troubling him and sometimes he would get these evil thoughts and this is normal for believers to get evil thoughts to be attacked by the devils in forms of depression in forms of doubts etc the only difference is that scholars and people of righteousness they are saved quickly and allah azzawajal restores their iman and make them steadfast in few seconds or minutes as allah mentioned in the end or at the end of al-araf chapter 7 that those who fear allah whenever they are touched by such whispers and in such evil thoughts they remember and soon they can see things clearly they remember so whenever even tamiya had these doubts or evil thoughts at times of illness at times of weakness when he was vulnerable the most he would ask those around him to recite these verses of tranquility of sakina so that it would strengthen him and in no time he would regain his strength again so scholars say that the whole quran is means of healing and cure therefore if you recite these verses seeking allah's tranquility and allah's healing to your doubts and evil thoughts when you are in a distressed times then this is permissible providing you do not consider that to be from the sunnah rather it is from the quran generally speaking and the meanings do reflect and have a connection to the distress you are uh going through so inshaallah this is permissible allah azza"
