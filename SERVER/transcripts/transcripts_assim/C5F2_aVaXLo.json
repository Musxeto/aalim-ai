  "title": "Ruling on Coloring Books for Kids - assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "What is the ruling on colouring books, can \nchildren colour living or non-living images   as they are not yet accountable? The most \nauthentic opinion is that even children,   if they're not accountable the parents are, so \nif a child wants to drink alcoholic beverages,   wine or champagne, or wants to smoke, or wants to \nlisten to music, or wants to do something Haram,   though the child is not accountable we as parents \nare, and this leads us to the fact that colouring   drawing books is part of drawing it, so it is not \nat all permissible for children to be assisted   in doing such a thing, they'll grow up loving and \nliking such things and most likely would influence   them in the future and hence we must stop \nthem from doing this, when the colouring books   are related to drawings of animals, humans, \nbirds, living creatures, but if it's colouring   books of landscape, of greenery, of mountains of whatever, \nfarms, there is no problem in that Insha Allah."
