  "title": "ðŸ†• Summers are long in the UK, Isha is at 11:40pm & Fajr is at 3am, combine prayers due to hardship?",
  "transcript": "the second question is about what to do when summer nights are long or summer nights are short like in the uk where richa is at 11 40 p.m and fajr is at 3 am it is very difficult to wake up for fajr is it permissible to combine prayers due to hardship scholars say that the general rule is we must pray at the prescribed times in asada canada prayers were prescribed at specific times so we have to adhere to that and pray them within the parameters of each prayer but there is a concession from allah azzawajal that whenever there is hardship it is permissible to combine between as a set or as magrib set so in places like up north in the scandinavian countries or up north in the uk or in germany where the night is so uh um short sunset is about 9 30 to 10 o'clock and the break of dawn is about 2 30. so there's barely four hours of night or five hours of night if a person were to pray isha on time it would be difficult if not impossible to wake up for fajr and people have school and work to attend this disturbance in their sleeping pattern would negatively impact their livelihood here is where islam comes with a concession not as a rule rather as an exception so for those who are forced and have hardship in praying isha on time and fajr on time only for those with such an excuse they may combine aisha with maghrib so when they pray maghrib at 9 30 they pray immediately aisha for raka's and they go to bed and this is a condition that they go to bed but if they go back home and they sit until it is isha time and they're watching a movie or chit chatting and going to bed at 12 o'clock then it is not permissible for them to combine the condition is that they combine asia to married so that they can retire and go to bed early so that they can wake up for fajr and allah azza knows best you"
