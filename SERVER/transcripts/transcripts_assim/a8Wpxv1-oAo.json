  "transcript": "asthma can we use lashes extensions and nail extensions not fake nails we extend our real nails if our husband is demanding us to do so this is an issue of dispute I personally believe that eyelashes extension is similar to hair extension which is prohibited and the Prophet asam had cursed those who do it now prolonging your nails fingernails this is permissible providing it does not exceed 40 days so even if your husband orders you to do it you have up to 40 days but try to convince him not to go that far because it looks ugly it is unhygenic you will grow germs and dirt underneath even if you don't see it and this is imitating the disbelievers so try your level best to convince him just to clip your nails every week or so but if he insists then there's no problem insha'Allah providing it does not exceed 40 days and Allah knows best"
