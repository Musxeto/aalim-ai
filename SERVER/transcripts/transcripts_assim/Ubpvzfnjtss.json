  "title": "Doubtful how many sujoods I made, inclined I made 2 but later, this inclination changes, what to do?",
  "transcript": "sharif from india uh chef so sometimes this happens that in first raka i'm doubtful if i did one or two frustrations and my heart is inclined that i did two frustrations so i act on my inclination and move on but later in the prayer like in the fourth raka my inclination changes like i did one frustration so what did i do what do i do it seems that again if this is happening in every salat then you are an ocd patient you have to act upon your gut feeling so if your inclination change in the middle of the salat we look at the position you are in at the moment so let's assume you think that you missed your sajdah in the first rakah at the time you were inclined to think that you have done it rightly so you prayed the second raka you prayed the third raka and while you were in the fourth rakah you are now inclined that no i only prostrated one raka one sujud what to do this first raka is void because it's missing a pillar the fir the second and the third and the fourth act upon as if they were the first second and third which means that continue in this rakha you're in to be your third then stand up and do your fourth then sit for the shahood offer your salam and then offer two prostrations of forgetfulness and offer another salam and allah azzawajal knows best you"
