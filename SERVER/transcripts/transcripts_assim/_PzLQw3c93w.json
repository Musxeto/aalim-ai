  "transcript": "I wanted to ask about I don't know if my pronation is correct about like experting a vow so I wanted to know if you have let's say two vows or three let's say more than one vow to xph and you have to feed 10 people can you give let's say two meals per people for like two vows or does it have to be different people or different days okay first of all I understand you or uh an oath broken is one of three things freeing a slave feeding or clothing 10 poor Muslims if financially you can't do any of these three things you move to the alternative which is fasting three days only if you cannot financially do any of the three things mentioned earlier now it is important that every EXP iation of a an oath that you feed 10 different people I cannot bring 10 meals and give it to the same person for one oath this is totally unacceptable they have to be 10 different individuals and they have to be Muslims old or young male or female it doesn't matter if I have more than one experation like I said W tomorrow I'm not going to drink green tea tomorrow I'm not going to drink black tea so I have two expiations if I broke them these Oaths and I want to expiate I can bring 20 meals and give two meals to one person of 10 different people if I have three meals I can give them three meals to each one because these These are different expiations so three three three three three this total is 30 this is an exp of three uh uh uh broken Oaths but if I broke one oath I cannot give two meals to five and I say okay two by five equals 10 no it has to be one meal for each individual and of the 10 and Allah Asel Knows Best"
