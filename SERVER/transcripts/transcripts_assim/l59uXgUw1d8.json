  "title": "If our limbs dry during wudu, should we repeat Does drying a limb intentionally break sequence Assim",
  "transcript": "um if someone's making and he's washing his feet but his face already dried up so should we repeat this will do or can he just continue now this is a very common misconception among the muslims they think that the pillars of wudu which are six we know the first four washing the face the arms wiping the head washing the feet the fifth is to be in sequence so the order has to be in in sequence the sixth one is to be simultaneous people some scholars even interpret what is meant by simultaneous is that you do it one after the other without a gap and they define the gap off if one of the limbs dried out this means that there was a gap and this is not true at all drying the limbs even intentionally does not fall under breaking these or this sixth pillar of wudu if imagine if i'm in saudi arabia or in kuwait during the summer where it's 45 47 degrees celsius and i'm performing wudu the moment i wash my face before i even finish washing my left arm my face is totally dry because it's hot and it's i'm gonna face wash it again and then quickly wash my right and left and it's dry again repeat this and repeat what is this no there's nowhere in the sunnah that relates the gap to the dryness of the limb so there's no problem in that none whatsoever and if i would to give you a bonus if i'm washing my feet for wudu and i dry my right foot after washing it so that i can put on my socks and then wash my left foot immediately which takes a couple of seconds there is no problem in that insha allah because this is not breaking the sequence and allah azza knows best asif"
