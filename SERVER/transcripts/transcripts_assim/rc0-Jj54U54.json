  "transcript": "consider subscribing abdullah from the us i had a question it's a regard in public schools yes sir i keep away from many students fearing evil or fit now as the boys are into bad practices and so are the girls if they come to me i show character to the best of my ability and allah knows best or slight slightly and respectfully move away from them and many times when i try to speak with them they add haram or corrupt stuff into their jokes and conversation and when it comes to muslims particularly the youth i show them kindness and i try and bring them to an extent to uh islam and being more practicing so my question was um how should i act in general with them the muslims and non-muslims and the stuff like fist bumping or handshaking represent association with them okay first of all abdullah may allah make it easy for you it's difficult to live in a kafir country let alone go to public schools and mix with all sources of fitnah it is difficult and only those whom allah make them steadfast will remain steadfast those whom allah azzawajal does not care about and does not make them steadfast will go astray in a heartbeat secondly what you're doing is generally speaking correct a muslim in a public school where it's all mixed and with where everything is almost haram so people speak about profanity use vulgar language all what they speak about is drugs sex violence music movies all haram things because this is where they live if you live in clean water is different when you live in a swamp or in the sewers the outcome is different so when you mix with such people all the time all what you hear is swear words the f words the s words the n words whatever word you just say that the m words the w word whatever you just put a a letter and put a word after that you have gays you have people with weird ideas you have different cultures and they would not rest until they drag you to their swamps intentionally or unintentionally uh our master the third caliph uthman even i found may allah be pleased with him said a statement 1400 years ago that still resonates till date a an adulteress would not rest an adulteress would wish that all women commit adultery this is a little bit harsh no it's not someone who is indulging in sin looks at everyone else as purer than him better than him why isn't he doing the heinous things i'm doing so he does not feel at peace until he drags you down to his gutters and to his sewer the same environment and this is what happens if someone smokes and you don't he would be happy and more than happy to teach you how to smoke if you don't vape and you pick up vaping you're the man and so on so this is what is happening in in such schools what to do you have no other alternative unfortunately maybe your parents can't afford it maybe you don't have islamic schools and and inevitably you are the breadwinner you have to study and go to college and and get a degree and work because you live in such a kafir country so the best thing to do is to become a muslim a practicing muslim knowing your limits knowing what's halal and haram never bending the rules let alone breaking them trying your level best to present yourself as a muslim who is moderate according to the quran the sunnah so you avoid mixing with them because 95 percent if not 100 of their conversations would be haram and they would like to drag you into such haram and shaytan is lurking in the back of your head anticipating the right moment to tell you see i told you go to the movies go to watch that uh filth you would have at least had an idea what they're speaking about why not watch a trailer why not read a preview this is what shaytan is trying to pull your legs little by little so try to avoid them if you have a workshop if you are in a steady circle and you have to be with them limit your conversation with them to what is beneficial and related to the topic fist bumping or shaking hands with the opposite gender is totally out of the question this is totally prohibited you can't even be within the vicinity or close by to such uh uh females let alone be in contact the prophet said it is better for a man to be stabbed in his head with a needle made of steel rather than to touch a woman that is not permissible for him that's the gravity of shaking hands which everybody thinks it's normal and no problem with it and whenever they swear whenever they curse whenever they say bad jokes don't smile don't act civil and it's okay no you just simply try to move away from such places but inevitably it's all around you everybody's using such language and you can't run away from it so try to protect your heart your ears your sights from seeing what is haram and make prayers and dua to allah to keep you steadfast on the straight path yeah allah we pray to allah to protect our brothers and sisters living in such environments and to keep them steadfast and to guide them to whatever pleases him i mean you"
