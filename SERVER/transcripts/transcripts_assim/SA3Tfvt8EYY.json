  "transcript": "hey jake my first questions sheikh is on behalf of my younger brother he told me to ask you this question because he he recognizes that he has a problem but and he desperately wants a solution sheikh my younger brother he's an undergraduate student at university and he has a problem with procrastination and motivation when it comes to his studies he he was an amazing student in high school he used to get straight a's but ever since he joined university he doesn't feel like studying and he just lacks the motivation and he spends the majority of his time surfing the internet watching youtube but when it comes to studying and he sits down to to read or study he starts to yawn and feel sleepy and he just doesn't feel like it even though he knows that's what he should be doing okay but alhamdulillah he prays five times a day he's practicing and he wants to know he want to ask you he said to me ask shaykh asam is this black magic or evil eye or i'll address this a lot of those who used to be a students all of a sudden become lazy lack motivation waste their time over silly things and they feel that they're doing something wrong and whenever they try to rectify it they find that they are yawning they are um lazy they are trying to they're falling asleep simply they're not being able to rectify these things so what is it the vast majority of cases that i have gone through uh maybe relate to the issue of uh evil eye and so many brothers and sisters who call me and some of them even get counseling sessions and i speak to them and i give them hints of what is happening and i ask them to do rookie and subhan allah they do rookia upon themselves i don't directly for them i don't ask him to go to people to do ruqia upon themselves and three to five days it's gone this is an evil eye i remember once one sister who is a well-known diary and she called me and she said sheikh i'm having this depression lack of interest of things i'm unable to give any lectures i'm unable to do anything and she started crying so i told her that this is an evil eye what's the cure who's the one who will cure you allah azza this is the basics you don't have to be a rocket scientist you have to be a muslim to know this so i advise her to go and take ramra with her husband and after they finish their umrah she goes and prays to raka's next to the kaaba raise her hands ask allah azza to relieve her from whatever she is suffering from drink a lot of zamzam with the intention of cleansing her system from this evil eye a couple of hours later hamdulillah she called and she said jazakallahu khairan i'm good as new so i believe that most cases of brothers and sisters who were good in school and all of a sudden something bad happens and they're unable to continue their progress this is evil eye it can be from your own parent by the way them loving you liking what they see and say wow he's excellent without saying allah mubarak evil eye does not have to be done by an enemy or adversary it can be done by yourself to yourself you look in the mirror you can give yourself an evil lie and you can also have a problem with your siblings giving you an evil lie not out of hatred but something they see which coincides with the destiny of allah azza in addition to an evil spirit that the person has and does not know because he did not say allah mubarak it takes place so insha'allah if he does this i hope inshallah in a couple of days that he'll be as good as new"
