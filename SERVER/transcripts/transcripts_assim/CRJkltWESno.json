  "transcript": "um I was just wonder in the meaning of this Hadith it says um Allah says I am just as my slave thinks I am so I was just wondering does this mean like um if I think of Allah as merciful be merciful if I think of Allah is punishing me be punish punishing me or I was wondering like what the meaning of the Prophet said Allah says I as my servant thinks of me so let him think whatever he wants meaning that Allah is self-sufficient if you think negatively of Allah then Allah would deal with you in such a Negative fashion some people say I do not ask Allah Asel to grant me success in tomorrow's interview why he says every time I ask Allah for something the opposite happens so this is something that he's saying sometimes we dare not say it it's in our subconscious whenever we make Dua Allah is not going to make it happen so I'm not going to make Dua this is close to kuur as if you're accusing Allah of playing with you and doing what you don't want and such negative thinking of Allah is Despicable how would you how dare you think of Allah in such a negative way rather a Muslim always thinks positively of Allah and this is how the prophet used to beat whenever someone while the prophet was traveling calls another person not related to the prophet or those who's with him someone random says relating to success the name of the man is or which means Prosperity or success the prophet used to become happy and believe that this is a glad Tiding from Allah in the conquest not in the conquest of Mecca in the treaty the Covenant of Al when they were blocked from going for om one of the mediators who came to negotiate his name was sah so when the prophet came to know that his name was sah he said sah means easy so the prophet said alhamdulillah now negotiations will be easy so this all shows us that we should think positively of Allah no matter what happens and this is the meaning of the Hadith and Allah Knows Best"
