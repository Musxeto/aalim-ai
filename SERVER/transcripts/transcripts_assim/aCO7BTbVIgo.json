  "title": "Fasting according to the majority of Muslims as there is no Islamic authority in my country",
  "transcript": "fatima says shake I live in Canada Ontario we started fasting the first day of Ramadan according to the majority of Muslims and according to the moon site but we realize that our near masjid communities started one day be ahead I don't know on what basis but should I now celebrate Ramadan Eid according to my near Masjid or what the major Muslims in Ontario do definitely you must follow the vast majority of the Muslims in your country if you have a religious authority so if you have a Sharia board or a sharia committee that governs the affairs of the Muslims in Canada you should follow them because they are your leaders whether they are the majority or not they are the ones that people go to to solve their problems there inheritances their marriages divorces and holler so you should go to them and follow them if you don't then this is a big problem because it means that the Muslims are unable to unite over a simple issue like this the norm is that moon sighting is followed but if there is no authority to cite the moon the fatwa is that the people follow Saudi Arabia and this is almost similar to the global sighting moon sighting because they take Saudi Arabia as the center of the Islamic world so they follow Mecca and whatever they do they fast with them but originally it is a number of hadith that govern this issue one if the moon is sighted the Crescent is sighted this is it to the Prophet saying to the Companions and to the Muslims at large fasting is the day you fast the majority and the footer there eat is the day you celebrate it and there is a majority so you have to look into your own country and as you have stated that the majority of the Muslims in Canada fasted on that particular day so what you have done was totally legit and correct now when they announced it you should follow them and not follow your local masjid"
