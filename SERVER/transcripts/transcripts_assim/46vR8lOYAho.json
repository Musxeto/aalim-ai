  "transcript": "(Arabic) Assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu and welcome to this live episode of ask zad Coming to you every Saturday between Maghrib and Isha here in Mecca region as Usual we'll take three of your emails and then we'll take your life calls. We didn't lahi subhanahu wa ta'ala The first question is from a sister. She says does a daughter become guest at her Parental home after marriage? My parents call me a guest whenever I go to my parental home Islamically does that order hold? Same right which she had to be to Go and be like the same which she had before marriage in her parental home The question is what's the difference whether they call you a guest or not and What are the rights? They are depriving you of Basically there is nothing Most likely they honor you more they Would not allow you to Participate in house shores as before and would ask your other siblings to do The job as you are there only temporarily for a few hours or few days Maybe a week or two and then you go back to your husband house So they honor you more not that they are depriving you of your rights unless you are Insisting on sleeping in your same old bedroom on your bed That you've abandoned for four or five years Because you're married with your husband that is not logical. It's not logical to ask your sister to Evacuate the room for your sake You're just here for a week or two and you want to change everything as it used to be. No, this is not fair Other than that, whatever they're telling you that you're a guest meaning that you're honored and you're not Expected to work and clean and cook as you used to before and Allah knows best So don't be too sensitive and spoil things accordingly another sister asks I am a groom's mother and I want to know if my son can take gifts from his in-laws at The time of the wedding which they give with their own wish is it okay to take or we should Not take at all What is? Prohibited in Islam is to ask for dowry from the girls family This is a Hindu practice Muslim men don't do this real men don't do this It's the man who's the guardian? Who's the financial? source of the marriage Allah asawajal says in ayah 34 chapter 4 Surah Al-Nisa Men are guardians and protectors of women for two reasons Because Allah favored them Over women and because they spend from their own wealth to provide for their women folk So real men don't ask for dowry but at the same time the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to accept gifts and These gifts are unconditional they're a token of Goodwill it's an expression of Love and a good relationship. So if this gift is realistic Someone gives the groom a watch a pen a wallet Something a set of perfumes these are normal There's no problem in that in Arabia. It is the tradition and the customs that the guests the uncles the cousins the friends would put some money in an envelope and Tuck it in the groom's hand as a gift. This is not a dowry and it's not from the in-laws. It's from everyone else So this is permissible but if the father of the bride Gives his son-in-law a car or buys him a house or Furnishes the whole house. No, this is a dowry without any doubt a Man should not accept this and says uncle if you want to give me something like that. Please register it in my wife's name May Allah forbid something happens in the future. It's hers not in my name And this is a gift for his daughter. That's okay so many parents give their daughters And on their wedding night or before that a kitchen For her or a bedroom or a living room for her. It's in her name. It belongs to her Everybody knows this this is not a dowry and it's a gift and there is no problem in that. Inshallah the third and final question Junaid says if someone eats something while having doubts that it might contain ha'am But they aren't fully sure about it But that food actually contained ha'am in this case Since they had the food without being sure of it having ha'am ingredients Can this have an impact on their du'a? See the norm is that Everything on earth is Allegedly halal until proven otherwise Consume and eat whatever is on earth halal and pay even pure halal for you and By default things that we consume we can consume without checking and without cross examining Because this is a default Scholars make an exception when it comes to meat They say you have to know whether it was halal meat or not if according to the Ralabah to van most likely to the best of your knowledge That it is halal Then you have to consume it without checking as in the case if a Christian or a Jew Invites me to a feast Being a Christian or a Jew as mentioned in the Quran whatever they offer us of meat Whether cows camels or sheep This is halal for us to consume So I don't have to check whether it was slaughtered or not because he's a Jew or a Christian and their food That they present to us is halal. I have to just make sure it's not pork So to the best of my knowledge, this is halal. I don't need to check Likewise if I go to the supermarket I buy cakes I buy bread I buy the default it is halal until proven otherwise I don't have to Reverse this it is haram until proven otherwise. No it is halal Until proven otherwise I have no reason to check Yes, somebody called me from Norway couple of years ago and said that the bread we buy from the baker I've asked with the baker and they said yes, sometimes we do use pork in the ingredients Okay, in this case you you asked, khalas you refrain from it or you have doubt you should check But generally speaking buying cakes buying things that are halal on display across song or whatever I don't have to check if my cappuccino has Pork milk in it or not. The default it is halal until proven. Otherwise, Allah knows best We have our first caller brother Yudis from Germany My my grandfather accepted Islam secretly, but I feel that his Christian relatives may cremate him after his death So the thing the thing is if I talk to him, I feel that he may be hesitant hesitant to practice Islam anymore because he may be accepted a few months months ago and I'm only 16 if he now dies and I Start to fight with my relatives about how should how he should we how he should be we be buried How he should be we be buried I may get I may get into trouble so when I get how how old is your grandfather? Eighty seven or so so is he healthy or you're gonna kill him soon? He is not that healthy his wife just died He's what? Yes, my grandmother died. It was 85 She looked just like him and died a few weeks ago. Okay, and how is his health? He is in He's in pension. He's in home for the elderly not Okay, my advice to you is not to put hurdles rather be positive proactive Go and visit him almost every day Try to speak to him how to elevate his iman Try to speak to him about the beauty of islam the beautiful names of allah Talk to him about a little bit of the seerah talk to him about one or two ayat of the quran Strengthen his iman in the six pillars of iman to believe in allah the day of judgment the angels the messengers the scriptures and in the Divine decree whether good or bad Try to focus on these things little by little diplomatically so that he would Be proud of his islam to strengthen his islam In ishallah in few weeks time maybe a month or two if he gets strong and declares his islam to his Children and to those around him then you can ask him to write a paper or a will not to be cremated after death and allah knows best say it from singapore As-salamu alaykum shaykh santallah Okay, so, um, do I have to redo my tala all over again if I initially attended the fat fat craters in a congregational manner where um, I mean When i'm about to start off the prayer or even during the prayers I discovered that on either of my left hand side or my right Inside there's an empty space which is about an arm length away and that None of the worshipers decided to close up the gap which which is Which is on my idol of my side So the question of say it is Is the gaps between the worshipers Does it nullify the prayer The answer is no It has no impact on the validity of the prayer the worshipers So if i'm praying and the man next to me like in the covet era There is social distancing he is Three feet away one meter away and the one on the right is one meter away and neither of them Is trying to come close and if I come close they run away So is my prayer valid your prayer is 100 valid and you don't have to repeat it and allah knows best um muhammad from the states As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh shaykh So i've been doing research in regards to lost and found items in islam to to what the prophet Uh in regards to lost and found items in islam, okay, okay Yeah, so the prophet al-asatul salaam said in an authentic narration and I quote Remember and recognize its time material and its container and make public announcements about it for one year If somebody comes and identifies it then give it to him. Otherwise add it to your property end quote What I wanted to ask you today was Would the same directions apply to lost cats or lost pets or any other type of lost animals Owners, unfortunately lose their cats in my neighborhood often and I usually find the cats and bring them back to my place Thank you. JazakAllah first of all It is not permissible for you to pet a dog So this is out of the question secondly as for the cat If it is a stray cat That has no badges no traces no marks on it It's for you to keep I have no clue whether this is a domestic pet or a stray cat So if there there are no traces Such as a collar or a tag number or a name or whatever to prove to me that this belongs To someone then yeah, it is for you to keep there's nothing wrong in keeping it in sha'allah Thirdly it is best. Of course if you know that Most likely this belongs to someone and they've lost their kitten or cat and they're Emotionally attached to it that you announce it And it don't be so cheap you can get cats elsewhere cats elsewhere and ask people to donate who have Extra cats and there are so many of them fourthly The hadith you've mentioned about al-luqatah Which is lost and found this is about property that has value And It belongs to someone that can be identified. So if I found A pen like this which costs peanuts and a pennies on the ground I can take it and move on I don't have to identify it because If people dropped it they wouldn't Go half an hour later to look for it It's so cheap it's negligible But if you found a pen that is worth like 150 Something of value or more You can't keep that you have to identify the brand the color the shape it's in and then announce Around you that listen. I found an item of some value So whoever had lost something within the vicinity of this area Please contact me and you'll get people calling you. So listen, I lost my watch. I lost my my wallet I lost this and that and you can just simply ignore These calls And say no, it's not what I found until someone tells you I found a pen to explain it describe the pen he says it's a Brand of so-and-so said sorry. It's not the pen until someone Fits the description correctly and then you can give it to them and Allah knows best Yusuf from the emirates As-salamu alaikum Is enforcing evil and forbidding good and Of this belief because I took a picture today After I think I did that. Yeah, I did that and I thought maybe this is kafir because I heard you saying it's like a Major sign of hypocrisy. So I took this picture and I have it as my profile picture. Do I have to remove it or not? First of all Enforcing evil and forbidding good is one of the characteristics of The hypocrites as mentioned in chapter 9 surah to toba And they collaborate upon this And their allies one to the other however this is a Style of life in a way of living not a random act a random act would be a sin but not a characteristic of a hypocrite so i'm sitting in the living room or in the waiting room of somewhere and I look at the man next to me And I would like to take a smoke So I say fancy a fag a cigarette a joint fag in the old british way is a cigarette not that fag so Fancy one. Okay. Now I am enforcing evil i'm Advising i'm endorsing it, but i'm not a hypocrite. I'm an openly sinner Which might be one of the characteristics of An initiative to be a hypocrite, but it's not part of the Ideological hypocrisy rather it's a practical hypocrisy So your picture that you've snapped and put in your profile, which is haram. This is sinful But you're not a kafir for doing that And you're not a hypocrite. Inshallah However, you're sinful you have to be careful because such sins accumulate without you knowing it and just before Noticing it's already too late. May allah protect us all Anwar from kashmir Anwar Is my voice clear not that clear Yes, I know I have some technical glitz I hope that my question reached sheikh inshallah Okay, so this is question from one of my cousins He says that his parents like don't respect him So he says that they don't uh, his parents especially his father. They don't they don't treat him well So he says that I do all the duties, uh, and I keep quite in front of my parents I don't yell back at them. I just keep quiet whenever they yell at me So he says but I have no love and no respect for my parents. So is this attitude? Okay in islam And I hope my question reads it reached alhamdulillah and your question Is commonly asked by people unfortunately We as parents sometimes fail miserably in our mission and vision statement in the sense that We encourage our children to be undutiful Disobedient and disrespectful How by our own transgression and wrongdoing by our own Bad attitude and the way we deal with our own children. This is haram upon us We have to fear allah azawajal. Yes We do have rights over our children But they're human beings at the end of the day And we can't ask them Or burden them beyond what they can bear so we have to Be sensitive in how we treat them so that we do not lead them to hellfire because of our attitude towards them which make them go against us and be disrespectful and Undutiful now having said that if a person is tested by allah by such abusive respectful bad parents This is a test from allah He will be rewarded for being beautiful and respectful They will be punished Not because he's your son It's okay to do whatever you want to do No, you will be questioned and then you will be tormented and punished for what you had done to your son so if the son is doing his level best And being respectful all the time being dutiful all the time and trying to be as obedient as possible Yet he has no love or respect in his heart He can't simple as that Is this sinful the answer is no providing they Do not sense or feel any form of resentment or hatred or disrespect Because sometimes your eyes can betray you your tone of voice can Deceive you And let you down if you succeed in not showing them any of Such in ishallah. There is no sin on you. May allah make things easy for all of us sumaya from the uk As-salamu alaykum shaikh salaam to Allah So once I prayed asha and inside the prayer I couldn't Remember if I did my second makah And oh my my sister was in in the room with me and I decided And I think it was a period where I had lots of waswas lots of doubts in the salah So I made it my third I had the doubt like whether I did my second or third I did my I said This is my third rock and I concluded the prayer and I asked the my sister and she told me that she didn't see me Now I tried to remember why I made that rock the third and I couldn't remember whether I was inclined or not So should I repeat the prayer? now Take it as a rule of thumb Whatever doubts you get After the ibadah is over These are whispers from shaytan ignore and move on example I am doing tawa from the kaba And we are in the season of hajj I'm supposed to finish seven rounds On the sixth round I get a doubt Is this the sixth or the seventh I could not figure it out. What should I do? act upon certainty I'm doubting whether this is the sixth or the seventh. Where is the doubt in the seventh? Cast the doubt away. So this is my sixth finish it add one more That's it. My ibadah is one hundred percent valid Now imagine I finished my tawaf And i'm going through sai Or I finished my whole umrah and I went to my hotel room and then I get These thoughts that did I make six rounds around the kaba or seven Now the ibadah is over the tawaf is over and when it was over I had no doubts These doubts that coming up now are from shaytan ignore it and toss it in the dustbin As if they do not exist don't pay attention to it. Likewise after you Thought To the best of your knowledge that this is my third and you completed your prayer as such Finished the prayer is over After that if you get doubts, why did I do this? Why did I assume it was three not two or four? You ignore such doubts because these doubts came after you Made the best of your ability to determine whether it is two or three and acted upon it and finished your salat And your prayer is valid. Inshallah I think we have brother eunice from germany with us again Uh So I didn't finish my question. I already did the things, you know, you said I talked to him about sira and other Other things that have to do with islam. So The thing is if he dies now and i'm in this situation where his relatives want to burn him And i'm standing there and say he was muslim. He shouldn't be cremated I will get into a problem. I may get beaten up. I uh, I may get beaten up or I was sent to the psychiatrist three times before because my because my father caused me a heavy long story so How much effort do I need to invest to prevent them? Is it like when i'm forced to say kufr? I need to give Really much strength. I don't know i'm i'm nervous. Sorry So how much effort do I need to invest to prevent them from doing this you can't do anything According to the law Everything is in your grandfather's hand If he writes a will Saying that I want to be cremated Then it will be implemented if he writes a will And tells those who are around him and writes a legal document that I would like to be buried as a muslim Then it will be followed You as a grand child In the presence of all of his sons and daughters have no say And even if you say that he was a muslim, they will say prove it And you won't be able to prove it And this is why I said to you in the beginning that you have to try to strengthen his iman uplifted and make him make such a statement and endorse or not endorse proclaim and say That he's a muslim so that everybody knows what to do afterwards if he fails to do this This is his fault his problem and not yours and allah knows best Dima from germany As-salamu alaykum, alaykum salaam So on monday, my class is going somewhere which is in another city and usually like I would usually not go because um, Traveling without a man is not permissible but if I don't go I have to Bring a letter from a doctor that i'm sick, but i'm obviously not sick.

Is that simple as well? Nobody in his right mind Would read such agreements That are formulated by the company for legal reasons And they put all the fine prints and the jargons and their legal terminologies over 10 or 15 or 20 pages so when you buy Products of microsoft or google or apple or amazon Or the likes they always have this long number of pages Of their policies and their agreement and you have to check in nobody reads it and nobody's Bounded to Sign it you just check it and move on Put a check and move on am I sinful? No, i'm not sinful. I'm not obliged to read such a thing Because I can put my own Obligations as well and they have to agree to that and they won't agree to that So ignore it and move on achi Zain ad-din from the uk Are you are you finished yes, I am okay Now From knowledge, we know that gold pure gold is impermissible for men, correct, correct so So now I want to ask are we allowed to use what about rose gold It's a form of gold. It's pure gold, but it's mixed with copper So it's an alloy Now we know wearing gold is impermissible But can we use the rose gold in using it buying in pens using um certain pieces Certain accessories for example buying in pens for example because they sell rose gold pens. So am I allowed to use the rose gold stuff Knowing it's mixed with pure gold or copper. I wanted to ask because would it change the state of the pure gold To a different form And not actually pure gold since it's mixed with something else To my knowledge pure gold is not available except in bars or in like 99.99 grams of Blocks of gold that cannot be molded into A key chain or a pen or the likes because it's too pure It has to be mixed with copper so that it can be molded and used in other cases therefore The answer is no Rose gold is haram because it's gold mixed with other ingredients And it is widely used in all aspects Cufflings and pens and key holders and watches and all of this is haram Um abdurahman from the u.s Abdurahman My question for today is uh Like, you know how reading tabarak and surah such as tabarak and surat alqah from week to week and reading tabarak every day It protects you from the grave. Is it permissible to Like cut it up and read it in in salah as well or you have to read it like only out of salah only It is permissible to read it every night If you read it in salat inshallah, this is applicable as well. But the best is to read it part of your bedtime afkar When you're at Bed you recite this you recite surat ishda as the prophet used to do. Alayhi waslam And you recite the rest of the afkar. This is best. Inshallah muhammad from the us As-salamu alaykum shaykh santallah There's an authentic narration attributed to the prophet muhammad alasat islam in regards to hunting in which he said and I quote When you set off your trained dogs recite the name of god while sending them off Then eat that game end quote Now I know the saliva of dogs are impure. So my question to you is What would I do with the part or area of the animal that the hunting dog bit? Would I avoid eating that part of the animal? Jazakallah? No You can eat that part as it was not mentioned in the hadith Or by the doings of the companions that we should purify it or cut it off or wash it off Which means that as long as the sharia did not elaborate Or address this issue. It is forgiven and neglected And you move on with the grace of allah as a wajal Faheem from india As-salamu alaykum If we are sitting after fajr till the sunrise or we are sitting in iba If someone offers a food or snack, it's all happened that in our locality If someone dies and when it reach one year, they stay to the imam to make du'a So after that, there will be a snack. So if I eat that will it break my reward? If they are Collaborating and joining in the masjid on such a snack Which is commemorating a deceased who died a year Earlier, this is totally prohibited for you to participate or to eat from it Because this is collaborating on evil and vice but If you're sitting there and someone randomly comes in gives you food This does not invalidate You're sitting after fajr till sunrise Or your dhikr and you can accept such a thing, but it is not permissible to participate And collaborate upon innovation and allah as a wajal knows best I am afraid that this is all the time we have Tomorrow most likely won't be a live session because the studio is engaged with other projects So until we meet Next saturday with the grace of allah after eight. I'll leave you wasalamu alaikum An You"
