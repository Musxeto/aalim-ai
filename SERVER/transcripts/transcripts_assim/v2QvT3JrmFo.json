  "title": "All Previous Sins will be Forgiven if you Pray night prayers during Ramadan - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "we move on to the following Hadith and maybe uh we will conclude uh our first uh part of the show with it the Hadith number uh 47 and this Hadith was narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him Abu hura says the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever prays during the night in Ramadan out of sincere faith and seeking its reward from Allah will have all of his previous sins forgiven and this Hadith was agreed upon this is a beautiful Hadith like the rest of the hadiths of the Prophet Alat wasam they're all beautiful they are all rich in meaning and they are all inspiring what do we understand from this Hadith we understand that the prophet Alam is highly encouraging the Muslims to pray and to dedicate the nights of Ramadan for night prayer and what is the reward of that well if you do this with two conditions Allah the almighty will forgive your previous sins and this is a lot to have all of your previous sins forgiven this is a lot and it's worth paying hundreds and thousands millions of dollars or Euros or whatever just to get your sheet your record book cleaned restore it white again as it was what to do you don't have to pay a lot you don't have to do a lot all what you need to do is to pray night prayer during every single night of Ramadan but there are two conditions one that you are sincere so you do this out of your sincerity out of believing that it is a Sunnah that the prophet did and so did all of his companions afterwards believing that night prayer is the honor of a Believer as in the Hadith the honor of a Believer night prayer and his dignity is in not looking at what people have in their hands so if you do this first condition that you're sincere and that you believe that Allah has given us this opportunity to get our record books cleaned and you do this with the second condition which is which means that you are anticipating the reward only to be from Allah you're seeking the reward and anticipating it from Allah so sincerity you're not praying for anyone else you're not praying so that people would say oh masallah he prays or he stands all night in prayer for the sake of Allah as some showof would do because you have to be sincere ji may Allah have mercy on his soul says that I went once late at night with a friend to a mosque in Bagdad and there was a man praying so we looked at him and we said to each other mashallah look at how beautiful and submissive this man's prayer is apparently they spoke a bit loud and the man heard this so he wrapped up his prayer in a quick fashion and he came to them with a big smile on his face saying as if he's saying to them that I I've heard what you said he said to them how would you feel to know that I am fasting for the past 30 years every single day so look at what showing off does to an individual this man interrupted his prayer and he exposed his Good Deeds by telling them that he did this form of worship or Good Deeds which is fasting for the past 30 years for the sake of Allah now he exposed himself and he used it to boast about it and to show off so if you pray night prayer during the month of Ramadan for the sake of Allah in this case Allah would forgive your previous sin but praying from to F is very difficult well Allah had made this easy for us and he told us that if you pray in the congregation with the Imam until he finishes his prayer that is wi so if you pray then you pray the whole with him or the night prayer with him until he offers Witter then this would be counted for you as praying the whole night so imagine if you succeed in doing this every single night of Ramadan at the end of Ramadan Allah the almighty will forgive all of your previous sins what sins major and minor or only minor it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that the minor sins are forgiven but if you pray with the intention of repentance and you feel remorse over the major sins that you've committed and you repent to Allah from them then Allah would forgive your major and your final and your uh uh uh minor sins as well"
