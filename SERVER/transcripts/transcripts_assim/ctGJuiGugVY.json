  "transcript": "Zeynep says how many names does the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam Muhammad have and what is the difference between a name and a safe hat some people say he had two names and some say he had 99 names whenever I used to give them reference from Sahih Muslim and sahih bukhari saying that he has five names they say those are not names please explain me about this well it is exactly how you had described it the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam have names and he said in one hadith narrated by Bukhari and Muslim I have several names I am Hamid and I am ahmed and I am Alma he which means the eraser by means of whom Allah erases Cofer and I am Al hasher which means the gatherer at whose feet the people will be gathered and I am Allah paper meaning the last which means that after whom there will be no other prophet or messenger he also said inside him a Muslim that he mentioned several names of his and he said I am hammock and Ahmed and almalfi the last succession and al herschel the gatherer and the prophet of repentance Nabil Rama or the prophet of mercy so these are what is authentic everything else would be considered as a description so you can describe the prophet alayhi salat wa salam with so many things such as al-mansouri boar or the one who is granted victory through aw this is a description of the name but unfortunately some people went into extreme when it comes to the Prophet Allah salah salem and this is what he himself told us to be careful and not to fall into a loo hulu to be in extreme so they said ok allah has 99 names our prophet as sam has 99 names a stock for allah are you saying that the Prophet is like Allah no no no we're not saying that but they both have 99 names this is what you're saying ok can I enter your message suggest you're more than welcome these are our message you go to the Masjid you find a circle with the name of Allah and another circle the same size with the name of Muhammad stop for a lot like what are you guys doing you're saying Allah Muhammad as if they are peers and identical this is not possible this is not permissible and this is why people went the extra mile in almost falling into blasphemy so they are giving our prophet Allison because Shaytan is manipulating and messing with their minds and he says you love prophet muhammad allahumma salli wa suleman yes i do love him so you have to show and prove it what do you want me to do well you have to praise him I praise him I always offer salutation upon him so no no no this is not enough ok I'm growing my beard to follow his Sunnah no no not enough what then you have to say that he was created from the light of Allah there was a hold of Allah how do you say sister thing not only that he controls the universe only Allah controls the universe no no he delegated this to Muhammad Ali so son and he sees everything as this Fe as if he's however another and he looks at his palm of his hand and he can see the whole world this is what are you doing this is how Shaitaan is messing up with them so don't pay them any attention"
