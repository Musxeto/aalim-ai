  "transcript": "sorry she says whoever prays to the direction other than a fibula can we correct them while they're praying the answer is yes when the ayah that was revealed from changing the Qibla from Beit al-maqdis to the Kaaba it was 180 degrees difference so a man passed by the people of Cuba while they were praying Federer and they did not know about the changing of the fibula so he told them that our ayah was revealed and it's changed 180 degrees as they were praying the Imam who was in the front came to be in the back and the congregation came to be in the front and they continued their prayer so yes you should tell them and they should not break the prayer"
