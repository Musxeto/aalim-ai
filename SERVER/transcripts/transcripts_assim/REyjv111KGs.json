  "transcript": "are you asking me what's their ruling on praying voluntary prayers on the on the ground sitting yes yes this is permissible the prophet salallahu salaam said that the prayer of a person on sitting down is half the reward of him praying standing up and all scholars agree that this is in regards to one the person who's not sick who doesn't have a legitimate excuse two in only prayers that are voluntary because if a person does not have a legitimate reason in fault and sits and prays sitting down his prayer is invalid and a person who is sick or has a legitimate reason and praise sitting down the fart or the voluntary his reward is fully uh endorsed and nothing is missed because he has a legitimate reason however it's worth noting that the people in the subcontinent pakistan and india and sometimes bangladesh have a wrong concept of after fart we see them in the masjid the guy is as fit as a bull masha'allah mubarak yet after the fall prayer is over he prays the sunnah of maghrib sitting down why he said this is sunnah no this is not sunnah don't lie upon the prophet salaam say that i'm lazy i'd like to get rid of half of the reward that's fine with me but it's not a sunnah the prophet islam is not part of a sunnah to pray sitting down except for the two raka's after witcher which he used to do at the end of his life and allah best"
