  "title": "Cannot perform Tayammum until the time is due & the Tayammum is only valid for that prayer",
  "transcript": "ahmad from the uk he says and i've noticed from his question that he's asking according to the he's learning so in his school of thought they say that you cannot perform tayammum except after the time is due and this has to be for this particular prayer and once the prayer time is expired and the following prayer is due you have to perform another tayammum and this is not right this is bogus yeshua but it is in our school of thought books yeah i know but it's baseless neither the quran nor the sunnah backs it up so what is the ruling you don't need the time to be due to perform muddle uh to perform tayammum so if it's like 10 o'clock in the morning and i'd like to pray i would make tayammum do i have to intend no i just intend like when i do with rudolph to uplift my minor ritual impurity i pray aloha and i stay until the whole time the daughter time is due i pray the  with the same time no need to make another move but i didn't intend the chair no need who said there's no need as our time is due i pray assad with the same wudu come on you don't do another wudo another team no i don't have to the only time i have to stop tayammum is when the water is present or my ability to use the water is there and i can use water only then my team would be invalid and allah knows best"
