  "title": "When to say the Morning & Evening Athkaar",
  "transcript": "uh finally faizan says what are the times of the morning and evening atkar morning at car begins with the break of dawn so if you start your morning at car immediately when the adhan of fajr is called even before praying fajr prayer that's valid evening at god is an issue of dispute whether it's after asar or after maghrib i'm inclined to say it after maghrib though sometimes i do say it after asr because the opinion that says it's to be said after assad is very strong it's very solid but again it's an issue of the dispute if i believe you say it after assad this is also valid and allah azza knows best"
