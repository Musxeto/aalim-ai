  "title": "Gifting a prayer mat with the person's name on it, permissible? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she nowadays it's a trend to gift uh a prayer mat with names written on on them is this permissible these names are mostly written at the place of SDA there is nothing wrong in having a prayer mat with a name on it but does it have any place in Islam in the sense that is the prayer mat as a piece of cloth something sacred the answer is no I can take a prayer mat and wash my car with it or wipe the floor with it no there's no problem in it it's just a piece of cloth there's nothing sacred about it now why do we use prayer mats oh because to have our prayer accepted oh this is an innovation if you think that your prayer is not accepted without such a mat then this is an innovation if you're using it because the floor has a bad smell or it's dirty or you're suspecting that there is an impurity there's no problem in that if the floor is too harsh for your skin and you need something softer there's no problem in that at all but as we see for example in many masjids the full Masjid is covered with carpets very expensive yet the Imam has a prayer mat on top of that this is totally unacceptable why would you have a prayer mat for the Imam just because he's an Imam he's a higher degree this is an innovation what's the difference between the spot you're praying on and the spot the followers are pray it's the same thing so why have an extra prayer mat this is an innovation unfortunately it's prevailing and it's spreading all over the Muslim world but nobody thinks about unfortunate so to conclude to have a paper uh a prayer mat with your name my name anyone's name on it has no significance and there's no problem in gifting it and Allah Knows Best"
