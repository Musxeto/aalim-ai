  "transcript": "I have a question on pride. Uh some people who are rich they seem that uh wherever they go they say that uh I am rich I am this and that. They waste money like anything and uh they look down upon other uh people who are suffering because they don't have anything to suffer. Is this a kind of pride and is this a a major sin? Yes, it is of course pride and arrogance. When you look down at people, when you hurt their feelings, when you boast about what you have and show them that I'm better than you, I have more than you. I am from a better country, I am from a better race. If there is something as race in this case, yes, this is arrogance and it is a major sin."
