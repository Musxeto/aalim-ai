  "transcript": "um okay we have would you have from canada uh my question was related to black magic so to give a bit of context uh someone very dear to me because they're afflicted with black magic and they happen to read the thing multiple times a day three five times a day who's using who's using the the with the ten and sort of classes the person who believes how how is this possible he's a sorcerer and he uses these surahs no no no i'm saying they they say that they feel that they are okay they've fallen ill to black magic okay so they read these every day and they cite rupiah like suit and fatiha on water before drinking it um and they pray five times a day as well as you know they may listen to quran via lecture online uh so my question was is it still possible that they are afflicted with jin possession or black magic and you know it's been over half a year since they felt that they were okay i will answer inshallah now wojji from canada had a similar question to nafiya from india and that is though there are people who think that there is a spell on them so they read rupiah and they observe their daily prayers and they engage in athkar yet for the past six months they still think that they have this spell on them so is this possible can jinn still exist possession of jhin though is being performed can black magic still be effective though rookie is being performed the answer is number one most people who think that they have gin or black magic spell on them they're delusional it is a common misconception or a quick escape goat for people to blame any failure in life over such things so if the wife is nagging me day and night she's possessed even if she doesn't she's possessed for marrying me but she's possessed if the child if my son fails uh in school well this is evil eye if my boss refuses to give me a raise this is black magic if my car has a flat tire this is envy from my neighbor so i tend to blame anything that happens which might be my own failure to black magic gin possession envy and uh evil eye and as i said in so many cases this is delusional this has no reality so sheikh do you think that there is no such thing as jin possession or magical spells and sorcery on the contrary this is something proven in the quran and in the authentic sunnah no doubt about it yet i'm saying that 95 maybe 98 percent of cases are not legit and if they were to be legit if someone is really possessed by jinn or has a spell from a sorcerer what is the remedy there is no cure there is no remedy but to recite the no one on earth can relieve you from what you're having except allah azzawajal okay can't we go to the sorcerer and ask him to make a counter spell that would be kufur going to a sorcerer and asking him to do such things would be comfort from your side so what to do suffer the answer is it's your choice if you would like to choose kufur over suffering be my guest but no muslim would opt for such an option knowing that it would throw him in hell or take him out of the fold of islam so continue to do if you're doing it once a day this is not sufficient maybe you have to do it 15 times a day and divide this on the day and night drink a lot of it wash with rakia water and take a shower of it number of times make a lot of dua in your sujud and i guarantee you that allah would cure you with the grace of allah as a wajal you"
