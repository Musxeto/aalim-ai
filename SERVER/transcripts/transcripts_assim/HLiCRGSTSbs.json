  "title": "Repeating after Adhan app & saying the dua afterwards for Prophet's ï·º intercession assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says the house or my house is far from the Masjid as I'm unable to hear the aan I have an aan clock can I keep the aan clock at home and would the response to aan in addition to the Dua be accepted as getting the intercession of the Prophet Alat wasam the answer is keeping an aan clock in your home is permissible there is no nothing wrong in that inshallah but is the aan being live and performed by a person existing now or is it recorded the answer it's recorded if if this is the case then you cannot repeat after the aan and offer salutation upon the prophet Alam and after that say the prescribed Dua because this aan is not live you can do this only when the aan is live and maybe someone would ask and say that in some countries they have an innovation where they call one aan in all of the masjids in that City so at the same time onean goes by one mu is this permissible first of all there is no innovation in that as long as the person giving the aan is doing it live at the prescribed time of Salat the only difference is that his voice is aired throughout the whole number of masjids in that City at the specific time at the same time there's nothing wrong in that this is totally permissible and Halal however if this was a recording and it's aired in the one Masjid or in all of the Masjid that would be inv valid and an innovation and Allah Asel Knows Best"
