  "transcript": "so uh I want to start an online uh working online business but uh like there may be some disagreements like in selling so I want to start business selling and buying and stuff so there may be disagreements between the seller and buyer and the sites that provide the service of like buying and and stuff is like in the event of dispute or attempted fraud he will you have to submit a complaint to the site which will study the the evidence and decide on the case however this site's decision is like final and you cannot reject it so I'm afraid that this is referring to something other than what Allah has reveal a This is Not Practical if you have no other alternative than to deal with a proxy site that would become the mediator between you and the one buying from you you have no other option of course the best thing is to do is to buy and sell directly but as you've stated correctly there might be a huge amount of fraud from either side from the buyer or from the seller so in order to protect each party's rights you have such sites but some of these sites are not not fair some of them are biased and they always take the side of the buyer so the seller ends up losing money but this is a risk you have to take and agree because otherwise you would not have any means of selling your products except on such a platform try your level best so that everything is crystal clear but at the end of the day this is not legislating to other than Allah's laws because this is not a company that would be arbitrating to the sh law because you live in a cafir country and they deal with their cfir laws and you're obliged to do this and the same thing happens when you fly using their airplanes and a dispute takes place you charge them or you sue them for the delay or the loss of your baggages again so many things that our lives are connected with their laws and we're obliged to deal with that in order to get our rights so this is a risk that you have to undertake or otherwise as they say if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen"
