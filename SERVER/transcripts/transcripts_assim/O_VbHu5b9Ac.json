  "transcript": "I applied to a university and I got an interview and was accepted a few days later but I have doubts about whether attending is Hal I think my father has a friend related to the university and and that told me to inform him before applying and before the interview claiming a man claiming to be my father's friend said things and I understood from what he from his words that will be some kind of intervention from his part um when I confronted my parents they denied any involvement and they said W but they think they might might not be honest I ALS they're also not practicing Muslims I felt that my interview is not good and I think the majority of other students did better than me I'm inure of the reason of was accepted and I don't know how many students the university will accept and I also do not know if I took the place for more deserving students so my question is ATT this University I was waiting for you to add another phrase after all this drama by saying and I feel depressed and I feel suicidal so is committing suicide Halal what is this come on they say they had no intervention oh but they're not practicing they swore by Allah oh they skip prayer she sometimes I'm doubtful that they're cfer and this and that and I think and I believe all of these are speculations you applied and you're accepted alhamdulillah this is a university in your country so there is no problem in going in and studying and leave all these Whispers of shaan behind you"
