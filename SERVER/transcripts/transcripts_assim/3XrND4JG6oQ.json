  "title": "Prominent Scholars say boycott Chinese & Products of enemies of Islam, what do we do Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "abdullah from india he says there is an argument we should not buy chinese products because of what they're doing to our muslim brothers in the yoga community and their imprisonment of a million in in concentration camps which they definitely oppose anything that is related to islam so someone says as a prominent scholar in in where they're coming from in india said that we must not buy their products because they are enemies of islam his wife says or his mom says sometimes they can confuse one foot with the other just kidding don't i don't need any more hate mail um so his mom or his wife says that by this logic we should also buy cut other products of other countries that support israel that support our enemies of uh they are enemies of islam etc in some aspect so what is the ruling first of all what i buy is my own business so it's totally up to you you'd like to buy green tea be my guest you'd like to buy coffee it's up to you what you drink what you buy nobody says no you have to buy from these places or not why because even at the time of the prophet sallam the companions used to buy and trade with the persians the fire worshipers the byzantians the room and the jews and they all had fights and skirmishes and wars with the muslims so never the prophet told us hasan don't buy from them or don't sell them which means that it is permissible now when it comes to personal preferences if you feel your blood is boiling and you would like to help your muslim brothers by any means you can don't buy their product simple as that nobody is going to say no no no you have to buy chinese products or french products or american products no nobody forces you to do this if you can't find an alternative elsewhere be my guest so if i do it am i rewarded definitely for your intention you're rewarded but you don't have the right to judge others or to control what they do so you don't want to buy it perfect allah will reward you for your good intention don't come to me and say okay but why are you buying their products this is something that belongs to me this is my own preference and conviction you have nothing to do with it so stay out of it and i hope this answers your question"
