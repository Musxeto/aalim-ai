  "transcript": "that it's your wife imagine in ramadan how long do our wives spend in the kitchen not less than three hours four hours when you break your fast with the dates what's the first comment ah the soup needed some salt the sambusa is overcooked and this is that in this it this is devastating no matter what praise your wife's cooking seriously my wife knows i'm a big liar whenever she cooks food and i've been married for 33 years whenever she cooks food she usually makes mistakes either it's burnt too salty to raw i eat and i speak while eating if it's bad i eat three morsels four morsels i eat a lot of salad alhamdulillah may your hands be healthy and to and she looks at me while i'm eating and she says you're lying the food is horrible why don't you say so why did you speak i said how long have you spent in the kitchen cooking it did you intend it this way it so happened and if it happens i appreciate your effort not the result because i have so many shortcomings if you start picking them up i'll be doomed i never take you out seriously i'll never take her out at all we never travel i don't take you to restaurants i don't buy you gifts i don't say good words and you want me to complain about your cooking or about the house or about my clothes not being ironed i should be ashamed of myself so this way of reciprocating of appreciation you live happy life you don't eat well but you live a happy life because we all have our shortcomings you must show your gratitude to others in order so allah azzawajal would grant you or would appreciate and reward you for what you do"
