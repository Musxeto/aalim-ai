  "transcript": "a question for a sister who works with me she is U uh fasting Ramadan and while working she's wearing tight clothes she's wearing tight clothes okay yes and she does not wear hijab as well so I was wondering now is her fast fasting valid for that reason or no okay first first of all we have to know that fasting basically is to refrain from whatever breaks your fasting from the break of dawn to Sunset with the intention of worshiping Allah the things that break your fast would be eating drinking sexual intercourse ejaculation and the likes for women menstruation or postnatal bleeding and and the likes but sins do not break your fasting rather reduces the reward the prophet said who does not who does not refrain from saying falsehood or testifying falsehood or acting upon it Allah does not need him to quit eating and drinking so from the same analogy of yours Shah if someone fasts and he shaves his beard would we say that his fasting is Haram is is not acceptable you tell me if someone fasts and watches soap operas or movies or listens to music is his fast invalid now we say go and eat and drink of course not the fast is fast but the reward decreases considerably according to such sins and I hope this answers your question"
