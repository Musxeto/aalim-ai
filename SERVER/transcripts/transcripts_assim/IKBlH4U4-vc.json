  "transcript": "And the strength to go on. Allah Azza Wa Jal praised such form of thinking in the Qur'an in so many places. Allah says, if we had sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and splitting from fear of Allah. And these examples we present to the people that perhaps they will give thought."
