  "title": "Being extreme in judging people & OCD with helping people sin",
  "transcript": "Duda from Tanzania I see the concept of judging people and doubting things is a huge Pandora box. Once you open it, things go down the drain. Now you, if you listen to yourself, you say, she's interested in doing business, but I don't know what kind of business. So if she asks you for a bottle of water, will you give her? The answer is, yes. How would you know if she's not going to change this water into ice cubes to use with her gin and tonic? You don't know. So next time someone asks me for water, I'm going to refrain or better more, I'm going to interrogate them. What are you going to use the water for? Are you going to say Bismillah? Or are you going to just drink? Because if you don't say then I may take that. This is too much overthinking and prejudging people. Without any Islamic legitimate reason, someone from out of the blue, a Muslim or a non-Muslim, even a non-Muslim comes and says, Sheikh Asim, can you help me rent a house? Sure, I'll help them. Oh, Sheikh, maybe he'll get his girlfriend. True. Maybe he'll drink intoxicants. True. Maybe he'll do his Christian prayers there. True. But this is beside the point. What I'm doing is a halal means of assistance and help. So as long as you don't know what their business is, the default is their business is halal, inshallah. If it turns out later on that it's not, this is not your sin. You're not obliged to interrogate or check or check on her business. Whether she's wearing the hijab or not, that's a separate issue altogether. It has nothing to do with you helping her getting an apartment because so many people come to me clean shaven and they ask me questions. Say, hmm, should I answer them or no, I can't give them fatwa because they're clean shaven. I don't know what they're going to do if this happens or that. All of this is irrelevant and you should not overthink in such a fashion. You will destroy your life. You will destroy your relationship with others because you're judging them when you're not their father or their mother. So I hope this answers your question, Duda. You're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
