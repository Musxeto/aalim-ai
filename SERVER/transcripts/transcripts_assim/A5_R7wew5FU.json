  "transcript": "she what is the ruling on an old woman taking off her hijab and her AB in front of non the origin of women's attire is that they conceal their beauty and adornment from nah men Allah mentioned in the Quran an exception for those who are too old to be desired by men so women in their mid-60s or 70s whose face neck and hands are so wrinkled that no one even desires them as a female Allah Asel permitted them to loosen up their hijab and not to be strict in it but said at the end of the Ayah and to be chased is far better for for them than having this concession and allowing it to go so if a woman is out of the range of being desired I'm not talking about cougar I'm talking about a woman who is like a a grandma who is so wrinkled and old and you can see it on her face and and body that she's she's my grandma nobody desires her unlike some women in the mid 60s and 70s that still maintain a nice figure and and and skin tone and they're mashallah they look like they're in their mid 40s no this is different we're talking about someone that all agree that Grandma I apologize no thanks but thanks yeah this type it is permissible for her to loosen up her hijab though wearing it uh uh properly is much better uh at the sight of Allah"
