  "transcript": "uhh bismillah r-rahman r-rahim al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salamu alikom de la rasilla he nabina muhammad nur ad he was a BH main assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh of course we are still continuing to study and to have lessons in folk and it's essential that we always remind ourselves of the importance of such a topic because without knowledge you do not have the proper means that allows you to worship Allah soldier so therefore you have to have this knowledge which is derived stemmed from the Quran and from the sunnah of the prophet salallahu alayhi wa salem and the companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam has delivered they have delivered all the hadith they have heard from the Prophet area so salaam to us the scholars compiled it and one of the books quite famous for compiling such hadith is Baloo and murim and today we're still continuing to study the chapter that deals with evolution and as you know evolution is the book in Arabic it's translated into booboo and without properly performing ablution then your prayer would not be accepted and the first thing that a Muslim is asked and questioned about on the day of judgment is prayer and if he does not perform prayer as he's supposed to then all of his deeds will not be accepted that is why it is very essential for us to know how the Prophet sallallaahu is LM performed evolution we have a number 50 it depends it varies from one translation to the other but it is narrated by Aisha brother Mustafa narrated Asha Asha may Allah be pleased with her the prophet salallahu alaihe seldom like to begin with the right and putting on his sandals combing his hair his purification and in all his affairs no this hadith is agreed upon which means that both Bihari and Muslim the renowned compilers of hadith reported this hadith so this is the highest in authentication after the Holy Quran Aisha is the wife of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam ah who I heard he said them she is telling us she is teaching us she is describing to us how the prophet prophet sallallaahu SLM used to like always beginning with the right side the right hand this is only in the things that are honored and she is giving us an example he used to like to begin with the right when he is wearing his sandals so he begins with the right foot rather than the left and when he is combing his hair so he starts with the right side rather than the left and in purification whenever he wants to perform ablution now these are honoured things can any of you think of other things that the Prophet used to use the hand the right hand in solemn Fatih it's awesome used to also eat with his right hand he used to eat with his right hand what else that summer drinking and eating using the right hand and why is that simply because the prophet sallallaahu REO told us that using the left hand in eating or in drinking is imitating or resembling Satan way of drinking and eating that's why we have to be away from that we have to refrain from doing that also in entering places the prophet sallallaahu reo seldom used to enter certain places using beginning with his right foot such as mosques massage it whenever you enter you enter with your right foot but when you exit you use your left foot now vice versa when you enter a toilet WC bathroom now this is a filthy pray place it's not an honored place so you big you enter it beginning with your left foot but when you exit it you use your right foot so if we look at this hadith we know that the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to like beginning with his right side and the things that are honored such as evolution which is our chapter now the dishonored things things that are not that preferred in Islam such as removing filth you don't use the right to use the left so if someone is cleaning himself if someone urinates and wants to clean his private parts is forbidden for him to use his right hand he has to use his left hand because it's a dirty thing it's a filthy thing unfortunately a lot of the Muslims nowadays seem to drift away from this Sunnah now what we see in lots of restaurants or during their eating habits they're trying to imitate the non-muslims that is by holding the fork in their left hand and holding the knife in the right hand and when they eat they use their left hand and this is forbidden prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said that if one of you eats he should use his right hand also if he wants to drink also if he wants to give someone something or to take something from someone he should always use his right hand because the Prophet justified so lala haria Selim because Satan eats and drinks gives and takes using his left hand now of course the question would be we didn't see Satan that's true but we believe in his existence as we did not see our spirits yet we believe that you are alive and there are spirits within us so let's not get into this and try to continue with our hadith the Prophet sallallaahu Salem used to like to begin with his right hand side in the good things such as purification such as boo-boo such as ablution and we will get on to this insha Allah to Hadees after this hadith the following hadith please excuse me what about Sokka are we supposed to use a right hand or left hand see what what is see walk see whack is a small stick that is usually taken from the ground this is a sea whack and it sits like a toothbrush and it is one of the sooners one of the things recommended by the Prophet RA salat-u-salam when you perform ablution and before you go into Salah it's a Sunnah that you brush your teeth using this sea walk why it gives it a good scent and it cleans and and and because it's a healthy thing now brother Fadi is asking should we use it while using it using the right hand or the left hand scholars have different opinions depending on how you look at it if you look at c-walk as removing food and dirty things from your mouth then you should use the left hand but if you look at it as a form of worship and a form of preparing to meet your Creator in prayer and to stand humbly with submissiveness in front of allah azza wa jal then you should use the right hands and it's it's it goes both ways so it's not a big issue at home Dalila the following hadith please narrated abu huraira run almost messenger sallallaahu hollywood's announced 8 when you perform ablution begin with the right side now again this hadith falls into the same category of the previous one beginning with your right side as a reminder there are pillars for evolution the fifth pillar is sequence it is a pillar of ablution that you follow the sequence the sequence that is mentioned in the Quran you should wash your face you should wash your arms you should wipe over your head and you should wash your feet to the ankles now these are four pillars and they have to be in sequence now beginning with your right or with your left does not fall in this category because it's not a pillar it's a Sunnah the Prophet says in this hadith if you start if you if you perform ablution start using the right hand side so is this a must or it's a recommendation usually if it's an order the Prophet tells you do this then it's a must unless there is what we call a karena something that makes this most recommended and the karena here is the census of the scholars and the whirring of the companions such as imam ali bin ABI talib may allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet Allah so Salam and his son-in-law he said that it doesn't matter whether I start with my left or with my right as long as I'm following the sequence of face arms head and the feet this is the most important thing it's recommended that you start with your right but if somebody starts with his left then his ruler is considered to be correct now this means that if I'd like to what's the first thing that I should begin in Moodle and you have to understand I'm saying you should you must not it's preferable what's the first thing that a Muslim should start with while performing Moodle nice mentioned in the Quran of course we're leaving aside the intention we were leaving aside al best men are saying bismillah so what's the first thing we should start with washing the hands no that's not true because the Quran says wash your faces so washing the hand at the very beginning is not a must it is a Sunnah so if somebody goes to the bathroom turns on the faucet and immediately starts turning the water in his mouth rinsing his nose washing his face his rule is 100% correct what happens if somebody goes in and washes the face first then Renzi's his sniffs the water in his nose then turned the water in his mouth lastly what would what would what do this is the same thing as beginning left to right it's the same thing so as long as you're keeping the secrets of one two three four your oak you know in each category what do you begin with left to right cleaning your nose washing your face or whatever then it is all accepted and it's all part of your wouldl that is accepted Isha allah by allah azza wajal my cameraman tells me that we have to stop for a short break so stay tuned and we will meet you in sha allah in a jiffy questions that bother you what about issues of concern to you would you like to share things on your mind with us are you interested in solutions based an Islamic perspective please join me live in meet your advisor every Friday at 9 p.m. Mecca time here Oh Oh salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah welcome back hadith number 52 brother Fatih please narrated Elmo via tube Neshoba may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallaahu Selim performed ablution wiping his forelock and over his turban and shoes this hadith was reported by Muslim so it's a it's an authentic hadith now we know that one should wipe his hair if he has hair he should wipe his head now in this hadith the Prophet sallallaahu are they would have said them did not take his turban off so is it permissible for me to wipe on my hat my baseball cap is it permissible for me to wipe on whatever I'm wearing on my head or what scholars say that wiping over the thing that you're wearing on your head depends on how easy it is or difficult to remove so if it's an easy thing to take off such as what I'm wearing on my head then it's a must that you remove it and wipe over your head but if you're wearing a turban like the some of the brothers that you know make the turbans round and round and they would probably take ages it's just like 20 feet long and the guy spends like an hour just turning on on his head and then you tell him well it's prayer time you have to remove it it's a little bit difficult and the prophets of our salaam tells us that islam is easy so to those who have difficulties in removing the turbans hamdulillah Islam tells you keep it and just wipe over because it's considered to be part of your head likewise sisters that are out of their houses they are in a supermarket they are in the garden they are out exposed and it's difficult for them to remove their head scarves so Islam tells them it's okay for them to wipe over their Tamar or over their head scarf wiping over the sandals or the shoes I think we'll get to that later on in sha Allah so we will not elaborate on hit the following hadith for the summer narrated by jabber bin abdul-allah or Jalan on the nature of the prophets solo island privileged pilgrimage he saw us Adam said begin with what Allah had begun with of course we've we talked about this and saying that it's recommended that one starts with the right hand now but if you come and look at this hadith it tells you that you have to begin with what Allah began with Allah did not mention in the Quran beginning with the right or left is that true when when performing ablution Allah began with washing the faces washing the arms wiping the head and washing the feet so it is a must that you follow this sequence because the Prophet says begin with what Allah began with and although this hadith is in the dealing with pilgrimage of course if you go to Safa and Marwah while making sorry you should start with suffer because allah says in the quran in the Safa Marwah time in sha allah so allah began with suffer so if somebody comes in and said well it's a little bit crowded in suffer I'm gonna begin with Marwa we tell him that this is not acceptable because the Prophet tells us begin with what Allah so John has begun with likewise in Woodill if someone goes into the toilet and wants to perform ooodle and this happens with a lot of us he washes his face you know gargles and rinses his nose and then wipes his head and while raising his foot to wash it he remembers that he did not wash his and so is it okay now I remember you gotta wash my hands and then move on to my feet would this be acceptable no why because he did not follow the sequence he went from face to wiping the head without washing the hands the arms so he has to repeat where he missed which is washing the arms then wipe the head again then wash his feet to the ankles hadith number 54 brother Mustafa narrated Jerry bin abdullah may allah be pleased with him whenever the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam preferred ablution he used to flow water abundantly on his elbows this hadith tells us that the elbows are included in evolution because the Quran the verse of the Quran says that wash your arms to the elbows so to the elbows might mean that the elbows are not included but the Sunnah explains the quran' clarifies the Quran because it was revealed to the prophet salallahu alaihe salam who is telling us what is the meaning of this particular verse and how to apply so the Prophet says erase a lot of surat or the prophets doing salah Mahadeo salem it was that he used to turn the water on the elbows which means that you have to include the elbows when performing ablution hadith 5555 know narrated abu huraira wrote a loved one who a lost messenger salallahu alayhi wa sallam said if anyone doesn't mention a lost name while performing ablution he's they're not credited with having performative okay what does mentioning Allah's name mean Samer more possibly making the intent to perform we do in supplication okay Moustafa okay this is what we mean by mentioning mentioning Allah's name which which we call an arabic basmala saying bismillah and this is one of the greatest things that a person says in the name of Allah what's in the name of Allah I begin evolution when we eat it's a must that we say bismillah what do you mean by bismillah means in the name of Allah I eat in the name of Allah I entered the mosque in the name of Allah I do this and I do that and this shows you how well connected we are to our Lord we never ever start anything without saying in the name of Allah bismillah yes fighting should we say bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim or just bismillah which one is now what the prophet salallahu alaihe salam taught us was bismillah so it's preferable that we stick to what the prophet salallahu alaihe salam has taught us one would say a rahmani raheem are attributes of allah so what what harm is there when we say it well this can be argued say okay aziz al Jabar are also attributes of allah so why not say bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim aziz al Jabar Malik and Mohammed and go on to mention Allah's attributes like 99 of them and this is endless the food would be called and you're not gonna be able to eat and you have to follow the following prayer this is not intended Allah tells you do this do it the Prophet SAW said Allah did something that is very nice and very easy for us to apply then we should follow suit we there's no reason for us to add things to innovate because if there were any good in it the Prophet would have done it a lot to Sarah and then we would have followed him so he only told us say bismillah Abdullah this is more than enough so we say bismillah and lots of things in everything we do just to be connected with alonzo gel to seek His blessing to seek His guidance and to seek his support and anything we do as humans we are vulnerable we were weak we don't have any powers we get all the powers from allah azzawajal that is why we say bismillah the Prophet tells us that if you do not say bismillah when performing ablution then you're a brush evolution is not accepted there's a dispute lots of opinions from the scholars regarding this issue saying bismillah the most authentic one without getting into details is that if you forget or if you do not know it's a must then your ablution is accepted and it's correct but if you intentionally do not mention Allah's name you feel intentionally neglect saying bismillah you don't want to say like a lot of arrogance what area the villa and I don't think that there is a Muslim that does this but hypothetically speaking if someone does it then his guru his ablution is not accepted and it's void so it's it's a very important thing that one recalls the issue is that lots of people say okay now I'm in the toilet and usually we have Woodill places in the same places where one answers a call of nature so what should I say should I say bismillah although I'm in the toilet or should I conceal that and say it in myself any whatever you do it is okay because even our toilets nowadays are not the same toilet says at the time of the Prophet that is a son because there is no filth there is no dirt it's all gone into the sewer and it's lots of toilets are so clean their median cleaner than a lot of people's bedrooms always washed and hygiene and cleaned regularly so whatever you do it's okay for you to say bismillah and commence and begin with your ablution hadith 56 we're not gonna go through this hadith number 57 narrated the masseur off from his father and the authority of his grandfather may Allah be pleased with them I saw a Las prophet salaallah alayhi wasallam rinsing his mouth and snuffing up water separately now this hadith has a weak chain what does it tell us it tells us that the Prophet used to wash his mouth and after he finishes takes new water and rinse or sniff up to his nostrils with the new water now this is not in accordance to the Sunnah because this is regarded as a weak hadith it's not authentic now the following hadith is more authentic and it follows the Sunnah hadith number 58 which reads narrated by Ali modulo I know on the nature of ablution then he the Prophet solano 7 rinsed his mouth and cleared his nose three times rinsing the mouth and clearing the nose from the very same hand by which he had taken water no this is the Sunnah the sinner is once you want to rinse your mouth and nose sniff the nose you use one scoop of water and half of it you take it into your mouth turn the water in and sniff the other half in one scoop now lots of people don't do this lots of people wash their mouths separately then rinse their noses separately and this is not in accordance the pseudonym but what happens if I do so is my Moodle is my evolution void answer is no your ablution is accepted and it's correct but you did not follow the Sunnah 100% so this is the Sunnah you should try your best in following it the following hadith abdullah bin zaid on the nature of ablutions then he the prophet sallallahu alaihi Salam inserted his hand rinse it his smart and snap it up water from one hand during that three times okay and here it tells us that it's the same manner but doing it three times and you either do it once twice or three times you have the option the Prophet did all of these three during the whole evolution whether you do it once twice or three times it's up to you whether you do some limbs once the others twice the others three times also again it is acceptable this is the prophet's way of doing it and I think that with this we should conclude our program there are a few issues still related but inshallah we will talk about them in the following program and until we meet fear Manilla assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
