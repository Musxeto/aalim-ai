  "transcript": "if my habits on the lawn while you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the show that he gave he be screaming after no baronies well saying you're too late assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to another episode of contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV I'm your host our camera sheen this episode is a continuation of last episode in which we were speaking about free mixing and gender interactions in Islam so let's start off by welcoming and introducing our wonderful guest chef assimil Hakim a cinematic when welcome to the show why you can sit down to LA and dessert melaka for having me chef it's always wonderful to have you you know i say it in every episode but it truly is and obviously last episode we've laid down some of the foundations and you've spoken about the different societies how they interact between genders within their societies and you give a wonderful breakdown of the different types of scholars you said there was a scholar of the government the scholar of the ummah or the people and the scholar of the quran and listen as the scholar of the midler and you know this was a wonderful categorization if we can say of the different types of scholars and who should we go to to find the actual Islamic rulings of segregation and we said the next episode that we do because we couldn't fit it into 30 minutes that we will speak about the boundaries that Islam has set if you know interactions do take place so let's start off by something that's very common which is when the lack of interaction happens when there's sorry when there's a complete when there's complete segregation and lack of interaction one interaction does occur it's as if something completely taboo if for example if you see a woman's eye you know run away or it becomes something like people are almost scared of women and for example if you call your friend on the phone and his wife picks up you know what are you do in that situation you just hang up or should she just hang up it becomes almost rude in certain situations so how do we you know handle this okay smooth out handle all sorts of stuff so you learn here I gonna tell you before job again we go back to the balance moderation we have extremes on one hand we have those who see that there shouldn't be any kind of segregation so we have PE physical education classes boys and girls swimming together boys and girls playing sports together and this is a problem and on the other hand you have those who as you've described are too extreme so his wife's friend calls on the phone the minute he hears a female's voice he hangs up and if he sees a woman in the street he goes the other way and he starts to panic now this is an Islamic the middle path is that you follow the and the Sunnah in terms of looking it is the right thing to do not to get to look to lower your gaze this is what Islam tells us in surah - Noor Allah Azza WA JAL says cool mini Nia would looming upside and say and tell the believers to lower from their gaze meaning that not to completely not look because someone says ok I'm gonna drive I'm not gonna look I'm gonna low my gait boom are you insured what happens see the Quran told me to lure Mike is it oh yeah old dope meaning yeah any from but not all of it and that is the similar thing when it comes to doubting age attainable Cathy Rodman Irvin avoid a lot of suspicion and speculations because some of it is sinful okay what are the majority the majority can't be truthful but due to the influence of this little the whole thing is Haram and due to the influence of your gaze because it's like an poisoned arrow you may look at this woman oh she is ugly the other one she's fat the third one she is short and you take this as a trend and you look and send your gaze freely without a problem but when the right moment clicks Japan knows what may should tick so when she comes that is the love of my life and this is the one that I'm willing to go to hell with stuff allowed to believe this is how Satan works he builds up these things and make you look at them as nothing there's you know small sins no problem so this comes when we talk about sending your gaze if you walk the Prophet said that I saw some to Adi his cousin and his son-in-law at the same time which brings us to the issue which is quite common in the West that it is prohibited to marry your cousin in Islam its opposite way around a lot of the people in the state stay she's my cousin she's my mom so no she's not the Prophet I saw Sarah gave his daughter to his cousin Adi and he himself married his cousin Zainab ajosh the Prophet Isis I'm mad at his cousin and so on so the Prophet said to Holly you have the first look and the second look is against you which means that you may walk on the street you see a bombshell walking accidentally you look and you see her now the duration of your look counts so if you say say okay I'm not gonna blink I'm just you know yeah I'm not gonna break the minute you blink this is the first look no the minute you see her this accidental look is free the second one you have to pay for so the second one don't go back and this shows you the amount of Tolerance in Islam because it doesn't tell you walk looking at your feet until you bang into the light pole or whatever no look around but when you see something Haram then you have to look the other way around this is what it comes to looking when it comes to interaction so if I meet someone in the street if I go to a shopping center and I need to buy something there's no males to sell if I go to hospital this happens in Islamic countries and you find the nurse with the doctor and you need to take a prescription medicine do something of the sort you may ask you may communicate because this is a necessity but don't take your time and Liberty to do whatever you think it's normal so yes I go and look down at the desk or the papers excuse me can you please now give me the prescription that doctor give to me but can I have your ID card without looking but if you go and start flirting say hi you look her in the eyes with a big smile and say hi I need my prescription please haven't we met before oh god we have to stop meeting like this what are you doing or cracking jokes okay part of being a Muslim I have to be you know like hip and I have to make an influence over the others because I want to give their work what kind of a dower is this is that what to help not dare to Islam Islam tells you to be respectful to maintain your dignity cracking jokes with the opposite gender third thing and talking cheap like this this is not Islam so it tells you to be moderate in some societies the voice of a woman they consider to be Iowa it's a taboo and they refer some of the bad ones not the practicing Muslims some of the nomads they refer to their wives and daughters as in a third party a way so yeah yeah the family and I went to this place you know lousy job protect you so they put words to show that they are dishonored of having women attached to them some of them even put them in the backseat when they drive so he put his wife in the backseat this was long ago done by ignorant people but they have this form of being extreme and looking down at women Islam doesn't treat women like this in the quran surat al museo della a woman came to the Prophet Isis Salam when he was with his companions and asked about a question they heard her voice the Prophet didn't say to her don't speak to me in front of these men they're not Muharram no she was abiding by the hijab and she communicated that the Prophet s design without softening her voice sometimes you get a call from a female operator or a sales or marketing agent assalamu alaykum what the heck is happening what are you doing and some of them speak in a very lowering voice is this Islam is this moderate it's not prohibits this Allah so judge says what I have on a bill code for my lady if you can't be him a lot and they should not soften their voice and speak in an ill-mannered so that those who have illness in their heart would not be lured and tempted Allah is protecting our hearts is purifying our hearts so you have to be balanced between the two not to lift all veils and barriers and have it free mixed mmm and nothing is bad at at the same time not go to extremes and treating them as HIV positive people that you have to quarantine yourself from okay another very contemporary issue when it comes to gender interactions in gender mixing I mean obviously there's rules for what is the order of a women in Islam and there's rules for what is the order of men what is considered private parts what they have to cover under Islamic law now many people say that because Society has sexualized men to a new extent that was never done before you know there's many ads with men's without amendment without their shirt you know showing ads and they're saying that the society nowadays have sexualized men in a way that it was never done before that it's not fair that the men's era is until the naval and you know women have to cover you know a lot more how do we deal with situations like this women come up with the idea that well we're attracted to men in the same way I mean especially because they're so sexualized nowadays that you know how come men can walk without shirts I mean this will be attractive as well just as a woman you know if she's uncovered so well I beg to differ because this is not the case do you never see in a TV ad a man making an ad of his Mustang g/t or driving a beautiful bike shirtless unlike women you would find an ad for a trucks tire and the woman is wearing a bikini what's the relation between a tire of a truck and the woman being nude women are being sexualized given as a symbol of sex and this is part of degrading women in the West they say that we have segregation in Islam and we are degrading women and suppressing them and doing all this the whole nine yards of a fox TV and and and and CNN etc but actually they're the one who are doing this and exposing women to a lot of fitnah and making them as sex symbols and that's why they have the highest rate of rape worldwide like in an FBI report I read a couple of years ago there's a woman being raped in the US every three or seven seconds what is this and this is a free country we have no segregation men and women are alike they go to University is high schools and everything is happier we are civilized no you're not think again this is not a civilization this is not something to be proud of what you must be proud of of maintaining the dignity and honor of the people hamdulillah and these are not man-made laws these are divine laws to protect now what was the question again I forgot well the question was that basically nowadays men are also sexualized as low-key so ok I get I get the question they say that women have desires and they look at men as men look at them and this is completely false out of experience if you get a hundred man a hundred men and some of them are practicing Muslims some of them are not some of them are disbelievers some of them are believers and you get a bombshell to walk in between them I guarantee you that 99% of them will have their heads turned and they would look even hundred for the first probably and they will be Wow this is man's nature but if you have a 100 women some of them are veiled some of them are not some of them believing and you get like Tom Cruise or or George Clooney to walk in between because probably they're married or they have still some bashfulness and chastity in them so men are far worse than women when it comes to sending the gays and looking at etc and that is why in Islam men are allowed to marry up to 4 so that they can curb this desire in a lawful way while women by nature can only love one man this is the norm maybe there is something that is abnormal or unnatural with some women who have lost all types of MA the ste in chastity but this is rare and this is why they say torn between two lovers feeling like a fool loving both of you is breaking all the rules by disbelievers definition she's torn between two lovers because she only loves one this is the nature of women now I want to get further into or just a little further into segregation but before we do that we're gonna go for a short break so stay tuned welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues now before we went for that short break we were speaking about segregation in Islam and a free mixing and gender interactions and we said when we were going to come back from that break we will get further into segregation now sure many people say I mean we spoke about the rules on segregation Islam but many people say well segregation isn't from Islam it's a completely new thing if we look at the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam time we can see that in his mosque it wasn't segregated men men and women didn't have this barrier in between them women prayed in the back and men prayed in the front so this is different to what we have nowadays whereas some masajid have different rooms for women so is this from Islam or is this a bida is this a new innovation okay first of all to say or claim that there was no segregation at the time of the Prophet erase salif's era this shows that a person who says this has no knowledge of the seer has no knowledge of the evolution of fik because we know that there are things and issues in Islam that took place in the very beginning and then they were abrogated abrogated is to change the ruling so we know that in the beginning of Islam not covering the face was permissible but then allah azzawajal made that mandatory specifically for the wives of the Prophet as of Salaam and then cascade it down to all women they have to cover from head to toe only having the ability to have an opening in the face veil to look from when they go out of course if they are in their homes or within the vicinity of their moms and relatives they can wear normal clothes and and live normally but when it comes to going out and being exposed to the public they have to cover this is clearly illustrated in verse 53 of surah ahzab and verse 15 of the same surah in 53 Allah Allah is addressing the mothers of the believers that when ever the Companions asked the mother the mothers of the believers that is the wives of the Prophet said I'm four utensils for anything they must ask them from beyond a veil why Allah says this is more purer for your hearts the Companions and there's the mothers of the believers and these are the most righteous segments or Muslims at that any time but at all times that's correct so what about us and verse 59 Allah says o prophet of Allah yeahyou Hanabi tell your wives your daughters and women of the believers the believing women to lower their garments from jaribg hen so that they would not oka would not be identified hence harassed so a woman a woman is identified by her face so if you lower the face veil nobody would harass her but if she uncovered her face and she is a beautiful woman most likely those who are or have sickness in their hearts would try to harass them or to do something that is unpleasant the Prophet Isis Salam was addressed to tell his wives to do this in 59 but he we also know that they were ordered to veil in 53 so it's the same order to them and to his daughters and to hit the women of the believing men which leads us to the conclusion that at the time of the Prophet SM there was a time when women used to unveil but then this was abrogated and the Prophet Isis tom was ordered to order them to covered complete at the time of the Prophet asam there was a time when it was permissible for women and men to sit in the same room but then came the instruction to segregate as for the message of the Prophet era so salaam is totally correct to say that they used to pray in the same message it however the prophet aerosol son drew the line when he said that the best rows of men are the first and the worst rows of men are the last and the best rows of women are the last and the worst rows of women are the first so the closer men and women are together the worst the worse it is which indicates that segregation was there not only that when it comes to the wife for example mother aisha and this is an authentic hadith wanted to perform Tawaf and her companion said to her let's get closer to the Kaaba because the closer you get the narrower the circle is and the quicker you can make it work so she said are you crazy go alone we were ordered to make power off as far as possible for men I'm not gonna go in I'm gonna be at the outside circle so that I would be segregated from interacting with men so there isn't this notion of having intermixing free mixing with men and women at the time of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam there were a number a handful of incidents for example when the Prophet Azam went to battle he may have taken one or two of his wives to assist with taking care of the wounded and this was in his present that is the presence of the woman's Muharram traveling with her over looking at her deeds and and and seeing that she's not a fighter she's not a warrior but you could take care of the wound in and she can provide water to those who need it so in this concept in this frame of work yeah this is acceptable but to open it freely and say listen pre-mixing was there so I'm working 8 hours from 9:00 to 5:00 in the office and next to me is a co-worker and she comes with her miniskirts putting a makeup like a clown missing the red nose though and she has soaked herself in a bottle of perfume and then you say hey don't touch this what is this and you call this as the case at the time of the prophetesses I'm definitely not and this leads only to fire this leads only to ignition so one has to be realistic so many times we hear move these scholars saying that if the woman is properly dressed and Islamic conditions are fulfilled she can work in a mixed environment she can go to the University mixed educate co-ed acade education etc these guys are speaking from their ivory towers they've never been down to earth houston we have a problem you guys have to go down go to a university class if I go to a university class and next to me are two gorgeous girls with the shorts and inappropriate dresses and I'm trying to lower my gaze and she says excuse me can I have the homework of yesterday I wasn't there I said you have to be a good Muslim I have to respect myself ok here is this a thank you you're a charm and a few weeks later good morning good evening and hi hi we're doing is I cannot not respond to Salaam Allah tells us that if you greet it you have to respond to it with a similar rhythm or better so hmm in my case of in my point of view she says hi zone hi what is this this to reply to the greetings and then she says that we have we having a party on Saturday night so you welcome to come and join and said yeah what do you expect when you send a teenager to such a school even if you send a grown up man what will it happen so to claim and to try to make it easy that yeah the prophetís that I'm they were mixing it with today's society this is unfair but I mean at the same time it could be said for example in Muslim countries this would be easier to be applied actually so for example if I'm in Saudi Arabia be very easy for me to segregate myself and and and save myself from those type of fitness but if I'm in the West we're interaction is almost a must on a daily basis where you don't have and now everybody gets the chance to go to a segregated school now everybody gets the chance to do home schooling you know so in in this type of situation how can a Muslim conduct himself what rules should he follow how should he behave in class how should you know how should he apply the Islamic rulings to his situation obviously he can't go to a segregated school he needs to get this education what should he do then well I you have to improvise I cannot give you situation sirs to all our solutions to all these types of questions I know if I were to live in the US or in Europe I would never send my children to a mixed school maybe the male's the boys I may send them because they are boys they are the bred earners they have to pursue their schools and to pursue a career so that they can sustain a living now the ideal situation is to migrate to a Muslim country which is unfortunately I'm not possible especially with lots of the Muslim countries restrictions on visas and these is and so many things the second solution is to segregate yourself from such community and try to home-school the third situation is for sending boys only but also having Sunday school that is for our school of course and trying to give them all the necessary immune systems that would help them face what they're facing for girls I would never dare send them to such schools I've traveled to the West a lot and I still do and I've seen families coming to me crying saying one of them my daughter she's 17 she left home a week ago we don't know where she is she called us three days ago that she's with her boyfriend what can we do share so well I don't ask me I don't have solutions you wanted a good life you wanted to live the American dream or the European dream like all the brothers in Syria are doing at the moment traveling - I'd like to live in Sweden I want to live in Norway I'd like to go to Germany why because the standard of living is high and they are thinking of this type of work or type of life they're looking for is it Islamic no it's not so you should gather together the Muslim community and build a Muslim school try to make an environment where the Muslims come together preserve their religion their faith the customs and the way of living but I cannot say that if I cannot break the rules I have to bend them I'm shocked when I go to some of these seminars that these so-called dyes conduct and I see this diary Masha Allah who is eloquent masha'Allah speaks nice words or on speak Steph's ear speaks soon speaks but I see his audience free mixing and he is looking to the women and talking to them I too i cracking jokes and making fun of whatever he wants as if this is normal and I start to eat my heart out to say you're Elijah awesome what are you doing here in the wrong place you're in the wrong business he may allows you to protect us if you can't walk the talk if you can't abide by the Sunnah and you are being a role model to others in doing this if the chef does this then I can do it as well I can sit next to a woman I've seen and you've seen this like few years ago there's a message where they have the Imam as a woman and the person calling the Adana is a woman and when they pray they pray all in one row men and women what kind of a prayer is this the Imam says Easter woo I'm getting close to the one next to me following the Sunnah God it looks nice this is Islam it might be a bit funny but well like it's heartbreaking to consider these deviant ignorant imbeciles to be representing Islam they have no knowledge of Quran no knowledge of Sunna no fear of Allah in their hearts otherwise they would not have gone astray and against the way of the Prophet erase the what was said on Islam came to protect men and women but women are the magnet and this is why the Prophet I saw Sarah told us that there are so many things a woman should stay away from clothes perfumes because you may smell something that makes your head turn even the ear has a problem Allah Azza WA JAL says insert a know that women must not strike the floor with their feet so that men would not find the sound of their jewelry they're wearing on their feet now all what you hear is a sound it's like a woman wearing high heels and walking and you hear the sound of the high heels even if she is a goat camouflaged in the clothes of a woman wearing high heels it still strikes a chord in your heart I thank you very much your customer Hakim we're at the end of this episode so once again thank you very much dear viewers I hope you enjoyed and benefited from this episode and inshaallah catches for another episode of contemporary islamic issues and until then may allah subhanaw taala bless us all assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh my habits of the money you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters divided on the Sony gay you hear me screaming after the piranhas well Senor to me return to the guidance of Allah I will set you free me"
