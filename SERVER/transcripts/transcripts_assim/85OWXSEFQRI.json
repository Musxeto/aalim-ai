  "transcript": "[Questioner] she says what to do if I'm at \nschool and saw my purity can I make wudu   and pray the answer is when a person is in the \nstate of major ritual impurity and wants to pray   the prayer is invalid until that person \nuplifts the state of major ritual impurity   and this is done by having ghusl or \na total ritual bath but if a person   is unable to do this due to the fact that water \ndoes not exist not available or in the case of   illness that prevents him from using water in this \ncase a person refers to what substitutes the lack   of water or the inability to use water and this \nis known as Tayammum or dry ablution mentioned   in Surat al-Maidah chapter 5 verse number six \nand also in chapter number four Surah An-Nisa and this is done by striking the ground the \nsoil the sand once and then wiping the face   and the hands this is how it is done and \nthen she can pray so in your case Mariam   due to the fact that you're \nunable to use water you can't take   a ritual bath in at school most likely I mean \nthis is almost impossible unless they have the   facilities and you have the ability then it's \na must but if not then you can do also person   and this is a similar question someone who has \nan illness that prevents him from using water   someone with smallpox may Allah cure \nus all from such illnesses and diseases and the doctors say you cannot apply \nwater to the affected areas in this   case such a person may use Tayammum and \navoid using water insha'allahu azzawajal and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All thank you"
