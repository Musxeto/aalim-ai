  "transcript": "so like if a person give the Salam to someone and later finds out that he was a non-muslim will he be sinful for that because we know that it's not permissible to say assalamu alaikum to non-muslims Allah in Surat al-baqarah the last Ayah of Surat al-baqarah Allah says [Music] oh Allah do not hold us accountable if we were to forget or to make an error when I give salaam to someone thinking that he's a Muslim and then discover that he's sick or a Hindu I made a mistake I cannot retract this but this mistake was an honest mistake because I thought he was a Muslim therefore there is no sin none whatsoever on you for this and Allah Knows Best"
