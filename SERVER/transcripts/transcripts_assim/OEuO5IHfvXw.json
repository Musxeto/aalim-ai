  "transcript": "her mother says that she were and there was an argument between her and some of her colleagues regarding whether their these snapshots shots or pictures of the house of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and whether the cup of the prophetess is authentically attributed to him and pieces of hair etc and they used to tell her that yeah but we believe that this is belonging to the professor at Islam and Allah knows best wallah who Adam so if I understood her question she's saying is it possible to say Allahu Alem over something that you are doubtful off like they're doing or is it permissible for me I'm definitely sure that this is bogus this is not real so can I say this is not for you and Allah knows best though I'm definitely sure of that scholars say that this is part of being polite with Allah social Allah is definitely more knowledgeable than anyone else so definitely Allah knows best even if I say this hadith is in sahih al-bukhari where the Prophet says a little officer in Amman I'm Albini yet and then I say after narrating the hadith and mentioning the reference in Bukhari and Muslim and I said well ah who Adam I know for sure it is there but saying Allahu Alem is part of showing your poverty and humility to allah azzawajal by attributing knowledge only to the one who knows Subhanahu as origin therefore there is nothing wrong in that as for the topic of discussion this is a waste of time one must not engage in such arguments that do not draw him closer to allah azza wajal and Allah knows best"
