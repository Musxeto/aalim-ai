  "transcript": "Sana from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. I'm struggling with overwhelming fatigue and emotional emptiness that makes it difficult for me to do my daily life tasks, including my night prayers, which really make me sad. I want to cry and pour my heart out to Allah because I cannot do it to anyone else, but I feel blocked and overwhelmed and disconnected as well. Even when I try to enjoy life or special moments, I feel empty and question, like, why? Like, it doesn't make sense for me. And I look at the sky and see, like, how others enjoy their life, but I don't. Like, I have everything, Alhamdulillah. Even those things that I don't deserve it, but Allah has granted me those. So, can you tell me, like, how can I deeply connect with Allah, giving my satiation? So, what advice or dua you can give me? And please pray for me as well. May Allah, Azza wa Jal, place a great deal of peace, tranquility, and content in your heart. Sana, it's not possible that I address this issue on a Q&A session because this would require me to speak for the rest of the whole hour of our episode about it. I would highly recommend that you book a counseling session or you go, if I'm too expensive, which I am, go to a Muslim therapist, a real practicing Muslim therapist with knowledge of Islam, because your issue deals with therapy of how to look at things. You're feeling hollow and empty from the inside because Satan has messed up with your head for a long time. So, now you're convinced he already sold you his pitch and you bought it. And now you're convinced of it, and this is why you're finding it difficult to progress and to move on. So, you need therapy. It shouldn't take more than one session, inshallah. And may Allah make things easy for you."
