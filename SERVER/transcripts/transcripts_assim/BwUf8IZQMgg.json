  "title": "Is it permissible to use Toothpaste that contains Alcohol? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign it's similar to my last question so I found that my parents use two toothpastes okay and I read like a part of an ingredient list and it said appropriate some kind of alcohol chemically and the other one I didn't treat at all so I I don't there may be some kind of alcohol in there I don't know whether the substance is intoxicated intoxicated intoxicating at all and I don't know the percentage so do I then say a default it's hadel or must I investigate and this is this this is so much of this is so can you use it you have all you have all no problem in using it first of all the default is everything is halal until proven otherwise second of all the the presence of alcohol does not mean that the substance is Haram for example we know that vanilla extract extracts is dipped into like 90 of alcohol so that it can be manufactured processed until we get the end result of the vanilla now I eat oatmeal those who say oh sheikhasam drinks beer I eat a lot of ice cream and it includes vanilla you eat a lot of ice cream cones does it intoxicate you the answer is no though there is presence of maybe point zero three percent of alcohol it has no significance it doesn't intoxicate it's not brandy or gin or a ROM that is present which is intoxicating by itself no it's it's alcohol alcohol can be found in some fruits in some breads in some dairy products maybe I don't know but with negligible amount of a percentage which has no impact on making it therefore use the toothpaste use the mouthwash use the cologne with alcohol that is 70 80 percent there's nothing wrong in that and Allah Knows Best you"
