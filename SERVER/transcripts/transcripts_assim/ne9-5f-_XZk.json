  "transcript": "sh he he was told what is going on and he came to my house they wrote I yeah I was not I was just happy because I have somebody to to stand up beside me where was that zah where was that where was it now it's four years ago where in which country in my country Kenya okay and after that you did not register your marriage in in uh civil court or in uh no the sh the that Imam told us he can go because I was on I was almost one one month to to come to Saudi Arabia it was almost one month to come to Saudi Arabia so I told the man you and the IM you can go to the registration but I don't know if we got the the the certificate or not so now the man is where here or in Kenya in Kenya so I walking okay I suggest that you go to Kenya and go with this man to the Muslim Shar court and register your marriage because you were not a mus because you were a Muslim and had no Guardian the rule is that the marriage in order to be authentic the Muslim judge who is the Muslim ruler or the authorized Imam of the Islamic Center giving the power to give and conduct such marriages must be your W now this did not take place some schools of thought say if a woman has no muslim W none whatsoever she may appoint a man who's Muslim to be her guardian and it seems to me that this shikh was your guardian at the time however if there's a dispute between you and your so-called husband this cannot be solved long distance you have to go back to Kenya you have to approach the Shar court and tell them about your story and they will Rectify it either write a new marriage contract or look at your contract and say that this is avoid an invalid contract because of one 123 as for the Mahar the Mahar is not a condition to be given immediately it can be postponed a year 2 5 10 maybe more than that and the wife can easily say I forgive you take the Mah I don't need it I have money it's a gift from me this is mentioned in chapter 4 in the beginning ofah where Allah says a woman can forgive her husband her Mahar if she wants as a gift or some of it uh therefore my main concern is that you rectify the marriage contract authenticate it and get a certificate because with this certificate in the future he cannot hold you uh uh accountable a he can go and migrate to France for example and then you look for him I want to divorce I cannot where is he I don't know okay you come to me as a a judge and you say I would like to divorce my husband I say bring me paper to prove that he's married to you you see I don't have any paper I said bring the witnesses I said I don't know where the Witnesses are they're gone no these things are required so that you can authenticate your marriage and after that inshallah if everything will be rectified okay so okay"
