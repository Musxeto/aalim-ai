  "title": "Ruling on Court Marriage / Civil Marriage in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sumayya says what's the ruling on court marriage will it be considered halal in islam court marriage is a bit um generic what is meant by court marriage so sumaia if you are asking about what is happening a lot in the west or in the east or in any non-muslim country where they the couple get married in court in what is known as civil marriage civil marriage if it fulfills the conditions of the islamic marriage it is valid what are the conditions of the islamic marriage number one the consent of the girl so she's not forced to be married rather she accepts the marriage number two the approval consent and the proposal of the guardian of the girl who's usually her father number three the acceptance of the groom and number four the presence of two muslim male witnesses so if they all go to a civil court and they say we would like to register the marriage and the clerk takes the data and whether there is a thun or an imam or a mawlana or not it's not part of the marriage by the way so when the father says i give you my daughter fatima in marriage to you ali and ali says i accept her marriage to myself and there are two male witnesses cousins brothers friends random people muslim witnesses male in this case when he says i accept the marriage is done and she is his wife now whatever the civil servant does registering giving the papers tomorrow next week it doesn't matter the marriage is done in his presence or in his absence this is the islamic marriage so if this is what you mean by court marriage if the conditions are fulfilled this is totally halal but if it is not fulfilled if these conditions are not fulfilled meaning that a boyfriend and a girlfriend they go to a court and they just registered that they married no guardian no witnesses simply a civil servant writing the contract this is zina this is fornication this is not a marriage that is valid and even worse when you refer to court marriage as some immigrants do so a lot of the poor muslims ignorant poor muslims in countries around the world in arabia and elsewhere they go on social media and they target someone who's from america from germany from england from europe anywhere whether she's middle-aged or more and they get in a relationship online and he plays the role of uh someone who's in love and he proposes so that he only goes to that country and gets their citizenship the green card or the passport or residency so that he would work and leave his poor background and environment in his country so actually he's not interested in marriage and when he goes to that country whether they get married for real or not the vast majority simply hire a woman and they sign a contract of marriage but they don't have any physical relationship they don't live together they don't even know one another but it's only on document so that he could get the residency in that country this is totally prohibited in islam this is cheating this is lying this is mocking allah and this is referring to divorce marriage divorce marriage divorce marriage so by by marrying for this with this intention and not a real marriage that would be mocking the signs of allah and allah azzawajal knows best"
