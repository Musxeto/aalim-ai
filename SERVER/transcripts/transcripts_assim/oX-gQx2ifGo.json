  "title": "Must I pay zakat on the money that people borrowed from me (loan) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "his question is as follows every beginning of let's say the month of safar i pay my zakat however six months ago i gave 10 000 euros to a friend and he promised to pay them back on december which is four months or three months from today which is my zakat date so now today is the first of safar for example and i have to pay my zakat i calculated the wealth i have and i found that it is twenty thousand euros so should i give zakat on twenty thousand euros or thirty thousand euros the most authentic opinion is that you have to give it on the thirty thousand euros because you are the one who gave him this extension or this deadline because if it was not covered by a deadline you didn't tell him to bring it on december or and you just indefinitely gave him a loan on the first of safar which is today i'll give him a call and say hey listen bro you know the ten thousand uh euros you you borrowed i need them back if he says i don't have the money give me some time or he says prove it you don't i don't owe you anything this means that i cannot have access to that wealth and this means that i don't pay zakat but because i gave him the ultimatum i set the deadline for him this means that i have to pay it today when my zakat is you and allano's best you"
