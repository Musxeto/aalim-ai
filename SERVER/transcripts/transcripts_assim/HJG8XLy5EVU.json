  "title": "Validity of prayer when food is ready or when  trying to suppress the urge of using the bathroom",
  "transcript": "brother Abu Yussef had the third question and his question basically was about if there is about five minutes for a comma the congregation would be called after 5 minutes and I feel the urge to answer the call of nature should I go and answer the call of nature or suppress it and pray there is the hadith that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said that there is no salat when a person is suppressing the need to go and answer the call of not nature or in the presence of food there is no salat scholars said that this means that there is no salat perfect not that there is no salat valid the salah is valid if this food is served then you go and pray while thinking of the food and you're hungry you're you are sinful for going against the sunnah but your prayer is valid likewise if you want to answer the call of nature and you have the urge to do so yet you still go and pray you have gone against the instruction of the Prophet Ali selection but the prayer is valid so it is up to you brother Abu Yussef if it's five minutes before Obama and you don't feel the real urge see the hadith is you deaf ear o Allah saying he is fighting someone who is really suppressing it not having just yeah if I go to the bathroom yeah but I think I can wait for a couple of more hours this guy is not suppressing it this is normal but if someone says I think I can hold it for about 7 minutes or 10 minutes and during the prayer he is just moving around in jumping and up and down just to get the feeling away from him no this is definitely not the right thing to do you have to go and relieve yourself and perform Moodle if you come before the Akama you pray the Sunnah if not you can make it up after words and I hope this answers your question"
