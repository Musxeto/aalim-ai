  "transcript": "So the Khimar that i wear during prayer is kind of \nthin and most of the prayer Khimar in my country   becomes thin after we wash them and I saw after \na prayer that my earrings are kind of visible   through my Khimar and if I look closely my ear \nis kind of visible it's not visible from far at   all but when I look closely in the mirror then \nit's visible I saw an Islamicq&a that it's okay   if it's only visible if someone looks closely \nso is it okay to wear it during prayer the best   and safest thing to do is to ask yourself can I \nwear this Khimar and go out of the house with it   or would I be fine if Non-Mahram look at \nme fully covered but with such a Khimar or   would you feel hesitant if you feel hesitant \nand that no it's a little bit too transparent   it's a little bit too clear to show \nwhat's underneath in this case do   not pray in it and wear something \nthat is thick and Allah Knows Best"
