  "title": "Reliable Website to Learn your Islam from: https://islamqa.info - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Islam Q and.info is one of the most trusted Islamic websites in the world and I have experienced this website for the past like 20 years maybe more since the mid 90s or late '90s and they work really hard and they ask Scholars directly and take the fatwas from real Scholars not like us Tom Dicker Harry so it is a trusted website and the fatwas are also trustworthy however in so many cases the issue is with our understanding or in comparing Apple to Apple so it is not advis ible for a Layman to go and look for an answer to his question that may not fit the question that he's reading on that website people divorce their wives and all of a sudden they say I found a fatwa on this particular site and it says that the divorce is invalid or the divorce is valid not knowing that there is a little difference between your situation ation and the situation of the person who asked the question in the first place therefore one has to be careful in implementing and applying such fatwas to them uh to their uh selves now the question that we have here at uh um from Hussein of course we have the um link or the title of Islam q& a.info which I highly recommend people to visit it on regular basis because it is a great source of information and to learn about Islam from such website"
