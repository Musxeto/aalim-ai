  "transcript": "Sufyan from France. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. So scholars say that it's not permissible to make wudu with water that has changed color or smell even due to things like perfume or mist. So my question is like when I put perfume or mist for example in my wrist or behind my ears and when it's a time for prayer and I do wudu, when I wipe my ears the water reaches the place where I put the perfume and smell the perfume comes out. Does this make my my life invalid? First of all Sufyan, you must not come or jump to conclusions. You have to learn and understand what you learn and this is why it's dangerous sometimes to learn from teachers who do not explain the full picture for you. What you have heard is correct when we talk about an amount of water that we perform wudu with. So we can only perform wudu with water. What if the color or the smell or the taste of this water changes if one of the three characteristics, color, smell and taste, if one of them changes with an impurity. This is totally haram to use. It's the whole thing is najis. Capish? Understood? Yes, no problem. Okay we come to the second part. If this water changes one of its characteristics with a pure substance, ah it's different. So this mug I put in it a drop or two of lemon. It tastes lemonade-y but it's not lemon, it's water still. Or I put some flour or I put some rose water. It smells nice, tastes nice, it's still water. I can still perform wudu. A drop of musk fell into it, no problem. But if I bring a tea bag and I soak it and I throw it out, tea is pure. The characteristics, color, taste and smell has changed. Can I perform wudu from this? The answer is no. Why? Because now this is not water with a drop of musk, this is tea. So it's transformed totally to a different substance. It's not water, it's called tea. So your question has no place in our situation because you're performing wudu, the musk is under your ear or on your cheeks. I wash my face, the water covers all of my face and I can smell the musk, no problem. It has no impact on this being called water or the water in my hands being called water or the water on my face being called water. And I hope this answers your question."
