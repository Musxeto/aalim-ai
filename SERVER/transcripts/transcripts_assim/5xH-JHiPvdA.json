  "transcript": "suha says is reciting the dua of kenzu permissible i personally did not know what this dua is and i had to look for it and i found that it starts with and all these words are beautiful names of allah azzawajal but this is not from the quran nor it is from the sunnah and i don't know what is the rest of the dua what does it include so the default or the rule of thumb is whenever someone gives you a dua or gives you a zikr and tells you to recite it before salat after salat in the middle of the night on the 24th of the month at a specific time at a specific location at a specific number and you have to say this five times ten times 114 times etc this is an innovation if the dua or zikr is random is general and the meaning is okay this is permissible permissible for you to say it without attaching it to a specific form of worship or a date or a time or thinking that this would add value because it is something closer to the sunnah or something similar to that this is the general rule and allah knows best"
