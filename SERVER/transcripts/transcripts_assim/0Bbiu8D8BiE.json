  "title": "Competing in Righteousness & having Sincerity (Ikhlas) Vs Showing off - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdulla man says we are told to compete in righteousness but does not that go against Klaus sincerity should you be doing things for Allah sake only and not for surpassing others in show-off how do we reconcile well there's a very thin line of the rapid ramen there's a very thin line between competing with others plus showing off and sincerity if you know that what you're doing is for the sake of Allah and you're competing not to win but rather to reach Allah first and to please Allah first and you're not showing off so that people would praise you then there's no contradiction romanovna Bob once said to himself today I will surpass Abu Bakr in charity cuz every time he comes first so today I'm gonna do something for the sake of Allah see not for the sake of competing but rather for the sake of Allah Azza WA JAL so he went to the Prophet are a Salaam and he presented the Prophet with some wealth so the Prophet al-islam prayed for him may Allah bless your health and wealth what did you leave for your family so Omar said exactly equal to it meaning I brought to you all prophet of Allah 50% of my entire wealth so the Prophet accepted it omar said after a while abu bakr came with a bundle of wealth and he put it in front of the prophetess and said this is for Allah and his messenger so the Prophet prayed for him as well and asked o Abu Bakr what did you leave for your family and a worker said I left for them allah and his messenger salallahu alaihe salam meaning that this is 100% this is my entire wealth I'm giving it all for the sake of Allah when Omar saw this he said by Allah I'll never compete with you Abu Bakr again it's not feasible I can't catch up with you so these two were not competing to show off definitely they were among the most sincere of Allah servants but they were doing what they're doing for the sake of Allah alone and if they saw others exceeding them they would compete with them to please Allah not to surpass them or to overtake them for the sake of a race or a competition but rather for the sake of reaching allah azza wajal first so there's no problem now when would there be a problem this is when you do what you do just to show people that listen I did this I did that like hymnal Josie and and I've said this so many times wrote in his beautiful book say they'll happen that I went into a Masjid in al kufan in Iraq with a friend of mine before the event of fire and we saw a man praying night prayer tragedy next to a candle to a lantern whatever so I said to my friend look at his prayer masha'Allah how beautiful it is and apparently the man heard me so he wrapped up his prayer and came to us and said when and if you like my prayer what would you say if you knew that I've been fasting for the past twenty years even though Joseph says look at this fool for shop for the sake of showing off he erased all the good deeds that he had done for twenty years because he did it to impress people not for the sake of Allah so just so if you know that you're competing so that people would say you're the best in reciting the Quran or in fasting voluntary fasts or in prayers and not for the sake of Allah you should refrain but if not and you know that this guy memorizes the whole Quran and you only memorize 25 Jews oh so you compete internally so that you would reach 30 Jews and be like him this is a positive thing to do and a large those'll knows best"
