  "title": "When does one emit Mathi and how to become pure from it",
  "transcript": "Tayyiba from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, if thoughts of past romantic talkings with one's husband comes during prayer, will it secrete madhi? I check frequently but sometimes I found dryness. Maximum times I found dryness but sometimes I found something wet. What can I do? This is something no one can answer you. People speaking to their spouses passionately, they differ. Some would emit prosthetic fluid or pre-cum or madhi and some would not be impacted or affected by that. So this is not a one size that fits all. People differ depending on their nature, depending on how long they've been married. Now if a woman finds wetness but this wetness was similar and exactly the same as her vaginal discharges, there's no reason for her to assume that this was because of speaking with her spouse. But if she was intimate with her spouse, no intercourse and she encountered such vaginal discharges, not the usual ones but more in quantity and she's inclined that this was emitted because of what she had done with her husband. In this case she should consider that to be madhi and najis and she should wash it off and perform wudu if she wanted to pray."
