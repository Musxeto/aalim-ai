  "transcript": "um as Anne says is it essential to ask the host if the meat that is being served is slaughtered or not the answer no this is an innovation if your host is a Muslim by default the food he's serving use challah if your host is a Christian in Chapter five by default Surat al-ma'idah it is hella and our best example that we always keep on repeating was that the Prophet himself had in his salat WA Salam when he was invited to eat from a ram that was slaughtered that was presented to him by a Jew woman he accepted the invitation and he ate from it he did not ask this Jew woman is this money you bought it with resulting from RIBA because you guys deal in River he did not did he ask the woman did you slaughter it or was it a dead in the under a mountain or whatever nothing he immediately ate from it so it is an innovation to ask people it is an insult to ask people whether it was slaughtered or not"
