  "transcript": "I believe that Muhammad has spoken to you about and you were all here inshallah is this true so what's the definition of yeah what was that deep deep the what Deep thing Deep thing yeah deep deep deep deep thinking probably deep ideas what what is steadfastness to be steadfast on this religion now we're Muslims tomorrow we may change right how do you say right is it a possibility see the most important thing is that you wake up after because if you're asleep you're going to tend to lose a lot of information is it possible that we change our religion tomorrow no no because this is the religion that we believe is the Core Essence of our existence without Islam we're animals without Islam we're nobody Islam gave us our dignity our honor Islam gives us our way of life Islam makes us human beings that Allah love and the more more you drift away because of your sins the more you become away from Allah and closer to being part of the animal kingdom the definitely has spoken to you and we don't want to go into his beautiful talk but is not a choice it is an obligation it is not something that you say today I'm going to skip for a while you know it's New Year's Eve I'm going to go and party and get wasted tomorrow I'm going to pray fa inshallah what's done is done it is not a choice because throughout your life you're intimidated you're frightened will I die now or later and if I die now would I be on the steadfast on the straight path and it goes without saying that the prophets am used to ask Allah most what the people are eating what what would he ask Allah most forgiveness do you have any Hadith you remember no so not forgiveness Paradise not to go to hell no United to keep the um United this is the most that he used to ask Allah the Hadith says that the prophet did not ask Allah anything more than to have his heart steadfast on the straight path oh Allah who turns Hearts over have my heart steadfast on your path AA said oh prophet of Allah we have believed in you we believe in you so are you afraid that we may go on our backs back on our heels he said yes the hearts are between two fingers of Allah and he twists them he turns them as he wishes and that is why you wake up in the morning sometimes you feel that I today will not conquer the world I will guide the whole world I have so much Ean in my heart and sometimes you wake up in the morning and thinking am I a hypocrite this is what comes into your mind therefore you have to ask Allah to have your heart steadfast on this religion otherwise in a blink of an eye you can change you can shift it is the guidance of Allah that keeps you on this path not your muscles not your knowledge not your friends if you don't have Allah's guidance for you with you then you're lost okay but the brother is asking what's the interpretation of the instruction of the prophet in theith of AB Talib may Allah be pleased with him when he said oh prophet of Allah what about the over all of a sudden look that I look at something Haram such as opposite sex for example at women and he saidat remove your gaze from it and in another Hadith he told one of the companions asking him about looking at women he said you have the first look but the second look is against you you'll be sinful for that and lots of the brothers as he mentioned go down the streets there are lots of women who are not properly covered so the brother would say this is first look this is first look I'm not I'm not going to blink don't blink and he says that first look how you need an hour for this first look brother what is meant from the Hadith of the Prophet Alam the look is an arrow that comes and hits you in the heart so if you look and you stare this is second look but if you and it is not logical to drive and a woman crosses over and say you're going to hit her you have to watch the road but if you start measurements you know 33 34 37 how high how how short now this is Haram this is going to be registered against you so the first look what's meant by it is the look that is not followed by staring and by you know things that may cause you to desire and in this a person fears Allah because no one looks at you no one knows if you're looking if you pass by a billboard and there's a big woman not wearing anything or in Arabic we call her so and you look and nobody's watching nobody cares if you're watching or not Allah registers and this is what Allah says inah Allah knows the deception of our eyes when we look at something Haram and what our chests hide and Allah knows best he watch it he's he's bigger than me so don't say anything bad there are as mentioned by the scholars there are traps of Shan I don't know if the Sheik was talking about the traps of Shan which me was mentioned by or not Shan anticipates for you in traps or hurdles or uh uh obstacles he puts in your way the first one is shik if he gets you here alhamdulillah to him you've made his day sh kuur blasphemy uh uh being an atheist anything that nullifies Islam he's happy with that if you have then he takes you in the second obstacle or the second hurdle which is innovation and if you have Sunnah in your heart and Sunnah then this these two are not good so he takes you in the third and the fourth which is major sins and minor sins major sins are all the sins that Allah warned and threatened Those who commit them with Hellfire or with prescribed punishment in this life stealing chop his head uh hand off uh killing chop his head off uh fornication give him 100 lashes or stone him to death if he's married slandering they give him 80 lashes Etc drinking 40 to 80 lashes as well so these are prescribed punishment or Allah threaten those who do these major sins With cursing or with being away and uh uh departing from his Mercy minor sins are all the sins that do not follow the previous criteria so these are four the fifth hurdle is the hurdle of disliked manners or or or issues known as makat such such as drinking with your left what's the ruling on drinking with the left some say it's Mak the most authentic is it's Haram why because the prophet Alat wasam told us that do not drink with your left do not eat with your left do not give with your left do not take with your left for the shatan drinks and eats and gives and takes using his left so the most authentic it is Haram but there are things that are disliked and the definition of Mak or dislike are the things that if you do them you're not sinful but if you don't do them because you want Allah's uh uh reward Allah will reward you for example entering the Masjid with the which Foot Right Foot but what happens if I enter it with the left foot it's a sin no I have abandoned a Sunnah and I'm not sinful but I've lost the reward therefore Shan if you have and if you're following the Sunnah and if you don't do major sins nor minor sins because of the the the the the righteousness in your heart he tries to catch you in the Mak so do anything that is not part of the Sunnah so you will lose a reward but you will not gain sins and what and and the majority of Muslims think that this is okay as long as I'm not gaining sins no problem not knowing that when you overdo it and when you indulge yourself in doing makat inevitably you're going to be upgraded to doing minor sins and eventually you're going to do what's up and up up and this is what appears to me and Allah knows best and the she is there if he can clarify this and Allah yes brother what did Dr zaker say he never he never answered well don't ask me why I'm asking me it's very simple brother we and I believe that Dr zachar knows this more than I do but maybe he was not given the time the question was a child asked Dr zachar when as long as Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam our messenger is the last messenger and last prophet and he's the Seal of the prophethood what is the status of maram of isaam when he descends to Earth at the end of time and he said that Dr zacha did answer and the answer is very easy he is still a messenger but when the prophet says that he's the Seal of prophethood and the and he is the last messenger meaning that no one will come with a new message and that is why he told us that when descends to uh uh Earth he would rule only with the dean of Islam of the prophet and he would follow him and he would break the cross and he would kill the swine and he will not take the jizya as the prophet said but he will not bring any new message no new prayer no new Vick or anything he will comply with the dean of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and that is why the prophet was angry when he saw mus when he saw Omar I'm mixing up things because it's already past my bedtime not because they did not offer us dinner I'm quite full uh this is exactly happened with om when the prophet once saw him sallallahu alaihi wasallam reading a paper and he said Omar what are you doing and he said oh prophet of Allah this is a paper of the Torah the book that was revealed on M peace be upon him the prophet was outraged he was angry he took it off him and he said are you going to extreme uh uh Omar by Allah if M was aive he would not do anything except follow me why because he is the last prophet and the last messenger and his message is the final and his message dominates the other books and the other messages I hope this answers your question yes brother first of all I do not like to answer any question that deals with the Quran in the because the Quran is much nobler to give your own interpretation of it and one is not advised to uh uh be Hasty in thinking yeah I think it means this and that Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him said what Earth would carry me and what Heavens would overshare me if I say in the book of Allah without knowledge therefore usually I refrain from usually I say from answering anything that deals with a verse of the Quran unless I am sure of it as for the uh uh verse you're referring to that the other one inah that among your wives and children are enemies to you this is in regard to those who were stopping the Muslims for migrating to Medina they are enemies to you because they're stopping you from the way of Allah and they are FNA because they tempt you to do things against the instructions of Allah and the prophet saidat verily your Offspring your son is a cause of cowardness a cause of being stingy and misery and a c in and a cause of uh dismay and and depression your Offspring your son how can that be because when you have a son you tend to take care of him more than anything else so it would cause you caring for the Sun not to fight in the cause of Allah it would cause you not to give in the cause of Allah in charity and it would cause you to feel sad and depressed whenever he's late whenever he's does not pass the exams or whenever he is ill and this what appears to me Allah Knows Best the brother is asking why do some of the so-called Muslims say it is okay to go and steal money from the kufar and abuse them and maybe beat them and maybe harm them and loot them why is is it and they say that this is in the Quran brother whoever says this does not know how to wash himself after urinating unfortunately these are the ignorant people of Islam who have no knowledge and they find it easy to justify their their their actions by blaming it on the Quran yeah go look on the Quran or someone would say the prophet said in alkari that it is okay to steal from the cfir uh even if he's your neighbor because his money is halal for you alari Andi and Ma I think and you go and look in the and ter Ma say brother it's not there what would he say to you maybe you're wrong you're reading the wrong translation look look more look more these are ignorant people and I've met so many in this great country of yours Mah uh unfortunately who make who make if if it was limited only to the nonm Muslims it would Cascade down I know brothers who think of other Muslims like they are kufar it's okay to take their money because they're living in the kafer country and they're approving of the kafer laws then they Kfar as well so what are you doing here you're like him yeah but I don't believe in their law Subhan Allah what do you do I don't work I'm taking social security the benefits where do you live in their buildings and your your medical is NHS may Allah bless them NHS they're CF but may Allah bless them Subhan Allah these are the most ignorant people on Earth they don't know Arabic they don't know Quran they don't know the sunah of the Prophet Alam and they find it easy to shoot from the hip they don't even take the gun they just shoot from the hip say Haram oh Halal it's okay if if you don't like it sue me what can you do no this is wrong these people are ignorant and that is why we say we have to surround the the scholars those those of knowledge those who have traveled and studied at least those who know Arabic you you can't have a scholar who does not know Arabic and does not know the Quran and does not know the the fundamentals of or the itself or the and and all these great Sciences of Islam and then he comes and talks about saying that it's okay to jump over your neighbor's house and steal him the prophet had he ever done something like this how did he deal with the kufar how did he deal with the kufar huh he what fought them fought them he fought those who fought him but didn't he h he have Jew Neighbors The Prophet was invited once to a a poisoned sheep from a Jew woman did he accept the invitation yes did he say was it slaughtered in the Islamic way well he just went and ate from it the prophet visited a young Jew child who used to serve him and he was ill and when he went to him he said accept Islam and the child looked at the prophet and the and the father and the child looked at the his father and his I'm not going to read this I'm supposed to have someone to read this and the father said obey abim obey the prophet Alat wasam and Subhan Allah the boy accepted Islam this is how we're supposed to De deal with the non-muslims not in a fashion that whenever I see a non-muslim I spit in his face I kill you you Infidel I don't do this we deal with them in the best Islamic fashion I give them a big smile not because I like them but because I like my religion now you are a Public Relation uh representative whatever you do it's not going to be labeled at Muhammad or abdah orim or it's going to be labeled on Islam so whatever we do they're going to claim that this is Islam they're going to blame my religion that's why I refrain from doing anything that may harm my religion Allah knows best well if you're watching ladies football this is Haram because you're not allowed to look at women and we're talking about the first Gates this is the first half and the second half so no this is definitely out of the question completely and I don't want anyone to you say oh she but it's the national team it's again Haram it's not now looking men to men men watching uh uh matches between Manchester United and Arsenal for example what's the ruling on that it's an issue of dispute among Scholars why because of of the definition of what is the restricted area in a man's body where I cannot look at so the majority of Scholars say that the thighs are not considered to be part of the but there is a Hadith or two where the Prophet saidat to one of his companions cover your thigh for the thigh is you're not allowed to show this you're not allowed to expose this and in another Hadith which is is not authentic but the scholars usually use it that do not look at the thigh of a living person nor a dead person so it's an issue of dispute among Scholars I personally believe that the thigh is but nowadays A lot of the football players wear sort of stretches that reaches the knee so it in a sense under the shorts they have uh um I don't know what you call it yeah whatever yeah that's something that sticks to your skin and then and this covers the innocense so by this sense it's okay to watch however what do you benefit from watching now look at the steps of shaan that he's using first of all you're going to watch the the the the match one two three four matches and afterwards you're going to be tempted to go and watch it it live in the stadium with all the holigans with all the heha heha and preferably maybe later on go for a pint of loga for a couple of Guinness I think I was not supposed to say this in the uh get drunk and go with them so you will find yourself going in the mainstream of those kufar is this what why Allah created me no Allah created you to wor ship him if you like football go and play go with your brothers I'm not doing this go with your brothers and dedicate for example one or two hours a week to play football it's healthy for you it's recreational it's entertainment but sitting on your backside with all due respect watching a game that lasts for an hour and half to two hours this only increases your back size size and fortunate because you're not go you're not burning any calories you're not and all what you do is shouting and go and then what Subhan Allah and then you end up fighting with your brother because he uh goes with uh fulam club and and and the other one goes with Aston Villa or whatever why is this we're having a drift between the Muslims because of football match and I personally don't watch it and I don't recommend anybody to watch it I recommend mend that you play sports I'm a sportsman I play sports every day almost and I encourage it because it gives you health it gives you in Inspiration it uh uh uh removes the stress in you um and Allah knows best well the question is misleading now he's already married and he wants his woman to be Pious and she's refusing one of the the main principles take another wife she would immediately mashallah become Pious no seriously if this is the first uh wife and you have not gotten married yet you have to be very selective but if you're already uh married and now you would like to uh encourage your wife to be Pious and practicing this is a long process and you have to first of all start with yourself so if you are not practicing if you are doing all the Haram things that you enjoy but you want her to cover and to sit home and not to do anything this is to her unfair she will never obey you and she would never listen to you plus to adding to that you have to try your best to increase the knowledge of your wife after you get this knowledge you have to increase her awareness of Allah so many times we fail when we instruct our loved ones our children our daughters and son Sons our wives To Pray by dos and don'ts do this don't do that and this is what Islam is limited in and this is wrong instead of doing this you have to teach your children your loved ones to love Allah so that when you want them to pray this comes from within not because you're watching we fail to uh uh plant this fear of Allah knowledge of Allah if you get an A4 paper and I give it to not the children but the grown-ups write to me what you know about Allah probably you would write three lines and say I'm I run out of gas I I don't know write to me what you know about Al what write to me about what you have seen from Allah's kindness you never think of this you take it for granted because your father told you pray your father told you do this no you have to know Allah if you have love for Allah and you have to have love for Allah you have to love him once you love him you start to taste everything else in your mouth you start to taste prayer when you pray when I pray I find oh mallah I'm enjoying my prayer when I fast I'm enjoying my fasting I'm not tasting anything I'm fasting but I'm enjoying it I find the taste of the beauty of fasting and so on therefore I believe that you have to work really hard on your wife if you want her to become Pious and practicing by you first of all giving her the role model and and be the example for her and Allah knows best this is a topic that I've lectured about 3 4 days five days six days I don't I don't recall somewhere here in this country actually actually it was in chenai India it was a month and a half ago but uh I think it's somewhere on the website there are means of increasing your IM in IM as we believe decreases with sin and increases with good deeds so to increase your Iman first of all you have to do everything that Allah mandated and made obligatory upon you you have to know Allah so which means that to increase your Iman you have to increase the amount of knowledge without knowledge you are just doing rituals without thinking about them when you read the Quran masallah how many J have you finished I finish the Quran every one month mallah a a day yes do you know the meaning no when are you going to start allahim no it is more important for you to understand the meaning of the verses of Allah of the Quran rather than to keep it by heart or to recite it every day because the Quran was revealed to be contemplated to be comprehended to be understood and applied in our lives one of the means to increase your Iman is to surround yourself with righteous practicing people if I surround myself with brothers that only love football all what we talk about during the day is football if I surround myself with brothers who only like uh R&B and rap all what we talk about is JayZ JZ and and puffy dog the whatever the names are if I surround myself with brothers who are practicing whenever I sit with them if I do this he says brother drink with your right because forbade us from drinking the left he gave me an advice if I he doesn't show me if he doesn't see me f he calls me in the brother I hope you well I didn't see you in F prayer next time tomorrow I'm going to be careful to be in fer they give me advice whenever they see me do something wrong they advise me they increase my knowledge at least if I'm not with them when they mention my name they mention my name in Good they don't backbite me so surrounding yourself with righteous and good people increases your IM voluntary acts such as night prayer a lot of the Muslims don't pray night prayer the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said Allah the almighty said and my servant would not get closer to me with Deeds better than the mandatory Deeds or worship that I have mandated upon him and my servant continues to offer voluntary Deeds until I love him and if I love him I become his sight that he sees with I become his hearing that he hears with I become his hand that he hits with I become his leg that he walks with and he continues to get closer to me and the more he gets closer I get closer to him by what by offering voluntary deeds and would it be proper for a Muslim not to pray night prayer would it be proper for a Muslim not to offer wit say I'm happy I pray five times a day once in the mid and four I delay them at the end of the night but I pray five times a day this is not a proper practicing Muslim a proper practicing Muslim has a portion of the night where he's alone with Allah nobody's watching you nobody's looking at you but you're praying to whom to Allah and that is why when you say Allah you feel that the whole world is in your hand and that's why in the F when you say ald Allah says my servant has praised me my servant has complimented me my servant has glorified me Allah is talking to you when you do you feel this when you say Al F no I just want the IM to finish if he says Al holy he's going to take ages now and I'm going to think okay going to take 15 minutes then we have to go and pick some of my friends and go to the stadium may Allah make it easy but when he says all right you're a man keep on doing the the good thing so you have to see why is it that my Iman is down why is it that I don't know I can't find any feeling and a nice taste to pray because I am away from Allah ages and and and and and hundreds of light years away how to get closer increase your IM inshallah and Allah knows I pray to Allah the almighty in this blessed night not because it's New Year's Eve it's blessed night because Allah has favored Us in making us join and and and come in this blessed Masjid I pray to Allah with his beautiful names and beautiful attributes that he make us all go to mecah and to Medina to offer omra and to offer Hajj and to have the honor of Kiss of kissing the black stone now if the brother has the means to go I definitely advise him to go it erases your sins man if you have sins the prophet says the to the following om erases the sins in between them it's all all of because of him okay so if you have the financial means go ahead brother and Hajj is once in your lifetime if you're young go ahead now because every time you postpone it you have more responsibilities So you you're 17 18 you have money said next year inshallah the money that you have I'm going to buy a car so next year inshallah you buy a car I have to go to the university now they it's £99,000 a year mAh may Allah help you in this country uh later on I want to get married later on I have a mortgage Subhan Allah and it never ends and you find a guy 85 years old next year inshallah what is this he's 85 years and still he's hoping and wishing to live what kind of life is this my brother no as long as you have the financial means go if you don't it is enough to wish it by your heart imagine this beautiful religion of ours I don't have money but I want to go to or to ha Allah will give you the reward while you're here without leaving this country and Allah knows best poetry and singing the ruling on poetry and singing The Poetry as stated by Abdullah Abbas may Allah be pleased with him man with his father the cousin of the Prophet Alam he said good poetry is good bad poetry is bad so saying poetry is permissible in Islam providing that the lyrics the meaning is good singing If you mean with uh uh the company of musical instruments this is Haram it's Haram in three three locations mentioned in uh the Quran as in verse 64 Surah is in Sur and in the end ofah and also it is mentioned in the authentic Hadith in where the Prophet said that there will be people of my umah making Haram things Halal such as fornication wearing of uh silk uh and drinking intoxicants and Ma musical instruments and this was also uh mentioned in Sun AB da and the authentic Hadith as well as for the consensus of Scholars the four schools of thought and none of us is out of these four schools of thought you're either hanafi or Maliki or shaf or H and and and they all agree that it is forbidden musical instruments but singing as in Nashid this is permissible providing that the words are okay providing that you're not imitating the kufar in their way and you're not imitating the bad singers Muslim singers in their way and uh uh that it does not occupy all of your time some of the brothers do not listen to music alhamdulillah but 24 hours they are with mased and zika these are the old the I know maybe there are more and all the time they're listening to it it hardens the heart and it if not kill it so yes listen to it like half an hour a week an hour a week but every single day full time this is not part of the sun Allah knows best I doubt that the the local M that the mid has a shop inside maybe it is within the fence but nobody prays around it or in it because this is not permissible to sell and and buy in the Masjid itself so if we have a corner here this is Haram to have a Masjid uh to have a shop here in the Masjid but outside if it's outside the the fence and it's considered to be part of the message it is halal inshallah and Allah knows best no Mortgage in the what is the meaning of Mortgage in Arabic no no not Mortgage in in Arabic what is it called that word do you know it no RBA is different correct me if I'm wrong mamed correct me if wrong if I'm wrong mortgage is in in Islam is to authenticate a debt with a property or with some this is a transaction in Islam so for example if I want to borrow from you a th000 quid and you say okay this is a th000 quid interest free but what will you give me as mortgage as something to authenticate so in case that you don't pay me in a month time as you promised so I give you my watch which is usually more than the Thousand it's 1,500 for example so this is Mortgage in Islam now this is halal because it is interest free and it is only to authenticate your right now what people here consider it to be mortgage is to buy a house in installment and the house which is bought there are complexed interest meaning that within 20 years time you have to pay1 million pound but due to inflation this 1 million can be 1.2 1.3 depending as we go on and if you are late you can reschedule it but we will add more money to that this is complete riba and it's completely forbidden this is exactly like like when they re rename liquor and they call it spiritual drinks it's called spirits and when they talk and camouflage prostitution and they call it escort girls and when they camouflage Haram things and they call it art all of these are names names do not change the actual uh uh thing the Haram is Haram so even if they call it handling fees as long as it's interest over the loan I'm borrowing money from you and you taking interest on top of that this is Haram and Allah knows best yes the question is what about what's the ruling on uh wearing change and and earrings this is halal for women it felt like somebody's going to beat me see Brothers Brothers now nowadays nowadays I am as a Muslim I have my identity I go up I don't come down when I wear these shackles and uh uh know be cool and doing this and when I walk I walk like a gorilla my hands reach my knees and I think that I'm cool no I'm not cool I am imitating a cafir am I a cafir I'm Muslim I'm proud to be a Muslim wearing these shackles and wearing these necklaces and bracelets or an earrings I've seen Muslims wearing cross what is this well I I've seen somebody it's cool it's cool I don't believe in it it's cool looks nice Subhan Allah so people go down the slope of following the kufar until they become like them it is completely forbidden for a Muslim to wear and in Saudi we find some Muslims who they have their scholar the great shaan their their Muti is shaan and you find them wearing these necklaces but they're silver why say gold Haram mashallah he's not wearing it gold because it's Haram but he's wearing it in silver why because silver is okay for men it is Haram for a Muslim to imitate the kufar in what only the kufar wear and to imitate the women in what the women wear and the prophet saidai May the curse of Allah fall on the women who imitate men and on men who imitate women and Allah Knows Best"
