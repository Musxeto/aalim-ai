  "title": "Does reward for reading quran translation equals the reward for reading it in arabic",
  "transcript": "hamdan sends us a questions a question and he says that I'm a new Muslim my question is is the reward for reading the Quran from a translation the same with the reward on reading the original Arabic text of the Quran this is a question often asked by the non-arabs they cannot read the Arabic book or they may be able to read the Arabic book but not to understand it so they read the translation of the meaning of the Holy Quran so is it the same reward and what reward are we talking about the prophet saidat wasam that with each letter of the Quran a person is rewarded by approximately 10 Good Deeds I do not say Al if Lam me is one letter Al if is one letter lamb is one letter meem is one letter letter so whenever you read the Arabic text Allah would reward you this 10 Deeds for 10 Good Deeds for each letter you recite and this can be multiplied up to 700 and Allah Asel can multiply it as much as he wishes so if I know Arabic but I cannot understand it would it be the same reward for me to read in the translation of the meaning of the Holy Quran the answer is no this reward is only for those who recite the Quran in Arabic if you recite the meaning then you are reading the interpretation of the meaning of the Holy Quran but not the actual text not the actual word of Allah nevertheless if you read the interpretation of the Quran if you read the you reward it because your intention is to learn but it's a different reward it is not the same and hence you would not be rewarded in the same fashion if you read the Quran in Arabic language"
