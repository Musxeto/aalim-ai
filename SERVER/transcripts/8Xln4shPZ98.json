  "transcript": "foreign [Music] feel still this stigma like in which our women face so whenever we tell our sisters that you have a right in whatever our father has left because he has died so they tell us no no we don't need it it's like we forgive you and it's a gift from us so my question is Sheikh January is showing that they have gifted up this or there is another rule says that a person cannot um gift or given charity his birth except for the one third party so which among these two should we take particles so if I understood anwar's question he's talking about a prevailing custom in the community where females are deprived from inheriting so if the father dies the sons get all the property and earn the wealth and they deprive the girls the daughters with the understanding that because this daughter if she gets married to a stranger he would have a share in our father's property and this should be only in our lineage in our family of course this is from jahiliyah this is a major sin and a prohibited act in a transgression and disbelief in the Quran because the one who divided the wealth of the deceased is no one other than Allah and Allah knows who's worthy of inheriting from those who are to be deprived so when you come and deprive the daughters from inheriting you have committed a grave and major sin now after people the grace of Allah came to know the ruling they started wanting to give back and to correct the wrong doing so they went to their sisters and said listen we deprived it from your rights here is your share but most likely these sisters are so loving and kind and generous they're married and they're happy with their family and they say no it's okay we forgive you so is it permissible the answer is yes as long as they were wronged and Injustice was acted upon them and then they forgave the oppressors and the wrong doers alhamdulillah this is permissible and Allah Knows Best"
