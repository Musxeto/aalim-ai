  "transcript": "foreign so my question is um I have a couple of socks which are a bit uh worn out so it's got holes in it and if I've got my wudu in it and I wear my shoes and I'm outside and specifically you know I'm just uh outside where I have to pray would my wudu still be valid in those socks um I mean I think I think uh Maurice you mean would my wood would be valid if I wipe on such socks correct yes yes okay the answer is it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic opinion as perimetamia and others that the companions may Allah be pleased with them did not have Skechers socks that were fine and good and and strong and without any holes they had Rags wrapped around their feet and they traveled in the deserts and over Rocky Mountains and and the likes which made holes in their socks yet this did not prevent them from wiping over it so as long as it holds the title or the description of a sock and you can it's it sticks by itself it doesn't fall off and you can then you can wipe over it without any problem inshallah"
