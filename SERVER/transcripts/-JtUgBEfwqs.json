  "transcript": "about their thing right so when I was young another just a few reviews so you have to have some fun but I didn't know that so now a couple years later I am thinking those months that I have to pass I have to redo the mic and do I have to pay attention from them like your parents before the next Amazon so how many days do I need to make up okay also where my parents are telling me not the best terms also shown in the United States because they think it is dangerous because your skin but I think I can test without any problems or do I listen to them like that okay I will answer this mike first of all those who hit puberty and did not fast these days due to ignorance negligence they don't want to fast they know it's mandatory but they simply don't want to fast the most authentic opinion is that they do not make up these days whoa we thought that you should make up missed days you make up Miss days that you intentionally broke after fasting them so today I woke up intending to fast I'm fasting everybody knows I'm fasting I prayed Fajr nine o'clock 10 o'clock am I woke up and I felt hungry I said tell you what I'm gonna call it a day and I eat and drink this day I broke intentionally I have to fast this day I have to make it up even after 20 30 years but if before going to bed tomorrow is a fasting day of Ramadan and I say to himself I'm not gonna fast I'm gonna fool everyone else I'm gonna pretend to be fasting I'm not gonna fast so I intended not to fast it this day cannot be made up assuming that you are from the first type you started fasting and broke it you have to make them up how many days I don't know this is something you have to estimate if I say a thousand days oh this is too much if I say five days no this is too little so 100 days no this is too much uh six days no this is too little and we go back and forth until we reach a date that you think that this is probable add a day or two just to be safe Point number three is the there is a difference of opinion among Scholars whether we have to feed a poor person due to the fact that a Ramadan or more had passed without making them up or not the majority of Scholars say that you feed According to some Companions and the most authentic opinion and this is the choice of they mean that there is no proof or evidence from the Quran or the Sunnah to back this up so we don't expiate while making up for a day of Ramadan that was missed even if it was 20 30 years ago all what you have to do is to make them up and that is it and Allah Knows Best"
