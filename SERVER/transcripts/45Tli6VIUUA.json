  "transcript": "Muhammad says what's the ruling on leasing a house because people tell me it's RIBA and I don't understand how it can be RIBA since we're not paying or giving any RIBA to anyone I need some clarification first of all Muhammad RIBA is different categories Ribble fuddled ribbon a/c arable card etc I'm not going to go through this usually the most well-known type of RIBA is the RIBA that is related to the debt so the more time span is added the higher that that is time of payment is 1st of March give me my money it says I can't see ok I'll delay you couple of months but you will have to pay me 5% extra this is RIBA so is asking about leasing houses leasing houses leasing properties nothing wrong in that if it is true leasing meaning I get your apartment for eight hundred or a thousand dollars a month a deal a deal done so this is no problem every month I give you a thousand dollars there's no problem in that none whatsoever there is nothing hidden meaning that after 20 years I will possess this apartment no it's simple renting like renting a car in there's not nothing wrong in that when does it become a RIBA when people flip it and twist it so that it fits their whims and desires so you have a flat an apartment a house and I'm interested on in living in it so I come to you and I say listen I'd like to get your apartment for the next 5 years is that okay with you said yes I'm leasing said ok how much is the rent and he says a thousand dollars a month so that makes it twelve thousand dollars s-matrix sixty thousand dollars for the five years period so I come to you and I say listen I have another proposal I'll give you $200,000 as a deposit so that I can live in this apartment for five years monthly basis I'll give you like $50 or $100 noting peanuts but at the end of the period when I am moving out you return the two hundred thousand dollars back to me and the Landlord said that's a good deal you're on this is RIBA why because actually as a tenant I am lending two hundred thousand dollars to the land Lord and he's benefiting from it he's using whatever he wants to do with it so that he would return it after five years meanwhile me occupying his apartment for five years paying nothing this is the interest over the loan so this is RIBA I don't know that if this is fits what you're doing or you're asking about or not general leasing or renting is halal and there's nothing wrong with it but if it's like I had just described this is totally prohibited but"
