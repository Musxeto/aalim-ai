  "title": "Do I ask Allah to cure me from a disease or make specific dua? Transgression in dua assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um my question is um so Institute we are encouraged to make as much dry as we can um sometimes for example I want to say Allah cure me from a certain disease and then I also want to be specific Ya Allah take away this feeling that I feel but then I I think to myself that um saying Ya Allah C me from this disease is sufficient that you don't have to say like um a a specific thing so is this correct or I can make as any drw as I want generally speaking as long as you're asking Allah without transgressing this is fine to ask Allah to cure you from a specific illness is fine to ask Allah to cure you from a specific illness and to uplift the pain you're suffering from this is fine but if you think that they're all the same there's no need to go into details there's no problem in that because this is not going into details going into details is going into details oh Allah cure me from this specific illness and from the headache I'm finding and the pain in my joints and the uh drowsiness and the inability to do this and you're explaining all the symptoms as if Allah does not know them and that would be a form of transgression just limit it to what is needed usually which is naming the illness and pains resulting from it and may Allah Asel cure uh everybody's uh illness and troubles"
