  "transcript": "is about her son who goes through the exams and subhanAllah he comes back and says the minute I entered the exam room I forget everything one of the two either your son is fooling you he's not studying he's concentrating on something else than studying this is what I used to do when I was young I used to open the book of the exams and I have like Superman magazine inside and my parents would see me you know really interested and the funny thing when it's a comic a magazine and I start laughing while reading geography then they know that this is something fishy going on so either he's playing you he's fooling you or seriously he has a problem usually these issues depend on conditioning so if you say oh you poor thing maybe you have to take your doctor to a psychiatrist to do this too maybe you have gin maybe you have black magic of envy whatever no the child will be convinced that there's something wrong if you try to encourage him and say no let's revise it before you go if you work with him and try to make him memorize the material before he goes and you revise it to him and he comes back and saying over Hampton ah I only missed 20% or 30% I still have a problem encouraging him more and more this would help mashaallah so we don't usually refer to saying that he has a problem you have to do Rukia is there any supplication any dua any ayah nothing specific on this issue there is nothing but there is a lot of generals application meaning or what you have to do is face dr. bloure raise your hands praise Allah social or facilitation to the Prophet as some what you call durood shareef and then ask Allah oh Allah make it easy on my son oh Allah make my son memorize his material and do well in his exams oh Allah cast away all the Devils in the the Djinn that are distracting him if there any all of this is general doer you make a lot of drug in your own native language and Alonso gel would respond to you with His grace Japan Hawaii"
