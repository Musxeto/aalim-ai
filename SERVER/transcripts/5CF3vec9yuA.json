  "transcript": "says he asks a long question in short he is given the responsibility of being the school kitchen master and he is the one who is preparing cooking and servicing the food he asks at the end should I eat the left over food well this has to be looked into you are entrusted with the food the ingredients the quantities so if you make food and you try your level best not to have any extra you try your level best to cook food that is sufficient for the students in that school and you serve them that food and there is left over an extra amount of good food we have to look into the policy of the school if the policy of the school says that this food would be thrown into the wastebasket into into the trash in this case you may utilize this food eat it give it to someone who is in need as long as this is the policy of the school providing that you did not do this on purpose that is the extra amount so if you have like a thousand students in your school and you prepare the food for 1100 so that you can take the extra food away this is totally prohibited for you but if you do your level best and do and prepare food for a thousand and only 900 consume it and the rest is to be thrown into the trash in this case you may utilize it and it's always best to keep your reputation clean that you clarify things with the management so you go to the management and tell them about your situation and tell them I have extra food maybe the management would say ok distribute the food to the staff the workers the cleaners and the teachers maybe the school would say give it all to orphanages and maybe the management would say you can do with it whatever you like in this case you get your answer in sha Allah"
