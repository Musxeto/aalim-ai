  "transcript": "uh shift my question is there is a transport service in India similar to Uber where you book a cab and it comes to your house but after it has arrived for every minute that you delay they add like three Rupees to the fare so is it Halal to use this or is it riba it is 100 Halal their service starts from the moment they reach your home imagine you're hiring me to do a particular service for you and it's counted by minutes and I come and the first 10 minutes you're saying okay you can wait I'm in the shower okay I'm I'm drying my hair I'm putting my clothes on and you take 10-15 minutes of my time and you expect me not to charge you for that this is not fair so this is totally Halal and permissible inshallah"
