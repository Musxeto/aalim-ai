  "transcript": "been been having a problem for four years you've been what I'm I've been having a problem inside me for four years that I've I I I made I made an oath I made an oath to Allah to stop to stop the sin but then for for a year but in the middle of that I I I went I went to the scene but I didn't know those at so I continued with the sin and then I started facing depression and then the side effects to Contin I didn't know that was so I came to know that was so I fed for 3 days but then uh my situation didn't change I think from Allah but I don't know what to what to do to change my situation because CU I tried for four years to to change my situation but but I know it's that breaking of the oath that got me into this situation I don't know to fix it are we talking about pornography or masturbation the first one okay okay first of all when you break an oath there is an experation that you have to give and this is mentioned in the Quran which is one of the three you choose free a slave or feed or clothe 10 poor people three choices either one you choose is okay freeing a slave is not applicable nowadays because they don't have slaves the other two are fine if you are unable financially to either feed or clothe 10 poor Muslims in this case you may resort to fasting 3 days jumping to three days before when you're able to feed or clothe 10 Muslim uh uh poor ones is not accepted so the three days you fasted these are voluntary days with not count as an experation for your broken oath secondly those who are doomed and tested with either watching pornography or masturb masturbation or the likes of such heus sins these are their tests from Allah and we are on this Earth only to be tested there isn't a soul on Earth who's not tested even the richest of the richest he's being tested and the poorest of the poor is being tested now some may pass the test and end up in Paradise some may fail and end up in hell it is you who decide there is no magical pill that would help you no one can justify his sin by saying I can't do anything about it if we tell you go to the highest building to a highriser and jump you said you're crazy why would I I would say don't you feel compelled to jump don't you feel that you want to just jump and say I Believe I Can Fly of course not you crazy I don't want to die very good so so why are you doing this sin oh she I can't help myself you can you did not jump you can also stop watching now how to do this this depends on the measures you take you want to pass the exams and get higher grades what are you going to do I'm going to study hard she I'm going to isolate myself from my hobbies and my habits and my family to study really hard and in the end I would get the trophy a high glamorous uh grades likewise when you want to stop the sin that you are indulged in you have to first of all do the preparation needed such as blocking all means so where do you watch this filth oh on my smartphone on my PDA on my computer eliminate what do you mean your SM smartone phone that's making you stupid substitute it with a normal Nokia the Symbian uh uh uh operating system that has no internet that has no videos that you can play only to text and to uh uh take and and and and make calls the PDA and the laptop or uh uh the computer in the house eliminate all of this and if you live with your family bu a big screen with a PC where your back is not to the wall and the screen is to you rather is the opposite the back of the screen is to the wall and your back is to the family to the living room so that everyone in the room can see anyone passing by can see what you're watching and you can have restriction not to watch it unless there is someone in the room not to have access to such porn yeah imagine if your young sister or brother were to fall into these SES and watch them because of you imagine if your children do this imagine if Allah punishes You by cascading this to your own family and what and and the the sad thing is if I were in the same room with you would you dare watch it you're intimidating I'm scared from you I would never never attempt to do this Allah is watching you 24 hours 7 days a week Allah is listening to everything you're listening to you don't have any shame you don't have any fear after all what Allah has given you so you have to do this as stage one and then you have to fill your time with beneficial things how many J of the Quran do you memorize how many hadiths do you know what's your knowledge in Islam you have to start filling your time with beneficial things third you have to surround yourself with practicing uh righteous Muslims 24 hours 7 days a week if you check your contact list you will find that maybe you have a handful of them but you don't hang out with them you prefer sitting home alone watching this filth or you have a lot of non-muslims or non-practicing people who keep on putting fuel to the fire and share with you some of this Haram filth so where whenever there's a will there is always a way but again nobody's going to give you a magical pill it's all in your hands you make oath you make promises you do this you do that nothing is going to help you unless you put it in your mind and ask Allah for guidance and really take serious and uh uh steps and measures to stop this filth and Allah Knows Best"
