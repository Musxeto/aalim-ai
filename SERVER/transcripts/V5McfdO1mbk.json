  "transcript": "Uh just I want to ask you before u I have one question related related to shik and one question related to my prayer if it's valid or not. What which one do I ask today? I'm conf I do which one? Whatever is important for you. Uh so I cannot ask two. Nope. Uh okay. Um I don't know if I Okay, I'll ask about the prayer. So, um, if I'm praying and I feel, uh, like I won't pass wind, but I hear a sound and I don't know if I, uh, really pass wind or it's just sounds, uh, coming, uh, from behind me. Uh, I know it's a sound, but when I finish my prayer, I pass wind and I know this is passing wind. Uh, now what do I do? Nothing. Nothing. Your prayer is valid. You cannot break your prayer. assume that you broke your voodoo with an assumption or a doubt. Some people say to me, \"She I was in prayer and I heard a sound. So should I break?\" I said, \"What sound was it? Was it the sound of passing wind or farting as they say?\" He said, \"No, no, no. Someone was cracking his fingers.\" So I thought, \"Okay, you've answered yourself.\" Someone says, \"Oh, she while praying I found this smell. So, should I break my prayer?\" I said, \"Is it the smell of your passing wind?\" Said, \"No, no, someone was applying perfumes.\" What are you doing? So, the hadith is crystal clear. Don't break a prayer until you find a sound, a smell which is offensive, which is you passing wind or you hear a sound which again makes it certain for you that yes, I did pass when and Allah knows best."
