  "title": "Islam Hijacked!",
  "transcript": "novena karate we've exhausted many credibility a first-generation American was a lobbying for Golikov on my logic says 11 white seed which is way past my bedtime this is how we try so if I fall asleep do commit me if you do fall asleep after each other the title was originally hijacked in Islam and this was a business spelling because it was hijacking Islam so particularly reason without that so we could have the conference ongoing each other and we change it into each lab hijacked now this goes without saying that the religion of Allah Azza WA JAL since the beginning of time is and will always be Islam all the messengers of Allah all the prophets of Allah we're Muslims because the meaning of Islam is to submit your will to your Creator Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and that is why all prophets and messengers were Muslims and this is illustrated in the Quran where Allah Dajjal says were translates to truly the religion with allah is islam and whoever seeks a religion other than Islam it will never be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be one of the losers and it also goes without saying you all know this that our name is Muslims this is our title this is what we are proud to announce to the people without affiliating ourselves with a school of thought or with the math hub or with an effect in Islam wherever someone asks us we're Muslims yes what kind of Muslim Muslim yeah I mean Salafi tably why me do bundi where Lewey Qadiani any kind of these names my name is a Muslim Allah says in the Quran woman axel Olin me manda a la la la mina ffolly-hardwicke all in nanny min l muslimeen there's no one woman accent this is a negation there's no one better in rhetoric more than that who calls to allah offered good deeds and says that he is among the believers among the muslims this name the Muslim is not something new it is the name given to us by Allah Azza WA JAL so it's not your choice you don't have a choice this is what Allah has called you and Allah says it is he who has named you Muslims both before and in this meaning this for and some interpreters said that it is he is referring to Ibrahim peace be upon him and this is not the authentic opinion of scholar the scholars say no this refers to Allah it is he who calls us the Muslims way before and also in this Quran as well this is the name that you should abide by and whenever we read in the Selah and we hear but actually if you read you see and this is past my bedtime so whenever you read in the Cielo and you read it in front of you that the best of the unsolved where the Hajj and outs and the best of the Muslims wherein muhajreen and ansar those who migrated for the sake of Allah to Medina and the inhabitants of Medina themselves are called the unthawed it's a beautiful name it's an honor that has no honor beyond it to be called a man from the muhajireen or a man from allen saab yet this title itself the Prophet erased alot Ostrom can consider it a proclamation of ignorance and jahiliyya imagine that it was reported in Bukhari and Muslim and elsewhere that while two boys two servants of the Mahajan and ansar we're taking water from a wealth in one of the expeditions they fought over it and one of them kicked the other so they started to fight and each one of them called his people so the boy from al-muhajireen said all people of Omaha dream come to my aid and the boy from the Ansar said o men or people of the Ansar come to my aid and both of the groups wanted to go into a fight and the Prophet came out of his salat WA Salam and he said what is this the proclamation of the days of jahiliya of ignorance this is what I'm hearing what is what was he hearing o people of Ansar Oh people over Mujahideen and he called this a form of calling the people to the days of ignorance and jahiliya when they told him what had happened he said leave these names leave this situation calling each other in names because it stinks it rots there oh ha ha montina it stinks though they were calling each other Mujahideen and unsolved no one is better than them they are the cream of the society yet when it was wrongly used this what the Prophet Ali salatu salam called it and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam told us that the nations before us were divided and they split it into a number 70 plus sects and divisions and his OMA his followers will be divided into 73 72 of them are in health and the Prophet does not say a liar in salatu salam we have to believe this we have to accept it 72 of his sect of his followers are in hell only one will be admitted to paradise with the grace of allah azza wajal and when the companion said o prophet of allah which one would that be and he said it is the Gemara the main body of the muslims and another narration he said those who follow that which i am which i and my companions follow so this is a serious issue 72 and health but of course we have to clarify that when we say 72 sects are in hell this does not mean that they are not Muslims there are among the 72 sects groups who are Muslim and who will be punished in hell and then be permitted to go out to paradise when Allah wills it and maybe if Allah wills it he would forgive them what they had done providing that allah azzawajal will that and probably because they were doing the best they could and they made a mistake by choosing that path however among the 72 are sects that are not considered to be Muslims who are doomed in hell such as the Hadiya any the remedies or whatever they are called the bahá'ís etc now the difference between these 72 sects from what we believe to be our sect is not a difference in filthy issues it's not a difference whether you put your hand on your chest and prayer or under your belly or you don't put your hands at all not that you chop it off but you just simply don't put it on your chest no this is not an issue this is filty issue it's not an issue of whether a woman has to cover her face or not it's a filthy issue the issues that would make them go to hell are related to al-qaeda and they do not have concrete evidence from the Quran nor from the Sunnah and it goes without saying again that the main driver for these 72 sects is Shaitaan is it least is Satan he is the main driver for them and he either does this through its gravitons going extreme or through negligence and ignorance and he works through infesting your heart either with desires which the majority of Muslims are prisoners of war to these desires or through casting doubt after doubt and this is how he manages to get the people to be part of the 72 sects now if you look at the arena today you will find that Islam has been hijacked you find that Islam has been claimed by so many of these sects the majority of them do not relate to Islam they are distant from Islam they're far far away from Islam among them are the people of whims and of doubts of innovation they come to the book and they take part of it and believe what they don't like so what they like they highlight it and they show it to everyone what they dislike and it's a lot they hide it and they claim that you do not understand the meaning of it they use the unclear verses of the Quran and then exact the crystal-clear verses of the Quran or of the Sunnah a lot they will describe them for us in the Quran and the Quran is not only to seek Allah's blessing by keeping it in your bag or in the glove compartment so that you don't have an accident or under the pillow so that your wife would not poison you this is inevitable it's going to happen but the Quran is not a protection in this physical form Allah did not reveal it to the Prophet as a Salam to be kept as a good omen in your back or like a lot of the Saudi Airlines pilots who are great friends of mine they keep it in their flight kit and when you ask them when was the last time you read it he says I think in Ramadan three years ago so why are you carrying it said Baraka no for an was revealed to be recited and not only to be recited to be understood and not only to be understood to be implemented in our lives otherwise there is no point in reading it reciting it if you're not gonna implement it and do it Allah says in the holy quran it is he subhanahu wa'ta'ala who has sent down to you Muhammad Ali salat wa salam the book the quran in it our verses that our entire early clear there are the foundations of the book ohm will get up and others not entirely clear so as of us for those in whose hearts there is a deviation people obey Him zal in their hearts there is a deviation Allah Almighty says they follow that which is not entirely clear therefore Seeking Alpha tana and seeking for it's hidden meanings but none knows it's hitting meanings except Allah and those who are firmly grounded in knowledge they say we believe in it the whole of it are from Allah from our Lord the clear and the unclear so Allah is telling us that among us there are people with deviation in their hearts so this is point two because as our brothers who played baseball say strike - we have strike one strike one is that there are 72 sects in Hell strike two there are people among us who have this deviation and their hearts so are we among them well this is what we have to find out inshallah that we would not be but Islam has been hijacked also not only by the people of innovation and following the desires and whims but also by righteous people people like you and me people who claim to follow the Quran and the Sunnah it was hijacked by them because they have limited the truth only to themselves so they have and they're the possessors of the ultimate truth and they use the methodology of the former American president if you're not with us you are against us and they failed to portray the true Islam and to carry the true identity of Islam all what they have succeeded in in eliminating people from the loop of Islam and from the circle of the saved group and they were forced to do this unfortunately especially in this country I've seen since I've been here a lot of respect and generosity from the brothers and sisters in this country and it's overwhelming mashallah the generosity was really illustrated in the fundraising this you cannot find anywhere else except in the UK the people masha allah la quwwata illa billah they are generous they are forthcoming for the sake of Allah because of their sincerity unfortunately we have a number of students of knowledge as well masha'Allah they're good students of knowledge masha'Allah they're sincere they have quite a good amount of knowledge but they're not scholars yet and in this country I've noticed you've seen of gain lots of weight whenever I come people keep on inflating me shake shake shake shake shake until I believe that yes I'm sure enough if I enter a room why isn't everybody standing up and if somebody wants to greet me I do this so that he could kiss my head as if I'm a real Sheikh and this is an illness that annihilates a proper student of knowledge the minute he thinks that he is now a full-fledged scholar meaning that even if there's something I could not find the answer to I could not give the fatwa because I don't have the means to that it's above my level well everybody's waiting for a fatwa I'll improvise I'll shoot from the hip I don't have to do a full draw I'll just do something so I believe that I'm a share I'm a scholar I'm an alum and whenever somebody comes to me with the fatwa of the Supreme Council of scholars or from the permanent committee real real scholars say they don't know they've never been to the UK I've been there and this is a big problem this is why Islam has been hijacked by so many people in each one of them say that I am on the right path and I am part of the saved group allah allah azza wajal told us who are those who will be saved in sha Allah on the day of judgment for example allah says in the quran and whoever contradicts and opposes the messenger sallallaahu anyone who seldom after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers way we shall keep him in the past he has chosen and burned him in health what an evil destination so this is the path of the saved group however I still can't put my finger on which group you're talking about and the $1,000,000 we're in pounds the 1 million pound question would be which group are you referring to so that I can identify myself am i with the saved group or not because we have lots of sects lots of schools of thought lots of as a blot sub groups love lots of perico as they call it and they all claim to have to be the only one the only group that is saved so which one would that be well definitely if you look at the Quran and study it you will know the answer a lot Almighty says in the Quran to those who are deceived by then by their own handiwork Allah says say all shall we tell you the greatest losers in despair of their deeds those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought and underlined this while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds every one thinks that he is acquiring good by his deeds so in order to know whether you are among the saved group or not you have to go back to the basics and I believe that of osama's lecture was going back to the basics going back to the foundations of Islam to the Quran and Sunnah don't be deceived by your own whims and desires don't be deceived by what people tell you you have to cross-reference whatever you do on the Quran and on the Sunnah a lot almighty says o you who believe obey Allah and obey the messenger sallallahu alayhi wa alayhi wasallam and those of you muslims who are in authority and if you differ in anything among yourself he did not tell us to go to the those with the authority if we differ in anything between us the point of reference would be refer it to Allah and his messenger sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam if you believe in Allah and in the last day so whenever we have a dispute among us the referee should be the point of reference has to be Allah and His Messenger and by Allah we are referring to the Quran and by His Messenger we're referring to the authentication of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and one again would say ok but still how can i identify whether i'm on the right track or not the elders say that i am on the right track track the share in the message says that i am on the right track but he is in difference and dispute and he's fighting with the other share in that other group and whenever I prayed there he says you have to repeat your Salah though they're reading the same books of Acadia they're praying the identical way of Prayer what is the difference it's the allegiance it's the sect it's the map it's the his what is it how would I know well scholars say that an individual Muslim has to be one of the three you're either a scholar and a scholar is a person who follows the Delisle the evidence who follows the Quran follows the Sunnah and he follows the authentic interpretation of the scholars the other scholars he has to be he has to be possess a lot of tools to enable him to do this such as the knowledge of the Quran he has to be knowledgeable of the verses that deals at least that deal at least with a camp so that he could stem the rulings from the Quran he has to be knowledgeable with Sunna he has to know the books of hadith he has to know the interpretation and the meanings of this hadith he has to know the science of most volatile hadith that deals with the authenticity of the hadith because what's the use knowing a number of Hadees and using them as your references and evidences while they are unauthentic he has to know the science that deals with all solofill the fundamentals of fit that governs the rules and regulations that allow you to understand what you're reading he has to be knowledgeable in the fill itself so he has to know the previous opinions of scholars and how they got their rulings from the evidences and then he can cross-reference and knows how he they got there and whether this was the right way or not there are many Sciences and tools that enable a person to be a scholar but above all he has to be knowledgeable in you can't expect a person who is an Arab or well let me rephrase that a person who does not know Arabic to come and give rulings and to talk about Islam and he doesn't even know how to interpret women share the gossip in either woke up while I was in Derby few time a while ago a brother came to me and started asking me about the Islam of the Muslim rulers and he is telling me that they are not Muslims their carfare they're doing this and I spent like half an hour talking to him and explaining to him brother you cannot nullify people's Islam just like this there are conditions to be fulfilled there are obstacles to be removed there are a lot a long and hard process to go through and it's not your job in mine and I spent half an hour shivering in the cold and the brother is talking B to me he's got his jumper in his jacket and I was only wearing this so after half an hour of healthy well it's not healthy it's lovely maybe but it's unproductive conversate conversation I had to be a little bit rude which I'm not usually accustomed to anyhow I had to be rude and I said brother you reciting this in every rakah maybe in every Salah in every day and night surat al-falaq and allah says well in Sharia law sitting either welcome pretty shirt ayah what is the meaning of that said I don't know Arabic so much Allah if you don't know Arabic and you want to bring and topple governments down and nullify people's Islam and you don't even know the basics of Arabic and that was it and Allah the brother said suck Allah here and he left because he got the point so therefore you are one of the three either you're a scholar or a student of knowledge you're not a scholar yet you are a scholar to be a scholar in the making you have possessed all of these sciences but in a lower degree you are unable to come up with a verdict of your own you are unable to make up an opinion of your own or a view of your own but by looking in the different schools of thought and by cross-examining there evidences and how they reached then I'm able insha'Allah to come up with a conclusion that seems to me the most authentic opinion it's not opinion that I have made up and it's not it has nothing to do with fatwa shopping the majority of Muslims now are doing fatwa shopping they go into a supermarket with a cart they go to the shampoo aisles and they see that okay I like this three and one nice I'll put it and they take a number of things and then they go to this school of thought this is halal okay this is how I'm mad on night now I'll take it from here the one that was how long here it's halide here I'll take it and at the end of the day they have their cart full of weird opinions that does not that do not relate to the Quran and Sunnah but they relate to the schools of thought so they chose the weakest and the most odd of opinions to collect their own religion which does not relate to Islam we do this a lot in Saudi Arabia when a woman wants to travel somewhere she goes to her husband she states she says I'd like to travel to see my family said I'm not gonna take you she said well you have to you she says go on your own she says I doesn't have I don't have a madam so no no problem he gets the satellite receiver and we have more than 500 satellite channels so he goes okay channel 1 Saudi Arabia and they're too strict channel to this country channel 3 this country ok this country is good let's listen what the Shaykh says and the chef says you can go without a Muslim the Prophet says is it's not hala but as long as you're in an airplane and they're all you know it's safe it's ok go see he says it's okay and he goes on to choose whatever religion he wants from the weird fatwas so this is what a student of knowledge does not do because he fears Allah he looks into the opinions of scholars and he chooses the opinion that he believes is the correct one at the sight of Allah because at the sight of Allah which is the truth all of these schools of thought or one it has to be one it cannot the truth cannot be true at the side of a larger agenda it has to be one but the one who made the mistake Allah will give him one reward the one who made correct choice Allah will give him two rewards but for you as an individual it's not permissible for you to go and pickpocket whatever item you see or school of thought and which makes you the third type of the three types of people and they are the general mass a lamb they are the ignorant ones they could be PhD holders they could be engineers there could be physicians and doctors but they are lay men when it comes to  when it comes to Islamic knowledge like I am amen when I have a toothache I have to go to a dentist I would be doing a wrong choice if I go to a mechanic to fix my tooth likewise I'm a layman and mechanic in mechanic's I can't fix my engines if it's broke life wise I don't know how to make a drawing for my house I don't know how to do this in that because each individual is specialized in a particular science so the majority of us are laymen and laymen have to choose one single limb to follow you have to trust him you have to know that he is humble that his ethics are good that he's not arrogant that he is knowledgeable that he has piety and righteousness in his heart he doesn't sit with the opposite sex and intermingles and cracks jokes and have Allah knows what he has so if I find an item with that fits this then this is the one I should follow if I do not have the knowledge that entitles me to differentiate between the other schools of thought therefore to stop people from hijacking Islam we have to go back to what Allah has instructed us go back to the Quran and to the authentic Sunna clear your heart to all the other brothers there all your brother always carry the flag of Islam what are you Muslim yeah I know mother Salafi super Salafi what are you know I'm a Muslim this is my religion okay what kind of school of thought you follow I respect all kinds of scholars there on my head okay you Hannah female Shafi this is the school of thought they're all good yeah yeah what are your cocktail now I'm not I'm a Muslim what was romanovna ha pop what was even Omar what was even a bass what was Abdullah in my throat the Companions what flag did they carry didn't they have difference of opinions not only insulation also in our teeth as well imagine but not without following the evidence their difference was not because of the whims or because of their forefathers or because of their elders or because of the hue known their differences was based on righteousness and on the evidence they differed did the prophets see Allah or he did not some say he saw him subhana Thailand others say no he could not they differed and the day of judgment when the scale is brought up what is to be weighed is it the records or is it the deed themselves or would the bodies themselves be weighed on the scale on the day of judgment and three opinions are all correct all three would be weighed as the most authentic opinion of scholars so they differ than these things they differed in the gold that a woman had the jewelry is there's a cow or not so their difference is so many things but this did not stop them from being brothers Eunice Asafa D may Allah have mercy on his soul said that I debated with ash a free once and we differed and the following day he came up to me took my hand and said doing us is it possible that we differ and still be brothers for the sake of Allah he said I have never seen anyone smarter like a Shafi these wise can be this wise therefore I conclude my talk with a request that we all become brothers for the sake of Allah if I differ with you in your opinion I respect your difference and I respect what you say as long as it is not in the core of al Qaeda as long as it's not something that would make you a deviant person I respect that you worship the graves and that you slaughter to them and that you call the Dead No then change your app either brother change your religion or this is something you cannot fool with this is difference between Islam and other than Islam but if you believe that covering the face of the woman is mandatory and I don't or the opposite it's a difference of opinion that was there for hundreds of years and it will remain to be I respect what you believe and you respect what I believe and this does not come in between us and we should never do the fatwah shopping and we should always be proud that we are Muslims Allahu Alem sallallahu salaburu horribly also a novena Muhammad you"
