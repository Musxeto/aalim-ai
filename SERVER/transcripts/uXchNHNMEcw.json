  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good in lighting this day's alright as the first I don't witness tonight right with family around a nice meal we're making dawn I feel how nice it is to be so neat to those eyes on Oh commander rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen sallallahu wasallam oh allah qari muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in water and he was a pH my dear brothers sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of virtues of fasting the chapter we are studying is from blue on malum which was compiled by the half of the manhaj Alaska Donnie and it's definitely about fasting hadith number 15 in this chapter this hadith was narrated by aisha may allah be pleased with her and she said that the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam would kiss and embrace his wives while fasting for he had the most control of all of your of all of you over his desires and this was agreed upon why did half of the manager bring this hadith in the chapter of fasting well we've defined fasting earlier that it is the intention of worshiping Allah sol-gel through refraining from the things that nullify fasting from the break of dawn till sunset so in order for us to fast we must know what effects are fasting otherwise you may fast and do things that nullify your fasting without knowing so it is essential this becomes obligatory upon every Muslim and muslimah to have and possess such knowledge because knowledge is divided into two types knowledge that is mandatory which your Islam cannot be without a knowledge that is communal obligation a communal obligation in the sense that if some from the community does it then the rest are exempted but if no one does it they're all sinful and an example of this type of communal obligation is when someone says must I know exactly the nasab the threshold of the cat of crops or of camels if I don't have crops or camels nan says no because you know that there is an obligation but you don't know the details and you don't have to know the details this is not related to your day-to-day activities and you can be born live and die as a Muslim without even knowing this information and this would not affect your email at all but when it comes to issues of prayer for example and someone after 60 years of being a Muslim says ha I didn't know that passing went nullify his widow Subhan Allah how is this possible so this is something that every Muslim should know of what are the things that nullify fasting even hazier may allah have mercy on his soul brought this hadith because in his book he brings the evidence is that schools of thought use that might be correct and it may not be correct it might be authentic as in the hadith of Aisha it's agreed upon and it may be weak but his point was that this is to give you an idea where the jurors got their verdicts from its not from thin air it has to be it had to be based on something that is concrete but maybe it was the wrong interpretation maybe it was the wrong evidence this depends from case to case so one of the three things that all Muslims agree upon that nullify fasting is sexual intercourse eating and drinking these three are mentioned in the Quran in surah al-baqarah Allah so jeal tells those who are married to enjoy their spouses if they wish as long as it's nighttime once the break of dawn is there they cannot do that likewise eating and drinking until you can recognize the white thread which is the break of dawn from the black thread which is the night so these three are agreed upon we have no problem with that we come to something that is similar to intercourse so what about intimacy that does not reach the level of intercourse does this affect the widow some jurors say yes because this is your desire and you enjoy this and well as fasting you should totally refrain from that he'd been hajar may Allah be pleased may Allah have mercy on him brought us this hadith to strengthen the opinion of those who said that this has no effect on your fasting and evidence is that the Prophet Alice awesome as mother Aisha used to say he used to kiss he used to embrace he used to fondle with his wives and this shows you that he's a human being and it shows you that he is full in his manhood and it shows you that he is loving to his wife's but he would control himself so that he would not have intercourse while fasting or ejaculate while fasting and she is telling us may Allah be pleased with her he was stronger than all of you in controlling his desires no one is like him and that is the most authentic opinion that kissing and fondling and intimacy and embracing the spouse does not affect the fasting providing that a person is sure and he's safe from falling into intercourse that would void his fasting or from ejaculating that would also void his fasting so many times people argue and ask why did the prophet alayhi salatu salam have nine wives and he was married to more than nine why did he do this why did he do that and they try directly or indirectly tarnished the reputation of our prophet alayhi salatu salam we all unfortunately remember the Danish cartoons that took place like seven eight years ago and it was a criminal act and it was disgusting with the grace of all I did not see it and I don't think most Muslims had seen it because it's an act of apostasy to watch such a thing why would the Muslim do that and they were depicting the prophet alayhi salatu salam and whenever a missionary talks ill about a prophetess I'm whenever an atheist talk ill about a prophet alayhi salatu salam we're offended we offended because we love him we know him and we trust him sallallahu alayhi wasallam but these ignorance these imbeciles do not know anything about him or about his message they're driven by hatred by envy and I can understand that there are sick people I can understand that but anyone with objectivity any with sincerity would have a correct balance between things not because north and south ireland fought against each other for so many years and so many fatalities were there it would be unfair for me to say that Christianity is a violent religion and both are Christians it would be unfair to say that world war one and world war two was the work of christians because then I'm tarnishing a whole religion for the actions of few millions and this is wrong likewise if you want to be fair and just read the biography of the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam and look what had happened over the span of 23 years of his lifetime and get a pen and a paper and write down his shortcomings if you would ever managed to get some over a period of 23 years and then come and tell me is this something to be criticized for or to be praised for not having accept these things that are in your imagination considered to be shortcomings so what about him marrying sallallahu alehiwassallaam they say that the prophet allison is a womanizer it's all along why her to send me peace and praise of allah be upon him the best of a las creation a creation the best man ever to walk the earth they say he loves women and he that he is a womanizer well I would dare any man to say that he does not love women and if there were any then they have to check their hormones because they're not men this is natural any man its built-in in his chips in his genes that he is inclined to the opposite sex too women so this is natural now being a womanizer you have to be fair how many wives did the Prophet that is a son marry oh he made it over almost 18 and he died while having nine okay do the math when did he first got married when he was 25 and he married a woman who was 15 years older and he remained married to her for approximately lets say 28 years 27 years he remained married to the same woman who was at the time approximately 60 plus years old almost close to 70 maybe and never ever he married another wife while he was with her so is this the actions of a womanizer in the peak of his youth when he is 25 years of age until he is 51 or 52 years of age and not marrying a second wife is this a womanizer and he's not married to someone who's younger than he is his Manning to an old woman and when he got married again allah√≠s a lot was Sarah he remained married for about four years and he married to women after the death of his wife Khadija may Allah be pleased with her he married saluda wind juma who was 54 years old and he married Aisha may Allah be pleased with her who was nine years old I look at the huge difference now would he be a womanizer for marrying a 50 year old woman where he had all the women of Arabia available if he wanted to pick and choose he had the lineage he had the reputation he had the character he had the charisma he had everything but he didn't sol La Jolla because all of his marriages are driven by protecting Dean and they are instructed by allah azzawajal the woman who proposed both women sewed the aunt Aisha is one and and he told her that when she suggested Aisha he told her that she's very young and she told him that it is not that young as he thinks thai people say are okay the Prophet Alice of Salaam proposed to I show and she was 60 years old and he married her physically when she was nine years old now he's a pedophile are all doable a min ash-shaytani r-rajim how dare you say such a thing do you know the Prophet Isis and to say such a thing do you know his track record do you know his life do you know what he did to humanity let us not go into that because it's pointless with these people let's take the facts historical fact when she was 6 years old she was engaged to someone by the name of Joe Byron Morton and he broke his engagement with her when she was 6 years old so she wasn't mad at she was proposed to and they agreed and they were happy that this engagement was broken fact number two it is Allah who ordered him to marry aisha and gibril the arc angel brought him her picture and he told her and he told him that Allah wants you to marry her and we when he unveiled it was a ashes picture so the Prophet said if Allah wills it it will happen and the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not actually matter her until she was 9 years of age and did it cross anybody's mind that why didn't any of the Christians the Jews the idol worshippers the fire worshippers at the time of the Prophet awesome and in the coming 100 500 1000 years after his message did it cross anybody's mind that are this is inhumane this is the acts of pedophiles and he shouldn't have married someone this young where is human rights no one ever spoke about this why did we buy them off at the time we didn't have oil accept 100 years ago before that we were nothing on deserts so why didn't anybody speak against it dance is very simple because it was the norm everybody used to get married at such an early age not only women not only girls even boys and these hot climates girls are females they reach the age of puberty very quickly much earlier than the people in cold climates and also they are well built so usually you could step something it's everywhere sometimes you see a woman and I've seen this that is like 18 or 19 years old and you think that she's nine years old she has the body of a child the voice of a child and sometimes you see a girl and you lower your gaze and sister for law and you find out that she is 10 years old but she is fully formed and well-built so this happened and this was the norm and nobody ever voice any objection and look at the benefits of the profits marrying I saw some more than one this hadith is an example there are things that are intimate between a man and his wife and the Companions would not know about it so we needed the mothers of the believers we needed the wives of the Prophet ostrom to tell us about the way that the Prophet as I'm used to behave used to act to tell us how he used to do certain things that his male companions did not see and we have plenty of such hadith and such narrations that enrich our religion with how the Prophet as salaam used to do in forms of prayer his night prayer he is fasting his taking his private things how he used to perform o Sole and so many many other things that some people would feel bashful of discussing but this is not something that is recommended in Islam you have to discuss these things if you keep on being shy and afraid of speaking then this would not lead you anywhere you have to talk and learn and this is why when it comes to truth there has to be no barriers you have to say the truth as it is without any sugar coating and among the benefit you at the wives of the prophet alayhi salatu salam each one of them had a story what none of them was a beauty pageant no no what was Miss Universe or one of the richest women on the 500 Forbes list no they were women most of them either widowed or divorced and most of them had a benefit to either give to Islam or the Prophet wanted that is awesome to have mercy on that woman and he married her so that she would not be in hardship example so that was 54 years of age from Koresh and she had no one the Prophet married her Alesana she was old who would marry a 54 year old with all due respect to old women a lot would marry you I know but if you were like the Prophet Alice Sena if you were someone as powerful and as big and great as the Prophet la salsa who would the Prophet choose okay what about Aisha she was very young at least a lot of Sam did not marry her except because Allah told him to and she was the daughter of his best friend Abu Bakr and you can tell that this made the bond much stronger later on he married hafsa the daughter of whom are in the hot tub his second best friend and when her husband died she was heartbroken Roma himself went to earth man and you know that was meant the third caliph when I finally peace with him was married to two daughters of the prophetess sir when the first one died the Prophet gave him his second daughter so when the guy was a widowed Romar went to him and said listen why don't you marry hafsa you're a widow she's a widow another one did not feel like Madison no I'm too depressed I'm not up to it now so he went to Abu Bakr and he told Abu Bakr how about you marrying my daughter hafsa and they were eager to get their daughters married because it is not the normed for a woman to stay without marriage even if she has to be the second the third the fourth wife no problem but not to stay single abu bakr did not reply and armor felt bad because he ignored me he did not reply to me and then abu bakr may allah be pleased with him later on the news came and the prophet has some proposed to hafsa himself and omar was jubilant and happy only then I Walker came to him and said Omar my brother I know that you felt bad when I did not respond to you but previously I heard the prophet as salaam mention houses name so I knew that he had the intention of getting married to her otherwise by Allah I would have married her for myself so the Prophet married her an assistant and the bond got stronger with his companions who else umm salamah home cinema was the wife of abu salim and abu salim died in medina may allah be pleased with him and they were among the first to migrate to medina and he was the prophets cousin and also his brother through suckling so Abu salama Hamza and the prophet has some were brothers through suckling when I was on my diet and she was out of her idea waiting period the prophet sent to her Alesana proposing to her and she said I'm an old woman and I have children and I am jealous so the Prophet said Alice Oh Sam you're not older than me and your children are in my custody I will take care of them as for your jealousy I will pray to Allah to take it away from you and he married her if you look at Zeinab in Josh she is the cousin of the prophetess on the first cousin but she was married to his adopted son when adoption was permissible she was married to Osama to issue as matter to zete it been Haditha and we know that you cannot marry your daughter in law but adapt adoption is not actual managed or it's not an actual relationship so it was abolished in Islam there is no adoption you cannot give your name to anyone you pick up from the street or from an orphanage and when he divorced her Allah ordered him inserted as app to marry her so that this would abolish the issue of adoption totally because others say ha he married his son's wife but this is not the case and he married a release a lot o sanam if you look at on Habiba bid ABI Sufyan her father was one of the dignitaries the fierce enemies of Islam but she was a muslimah and she migrated to Abyssinia and her husband a committed an act of apostasy if i'm not wrong and he died there he became Christian and died so she was stranded there and she was the daughter of the the chief of quraish she cannot go back to perish because they will make fun of her and torture her and she cannot stay alone so the Prophet I said I'm sent her dowry to and the joshi the king of Abyssinia he married her and she came back to Medina if you look at safi event oh yeah even a pub her father her uncle and her brother and her husband we're enemies of Islam they plotted relentlessly to kill the Prophet lazim to demolish Islam at the very end the Prophet I sasaram got his hands on them and he killed them all and Sofia was a was a slave girl and because she was the daughter of the chief of a tribe it was inappropriate to be sold and treated as a slave so the Prophet is a lot of Salaam told her that he would marry her and she accepted Islam and she became a free woman and a mother of the believer and a Muslim if you look at maimuna mental health if you look at Zeinab mental health if you look at so many of the prophets wives sallallahu REO salem you will find that they were not what you any man would look for in the sense of beauty wealth and age so all of his marriages where for a purpose for a reason to come by one of his wives the Prophet Alice salatu salam when he married her she managed because of that marriage that the prophetess m addressed her people and said that I married this woman and all of her tribe were prisoners of wars and slaves they met when they saw that the Prophet married this woman from that tribe they said all of them free for the sake of allah azzawajal so there are so many benefits when you look at it and you will find that these all for the purpose of serving Islam and we got so many hadith so many narrations that add to our knowledge of how the prophetess m used to treat his wives how was the prophetess I'm in his patterns when he used to go to bed what would he do when he performed would do also the voluntary prayers in the house all of these are reported through his wives and this hadith is one of them so the prophet alayhi salatu salam though he was the top in his manhood the strongest and not only that and this shows you how strong and manly the Prophet was an assistant the hadith states that he in one single night used to pass by all of his nine wives and have intercourse with them one would say ah what is this how can you disclose such a thing this is for the fact-finding mission in the sense that you have to learn the permissibility of doing this if you have three wives can I go and have intercourse with all of them in the same night of course not together the answer is yes because the Prophet did it I saw some wood one wasn't so this shows us that the Prophet was full in his manhood sallallahu alehiwassallaam yet such a man with such strength and passion one would expect it that if he were to fondle and play and kiss and embrace his wife while fasting the would inevitably lead to enter course not the profit at is sought asylum with his full strength and manhood he was the strongest among all of us in controlling his desires so he would never ever fall into intercourse while fasting or ejaculation while fasting while others may fall in doing this and this becomes prohibited for them if it's not the case for you then it is permissible for you to fondle and play with your wife without any problem and that is why when asked about the kiss for a person who's fasting to kiss his spouse he said Alice of Salaam if you put water in your mouth and turn it as in the case of Voodoo would this nullify your fasting he said no because he's going to spit it out it's likewise if a person kisses his spouse or her spouse we have a short break stay tuned and after that inshallah we will take your questions so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome

in the hadith of loki tomisaburo may allah be pleased with him the Prophet said adding salatu salam exaggerated sniffing the water up your nose nostrils unless you are fasting so exaggeration is recommended except if you're fasting because this would mean that it would go into your passage and would go into your stomach the nose is a pass passage to the stomach like the mouth so it does not invalidate your fasting unless you swallow some of that water bra him from Nigeria are you say Allah yes number one has somebody from Nigeria a Muslim from Madeira who has shattered person because we

Gambia yes Ibraheem yes mute your television and listen to me from the phone please apparently Ibrahim muted his phone not his television anyhow we have Muhammad Amjad Arabia he's his question I think we've addressed this about pulling the water up your nostrils Ibrahim from Nigeria he says that if a person from Nigeria who happened too fast on Saturday travel to Saudi who happen to fast it on sunday so they would be adding more days to their fasting than the people of Nigeria the rule is as follows one the Prophet said that is awesome the fasting is the day you fast meaning in the country and they eat or the breaking of fasting is the day you break your fast that is in the country so if you are in Saudi Arabia and they've sighted the moon you start fasting if you travel to anywhere else keep on fasting until they in that country you are in celebrated but then you have to calculate so if it happened that you fasted only 28 days because you started late and you went to a country that celebrated eight early so you fancied only 28 days in this case you have one day to make up but if it so happens that you fasted 30 or 31 days this is no problem it is considered to be part of Ramadan as well we have arsh from Saudi Salaam aleikum Shaikh Salman ramadan kareem hello mubarek to you as well she's basically i'm from india and i have a question regarding interest we have deposited our money in Indian banking system and unfortunately we do not have Islamic vacuum system there in India and I'm worried that even if we don't like the bank is giving us interest on our stamey account and current accounts so I want to ask that if this money is like can you take this can we use this money that bank gives us I mean if you did not ask for this money and to put one point

about momentum Saudi Arabia Oh a little here Santa ma I have a question concerning Sola and it is for example I mom is too fast than you maybe he finish Allah makes her the salon before you before you finish they left a shout then my second question is how can somebody dispose a harem household maybe can you burn it or how can you how can he do it that's basically what was kind of haram haram what Yanni household may be there baby system taking something of that sort and where did you get it from I get it from a doing some job which job which I have been I'm we bribed somebody get that job I'm dialing Muharram is it okay yeah I will inshallah okay braheem this question first one with through this he says that as a person who has triple closest or whose sake or his ill how does he fast well if this illness of his affect his fasting meaning that he is unable fast he gets tired he needs to have his medication while in the state of a fasting which means that it will void and nullify his fasting in this case is exempted he's excused Alonso jail gave him the permission to break his fast but if his illness does not affect his fasting for example he has a tennis elbow it's all it's killing me it's hurting me okay are you taking medications no no no but I have to just you know make it rest and I can't fast no we have to fast this is not connected so I hope this answers your question oh my gosh man from saudi assalamu alaikum she sample ma che girl my question is my father like every two months or three months he will take injection for his eye because of dr. suggestion he is having some problem in his eye so he is that he asked me if guys fasting he can take that injection inside ok any more questions no Jessica and we have om sera from saudi salam alayka were able to left but a cat anymore Sam mobile rocket I have a question and likeness loud this it will not break in ship one of my sisters has stopped talking to me and I have tried my best to reconcile with her I've asked her what is the problem she never answers my calls and always avoid me and I'm still trying my best what else can I do because I do not want to be seen wrong in the eyes of God you know I'm trying my best ok I'll answer your question Sharla very much ma salaama Nora from Saudi Arabia sanam la la oh la la salat al hajj earth when we do it and fella who shook loose riani how to thank a line like make our separate follow is it so local shoe karana or what we call it ok interlocken cultured oh we should do it and what ok any more questions ok I will answer your question Charla and our from Saudi Arabia he is a bit offended because he always thought that reciting the fat high is mandatory in some times I say that it's okay to read it in a very quick paced when the Imam gives a pause in yesterday I said that giving a pause is not part of the Sun so he's sort of any upset I don't no need to be upset you can go to my youtube channel and you'll find the same rhetoric unchanged with the grace of allah so jeal it's an issue of dispute whether fatihah is mandatory to be recited or not some say it is mandated sand a pillar I'm talking about cloud prayers when you are a follower not an imam or an individual you're praying behind an imam in a loud prayer malaysia or fechar the first two records so some say it's mandatory you have to pray it whether you'll find time you don't find time the Imam gives you a pause you have to create others say no you don't pray that all not even in silent records and the moderate and in between opinion is the opinion of chehalis lambent Amy Allah have mercy on his soul and this is also the opinion of imam malik before him he says that in loud prayers you don't have to pray it you don't have to recite fatiha it is highly recommended but it's not a must in prayers that are silent it's a pillar so it is recommended to recite it in loud prayers and I said that the recommendation is there so if the Imam gives you a pause then go ahead and recite it in it if it doesn't they don't find time then ignore it now having said that what's the ruling on having the pause between the fatty Honda surah I said that this is not part of the sooner how dare you say such a thing yeah sure well you say it's a Sunnah bring me the evidence it's a very easy thing to say that is whoever claims that this is part of the Sun bring me your evidence if i come to you tomorrow and I say saying Allah Akbar and you put your hands over your head through the prayer and I say this is soon it's great you say she said no your challenge we said what is that the lien so does the Sunnah say ok show it to me a key in the box of the Sun a Bihari Muslim Buddha wouldn't say thermal imager Adaro hot Neil hockey most democratic the whole nine yards is there any hadith that's authentic let's say says that the Prophet after saying right I'm Aldo very mobile Dean used to pause for a while and then would recite know so this is as simple as that and this is my argument Abu Bakr from Saudi come on where you could shake senator Amidala thank you so much for this wonderful job wherever you are doing for second my hair should I have to question yes the first question is I come from part of Africa where we have this tradition of after Tosha hood after salam you see people shaking hands I don't know what it is it right or not shaken hands shaking hands with each other yes six chickens which is each other okay whether it is to know what I really don't know and say my second question is I have a sick father is almost 90 something years now and he's finding it very difficult to fast and I don't know that way out what we are going to do as the children of this old man okay I wanna see me inshallah our answer you're welcome may Allah bless you two are the

I want one question that and the second one is I've heard that when we are to ablution the remaining water do we drink it it has a lot of thing you can you suggest me remaining water remaining water in the vessel itself or the water you've already washed your limbs with you drink it no the remaining water in the West will we had do we drink it or okay oh yeah after using them both occur for bution the water which remains in the vessel do it ring and any other good sooner treatment for stomach ailment I will answer you in shock you're welcome okay with this we conclude the questions now we try to answer the questions in the remaining time inshallah sherry from Saudi Arabia is asking what's the ruling on learning for the pleasure for fun on a musical instrument this is totally prohibited music listening or playing or conducting or writing all is totally prohibited in islam and this is the consensus of scholars the force called schools of thought a manager from Saudi Arabia she says that on Wednesday she wants to come from taif and today's Wednesday tomorrow she wants to go to Jeddah to put her kids with her mom she wants to make a haraam from them apart and she says how would I prepare because today I'm supposed to become pure well don't assume a Haram unless you are sure that you are pure if you're not and you have to go on Thursday so that friday you would make your home run in this case make a condition so as you are coming whether today or tomorrow to Jeddah you make your rom assume you're hung from the mail cart even if you have your menses and say labaik alahambra for inhabits any habits from a hilly hate to have a STEMI if there were something to prevent me from completing my umrah then i can become halal and take off my rom wherever you have prevented me from completing and with this if you did not become a clean till friday and you had to go back to your tote I if then you can take off your home without any expiation and Witter and pollute country can we pray one raka water and make poo note and answer is yes and how can we prevent people children from cartoons give them alternatives first of all block all means to the cartoon so there's no channels like NBC 3 or whatever the deviant channels that show deviant things don't close it drop it off and then give them alternative give them Islamic alternative that would fulfill their requirements hours from Saudi Arabia she says that they have money deposited in banks so they get interest what to do with this interest if there is no other account that does not give interest you forced to get this interest you may take the interest and you can give it in means of charity as a form of cleansing your money your wealth so this is similar to the question of a zahara from the Ambridge you can give it to the poor to the needy or you also can use it to pay off your property taxes your income taxes whatever that the government takes from you this is not lawful to be paid to the government it's their responsibility to support me and to provide for me not the other way around but if this is what they are mandating upon me in this case using this hard on money to pay their haram taxations is permissible insha'Allah providing that you do not have a choice that this is something you have to take and Muhammad's question from Saudi Arabia the Imam sometimes says that the Shahada offers salon before we can conclude so what to do no problem you can continue to make your tea sure how they make diet until you finish and then offer the Salam and he says that he has possessions from obtained and bought from her on money now he is repenting what to do estimate how much they cost at the moment and give the money to means of charity I'm a black man from Saudi Arabia she says her father takes an injection in an eye this doesn't affect your fasting at all and this would we will discuss maybe tomorrow or the day after insha Allah as thou shalt the injection in the eye the eye drops do not affect your fasting I'm sorry she says her sister does not want to talk to her she tried she went out of her way but she's still adamant and she is not communicating what to do keep on talking to her keep on sending her smss is sending her a gift until the day she dies by this you would have done your duty in front of alonzo gel she's the one who's going to help and you're not with the grace of Allah because you are connecting to the next of kin Nora's asking salat al haja and Saleh to sugar both are not authentic they are not authentic the hadith are not pathetic so you do not have any right to do these two things a bucket from Saudi Arabia he says that in our country it's a tradition after you finished allah salam alikom you shake hands with on your right on your left this is an innovation so if somebody does this to me do I say no decision innovation no I would reply the salon but i would not initiate it because this was not the doing of the prophetess his father is 90 years old and he cannot fast very normal abdul omnibus a lot of the Companions of the Prophet a time when they grew this old they could not faster they used to feed for every day so your father may Allah Georgia bless his soul after the end of Ramadan you can cook food and invite 9 30 people to eat from that food until they're full and they leave and hollis this is enough insha Allah cimron is asking about the issue of wearing an outer garment and trousers underneath and sometimes it's open this is not appropriate in prayer this requires a lot of movement from your site so we do what all our sisters do stitched it so it becomes like abaya and it would not open and it would not expose what's underneath Sahara Ambridge she says that she forgot in the first sitting instead of just saying it yet she said Allah my Allah Muhammad Ali Mohammed afterwards so she said then I remembered what should I do no problem finish it and stand up and if you interrupt it and stand up this is the same o Muhammad says that she had a hundred grams of gold they sold it and they gave the money to someone who was poor what to do with the zakat ask the money from that person and if he gives it back to you you have to give 2.5% if he says that I apologize I don't have money or he rejects giving it back in this case you don't have to pay zakah until you receive the money and the final question is that when we make wudu and there remains water in the vessel that we performed will do from so some say that if you drink that water it's very good for your digestive system etc this is totally baseless and it has no foundation and it's an innovation to even believe vinit let alone act upon it and it's not even hygienic so do not do this this is all the time we have until we meet next time tomorrow i leave you feel manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh while watching the noon siding it felt like a good in lighting this day's alright as the first outer wing has tonight right with family around a nice meal we're making doin I feel how nice it is to be so neat to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can Oh Oh"
