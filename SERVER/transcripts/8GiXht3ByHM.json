  "transcript": "all right perfect with no flaws at all how the laws a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of life all praise belongs to Allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam I welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are going to be discussing funerals and death joining us in discussing this topic we have at the issue from Saudi Arabia Muhammad from the USA from Canada from the UAE may Allah reward you all for joining us now in our last episode we were talking about some of the signs that are given to a person we know that there are a number of signs given to a person in their life when they're on the right path we know after death there are signs however at the moment of death you see as well that Allah gives signs to a Believer and this can be a form of glad Tiding for the person and it can be as well something that inspires others so we mentioned for example some of the good endings praying whilst you die reading Quran and then you have the opposite bad signs when a person dies in disobedience and of course we know that you're going to be raised to Allah in this state so this is a reminder for each of us to make sure and we don't just make sure because we don't know when we're going to die but we make sure by obeying Allah throughout our lives and I'm going to start with you about a few more of these signs of a good ending that the believer aspires to among the good signs or form of death which grants you martyrdom mentioned that a woman in her labor the woman dying in her labor is a shahidah and those who are fathers who already they know what a woman goes through at that particular moment he sees death before her eyes that's why you can't reward your mother you can't reward her she went through many things this brings to mind the famous story of the man carried his mother his back from Yemen to Makkah and he started making tawaf and when he asked a companion or one of the olamide he said boasting feeling that we are breaking even now he thought that they were breaking even said I carried her on my back from Yemen till here what do you think he said can she walk said yes he said let her walk all this is not even equal to one of the contractions of Labor one so no wonder if Allah makes the paradise at her feet because she went through many many things you can't reward your mother so a woman dying in the labor Prophet sallam said he is is yahida also he said person dying because of plague maroon so the plague if a person dies because of that then he's a Mata and the prophet sallam he told us that when you hear about the break of the plague in a town if you are inside don't leave you're outside don't enter I remember one of the olama said I asked an expert on Plague disease if this disease breaks in your country what will you do he said I will isolate the whole country all exits air space sea and land I will not let anyone inside to live or anyone outside to enter said I can understand those outside not to enter because it is contagious disease why why you would not allow them to leave he said the moment this disease breaks all the people got affected some bodies they have high immunity resists but they become carrier so if they leave they will spread it somewhere else who taught Muhammad this that the whole country becomes a quarantine and that's why also some of the bokaha when they mentioned why shouldn't they said also because it is martyrdom why are you fleeing from dying as a matter Shaheed shahada this is another form that the Jinn they kill a person if a person who was killed by the Jinn is also that's what the prophet salallahu said and we know this Hadith Muslim of the sahabi that begin killed him and also another thing he said well Shaheed a person dies because of a disease inside the abdomen abdominal diseases and some of the Armada included all these different fatal diseases so alhamdulillah Allah's bounties are innumerable did now you've mentioned a few examples here some of them sudden and some of them that are hardships that a person might suffer through now the sudden death we can't prepare for it this is a reality that it's going to come and you're not really going to have a say however when it comes to sicknesses uh old age things like this we can start to prepare so getting closer to the actual death what are some of the things that we can do whether we're with those who are dying or whether we ourselves are the person who is dying before we step into this I'd like to make connection between what the Sheikh said these cases of being plagued or having a Calamity or tsunami or as the Sheikh mentioned also I'd like to connect it and this would be a very good answer for those who always raise this question why me why this country why this Village and not another Village and most of the people see it from a negative perspective although what we have heard now it's from a positive perspective because every Muslim in the bottom of his heart or her heart aspires to die as a Shaheed and now it came to them without the request so Allah prepared those people to let them die with this type of death because they will go to a higher level of paradise so all the time that's why we don't hear we have to ask the scholars what is the situation all the time instead of trying to interpret what we have in our minds or to analyze what is in the media we have immediately to go to see the Muslim Scholars what they say about this situation in fact we should be happy for them because they got this quality of death inshallah even for the ones who don't die it's a reminder I just wanted to comment it's a little bit funny take us a little bit off the topic maybe put some spices on it sure Salim was mentioning one of the good signs of dying that you are macaroon and I remember once going to one of the Islamic centers in the U.S not physically but on the web trying to see some of their materials and one of the imams of that Center was translating the good signs of death and he translated it to be a stabbed and I don't know if the guy is from New York maybe it's from the ghettos or some projects and this is the way they think that the prophet was referring to and this is extremely important that a person who translates is fluent in both languages especially when it comes to Quran yes but let me comment on this in Translation it can work both ways and this tells us the importance of the understanding of the companions of this context true so it's not just a problem of a language here it tells you that you need to go to a scholar or to study this whole context in order to come up with a good translation so matron means Implement a person with the plague which is an epidemic but matron as in stabbed it comes from the word pan and you have to be careful when you are referring to that as for your question you've posted earlier what is our duties what should we do if we are on dying bed which we tackled that before and we said that you have to think positively of Allah azzawajal and feel your sins as well but those around a person who's dying we also said that they should remind him of and when he dies and if he dies there are a set of things that they should do among the first is that they should not supplicate anything that is negative because Allah would assign his angels to say Amen so if my loved one dies and I say oh may Allah make me instead of him the angel will say I mean so you have to have positive Dua may Allah forgive him may Allah make it easy upon him so this is yeah I mean one of the things that come to mind which also shows the the positive spirit of Islam all the time when you trace Islam in all events all the time adopts the positive thing to do so now we're at the point we're assuming a person has died person is now going to return to Allah now we have the duties of the family the community and all of the other people so from the time that a person actually dies many of the duties are going to come now we're going to go to a very short break in sha Allah and then we're going to try and list some of these things and you know the duties and who will be hosted to do what so inshallah we will discuss this in a very short moment so dear viewers do stay tuned insha Allah will be back with you after a very short moment themselves welcome back to your viewers we're here with our dear sure discussing the topic of death and funerals now just before the break we were mentioning that we're now at the point where a person has passed away we have his family his friends the community at large who are there so from the point of death as soon as the person dies and I'll ask you Chef Muhammad Sharif what are the duties that now become important for those around to do one of the obviously the main duty right here is going to be to wash the body and bury the body as the prophet salallahu said that one should hasten in bearing the body so for example if there's somebody well known and famous and whatnot and they there's a big deal made out of their funeral and they delay the funeral and many people are coming that shouldn't be the attitude of the Muslim attitude of the Muslim be that this person dies that they arrange for the washing of the body and the janaza and get that done in a hasty pace and in addition to that though not Hasty so much that nobody comes to the janaza prayer right you want a large crowd to come to the janaza prayer when my grandmother rahmallah when she passed away it was an awkward it was a weekend day and so on so forth but following the Hadith of the Prophet salallahu I wish for a large Gathering of people to come so they could pray for her and so I sent the message out I told people you know my grandmother's eye please make time today and come to the Jazz alhamdulillah the Masjid was full salt it was not in the same day then I mean it was done hastily but also you wait until you've got that crowd of people so that there's enough people to pray for the janaza and having people praying at the janaza sometimes this can be a good sign not only a good sign that is if only 40. sincere Muslims they do not associate any partner with Allah monotheist believers attend the janaza Allah grants them the right to be intercessors for you and accepts their intercession and their Dua now a person is dying when the person is dying it's the angel of death will come totally one Angel but he has helpers and His Name by the way is not Israel his name is the Angel of Death now the soul reacts in different ways the righteous soul comes out easily comes out easily like a drop of water flowing smoothly out whereas The Evil Soul or rebellious Soul disperses in the body and the angel traces it and takes it out and it is so painful like the prophet sallam said like a hook in wet wool do not come out easy it will tell everything this is that different than the sickness because sometimes you see a good believer but they've been through heavy sickness and then but when the soul is extracted he's saying the soul goes out easily or how does it work the soul comes out flows easily and smoothly this is a good ending brother Muhammad is referring to is how do we combine between this Hadith of the Soul coming out easily and three weeks of Agony and pain because of sickness so this is the death itself the departing of the Soul which is at the very end the different matters then towards the end towards the ends because the opposite also applies if a disbeliever dies quietly and we see that he's him dying peacefully this is not a good death because he's peacefully passing away but the minute the soul is being taken out of his body it is Hell nobody sees it we see the body we don't see this we don't see it so now the prophet salallahu is telling us that when and the Soul by the way it's something material something physical that's why there is a conversation between the angel of death and the son that is something created by Allah and it is something physical something tangible something material and the angel if it is a good soul will be wrapped and they bring this shroud from the Jannah and a very nice smell comes out the moment the soul comes out and Allah knows it seems it comes out maybe through the mouth the sight as the prophet sallam said the sight follows it Souls goes up up to where to Allah where they came from it doesn't go to the right it doesn't go to the left because Allah is up Allah is above the creation so the side follows the soul and then we have to close the eyes so this is Sunnah yes you close the eyes it is Sunnah and it's interesting to note that we know from the narration we've mentioned that the soul is taken out and you will see this many times and I've spoken to brothers who work as paramedics in the ambulance and I would say this you know that the person is about to die the moment they look up as if it's following the soul that's being taken out of their body subhanallah from their eyes from seeing watching their eyes indeed mentioned something very important that the number of the people who would make the Salat al-janaza for the deceased person as we know that there are some narrations one of them is 100 the other one is 40. but the most important thing here is that they are they have no shirk in their hearts and I'd like to focus on this that the person who would have no shirt in his heart would do definitely favor to himself and he or she will go to paradise because they die as muhad and at the same time he can save others try to imagine that by being more than being by being away from church is that you can help many other people that because you can save them by being one of these 40 or one of these 100 when humanities associating others with Allah so it's a very important issue in Islam and I think any Muslim with some reason in his mind he would spend some time asking himself or developing this am I having some it's worthy of spending some time and asking Scholars all the time because it's the final thing you want to get paradise and this is if you die even if you do other sins but not sure you can repent from them yeah the church you have to repent from it and you have to correct what you have in your village so it's very important and it works both ways when we actually have the janaza now the Genesis shouldn't be delayed we don't do for example we wait a week but then at the same time we also want to make sure that others are aware of this as Sheikh Muhammad mentioned that we have to let others know so inshallah we can have these at the funeral so generally I mean is there a time limit that suggested uh should we write letters to people you know how do we go about this process well when a person dies the Sunnah tells us what to do so Hadith um pleased with her when Abu Salama died the prophet came in they were wailing and the prophet told them do not supplicate upon yourself because the angels will say amen and the first thing the prophet did was to close his eyes as Sheikh Salim indicated and this is part of the Sunnah also part of the Sunnah is to cover the body because the prophet Allah he died they covered his body and covering the body for all people who die so that people would not be affected by the appearance of the deceased now in different schools of thought there are lots of things to be done but they're not backed by the Sunnah they may be backed by practice they may be backed by a good will and intention for example if the jaw drops of a disease some schools of thought say that you have to close the mouth so that you don't have any insects going in and if it is not possible because there are no muscles then some of them even go to the extent of tying the jaw up by a ribbon or not of course a ribbon that are used for children but this is something intended for the sake of not getting the mouth open and even people when they look at their loved ones in this status they wouldn't feel so good about it some schools of thought even say that you have to loosen the limbs so that they're not stiff so the minute a person dies you just loosen his elbows his knees so that it would be flexible when you come to wash them some schools of thought say that you put something a little bit heavy on the stomach so that when a person dies due to the warmth of the weather he may swallow his stomach and so they keep something on his stomach to prevent this some put a brick some put something heavier some lessen in weight but Scholars say if you keep them in an air-conditioned room this would not be necessary all of this is not from the Sunnah but it is something that the scholars came up with as part of protection of the body so sometimes maybe you can lighten us about you have these things where they drain the blood where they sow the lips and so the eyes and stuff like that you know this is mutilation this is mutilation that is not permitted in Islam and this is something non-muslims may not be aware of in Islam we have great honor of the disease corpse the prophet tells us that the breaking of the bone of a disease is like the breaking of the bone of a living person so when a person dies we give so much value to that person that we wash and we take care of him we calm his head we perfume him but we don't perform autopsy for example and cut him open and do all of this is unless it's legitimate unless it's something that is for a criminal investigation yes this might be called for but other than that it should be respected and taken care of some people exaggerate this instead of just cleaning and perfuming the body they put the make up and even we've seen this in some communities I've seen it in Indonesia and they dress him up in a suit and with the tie and Muslims oh yeah yeah and this is unfortunately because they were living with non-muslims in the Sun and that's why a Muslim all the time needs to know needs to ask the scholars and I wish that we would have many websites even for the non-educated these websites would be very beneficial in case of somebody dies they would access immediately but they have to all the time train to themselves that we are followers of Muhammad we are not followers of X and Y so all the time we need to keep on the Sunnah in order to do it right we have come to the end of the episode it's been very good discussing the topic with you may Allah you all we hope inshallah to see you in our coming episodes and may Allah reward you also out to your viewers we hope inshallah that you've gained some benefit from this and we hope to see you in our coming episodes until then I greet you Allah"
