  "transcript": "uh is it permissible for someone to wish or believe that maybe Allah will not give him marry to the extra who is in Jenna and only give him his worldly wife as he really doesn't desire or feel feel any kind of attraction to any woman other than his wife and he extremely loves his wife he doesn't make Dua to Allah fearing that this could be a form of transformation uh but is it okay to have this kind of mentality as it motivates him longing for J or is it sinful first of all we believe in whatever the Quran said and definitely we believe in whatever our Prophet Alam told us about Jenna and all the verses of the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet wasam indicate that men would have now to succumb to the pressure of your wife who has little if any e complaining that why would you have other wives when I have only one husband in Jenna as if it's given as if you and her are in Jenna already this is preposterous this is ridiculous where is the fear in your heart that Allah asael may give you a bad ending and you wouldn't not die on Islam No you're not afraid you're already negotiating the size of the Mansion you're going to get in Jenna and the The Gardens and the rivers that run underneath and you're making conditions well I I don't feel like I need a wife other than my worldly wife what what do you know this is transgression by itself you have to submit your will to Allah you don't want to marry a second wife in this life this is your right but don't start putting conditions and saying that I don't want this in Jenna and and if the the house is like uh White I'd like it to be changed into blue and you did not even reach Jenna this is not logical and you should confine yourself to the idea to the concept that Allah has told us in Quran and in the sun Allah Knows Best"
