  "transcript": "foreign it's an issue of disputes some Scholars say that this is a celebration that can only take place in the allocated days in the Sunnah he found that they celebrated on a particular day so he asked what is this so they told him that this is a day that we used to celebrate in pre-islamic Era and we continue to do so so the prophet prohibited that said Allah has replaced you with two days better than that the day of Eid al-fetter which is after Ramadan and the day of which is on the 10th of the hija of the month of pilgrimage Scholars added the three days of ayamutashirik which is the 11th 12th and the 13th to the day of because it's a day of Celebration and feast and remembering Allah it is prohibited for normal people to fast them so they included that so they made those four days per year this is the most authentic opinion some Scholars expanded a bit so they said that regarding the day of Aid of al-fitor which is the first day after Ramadan it wouldn't be so bad if we make it three days because one day would not be sufficient if we have the eighth prayer and the receptions Etc so they added two days to it and when we say celebration usually the only thing that stands out is beating the Duff that's it other than that eating and and visiting people you can do that throughout the whole year there's nothing wrong in that but usually people ask about celebrating so that they would combine in their celebrations than the seeds and the playing of the doof and especially girls and women would like to dance and celebrate in their own way which is lawful and and no problem in that but I'm inclined to restrict that rather to be saved than sorry to these four days one day of and the four days to of uh the total is five and Allah Knows Best"
