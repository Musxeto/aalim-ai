  "transcript": "Okay. She so my uh question is regarding prayer. Uh sometimes when I'm praying I may say a word or a phrase improperly and uh I can't just pull out my phone and look at it on a word form to see if I'm saying it properly. So what I do is I just try to um remember it. What kind of word when I finish the What kind of word? example, if I'm saying uh just if I'm saying the fat and there's a certain phrase like okay, okay, and I and I want to make sure that I said it properly. So, I just and I'm but I'm not sure. So, I just wait until I'm done with the prayer and then I look it up on my phone and then I see if I did it properly or not. But sometimes I forget. Okay. And and and I go through the whole sometimes I forget which phrase it was and then I go through the whole prayer and I can't remember. I try to retrace my steps but I can't remember sometimes. Should I redo the prayer? Hakeem, how long you've been Muslim? Um 23 years. And is it logical? What's your name? Hakeim. How long did it take you to say your name? A second. One second. Yes. And how many times do people ask you your name? A month. Five times. Maybe 10 times. So a name that you do not say except five or 10 times a month. Compared to 23 years of Islam, 365 days a year, 17 raq per day, you do the math. Gazillion times you've recited the fat and still you doubt whether I've said it correctly or not. This is a clear sign of messing up with your head. Just act upon your gut feeling and totally disregard any such withwas because this is what shaitan does to open a can of worms and once you open it it would never be closed. So save yourself save your religion 23 years m you're a veteran you don't need to tell you what you've said correctly or wrongly and Allah knows best."
