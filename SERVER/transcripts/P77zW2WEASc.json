  "title": "Can we give sacrifice of an animal when someone falls sick? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "rania says can we give sacrifice of an animal when someone falls sick I heard from a scholar that this is not permissible since it's like bribing Allah this is not true we do not pry belies the origin we humiliate ourselves we show our poverty to Allah and we offer sacrifice so charity in general is a great mean of getting closer to Allah begging Allah expressing our need to allah azza wajal and there is a hadith that you should cure your patient with charity but if I recall correctly this is a weak hadith can be possible to authenticate but the most authentic opinion that it is weak however the vast majority of scholars are applying it first of all because there's no harm in it there is benefit for the poor and thirdly it is a form of worship that you're doing for Allah Azza WA JAL begging His mercy upon your ill one and insha'Allah there is nothing wrong in that"
