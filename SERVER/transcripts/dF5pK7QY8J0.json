  "title": "Sheikh, would you make a Matchmaking App for those looking to get married? #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Uh she I heard in some of your videos that uh many people calls and ask you about marriage and lot of them don't know where to find the spouse. So she we know and you know better and Allah knows best that you are very busy all all the day but won't you be interested in creating your own app about marriage? This is a very uh intriguing and interesting question because in my counseling sessions I meet hundreds and hundreds of boys and girls who are looking to get married. If I had the brains and the time, I know that I would do an extremely excellent job in matchmaking with the grace of Allah because I have in a way a gift from Allah to understanding people in knowing their personality. It's Allah's gift, alhamdulillah, in addition to experience. But the problem is that I don't have the time nor the brains. And so many come to me and matchmaking is a responsibility. It's not just oh okay this one is good for you. No this is a life that you are tying together which would would make it or break it. So you need to do your due diligence and to make your checkups and uh make sure that all the boxes are checked and before you give the final verdict. I cannot engage in something unless I am certain that I can excel in it or do a good job. That's why I don't go on Sharia board for companies that want my name only without being involved in the work because I just don't sign on what you say. I have to see it myself and make sure because people trust me. So if I say that this person is good, then my neck is on the line. If I say this company is good, my neck is on the line. I have to put my name there. So likewise, I can't put my name on an a matrimonial app without looking into the CVs and whether they match and meet them and talk to them. And I have enough on my plate, unfortunately."
