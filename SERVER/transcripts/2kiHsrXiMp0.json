  "title": "Is it permissible to cry in prayer due to worldly things? Can I close eyes in sujood assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so my question is uh during prayer I sometimes or most often cry while in and this happens for different reasons for example feeling hurt by someone remembering my sins then feeling remorseful or deeply longing for something and I also close my eyes during sujud while making supplication uh so are these practices permissible and align with Sharia or not first of all first of all Nora to cry during Salat due to worldly reasons is not something that is recommended or promoted to cry out of the fear of Allah out of the love of Allah wanting to go to Jenna fearing Hellfire fearing your own sins and being remorseful this is a very very good thing but you're normal you have no problem the moment you start to pray you think of a cousin who betrayed you or a spouse who cheated on you or of a parent who has oppressed you and taunted you and caused trauma for you and you start to cry because of this anger in you not because of the fear of Allah or wanting something from Allah this is totally uh unacceptable closing your eyes during suud there's no problem in that inshah it's best not to do it but if you do it there's no no problem and Allah Knows Best"
