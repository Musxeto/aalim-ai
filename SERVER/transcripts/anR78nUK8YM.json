  "transcript": "Zeenat says is it permissible to use skin whitening cream whitening cream if it is temporary and it is for like a couple hours 3-4 hours and it is medically safe there's no problem in that so lots of women wear makeup and it changes the color of their faces usually it makes it wider they use Foundation and put so much makeup that they become like the Giza girls so white and so I don't know there's no problem in that but if it is a long-term treatment six months a year or more this becomes Haram because this is changing the creation of Allah Azza WA JAL Allah created a person like that you cannot come and change the creation like this like MJ for example or others other celebrities who change a color unless a person has an illness that permanently changed his original color to something else and he wants to restore the original color so some people get illnesses that makes their cheap black or brown and they would like to apply some creams or to get treatment to restore their original color there's nothing wrong in that insha Allah and Allah knows best"
