  "transcript": "but brother Mohammed from Saudi he's asking about SD bra and the word is the bra could refer to cleaning yourself after answering the call of nature it could also refer to ensuring that the womb has no pregnancy in the case of divorce or fuller so I'm not sure what he's asking about but in any case yes if you answer the call of nature it is a must that you cleanse and purify the exit of this impurity and this is done by either washing it which is the most purifying method or by using dry substance such as toilet paper or stones or anything that is solid and would have the ability to cleanse and to purify as for the womb yes if you divorce someone or if a woman is divorced or she seeks fuller or if she was separated by the judge from her husband for any reason she cannot remarry until we could say that she is not pregnant and this differs by scholars in the case of divorce the first a second divorce this has to be through three monthly cycles the pregnancy test does not do the job it has to be by three monthly cycles if she does not have her menstruation if she's too old then it has to be three months three months 19 days and if she is seeking color and she was awarded the color then her esta Brock would be one monthly cycle and the topic goes on and on"
