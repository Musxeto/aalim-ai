  "transcript": "ly seeking Rya exclude you of the 70,000 who will enter Paradise without being brought to account but listening to a recorded Rukia for example on YouTube comes that Under The Heading of seeking Rukia and exclude you of the 7,000 and is any Surah or first allowed listening to for the purpose of Ria first of all the Hadith you're referring to is an authentic Hadith where the Prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasallam said once to his companions 70,000 of my umah 70,000 of my umah will enter Paradise without torment or accountability and he went to his Chambers so the companions started to dispute among one another one says they are the children who are born in Islam and were not affected to kufur others said they are the martyrs in the C of Allah a third party said this when the prophet came out again to them from his Chambers from his room and saw them arguing he explained to them and elaborated on who fits the description of the 70,000 and he said they are the people who are or who do not they are the people who do not ask others to perform Rya for them the other three I won't mention so if I'm sick if I'm suffering from evil eye and I go to AI or to a p a person seeking his assistance in offering Rya to me I do not fit in the 70,000 category because I was inclined Independence and reliance partially not on Allah 100% rather on this individual which is not Haram the prophet said whoever is capable of benefiting his brother he should do so so someone comes to you and asks you for R you should do so you're rewarded for that he is not doing something sinful but it reduces his amount of on Allah so he's Exempted from the 70,000 he could qualify with other Deeds to enter Jenna without accountability or torment but this is not our point now if someone comes and offers me R I'm sick I'm suffering and someone comes to visit me and he sees me and he says or and he blows on me there's no problem in that if I do on myself and wipe or do r on water and drink there's no problem in that I'm still qualifying inshallah if I listen to r on the Internet or on a cassette or if you still remember what a cassette is or on on on a DVD player or whatever this is also there's no problem in that because I did not go and seek such assistance from another person and I hope this answers your question"
