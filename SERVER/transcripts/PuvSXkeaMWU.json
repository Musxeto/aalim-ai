  "transcript": "uh my question is if i wash something not just in my hands then do i have to wash my hands after washing the nadasa like when washing it with my hands like for example if i watched najas of my hand so my hands came in contact with it so do i have to wash my hands after that if i were to touch an impurity touching the impurity itself either results in the impurity transferring to my hand or not if it's a liquid then definitely it's transferred to my hand because it's the wetness is nudges if it's solid and there is no traces of it then it did not transfer now if i were to touch an impurity and wash my hand would that purify it i don't see any traces of impurity i washed it with water then definitely this would purify it"
