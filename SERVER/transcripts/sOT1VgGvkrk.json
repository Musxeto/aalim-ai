  "title": "Can a child give athan even if an adult is available? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sameer says is it permissible for a child to give the athan even if there is an adult available in the message to give the event first of all the jurors and the scholar said that if the child is below 7 years of age he is not allowed to give a Dan because he is not steady it in Arabic Lee called it Mumma is meaning that he's he has the ability to distinguish between things to make choices he's still an infant so he cannot be entrusted with giving that and forfeiture people refrain from eating or formerly people start to break their fast but if he's older than 7 let's assume he's like 9 or 10 years of age the most authentic opinion some allow it some don't the most authentic opinion is that as long as there is an adult accompanying him over seeing that he is giving the event at the right and correct time this is permissible because a boy in such age can also lead the prayer as in the hadith of Amarone Salama who used to lead his tribe when he was like seven or eight years of age so if he's allowed to lead a prayer calling a van is by far a lesser of importance than leading the prayer and Elijah knows best"
