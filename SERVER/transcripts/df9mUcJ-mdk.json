  "transcript": "I have a question Soh mam said that whoever was in city as to be a m he would even if he dies on his bed he will be a m there other had where he says whoever prays for before the and after the they will be protected from the Hell Fire so even if one is sinful would he be would he still die as a m or would it still be proted from theth we take the Hadith for their face value whoever asks Allah for Mom he will get that even if he dies on his bed a big example KH may Allah be pleased with him one of the greatest leaders of the Muslim companions he fought hundreds of battles in the cause of Allah and he died on his bed and the Hadith is as it is we believe in it now if there are things that block it or the conditions were not fulfilled we can't say that it will happen whoever prays four Ras before and four R after he will be prohibited for Hellfire can you guarantee that these four rakas before and after were fully prayed in Con in submissiveness and concentration and and Perfection and accepted by Allah you can't and hence this is something that blocks the condition that it was stipulated and as well in addition to that if you have sins that would qualify you to enter Hellfire and can't be forgiven not from the small minor sins but rather a bit major so this is something only Allah the fairer of all judges he's just and fair he's the one who's going to hold you to account and weigh your good and bad deeds and then come with a conclusion that would be only fair"
