  "transcript": "when i pray due to covet in my home so i'm on my own should i pray like an imam what does what do you mean do you after the comments say is [Music] there's no one praying behind you he says no no i don't mean that should i recite my salat as when i recite it as an imam loudly so for example when i offered the inauguration to be should i say [Music] or just say do i recite the fatiha loudly in fajr maghreb and isha or should i recite the whole thing silently when i go to uh raku and i rise up from the course should i say allah or should i say that in a different way the sunnah is to recite all like the imam this is the sunnah as if you're an imam so in fajr first turaka in maghrib and aisha first to raka's you recite loudly movement from one pillar to the other you say allahu akbar loudly say allah this is the sunnah but if you do it silently throughout the whole prayer there's nothing wrong in that your prayer is totally valid but your reward is lesser because of abandoning the sunnah and allah azza knows best you"
