  "transcript": "so I want to ask a question about Saka if someone wants to give Saka in another country and you have to pay fees to transfer the money and when you transfer to the person that is going to be receiving the like five of them the bank also charges for transfers so does that come out of or to come outside so basically a person zakat is approximately let's say $100 and in order to transfer it to another country they have to pay $7 or $10 so should they send $90 as zakat and 10 uh uh service charge or transfer uh charge or should they pay 110 where the 10 goes for the transfer money and the 100 is the zakat that's answer is the latter you cannot dedu deduct from the zakat the transfer money or the service charges you have to give the zakat as it is and it has to reach the poor and the needy and those who are entitled to receive it as it is whatever extra charges there are you have to pay them from your own pocket"
