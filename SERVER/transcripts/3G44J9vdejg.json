  "transcript": "the media is our worst enemy which is nowadays controlled by marinates christians by jews by atheists by secularists not definitely by muslims because rarely will find a muslim real true muslim controlling any type of media and this media is our worst enemy because it portrays a non-hijabi woman a non-practicing muslim to be educated intellectual sophisticated beautiful while a muslim woman who's righteous and practicing they portray her as uneducated doesn't know what to say or how to act so primitive and this is a sort of brainwash that the cause of all of this is her religious commitment if she wasn't practicing if she was easy going if she attended nightclubs and mixed with men and had no issues with hijab or music or watching movies she would have been a perfect person this is what the media is doing and we all know what the media is doing now in terms of enforcing the the the uh concept of lgbtq homosexuality forcing it to the children even at primary schools introducing it in all aspects of life to be the norm they are normal people they can live their normal life you have to accept them you have to promote them and endorse them if they are within your community this is what the media is doing the media is creating a virtual battle between men and women and the media insists to creating another man so women now they look and sound like women but they're actually being transformed into another man i do a lot of counseling sessions as you guys know and a lot of these counseling sessions when i sit with the men and women i usually discover that these women are not real women they have this idea of being independent though she takes everything from her husband he provides for her he gives her money shelter food but she still feels that she's independent he has no right to control me he has no right to do this to do that and the man complains he says i'd like to have a wife not a colleague living with me whenever i say something or ask for something she says you do it yourself yet she demands everything from me so this is what is being created through the media nowadays"
