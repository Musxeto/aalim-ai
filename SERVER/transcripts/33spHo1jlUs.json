  "title": "Permissible to say RIP (Rest in Peace) for disbelievers? (Bollywood actor who died) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and so second situation is uh uh if any non-muslim actor did suicide uh then most of the people on media they were saying rest in peace for him and when people said them that it is not permissible to say rest in peace or uh to pray for makhrat for non-muslims so uh they started claiming that who are we to judge who will go to paradise and who will go to hell and islam is a religion of love humanity so don't spread hate and even if that non-muslim was maybe that non-muslim was in depression and he maybe he was very kind so allah knows intentions so they claim such phrases so how to respond such people that's also inshallah thank you so much so uh her fourth question about a kafir who died recently i think he was an actor or something like that a bollywood actor who was a sikh or a hindu he's not a muslim and what happens in their religion this is their problem it's not none of our problems our problem is when muslims write on their facebook pages or on twitter rest in peace also and so we loved your movies we loved what you had presented to the people so we pray that you rest in peace and as a muslim i know that this is not appropriate to say allah stated in the quran in chapter 9 surat al-tawba that it is not permissible for the prophet and the believers with him the companions to seek forgiveness for those idol worshipers even if they were related to them even if they were next of kin so it is prohibited in our religion to make dua for someone who is not a muslim to get mercy of allah to enter paradise or to be forgiven totally prohibited we can ask allah that he guides them that he blesses their lives that he blesses their children and wealth no problem worthy things the sky's the limit but when it comes to forgiveness mercy of allah or paradise this is a red line we cannot cross so muslims believe and there's there's no need to sugarcoat it muslims believe that any non-muslim who dies will never rest in peace and his grave will be a pit of hell fire and when the day of judgment is due he will be admitted to hellfire for eternity for not believing in allah not submitting his will to allah not accepting the word of allah now do we say that this particular actor is in hell no way we can't say that i can say that how would i judge such a person but to claim that he is resting in peace or he's in paradise this is the same thing so when you say that he's resting in peace you're judging him and when you say that he was a kind person and maybe he committed suicide due to depression this is his problem not mine i don't judge him i give the journal verdict any person who dies not being a muslim will not rest in peace he will be in a pit of hell fire until the day of judgment and then he will be admitted for eternity to the real hell fire me allah azzawajal protect us"
