  "title": "Another Film against Islam! What is the solution?",
  "transcript": "the second question is from AA Salah and she says I'm debating with my husband about the above issue what's the Islamic judgment about killing non-muslim people because of offending the prophet what's the ruling on attacking Embassy staff uh of representing uh for representing the USA which allows YouTube to broadcast offending videos about the prophet Sall wasam first of all we have to know that you cannot be a Muslim without having the compassion the affection to protect and defend the prophet from any negative or any things thing that is not suitable to be said against him you're not a Muslim however you cannot express this by doing un Islamic things first of all this film that was finally now they know the uh uh it's known that it was produced by Coptic Christians in America for the mere political intention to stir up problems in the Muslim World especially in Egypt and to undermine the government of the newly elected Muslim uh uh president Muhammad m so this is their aim this is everybody talks about it and we know that the USA as a government and I'm not defending them I don't have any relationship to to them on the contrary I criticize a lot of their uh policies and a lot of their wrongdoings such as the Drone attacks that go unquestioned and no one can do the same to them they have the upper power and they have the ultimate supreme power to do whatever they like unquestioned no one agrees with this no one agrees with their military missions and their war against Muslim countries nobody agrees to that however we are told in the Quran to be just and fair so the US government has nothing to do with it now imagine if a group of Saudis did a movie criticizing or ridiculing or talking negatively about the coped Christians in Egypt now is it fair to say that all Saudis are involved and we have to kill them and we have to burn their embassies and we have to do this and that there are people who are unknown we know don't know anything of them likewise with this film and let's assume that this film though it's there and existing does this harm our Prophet by any chance Allah has exalted the name of the Prophet we have exalted your mentioning everywhere in the world not a minute pass not a minute passes without the name of the Prophet Alam is mentioned with the name of Allah throughout the aan the call for prayer throughout the whole entire universe even in Alaska there is people who are Muslim and they're calling the aan and mentioning the name of the Prophet alai so no matter what they do his name is exalted his name is high his mentioning is above all not only that the more they criticize the prophet Alam the more people are invited to study his biography his and to know what his life was like and to see the effect of his da and the effect of his call and message upon the whole of this universe so it's not going to stop it started long ago when the cfir was were there when the Hypocrites were there they tarnished his reputation they uh slandered his wife at his time yet he did not order anyone to be killed now look at what the people are doing in Libya and in Egypt and in everywhere thinking that they're defending the prophet Alam by Allah they're not defending the prophet Alam they may have good intention and enthusiasm but when interpreted when depicted and Illustrated in such violence in such demonstrations this becomes un Islamic and they will say we initially wanted to have a peaceful demonstration peaceful demonstration is not part of Islam if you get 100,000 peaceful demonstrator protesting and just Marching In the Streets it needs only 10 of the holigans of the Hypocrites to infiltrate them and do acts of uh uh violence and it ends up bloody and messy is this what Islam calls for no so one says how can we defend the Prophet The Prophet doesn't need your defense when Allah be pleased with him and with his mother and father the companion of the Prophet came once to the prophet crying and the prophet said what what happened he he said the idol worshippers kept on torturing me until I cursed you and said bad things about you and he's crying and weeping so the prophet asked him one question how do you find your heart and Amar said by Allah I find it resting with IM and steadfast on on my belief on Islam the prophet told himam if they go back to torturing you go back to talking negative ly and saying bad things about me so the prophet allowed Amar to do this now if you Analyze This logically one or two people producing such a filthy and worthless clip and by the way it was launched in July not in SE the end of September but it is politically motivated a handful of people who did something like this two months and it had like five or six hits on YouTube all of a sudden when you do these protests and when you demonstrate and you do this killing and violence it has millions of hits who's advocating it who's marketing it it's you the Hooligans the mob who are doing things that are not controlled by the Quran Sunnah nor by the scholars had they gone to any of the scholar of Islam asking them for opinion no they did not why because they consider these mob these Hooligans they are probably or they're ignorant they consider the scholars to be uh uh Petro dollar Scholars as they call us why because they don't say what the people want to hear and the scholars like explains and describes are three types a scholar of the country of the government he says what the government wants to hear and a scholar of the umah in the sense that whatever the majority wants to hear from the people he has no problem in saying Halal Oram and none of those are real Scholars and the third type is the scholar of Al of the religion who says what pleases Allah and no one else but Allah so I tell sister UHA Salah that what had happened is unfortunate it is UN Islamic it has to be condemned without any questioning as we condemn the producers of this clip and those who collaborate with them and those who uh uh allow it to be published like YouTube YouTube is a cfer uh form of organization or Corporation they care less about our religion they say that this is freedom of speech and all those who Advocate and defend this clip they say that it is freedom of speech well I'll give you a piece of my mind is are you okay as freedom of speech if I make a film about the Holocaust saying that it's a myth and not a single Jew died or furthermore if I say that it was a good thing and bad for Hitler that he did not complete the job this is freedom of speech I'm speaking my mind how would you feel if I speak up my mind and say that this terrorist attack or this killing or this assassination is legitimate in Islam for example and nothing is legitimate as such but I'm hypothetically asking is this freedom of speech allowed in your country you would say no if you don't have any honor or any dignity to the extent that if someone curses Jesus Christ who you believe in and you have no problem freedom of speech if if someone one uh criticizes your mother or Slanders your mother or your sister or your wife you have no problem with that it's freedom of speech if you have no dignity Muslims do and they highly respect their Prophet so I ask those who allow these actions to take place to reconsider and to the Muslims how to protect your reputation of the Prophet Alam you should highlight his biography in s publish books make uh uh uh uh uh TV programs Enlighten people with his beautiful work and his beautiful religion and this is being done by a lot of the Islamic centers worldwide alhamdulillah if you see that they are consistent in doing such acts you may hurt them or you may hit them where it hurts most and that is the economy so don't go to their country don't spend your dollars there take away your children and put them in other countries that where they can get a suitable and good education whether it's University or whatever buycott their products there are other Alternatives and make this public to everyone I'm not going to buy this or that because it is originating from that country that is insulting our Prophet Alam and this should not be on the individual uh level it should be also on the of the governments if the governments are abiding by the rule of Allah and they're trying to defend the reputation of the prophet"
