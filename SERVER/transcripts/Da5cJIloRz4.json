  "title": "What 2 say after rising up from ruku (Imam Individual Follower) Where to place hands Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is mandatory for an individual praying on his own four an imam leading prayers four worshipers and i follow that by saying either one of these four does the job and this is said by the imam by the individual and by the followers which means that if i'm praying behind an imam and he rises from rakuwa saying [Music] i as a follower do not say sir what he has said so i've raised or arised and i got up from the core position saying there are a lot of afkar i can say afterwards but this is what's essential you can say sh and do i place my hands on the chest or leave it on the side either way is possible what do you suggest shaykh i personally follow the hadith of which says that whenever the prophet hashem rised from record whatever the prophet stood up he used to put the right on the left on the chest so now after i've risen from rukur what is this position called is this is it raku or is it what is it it's standing up so according to the hadith then i should do this the majority of scholars say no you have to put it on your side but there is not a single hadith that stated that the prophet used to put his hands on his side in any position so it's an issue of dispute but again this is a sunnah you put it on your chest you put it on your side there's no problem don't make an issue out of it don't label people or classify people or think that people are better than you or worse than you no just leave it as it is this is the conviction leave them so i'm in the required position subhanallah [Music] foreign"
