  "title": "Will Dajjal go to hell or heaven? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "King he says will the Jal also be in Hell or Heaven or he's just sent to test Humanity the Jal is he's a disbeliever and what more Blasphemous than to claim that he's our Lord what more Blasphemous than to claim to know the Unseen and to give life to the dead so he's claiming lordship so he is definitely a cafe and being killed by the prophet and messenger of Allah Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is also a sign that he is in hell for eternity"
