  "transcript": "sh I'm from Georgia and uh here Muslims we are minority uh we have and our imams majority are M sufis Etc we have one she who is salafi and he gives lectures in mon one or twice in month and sometimes uh he does not have another opt option and goes as an IM after Salah he makes congregational zik and Dua uh he says that this is an innovation but he does not have another Choice uh some people say that because of this because of that we can't take Knowledge from him so what's your answer about this those who say we cannot take Knowledge from him are they as qualified and knowledgeable as him yes or no Abdul Latif uh last year sorry Dasha you're gone okay no problem no no no no sir are they are they qualified or as knowledgeable as he is no in this case they have no right to speak they they don't even know how to purify themselves after answering a call of nature they don't know a Surah of the Quran or a word in Arabic so how dare they assess a mistake he did out ofad out of weighing the pros and cons he may come to this conclusion by saying I have a Crum I have a dilemma if I don't make congregational Dua they will not allow me to be an IM and they will not allow me to give lectures and teach the proper AA and the proper for Sunnah by doing the Lesser evil doing VI after Salat while hating it resenting it I get to teach a lot of good and do a lot of good and let the people trust me and believe in my knowledge and maybe in six months time or a year time I can transform the Masjid into a salafi Masjid this is a legitimate reason and this is an issue ofad and he has the right to do that and not you guys and Allah Knows Best"
