  "title": "Until when are parents responsible for the children if they sin, to advise & stop them Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "until which age of the children are the parents still responsible for them in in what sense responsible financially or to guide them and direct them responsibly like if they are sinning and the parents know that they are sitting but they do nothing so that they will be held accountable because they are responsible for them that's what i mean okay basically speaking the parents are responsible till the day they die and this is what the prophet said all of you are a shepherd it's a metaphorical description of me being a shepherd over my family and every shepherd is accountable for his congregation his family whomever he's responsible for now when i say responsible it means that if i see my child or my son or my daughter smoke am i responsible to tell them this is haram if i see my daughter not wearing the hijab not abiding by it though she's married and she has children am i obliged to say fear allah this is haram or i'm not responsible the answer is yes i am responsible to the day i die and depending on the sin i have to react in the sense that if a man's daughter or a son decides to marry a hindu this is haram a muslim man can only marry a muslim woman a christian woman or a jew woman that's it he cannot marry other than the three denominations a muslim woman on the other hand cannot marry other than a muslim man if one of them decides to go against this ruling the parents responsibility is to stop them to order them not to do this if they insist the man says i love this woman i want to marry her even if she's a hindu or a buddhist or an atheist or she doesn't believe in any religion i want to marry her the father and the mother must tell him that this is prohibited he says i'm going to do it they have to stop him if he is not going to be stopped and he's defiant or relentless in pursuing what he wants they have to try to express their objection by at least boycotting him not meeting him not endorsing him not attending the wedding not going to his house if he believes or she believes that such a marriage is valid they are apostates they're disbelievers because they're going against the quran and the sunnah and the consensus of all muslim scholars if they believe that no i believe my marriage is invalid but i love this woman i love this man she says not me in this case they are fornicators they are sinful but they're still muslims nevertheless they should not have to do anything with this sin so they are responsible till the end of time but the responsibility varies my responsibility over my son or my daughter living in my house is different than my responsibility towards my child who's married and he's living out in a different house an independent house has his own life has his own income with that person i just advise remind admonish i can't do anything else the one living in my house no i have control if they watch porn i can cut the internet i can take their devices i can prevent them from doing anything that facilitates such a sin so each and every situation needs wisdom needs thorough investigation to find out what's the best reaction to such a thing and allah azzawajal knows best"
