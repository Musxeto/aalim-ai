  "title": "Can I (revert) work in entertainment industry (DJ, Musician) cuz times are tough? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so many questions I would like to ask you but for the moment I will ask you this so I uh I did my shih like a like 20 years ago at a yemeni mosque in San Francisco it was very nice alhamdulillah I've so many blessings come to me since accepting Islam but an interesting thing since a child I was uh highly trained in the symphony orchestra I played the drums and I also am very good at uh dejing and stuff and so I've been I've been learning you know Islam throughout the years and then the more I learn I learn about you know people saying music is Haram and and there's many different topics and so you know I I'm trying my best to follow Islam but I'm in a situation right now where I live in a a a city where there's a lot of Tourism and I uh you know work is difficult times are tough financially but I have a lot of opportunities being thrown at me uh in the entertainment industry and because of my skills I I'm actually highly skilled at this and many people like me um and so but I don't want to uh upset Allah I don't want to hurt myself or cause any trouble I keep my Dean very serious and I do my best so I I I'm wondering like in times of need would it be acceptable to uh work in like um to entertain people for a short time within while keeping in within the limits um of Islam got got your question Tony first of all alhamdulillah that he guided you and that you're still steadfast on Islam and that you're still Keen to know what pleases Allah from what does not 40 years in Islam it should have given you a full picture and a gut feeling and most likely your gut feeling is what drove you to us to ask this question no one does not like music whoa that's a bold statement she no seriously music is nice it's fun it's enjoyable and so is everything that is Haram so a gas of champagne some red wine is mighty fine after a good meal with some cheese someone would say a cigarette after a good meal is mighty fine sitting and talking to people most likely the opposite gender is entertaining and fine so you see the pattern here is that each and every one of us on Earth is being tested and the test has to be challenging a multi-millionaire when he loses $100,000 it doesn't mean a thing to him he's got billions so it's nothing when they sue a millionaire for 300400 million do because of his lying and rering and cheating the tax uh Department IRS it's nothing he just appeals appeals appeals this is not challenging the challenge is when you're in desperate need of making an honest buck in paying the rent and putting food on the table and it seems that things are being tight and the only window of opportunity is Haram is to deal in entertainment is to be a waiter in a restaurant that sells pork and serves wine in being a driver facilitating Haram for others and the likes this is where the challenge is therefore as a Muslim I have no choice but to follow what Allah commanded me to and the prophet Alat am don't listen to Tom Dick and Harry because they will only put You In Harm's Way follow the Quran and the Sunnah and in the issue of Music the four schools of thought the the the school of Abu hanifah Imam Malik Imam Shafi and IM Ahmed agree that musical instruments are Haram and the exception would be for the dof which is similar to the tambourine but without the metal rings around it so it's an used in weddings and it's used when uh in in festivals like Eid and when receiving a dignitary who has influence over Islam when he comes from travel these are the only three cases allowed in the books of the Hadith prohibiting musical instruments is reported in and many other hadiths support this inclination now if you were to ask me why is it haram number one because it's a test from Allah something you like yet Allah prohibits something you're good at yet Allah prohibits but among the reasons it is addictive it's an addiction to listen to music you can't get it out of your system and you know when the goes on people start jumping and dancing and feeling happy it depends on the music you play whether you make them sad or do you make them happy whether you make them joyful and willing to dance or just want to contemplate and think it manipulates your nature your soul and this is why or one of the reasons that it is prohibited in Ramadan Allah Asel prohibited water and halal food for us to consume for these 15 16 17 or 18 hours why so that we're not addicted to Halal things and that we do what we do for worshiping Allah to submit our will to Allah no questions asked if you were to look around you will find Tom Dick and Harry saying to you oh it's an issue of dispute and they'll sell it to you that what you're doing is fine so many celebrities who were in the 60s who dropped music and listening to music and playing music for the sake of Allah and the whole Muslim world was jubilant and happy for their repentance and they did well may Allah gives us a may Allah give us a good ending 40 50 years down the line they went back to concerts they went back to playing music they go wa it's Fame that people are looking for it's not the sake of Allah not the face of Allah and this is what's threatening our existence you may be steadfast on Islam for 40 years and then flip at the end of the day what a waste the prophet saidat wasam an individual would act as if he's among the people of paradise for 60 years until his predestiny catches up with him and he does something that qualifies him to enter hell and he dies and he enters hell 60 years he was doing well so the people would think oh this guy is a righteous person he prays in the Masjid he does good deeds he doesn't do Haram and all of a sudden he flips Because deep down he wasn't fully submitting to Allah and the moment he flips this is when he dies and ends up with such an action Deeds are judged by conclusion all of his 60 years are down the drain this week he did in Haram indulging in Haram tarnished and soiled his 60 years of good work so be careful my friend it's hard but be positive trust Allah depend on Allah even if it's the most difficult times so it may seem to you Allah is still there and he's providing not only 8 billion inhabitants of Earth among the humans he's in providing for billions of gin that we do not see he's providing for billions of animals striving on Earth and billions of fish in the oceans and billions of birds in the heavens and the skies and trillions of insects that we don't have any account of he gives each and every one of them their provision what they need of food and water he's the one who allows the blood to run in their veins and their hearts to pump with blood and when he wills it it all stops and they die so trust Allah Allah will never leave you alone but do not seek Allah's Provisions through means that he had made prohibited for you and Allah Knows Best"
