  "title": "Gold and Silver plates & utensils - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so if you want to have a crystal plate or a glass in no problem platinium it's a bit extravagant but no problem golden silver haram why because the hadith and you can read the hadith here indicates that this is totally prohibited by the Prophet on a solid cell and that whoever does this would drink and eat in Hellfire fire with it so this is something that is a serious thing not to be taken lightly I travel a lot and I stay in 5-star hotels usually I'm not paying people are paying so hamdulillah and when you eat in restaurants they serve you in silver and sometimes gold utensils you can see the stamp on it and this is why they serve you with it in the restaurants not in your room service because people would take it and put it in their bags and kiss the baby goodnight so what's your ruling on eating with it it's Haram in some hotels you ask for green tea and they bring you the the jug or whatever they call it the teapot and it's silver you can tell by the color and you ask is this silver said yes sir said nope change it it's Haram for you to consume in it and the hadith are crystal clear there is no acceptable difference of opinion among scholars and this because we rely on the hadith I don't know the Muslims say what is the reason you're not entitled to ask for the reason the Prophet said is harm and I'm sorry I can give you five or six justifications but would that mean that this is why Allah made it Haram no unless we have evidence that it was how long because of this we cannot simply say yes surely it's hard on because of one two three out of my own reasoning and logic so the Prophet prohibited it is awesome we abide by it now one would say okay is this just for eating and drinking or we can use it for other things what do you mean see people usually don't eat in gold and silver utensils because of the hadith but what about if I simply have the last souvenirs sometimes I entered rich people's houses and they have a plate of gold a jug of silver and they don't eat and drink in it they just simply use it sometimes they use it in wood it's a different or is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion as Jacob if Amin and other scholars said that the prohibition is only to eat and drink in gold and silver utensils using them in other means such as washing or keeping things in it this is not Haram yet if it's extravagant one truth one should avoid it and avoiding it just to be safe is a better option okay what about in the old days now alhamdulillah when we read such things in the books of work we seem to say what it doesn't make sense to us when we find in the books of fact the ruling on drinking or eating in utensils that were welded with silver what is this it means that if a vessel is broken or shattered and we weld it fix it with silver is this permissible not most of others say why the troubled throw the thing in by a dozen for the price of welding it with silver this is true nowadays but we don't know how difficult it was to make such cups vessels utensils in the past so welding it with silver is an OP was an option in the future we would not know whether we would need this option or not Allah only knows so we study it just to know welding a container a vessel utensils with silver when broken is permissible because this was in the hadith of an assassin the Sahay that the Prophet Adam had a cup that was welded with silver it is there was a crack in one side of it and it had to be welded with silver so that it can be used but welding it with gold is totally prohibited why do you differentiate between gold and silver because the hadith that made the exception that exempted using gold and silver in utensils was in welding and it was in silver so gold remains as it is prohibited to be using plates in utensils and containers etc either entirely or by welding it and allah azzawajal knows best"
