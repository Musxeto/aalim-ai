  "transcript": "says can a non muslim breastfeed a muslim baby and vice versa if yes will the wet nurse's son or husband become mahram to this child after five meals if the baby is a girl the answer to both questions yes if a non-muslim woman breastfeeds a child with two conditions condition number one that the child is below two years of age condition number two that she feeds that child five meals it's not five sucklings rather five meals within the period of two years of age then this child becomes the as any born son of that woman so this means that all her children are this child's siblings it means that her husband is this child's father through cycling and so forth the religion does not have any impact on the permissibility or not it doesn't impact whether the child becomes a mahram or not because what counts is the milk itself"
