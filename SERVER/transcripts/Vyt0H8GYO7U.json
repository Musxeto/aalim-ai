  "title": "Is a person hypocrite & will be punished if he doesn't do things that he preaches? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "it's from the uk i preach people on social media i don't do the things i preach would i fall under the hadith of osama bin laden when the prophet told us about a man with his guts uh spilled and he rotates around them as uh the donkey does when grinding the wheat and the and and the likes the answer is no see in islam you're ordered to do four things you order to preach people to do good things and you're ordered to do them yourself in your order to prohibit haram and evil things and your order to stay away yourself from such harams so if i am capable of doing three or four meaning i'm capable of preaching people like i'm doing at the moment does it mean that i'm doing everything i'm preaching definitely not but because i'm not doing the things that i am preaching should i stay home and forget of about preaching others no the hadith refers to the hypocrites who used to preach people but not do it intentionally because they don't believe in it so it falls under the category they're blamed not for preaching people the man is being tormented in hell not for preaching people he is tormented because of not doing it so never stop preaching and doing good things in sha allah"
