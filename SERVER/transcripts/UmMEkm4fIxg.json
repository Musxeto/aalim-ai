  "transcript": "so label second question he's saying that in regards to a gift if my father gives me due to my need a mobile phone and my father dies before my younger brother is old enough to buy him a mobile phone does this mobile phone it must be included in inheritance the answer is no this is a gift it was given to you so what your father has given to you and you possess it and own it this does not become included in the inheritance and the wealth of your father but if your father bought you a car like most families do they buy the eldest a car so that he can take his siblings to school and do the shores that his mother needs the car is registered in your name or in your father's name most likely it's in your father's name therefore when your father dies this car is included in the inheritance because it doesn't belong to you and allah knows better"
