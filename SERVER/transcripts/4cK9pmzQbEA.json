  "transcript": "[Music] if I miss one then should I sit for position at the third and fourth ra or in my makeup ra what is the ruling over changing places after Salah like the IM uh or almost everyone changes the position to pray Sunnah if you miss a in the congregation of for example this means that when the Imam sits for his fourth this is your third therefore you should not offer you should not perform which is sitting on your left btic as the prophet used to in the last because this is not your last therefore when the IM off and you stand up for the fourth and you sit down you perform the position having said that a lot of the Muslims when they offer in the third ra having missed one ra they offer Salam with the IM because they forget they're used to sitting in the position only in the last ra and because they did this on their third ra when they offer Salam without concentrating he also offer Salam therefore one should only do it at the last actual last ra as for changing the position for the Sunnah prayer it's an issue of dispute some say that this is recommended because people uh would be registered and the spots of the uh the ground would testify in the day of judgment that he prayed here and here and there other Scholars saying no praying where you have prayed the is also uh uh increasing your reward because you would be considered to be in prayer stad the prophet told us when a person concludes his prayer he is still in prayer as long as he remains in his position and he does not mulfy his W so if I pray and the IM concludes the prayer I conclude the prayer and I stay for 10 minutes in my prayer position this 10 minutes would be considered part of the prayer uh itself and I would be considered as praying so adding to that two of Sunnah would be also acceptable and Allah Knows Best"
