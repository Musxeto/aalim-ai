  "transcript": "uh so my question is I saw like a clip of a video on you like you know like a few years ago saying that the person you know in the world everybody actually no one knows their position whether they're going to go in or but like I found some evidences that were a bit contradictory such as also like in the you know they're going to see their place inam if they done bad and they're going to see their place in Jenna and then the one who wants the one who will be inanam he will ask Allah and then the one who wants to when he sees his position in J he says so I'm a bit like confused on on on how he would not know where his position is if there's a bunch of evidences such as these it would have been much easier for me you to ask me the question without giving me the history because I definitely don't remember what I had for lunch couple of days ago let alone what I said couple of decades or a couple of years ago if you would have asked me I would have told you yes the people in the grave are divided into two types one type that have the Glad Tidings and they know that their final is to Jenna and the others are who were giving the bad Omens and uh uh uh uh news that they are disbelievers and they are guaranteed a seat in Hellfire and each one would have a window from Jenna or from hell where the fragrances or the fumes would come and fill their graves and there are people who are in between who are Muslims but they will be tormented in their graves whether for backbiting for namima slandering others for gossiping or for not cleaning themselves from urine and on the day of judgment they will be held accountable for their sins etra maybe do some time in hell but eventually we'll go to paradise but I don't know what the clip you saw and by the way this is a disclaimer a lot of the people come to me and I mean a lot and say yeah sheh you said so and so and so and I reflect and find out in 95% that what they're quoting is wrong but they misunderstood it and when I sometimes correct them they say oh sorry sorry sorry so it is totally unacceptable from my side for someone to say I I saw a clip for you and you said so and so and so but I have have to see the clip myself so if I was wrong I would correct it but I would not take your word for it a brother called me yesterday on a counseling session and he said yeah she I saw a clip for you um on on Twitter someone asked you about blowing um and and you said that this is not permissible inar but you always told me that bedtime AAR we blow and wipe over our bodies I said the question in the Twitter was what's the ruling on blowing the AAR of the morning and the evening on my children and I said no this is not permissible this is not from the Sunnah oh Subhan Allah I did not pay attention to that not only that I said even thear of the bed timear you don't blow and wipe over your bodies it's only the three lasts that you blow then recite then wipe over your body so 99.9% when someone comes to me said you said so and so I don't I discredit it I don't believe them because I have to see it myself and 99 99% I see it and I find out that they were misunderstanding they missed something they did not figure it out and they apologize so I hope this answers your question"
