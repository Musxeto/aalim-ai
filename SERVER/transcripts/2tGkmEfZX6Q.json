  "transcript": "foreign oh the expedition of is over the prophet sallam attacked them and they fled their houses leaving the women the children and also lots and lots of heard among those enslaved was the daughter of the leader of that tribe and she was joalia bint al-harith she came to the prophet salaam trying to free herself and in islam slavery is there and no one can deny it some of the scholars who were affected by the west were taking defensive positions in the sense that whenever the issue of slavery comes they try to defend by saying no no you misunderstand the situation slavery was very limited and on the contrary the prophet sallam almost forbade slave slavery and this is not true in islam slavery is much different than any other religion for example in in other practices before islam came slavery was so widely spread that it was easy for a person traveling on his own or with his company to be attacked by tribesmen killing whomever they can and enslaving the living so if you were walking on on your own minding your own business it's very easy the following day that you become a slave because somebody just came and attacked you this happened with salman fancy as you remember the seeker of truth when he uh migrated from persia and he went to iraq to sham and then was enslaved and sold to a jew in medina so this was widely practiced if you had a debt to someone and you could not repay it he would enslave you if you were poor you could sell your children and this happens in parts of asia because they're so poor they sell their children for twenty hundred and or two hundred dollars that's very cheap islam came and made all of these practices forbidden yet there was one place or one process for slavery in islam and that is fighting in the cause of allah in the sense that if we fight non-muslims whether they are the oppressors whether they are preventing islam from spreading or whether they are hostile to islam and muslims and we prison in prison those who are still alive they become slaves any other form is not permissible of course even if they were enslaved and then they reverted to islam they are still slaves and their children are still slaves now having said that islam permits and recommends you setting slaves free and as form of of expiation there are so many sins and wrongdoings in islam that when a person does one as form of expiration he is instructed to fray a slave for example if you kill someone by mistake not intentionally if you're driving a car and you hit someone and he dies this is my mistake you give the blood money to his relatives next of kin but you also have to fast have to free a slave if you cannot find a slave to free you have to fast two consecutive months the slave goes to the deceased family no just to allah you don't give the slave to the uh family of the deceased you free the slave for allah so after being your slave he becomes a free man uh to go also if someone makes vihar and the heart is not a divorce but it is a form of making something that is permissible forbidden so if a husband says to his wife that you are to me like my mother or like my sister so he made what was lawful for him forbidden because it's forbidden for him to have intimate a relationship with his wife with his mother or with his daughter or sister so once he utters these words in order for him to go back to normal practice with his wife he has to free a slave there are so many things that the prophet sallam tells us that if you do this free a slave and there's a beautiful hadith where the prophet salallahu says whoever frees a slave for the sake of allah with every part an organ of that slave allah will free a part or or an organ from you from hellfire so if he had two hands and you feed him allah will free your hands from hell so if you free a full a slave allah will free you from hell so this is extremely important for muslims because this is what they thrive for to avoid hellfire and to be permitted into paradise and that is why lots of the companions used to buy slaves and free them for the sake of allah the almighty one other issue of slavery is that it is permissible for a muslim male to enjoy a female slave in the sense that it's forbidden for a muslim to fornicate or to commit adultery it's forbidden for a muslim to enjoy sex unless it is with his wife or with his slave female now one would say this is barbaric she's a prisoner of war she's a slave and he has intercourse with her well first of all this is the rule of allah second of all this is for the benefit of that slave how is that if the slave got pregnant automatically she cannot be sold she cannot be given away and she cannot be uh inherited so by getting pregnant she is actually on the process of being free of course she is not completely free until her master sets her free or he dies sure she she has some rights a lot of rights after she gets again no she does not have the rights that a wife does because she is a slave and to us this might sound a little bit strange but then a slave was something that is sold and bought something that is given wives would would buy slaves and give them to their husbands in order to uh work at the house and maybe serve her master so this is god-given right to muslims this introduction makes us understand the position of our prophet salallahu came to the prophet she came to him because she wanted to be set free in islam if a person sets his slave free he or she are free but if he does not want to set the slave free the slave has the right to agree with his master and by himself or herself from the master so if my slave comes to me and tells me that i would like to buy myself i would say okay go and work and whatever you make let's say i need i'm i'm gonna buy you for ten thousand so you go work and get me ten thousand one thousand per month after ten months i have the money you're free so this is permissible in islam having said that remember that the slave and everything that the slave owns belongs to the must to the master so even before i allow him to work whatever he does it's mine so it's a form of compromise to the master and to the slave and there are so many cases in in the seerah in the sunnah where slaves came to the prophet salaam and asked him for help for example may allah be pleased with her was a slave and her husband was name named was and they were both married as slaves and then barira went to mother isha may allah be pleased with her and requested her help to free herself so aisha helped her with the money until she bought herself from her masters and she became free once she became free it was her choice as a free woman to remain with her husband or to be set free and separated from him so she chose to separate from him because who would want to be married to a slave and muriet loved her so much to the extent that he went to the prophet salallahu and requested him to intercede with his ex-wife so the prophet went to barira and he asked her if she would like to reconsider getting back to marit so berida said are you instructing me is this an order so the prophet saws said no i'm just interceding she said i don't need him and i don't want him. the story says and tells us that afterwards may allah please with him used to walk behind and after barira with his tears going down his beard because he loved her so much and he could not go back and she could would not go back to him the the the catch of the story is that barrier bought herself from her masters went to the prophet and as the daughter of the leader of her tribe she told him that she wanted to buy herself and set herself free free now what was the answer of the prophet alaihis to uh jawed bintil this is inshallah what we will know after the break so stay tuned so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the hereafter each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it being the daughter of the leader of the tribe of bani she wanted to buy herself because she was enslaved and she wanted to set herself free the prophet sallam with his vision saw that this woman cannot be enslaved she is from a very high ranking in her tribe and the tribe of bani mustala as we know is part of the tribe of and they were so close to the prophet though they were not muslims but they were allies of bani hashem so they were allies of the father of the prophet sallam and his grandfather abdullah talib so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam thought that it was not proper for a woman in that prestige and to be enslaved so he told her would you like that i set you free and i marry you and she accepted that so she reverted to islam accepted islam she was set free and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married the daughter of the leader of the tribe of bani mustarak now if the prophet allah wanted to have this woman as a slave he could have there was no need for him to free her and marry her because it's permissible for a man to have as many slaves female slaves as he wishes and enjoyed them yet the prophet alaihis was the vision and subhanallah the blessing of jawariya on her people was tremendous the minute the companions may allah be pleased with them saw the prophet salaam marrying juarez they said to themselves is this acceptable the prophet is married to jawariya the daughter of the leader of and we have his in-laws as enslaved as slaves our slaves this is not acceptable how can this be so immediately they went to their slaves of the tribe of bani mustala and set them free because the prophet's wife was one of them so she had the blessing over her tribe to the extent that 100 families were set free for his sake did she embrace the islam later or no she embraced islam earlier earlier because the prophet sallam could not have married her while she was apologist so after being enslaved she accepted islam and then went to the prophet and the prophet set her free and married her so look at the vision of the prophet though he married this woman he could have enjoyed her without marriage he could have enjoyed her without freeing her he could have done whatever he wanted without the companion setting their slaves free for her yet the prophet sallam wanted to bless this whole tribe and the all alhamdulillah reverted to islam because of this woman because of this marriage now her father al-harit was not a muslim he was a polyphist so the story says that a month or two or maybe more he came to medina in peace and he requested permission to enter medina so he entered medina and he met the prophet sallallahu salaam and the prophet called him to islam and he was you know hesitant not yes or no and he requested the prophet to give him back his daughter thinking that the prophet sallam enslaved her and now she was under his power and in captivity so the prophet alaihis al-assam told him well ask her if she wants to go with you she's free so joey was present she greeted her father her father told her come back with me to our tribe and what we would you expect jawed to say no way this is the prophet the messenger of allah how do you want me to leave him and go back to you with you and she refused to go with her father and decided to be with her husband and this is what every woman should do if given the choice between her father or her husband she has to remain with her husband because he is her way to paradise before being married her father was her way to paradise this is part of islam to obey your father and if she's married to a very to be uh her husband and likewise for a male it is his of obligation to obey his god well humans fought for no his mother so no women would say what is this this is a a for the man's side a woman must obey her father then her husband then so on well it's the same thing with the man he has to obey his mother and that is why excuse me his mother before his father well this is a a controversial issue he has to obey both and that is why malik may allah be pleased with him the leader in the head of the maliki school of thought when someone came to him and told him that my father tells me something and my mother tells me another thing that is completely opposite who should i obey so he told him obey your father and do not disobey your mother so what do you want me to do this is a very diplomatic answer that tells him do not disobey any of them try to reconcile try to have something compromised do something in between but you cannot disobey any of them as long as they're not asking you to do something that was forbidden now after that al-harit of himself alhamdulillah accepted islam and it was the custom of the prophet that when a dignitary or a leader of his tribe accepts islam that he makes him the leader of the muslims at that area so he kept him as the leader of his tribe and he made him collect the charity and the arms do the poor's do the zakat from his people and from the tribes next to him after balaam was over the military detachments kept on going but this time they were headed in different directions to the east of arabia to the center of arabia and also to the north and among the first was the detachments of abdul rahman ibn awf may allah be pleased with him the prophet salallahu sent him to the the village or the area of bani benikel uh and it was close to domitil jindal and he told him that call them to islam if they accept islam then marry the daughter of their king and abdur-rahman went there he preached them about islam they liked islam they accepted it alhamdulillah and he married tamadar mental asbar the daughter of their leader their king he was a king and he stayed there for three days alhamdulillah went back to medina also the prophet sent halibut to the land of saddam evan and he went there they were dispersed all around their village and in their their place they could not fight and alhamdulillah he gathered 500 camels and 2 000 sheep and took them back to medina syria another detachment of abu bakr and some say it was of zayd to wadi successful then came a group of men some say six some say seven and others say eight they came from the tribes of okl and reina and they are well known as the story of the yin the people from they came to the prophet claiming to be accept islam and as we know that medina had something in it that made people feel uh fall sick the minute they go to medina it's sort of a fever because of its dry air and of its uh nature being surrounded by volcanic mountains and so on and when the prophet sallam first migrated to madinah abu bakr bilal among other companions fell ill and they had the fever and they hallucinated so the prophet sallam prayed to allah to take this fever to al-jourfa and as we know al-juffa is a place that is about 250 kilometers west south of medina and it is amir where people come and establish their ichram when they're performing umrah or performing hajj if they're coming from the north or from the west of mecca so allah azza answered his prayer and it was moved there and soon after the uh the village turned into a ghost town the people fled that village and they went to other areas when these men came to medina from and they felt sick and they were actually very poor and very thin because of starving and hunger they went to the prophet sallam and told him that we would like your help and aid because we are sick so he told them to go out of medina where they where the prophet sallam had all the camels that were given as sadaqa and these camels they used to milk and drink from its milk and in it is well known fact that the milk of camels cured a lot of diseases so these men went to the camels and they sat there for a while until they were back and healthy not thanking the blessing of allah azza not having any type of gratitude to the prophet sallam who was kind to them after being well and strong they went to the shepherd or the keeper of these camels and they killed him before they killed him they tortured him and in some narrations it was reported that they uh set fire on nails and then they put these nails around his eyes until his eyes were gone and then they chopped his hands and legs and killed him this was a grave and serious offense what was the reaction of the prophet sallam to that this is inshallah what we will discuss next time we meet until then allah hmm hmm"
