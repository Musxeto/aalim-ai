  "transcript": "and he's a university student and there are still two to three years at least until he graduates and he ask his parents to permit him to get married and they do not pay any attention um this is the norm because usually parents want their children to be independent and then get married he says but it is hard to show patience against Temptation I need your advice my advice is divided into two sections the first one is for you I advise you as long as you are unable to get married either due to uh financial reasons and constraints or due to any other reason I advise you to follow the instruction of the Prophet Alam where he says oh young people and he has he's addressing the youth whoever is capable of getting married he should do so but whoever does not have the ability to get married then he should fast because this would restrain his gaze from looking left right and center and it would curb his desire for uh uh sex so you should follow the Sunnah of the prophet and his instruction and try your level best to fast every alternate day and this inshallah would help you a lot my second advice is to the parents they should fear Allah they should fear Allah because as you care for your child you feed him you nourish him you give him water you clothe him you take care of him and you buy him a car getting him married is far more important and another mouth in the house would not cost you a lot but it would save your son how would you feel if your son commits fornication and he is indulging himself with illegitimate sexual acts and relationships would you feel that this is normal are you getting your son closer to Hellfire or to Paradise so I advise you to reconsider and if your son is wise and mature enough you should get him married with uh uh what you have of money"
