  "title": "Women marrying younger men is looked down upon in my community, what does islam say? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so she says in our community marrying someone marrying a man who's younger than you is not something nice and people would consider it to be insulting the answer to that would be this is bogus such tradition and customs and urf is to be neglected and not to looked upon simply because the prophet isaiah married a woman who was older than him so if the prophet did this and he's the role model then definitely we can do that so the age difference whether the man is older than the girl or the girl is older than the man there is nothing wrong or humiliating in this in islam at all"
