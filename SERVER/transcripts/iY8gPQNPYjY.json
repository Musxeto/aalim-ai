  "transcript": "and she says that sometimes my son leads us in prayer and while we are in praying he nullifies his Woodill by passing wind or something of that nature so he goes to renew his will do what to do this question fits in the scenario of different situations one while we are in the Masjid the Imam over all of a sudden breaks his woudl and he leaves what to do - while we are praying with the Imam the Imam instead of standing up for the fourth chakra he sits in the third raka and when he sits in the third reckon we say subhanAllah he refuses to stand up insisting that this is his fourth or the opposite after he concludes his fourth raka he stands up for the fifth the fifth Erica yes and which is from Hannah Allah it doesn't go back he continues so in all of these situations and many many more you can always have the same answer and that is when there is a problem with the Imam and the Imam has to go either he would take someone to take his position in place so for example if I'm leading the prayer and I remember that I'm not in the state of Woodill I cannot continue and say well nobody knows Allah knows this can be an act of cover what to do I have to pull someone from behind me who is suitable to lead the prayer and he would know and understand and I go and make wudu and come back to join the congregation as a follower if the Imam does not take someone in to succeed him one of the moons one of the followers should come forward and continue the Salah because the Salah of the followers that is correct why should we Nullah fie it because of the event that took place with the Imam now in your case nya and your daughter when your son's Widow is in is nullified you either choose to lead the prayer and your daughter would follow you or both of you continue from where you have stopped and finish your prayer individually but you do not wait for him to come back after he renews his woudl after he renews his will because his prayer is over your prayer has been established and you have to complete it and Allah knows best"
