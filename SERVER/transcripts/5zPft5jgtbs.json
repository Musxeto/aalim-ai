  "transcript": "so so yesterday some urine had fallen into the bathroom I didn't wash it but H with water I just wiped it with toilet toilet paper until it until it dried but today I needed to wash my sleepers in the bathroom and it may it may have touch it wet with where urine had fallen yesterday a thought I don't know if it fell exactly where the urine was is my slipper and where I H so step it on it with NES I do not know this is something for you to tell you have done a mistake by wiping urine with toilet paper rather than washing it because Islam tells us Whenever there is such an impurity it has to be washed off and overwhelmed with water unlike if this impurity is on your private part then you can wipe it so you have done wrong most likely as long as you don't have any certainty whether the water has fallen onto that dry area of urine or not as long as you don't have certainty whether whether the amount of water is less than the amount of wiped off urine or not because if the amount of water overwhelmed it like it's 10 to one ratio this overwhelming of the water of the area that has njasa purifies it with the grace of Allah and Allah Knows Best"
