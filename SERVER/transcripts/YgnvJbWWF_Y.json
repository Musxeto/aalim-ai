  "title": "Zakat on gold that women wear everyday or regularly - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "raissa says is there any zakat on gold that we wear every day if it reaches an Assad amount it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that the cut on gold is only on that which you do not use or where others and this is reported by the companions some of the companies they say that it is only on the gold that a person possesses but not uses so jewelry that a women wear are like clothes they don't give the cut on clothes you don't give zakat on your car likewise you don't give zakat on your jewelry but the most authentic opinion of scholars is that gold and silver are the main artery of economy in any country so whether you are holding it or keeping it in safekeeping or using it as jewelry there has to be the cut on them there's no other cut in diamonds there's no zakat on rubies and emeralds and and and the likes or platinum white gold as they say but the yellow gold and the silver you have to pay zakat and the verses of hoarding gold and silver mentioned in Chapter 9 surah al Toba and the hadith of the Prophet Isis Salam stating that bracelets of fire for those who do not give it's the cat all of these evidences prove generally that a woman must give the cat on her gold and silver"
