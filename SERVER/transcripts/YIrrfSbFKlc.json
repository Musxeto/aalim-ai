  "transcript": "Moustafa says in India the event for prayer is done at varying times because of the school the mosque follows now if I hear anough than first and I stop whatever I'm doing and reply to it and about five or more minutes later the other mosque gives a Dan do I need to reply to them and stop what I'm doing again first of all the concept of stopping when the Iran is being cold I don't know any basis of it so if I'm eating and then it's cold I don't have to drop the spoon and just listen if I'm writing if I'm working with a hammer and a nail if I'm typing if I'm talking to someone I don't have to stop the Sunnah is to repeat I can do that while doing whatever I'm doing I don't have to stop and even if I don't want to repeat I don't want to again I'm not sinful this is recommended Sunnah I'd be losing reward for not repeating behind the imam at the my event but i'm not sinful definitely for not repeating so if i hear the event from a masjid close by and i repeat after him and afterwards i say that Dora and I ask for allah azzawajal to grant our prophet osama waseela and then 5-10 minutes later I hear another event in my oblige - as I said in the beginning neither the first nor the last you're not obliged it's a Sunnah so if you hear the second event if you repeat behind him and say that Dora it's reward again if you don't there is no sin none whatsoever of upon you one Allah knows best"
