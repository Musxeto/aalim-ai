  "transcript": "[Music] oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious y [Music] [Music] ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam we're still studying the minor signs of the hour and there are so many of them and and I'm afraid that we may not be able to cover Mo most of them but at least we would try our level best to have an idea about them one of the signs of the hour which we can see clearly in today's Times is that the prophet told usat that there will come a time just before the day of judgment where means of measurement means of judgment and of evaluation would have a disorder so if I look at a piece of paper this is white but when there comes a time when I would look at it and it say it's black then definitely there is a disorder there is some sort of malfunction that is taking place in people's perception of things in people's evaluating measures and means and also in their judgment the prophet saysat in the Hadith was reported by Ma and was authenticated by albani may Allah have mercy on his soul the prophet told usat there will come a time there will come years of deception the prophet called it years of deception that the people would believe a liar and would accuse someone who's honest and truthful of lying they will entrust a person of treason and betrayal and they would accuse something someone who is trustworthy worthy of being a traitor or someone who betrays them and at these years of deception someone by the title of will speak in public affairs so the companions may Allah be pleased with them ask the prophet what do you mean by this is a new terminology so the prophet explain by saying he is a silly person a person who is worthless who has no value yet he speaks in the Affairs of the public if you look at this Hadith which is an authentic Hadith without any doubt the prophet is telling us that there will come a time where these years are years of deception and this is exactly the description of the era we're living in we find that the means of judgment have been altered and changed people nowadays believe the Liars who are the Liars the Liars are what we can call Press agencies the Media newspapers all those who convey to us what is happening in the world and we can tell that they are lying they are serving their agenda because they don't have anything to fear they don't have their belief in Allah asael is not that strong and some of them are non-muslims so they tend to lie and we notice this we sense this when we watch the news we see how those who are compiling the news and writing it and for relating the policies that a News Channel or a newspaper or a magazine should follow we see how they manipulate the news to to fit their own agendas and definitely it's an not an Islamic agenda so people listen to them believe in them and embrace whatever they say though they are known Liars for an example few weeks ago all of the media Condemned Few of the what is known as a religious police though we don't have any religious police they are members of the organization that enforces virtue and forbids evil because there had been a car accident and in the car accident a man and his wife died and the children were hospitalized in critical condition condition so they accused these members of the so-called religious police of pursuing them and causing this fatality to take place one week 10 days they've been bombarding this organization that ensures that virtue is being forced and that Vice is being prevented this is something from the Quran Allah told us to do this and the only government in the the whole world is our government that applies it in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah with the grace of Allah and this is something our country is honored by 10 days and they were bombarding everything they can uh uh in the book even if they had to go to slunder Scholars or talk about uh uh students of knowledge no problem everything was open Subhan Allah 10 days or two weeks afterwards it was reported officially that it was the police force that pursued this family and the members of this organization of enforcing virtue had nothing to do with it and they were set free and they were cleared by the government and after an inquiry that was thorough not a single word in the Press was mentioned why because it doesn't fit their agenda so all of these are part of the big hypocrisy whether it's major or minor they lie lie until people believe their lies and the prophet is warning us from this likewise when you see in so many places in so many countries Scholars students of knowledge people of TR people who are trustworthy who do not lie and people don't recall them lying even once and they don't have any hidden agendas they're not Filthy Rich they're not collecting money for their own good or for any other cause or means yet people the media the Press tend to tarnish their reputation and whenever they say something they say this is a lie without verifying it without checking it without even giving them the chance to defend themselves nowadays those who are not trustworthy they're being trusted they're being intrusted with things why because this is years of the deception that the prophet told us about Alat wasam you would find people interesting the Jews in trusting the disbelievers and giving them everything they have while the Muslims they are being accused of treason and betrayal and they're not worthy of being trusted and this is strange there are so many Hadith talking about the issue of trust and that it should not be given except to those who are worthy those who fear Allah Asel in the day of judgment and that is why we're talking about the signs of the hour or or the signs of the day of judgment and then the prophet saysat in these years of deception will speak so the companions are asking who is the the prophet explained he said he is a man who is worthless who is silly who has no value none whatsoever however he talks in the public affairs in the Affairs that deal with the public with the community with the country and this is exactly what is happening now who comments on what's happening in the world who comments on uh uh uh interior Affairs or Foreign Affairs who talks about every single thing nowadays are they are the people of the press they are the people of the med media and the majority of them have no knowledge in Islam and they sometimes even don't have knowledge about the things they talk about but they are influential due to it is not what you know it is who you know so that is why they write articles in newspapers and if you look at newspapers in Muslim countries you would rarely find someone who is attributed to Islam or to the knowledge or to defending the Quran and Sunnah is giving a chance to write all those you see are those who are clean shaven who are known or most of them so let's not generalize most of those who you see are clean shaven they have they're known with their uh uh uh dubious affiliation with here and there and they do not have that enthusiasm and Zelf to defend Islam on the contrary what you read is continuous bombardment on Islam on those who are practicing trying to undermine whatever they're doing to protect Islam and to propagate Islam this is exactly what's happening in the Muslim world you can look anywhere and you will find those who they call themselves secularists or liberalists defending secularism liberalism and all of this does all of this do not relate to Islam at all not by near nor nor by far at all it has nothing to do you cannot find a a Muslim a liberal Muslim what do you mean by a liberal Muslim his wife goes to a nude club or a nude beach this is the type of liberality Liberty you want we have our Liberty in the Quran and the Sunnah so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is clearly describing to us 14 centuries ago what is happening today when he said this S wasallam one of the signs that he talked about uh uh to us is a plague and in Hadith of Malik he said that count six before my before the day of judgment and one of them is a plague or an illness that kills a lot of you like an epidemic that hits the herds of sheep and it was known as uh uh at the time that this was a famous epidemic that hits the sheep and it kills it and the scholars say that this epidemic took place in uh uh I believe the 18th uh year of uh Hijra the eth year of Al Hijra that is and 25,000 died and it was in a town called imas the plague ofas in Palestine may Allah liberate it and return it back to to the Muslim uh uh hands and the prophet said that this plague or this illness would kill a lot among you and that is why Scholars said that after the time of the Prophet Alam there were many epidemics that killed a lot of people in the hundreds of thousands so why did we say that it was this plague ofas that was meant in the Hadith because the prophet said among you that you will die those of the Companions and among the famous companions that died abua one of the 10 Heaven bound and mu jab and a number of different Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam now among the signs of the hour the prophet combined a number of them in one Hadith and this Hadith is extraordinary because all what the prophet wasam told us about had happened now listen or most of it an Malik may Allah be pleased with him said should I tell you about a Hadith that I've heard from the prophet myself he's talking to his companions he said the prophet said among the signs of the hour count with me one knowledge would be uplifted it would be it would go it would go two ignorance would show and Prevail three fornication would be spread out four intoxicant the Hadith says wine but I will come to explain this later on intoxicant is drunk that is freely five men would go and women would remain to the extent that every 50 women every 5 Z every 50 women would have one Guardian that is a male Guardian now in this Hadith Subhan Allah are prophecies that had taken place definitely first of all the prophet saidat that knowledge would be lifted it would be taken away and the an ignorance would spread and appear and this took place or is taking place at the moment at the time of the Prophet at the time of the companions at the time of the tab Scholars were in their hundreds and and thousands everywhere you had Scholars every even Layman were able to identify a weak Hadith from an authentic Hadith by just reading the chain of narrators so it was widely spread that knowledge was there but nowadays we see that knowledge has decreased a lot and ignorance has prevailed and it's much much more noticeable than knowledge why is that well the prophet said in the Hadith in the authentic Hadith that Allah does not extract Knowledge from the chest of men it is not that Allah subhana wa tala simply makes you forget knowledge and he takes it away from your chest but the prophet goes on to explain Allah ex extracts knowledge Allah extracts knowledge by having the scholars put to death in the sense that Allah captures their souls and they make and he makes them die and once the scholars are dead and gone the people look around they don't find Scholars so they take ignorant leaders and they appoint them to be their Scholars and these ignorant leaders and or fake Scholars would give fatwas and these fatwas are misleading and they would mislead the people look at our times nowadays who is considered to be a scholar anyone who appears on a TV screen becomes a scholar is this the fact definitely not this is so unfortunate that people like me are giving the chance to come on TV and prach people as if they are Scholars and we're not we are students of knowledge we try our level best to convey what we understand and what we learned to the viewers so that we would share with them the beauty of the Quran and the Sunnah but are we scholars in the sense that are we like ahmedh IM Abu hanifah and IM Shafi sufyan abdah etc etc definitely not not even close so we have a problem nowadays we don't have institutions to produce Scholars we have students of knowledge we have universities you graduate after four years you have a ba in Islamic Studies or in or in or but this is this does not qualify you to be a scholar at all maybe a student of knowledge and the majority who graduate are not even students of knowledge so we have a problem nowadays with producing Scholars so that they would fulfill the need of the public the need of the umah instead of having so many doctors so many Engineers so many Pilots so many businessmen which is good but the priority is for the religion for Islam for those to teach the people what they need to fix what's between them and Allah and to get them closer to Allah and to give them fatwas and and and knowledgeable answers to their queries and questions so this sign is found these two signs the uh uplifting or the extracting of knowledge and the uh uh uh the appearance of ignorance this is definitely clear thirdly the prophet saysat the spreading of fornication now we're not talking about fornication and adultery in non-muslim countries or among the non-muslims this is up to them people we see it we hear about it we uh uh hear people talking that in the west they have wild parties they have partying every weekend and they have relationships ories they have so many things that Muslims canot even imagine and don't want to imagine because it's so filthy and so dirty that it tarnish is the heart it it it makes it black so we don't want to listen to this now we're talking about the Muslims this is available this is found this is noticeable in a lot of the Muslim countries nowadays not all of them with the grace of Allah but there is a lot that you can find in the Muslim world in the Arab countries why is that because the more you go away from the Quran and Sunnah the Wilder you get and you become a beast and you become an animal so you have to fulfill your animalistic desire if this is the proper uh uh adjective for it Malik may Allah be pleased with him and theith is in the prophet said that there will be among my umah among my followers a group of people that would make forbidden things Halal so they will make fornication wearing of silk listening to musical instruments and drinking intoxicants they will make it Halal and the prophet is telling us that they're will be from his own umah those who pray and and fast who would make fornication Halal and this is found unfortunately go to the majority of Muslim countries you will find brel you will find prostitution and sometimes it is legalized by the government and they have a lot of the politicians defending them and calling for their rights so if this is not making fornication Halal what can be this is a manifestation of the prophecy of the prophet alham of these evil things coming up now would it be possible to find such filth and dirt in a community that is conservative where the men are segregated from women where the women are abiding by their uh hijab and not softening their voice when they're speaking to men and they're keep staying as far as possible from men except their relatives and mams of course would you find it easy to find fornication spreading in such a community definitely not and that is why the enemies of Islam are focusing their efforts and they're going out of their way trying to get women out of their houses out of their hijab out of out of their Chastity and this is done by a number of ways mixing in the workplace so forcing women to mix with men this is one of the means and one of the ways of spreading fornication in the future forcing children at an early age well though it's not Haram but trying to implement the idea trying to put the idea of free mixing at the beginning of their years at school up till grade four maybe up to grade six in some schools I've seen it is open until grade 12 so what can result of such Mis uh uh management with the different uh genders this can be also spread by trying to promote Sports Under the flag of the Olympics or uh the United Nation or whatever when you get men and women mixed together men and women women are participating they're playing sports and playing sports is not Haram for women but when they play in front of men and the only difference now is wearing this scarf on the head so if we wear the scarf okay we can play sports in front of men if they don't allow us then it's Haram who said this hijab is not just only the scarf on the head it's far far more than that it's an attitude it's the way you speak for a woman it's the way you mix but to be displayed in front of every single man looking at your figure looking at your body looking at what you're doing but simply covering your head with a scarf this has nothing to do with Islam definitely so whenever you have people going away from the Quran in the Sunnah ignoring what the scholars are saying and telling them and Advising them and they only look at imitating the kufar looking like them behaving like them speaking like them watching the same movies listening to the same music even practicing the same Sports in accordance to their evil traditions and and and rituals they have no problem in that if you have this then the prophet as he warned the fornication would Prevail and be spread fourthly the prophet told us that people would drink intoxicants and nowadays it's so common you find people in most of Arab countries most of Arab countries and the majority of of Muslim countries they are drinking intoxicants they are selling it you have bars you have bars in hotels you have bars in neighborhoods and they're abusing it as if it's Halal and when you ask them is this a Muslim country yes we are Muslims we're proud to be Muslims what kind of Islam are you propagating it's in black and white in the Quran it's in black and white in the Sunnah they came with an evil idea that is trying to change the name so that it would make it popular and acceptable how did they do this this is inshallah what we will elaborate a little bit after the break so stay tuned our aim in and there is an American sister who's very active in Egypt told me personally that uh she traveled between who is in Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quan so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word of it's a word of Allah subhana it goes into the heart it was not created rather Allah SP out May Ramadan blessed with and forgiveness Ramadan Ramadan Ramadan [Music] you can't do that because you do not know what to say to them something at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guidance to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad sallam to follow our Prophet Sall wasallam means you must understand his Islam is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadith is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by om saying now again I'd like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of this say of the companion [Music] oh my Creator [Music] Oham alaykum and welcome back I believe that we have sister Zab from uh Emirates sister Zab um brother I have uh three questions okay uh um first is um uh a day before yesterday I guess you talk told us about the the alcohol in perfume or deodorant but in the end I couldn't be able to understand you said like if it's like um minus point2 or 1% so is it okay to like drink it or uh so I was bit confused okay and uh about please if you uh can tell me more about it okay and the other um um we usually me and my husband when we sleep before sleeping we like play Quran Surah so like while sleeping like before sleeping we uh like listen and uh we go to sleep okay is it okay okay and uh the third my question is um like it's been four three years I reverted to Islam so me and my uh uh actually my husband we were like known each other before so later on um we got married so we got married like um um we just like Quran we saw three times that you know kab kab kab and um I did this um um he did the me and all that stuff were you a Muslim at the time time when you got married or you did not revert yet yes so when you you you reverted you did not have any W your father was still non-muslim uh yes because my father and mother I don't have my father now yes my mother she's not a Muslim and none of from your relatives is a Muslim yeah so he was the one who like uh told me about the Islam and all that stuff that you know this is the reality Okay so this is the reason I guess he told he gave me the all information about the Islam so like I you know I accept it I was like okay you know okay I will answer your question uh okay do we have Abu safwan from Kuwait okay then Abu safan is gone uh sister Z had three questions the first question was related to uh alcohol in deodorant and perfumes and she said that I said something about a percentage let me set things straight alcohols alcohol in perfumes or in deodorants are permissible you're not going to drink them so applying them externally does not affect your prayer does not affect your woodo you're okay to do that for a sister be careful not to wear them and uh expose yourself to men so that they would find this scent this is completely prohibited and it's a major scent so alcohol in perfumes in deodorants in shampoos in creams you apply on your face or your body are this is permissible this is halal now when it comes to drinks we know that wine as in the Hadith we were going to elaborate a lot a little bit on that later on inallah if we time permits us we said that Allah has prohibited upon us to drink any type of wine that was mentioned in the Quran and the scholars say the the Sunnah explained and elaborated so the prophet tells usam whatever a large quantity of intoxicates the small amount of it is Haram even a drop is Haram so the prophet did not mention anything about alcohol the prophet did not mention anything about a percentage he gave us a rule and this rule Scholars said that the percentage of alcohol found in a drink if you drink a large amount of it and I gave an example of beer but when I said beer I did not mean the beer that is sold in uh Europe or in the states or in India or elsewhere where if you drink couple of bottles you're uh uh gone I'm talking about the beer found in Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia there is a percentage of alcohol in it about 2% 3% and if you drink six bottles if you drink 12 bottles you will not be intoxicated you'll be sick but you'll not be intoxicated so Scholars say due to the fact that drinking a lot of this does not intoxicate so you can drink one or two no problem now going back to the beer sold in the non-muslim countries the alcoholic beer the the the known beer if if you drink a lot of it two bottles three bottles you might be wasted so Scholars say even single drop is Haram why because the prophet indicated to us so the percentage may vary and differ but what does not vary and differ is the concept that the prophet Alam taught us so if someone and this is a common question what is the ruling on drinking bardi breeze it's bardi is is a known uh company that sells uh uh spirits and into intoxication and and whiskey and whatever so definitely the company is Haram but if they produce something that is similar to uh uh the beer that does not intoxicate and you drink five six seven bottles of it and it's not intoxicating you the ruling is it's Halal I'm not making an advertisement for that company the whole company you should buy cot it's products because it's based on selling Haram intoxicants wine whiskey whatever you call it it's all forbidden in Islam so again it is not the percentage even when you make dough in Yates there is some percentage of of alcohol does this mean that I cannot eat the bread because it contains some alcohol though 0.1% medication that contains alcohol so this is completely different than actually consuming Fe that is forbidden uh zanab had a second question they her her husband and her fall asleep while listening to the Quran is this permissible the answer is yes because there's nothing forbidding it uh the third question is a a long question she had a relationship with her husband before marriage and he taught her Islam and she embraced Islam and then they got married between themselves so is this permissible the answer is no first of all if you were still having a relationship when you accepted Islam and you got married while still having a relationship this marriage is void it is not acceptable because if you have a relationship with another person you cannot get married until you repent and ask Allah for forgiveness and then after both of you repent you may get married which usually it takes a month or two so that you can make sure that you have your period and that you have no you have not conceived secondly okay om zaha from Saudi Arabia and Amina Amina From okay I apologize for not taking your calls please call back again if you have the chance so first of all repentance should be there second of all you cannot marry a woman on your own I meet a a beautiful girl in the street said oh mallah you look nice she oh you look handsome okay give me yourself in marriage you said I give you myself in marriage and I say kab and that is it let's kiss and make up this is out of the question the prophet says there is says there is no marriage meaning it is void without a guardian a will and two witnesses so the W because you've said you've reverted to Islam and you had no one in your family that is a Muslim from your father's side to act as your Wally in this case your Wally becomes the Islamic judge of the country you in and if there isn't okay Amina from Nigeria yes yes what can I do for you sister I miss fasting for almost three years because I was pregnant and after the delivery I was so sick and I could not pay back due to Chronic ulcer so please what can I okay I will uh uh answer your question AA Aisha from Saudi yes yes what's your question I have few questions okay um my first question is is there any reward like light of the Grave if we recite between and is okay second question and second question is is it permissible to do evolution ining position and my third question is is it permissible to read 100 times okay I will answer the question okay um so sister Zab what you have done is completely wrong your marriage is not uh uh acceptable but it can be rectified and it's uh uh uh the best way of doing it of rectifying it is to and I'm assuming that you still don't have any Muslim Guardian from your family so you have to make the marriage contract again you go to the judge of the Islamic uh uh uh Court in your country at the moment or if there is any you go to the IM of the Islamic Center and you tell him in brief what had happened and you say that we would like to renew our contract we've been married for God knows how long and he would act as your guardian he would talk to your husband and say I give you my uh uh uh this lady in marriage and the man says I accept there are two witnesses or more kalas it's done you go and resume your life Amina is saying that she missed three year uh three years of fasting three Ramadan due to breastfeeding and pregnancy and now she has a severe uh uh uh case of ulcer so she's saying what should I do we should go to the doctors and ask them if this ulcer is permanent and they would forbid you to fast until the day you die they say this is incurable there's no way you can fast until you die in this case you may feed a poor person for every day that you had missed and if you cannot cook food enough sufficient food for a person to eat you give each one 1.25 uh uh kilog of rice if the doctors say no this is manageable with some medication you're able to fast maybe it takes a year or two to recover inshallah but you will be able eventually to fast in this case you don't have to feed anyone you don't have to pay anything wait until you recover and you are fully fit then you may make up for these 3 years or 5 years or whatever uh sister AA from Saudi Arabia says can we recite or if we recite between with it uh send light in our Graves Etc there isn't anything to my knowledge uh uh uh regarding this issue the only thing that I know of that the prophet told us that there are 30 ay a Surah comp composed of 30 ay which is Surah mul that it would prevent the torment of the Grave to those who recite it so we know that memorizing it Allah Asel would save us from a lot of punishment and tor because of that and we also know that reciting it every night protect us in our Graves the prophet used to before going to bed every single night recite Surah alul as part of thear of going to bed so don't Abu safwan from Kuwait how are you fine yes what can I do for you okay I have a question um you know if you are reciting Quran after Surah fa uh and there is no one on the back so to correct you and if you make make a mistake in inwa or if you are confused about an Ayah can you switch to the next ayat and if so do you have to make any and similarly the S question is for example sometime while you if you make a wrong pronunciation like instead of saying if you say and like for example you have sometimes if you add by mistake so in this all cases do we have to make I will answer your question I will answer your question inah AA from Nigeria Aisha okay we apologize again um a from Saudi Arabia uh also so Surah mul is to be recited before going to bed and resigning it between M and is to my knowledge baseless uh the second thing that she asked about was the ruling on performing Evolution while standing this is completely permissible and there's nothing wrong in that and the third uh was about saying after J prayer 100 times and this is not part of the Sunnah it's an innovation you should say this anytime without any number say it in the morning in the in any day of the week There's no problem in that Abu saf's question we have um zah from Saudi Arabia yes yes sister what can I do for you uh I have one question for you about umra okay uh one of my friend uh made the of umra and she went to makah yesterday for for umra and she wasn't able to do sah she did and it was like P time and uh she she's a diabetic patient and she was feeling busy so she didn't perform sah and then she came back to jida now I want to know what is the ruling for this well uh did she say the Dua of I don't know I have to ask her about that okay I will answer your question inshallah um so uh this is Abu safan from Kuwait was saying that if someone's reciting on his own the Quran while in prayer and he makes a mistake and he's baffled he doesn't know whether this is the right Ayah or not can he skip to the following Ayah the answer is yes and does he have to offer any sujud or forgetfulness prostration the answer is no and likewise if he makes a mistake while reciting and he may add something and he's not sure does he make a a forgetfulness uh uh frustration and the answer is no and he doesn't have to do that he tries his level best and Allah will uh uh hold you accountable to your best so if you did your best Allah would not uh uh punish you for that om zah is saying that a friend of hers went yesterday to did ta and when it was time to make she was completely drained out she did not have any uh uh Power so she went back to jida and I asked her specifically did she say the supplication that was taught by the prophet to say when someone is afraid of something happening that may prevent him or her from completing the OM and she said she doesn't know well let's get the answer of both cases if she said this then there is no problem for her to take off heram and resume her normal life without experation without slaughtering anything if she didn't then she is still in the state of she she went back and she took a shower and she put perfumed and she had intimacy with her husband she didn't know so all of these restricted acts are pardoned are forgiven because she did not know now she knows she is in the state of no one has the power or the authority to say that means I am now in the state ofam and after an hour or two said I change my mind I quit so I'm going to take my clothes and put my uh uh take myam and put my clothes back on no one has the power to do this once you committed yourself to it you should abide by it until you finish it Allah says complete and for you have to complete it you cannot just simply uh uh shrug it off and U go back to your normal life to so what can she do om ABD rman from Saudi um sh I I just have like a question and um and a request sh my I was a good practicing Muslim I make my Salah I woke up at night I read my Quran my IM has really been affected I just feel I can't do anything from morning up to evening myself out of bed to go and pray I'm trying to fast but it is so hard why what's the reason don't know I it's not like I'm sick but my IM is gone what is new in your life what's new in your life that you think that is attributed to that she I I cannot say anything I mean I just don't have the energy like during Ramadan I feel finish the whole Quran but now even if I try to read I can't read more than a page you married I can't woke up at night yes shake you have children I have one son okay and your husband is helping you or he's criticizing you no my husband is the best man I can't ever have he's trying but I'm just worried he might get tired of my situation the whole day just for myself out of bed go leg I will answer your question inshallah and I I'll try I will inshallah rahma from rahma from the Emirates sister rahma from the Emirates uh my my name is rahma I'm from the U my I have a question sh but I it's very long can I maybe uh like maybe I can email in your email address email email it email it to or post your question on my website my website is WW w dot my full name Alim which is a SS i m alhim a l h a kou e m do net net net ne ne yes net okay you you post your question and you will get your answer in uh okay Z from the Emirates uh I'm Zena from Dubai again which is it just got disconnected okay uh actually my third question wasn't clear uh so actually I wanted to make sure that you know um I just clear all my doubt my question was that uh uh the uh me and my husband before marriage we didn't had any relationship but just as a person yes I know you and you know me that's it okay and uh he had um we had the two G also and he gave me the H also but the thing is we were at home and you know uh in front of the Quan so there was like two gas like that um so that like you know after a year or so my family didn't know about it but now my family knows so like that uh uh is it okay is it valid my my marriage is you did not have a guardian did you sorry you did not have a guardian when the contract was right my no uh not from my uh it was I me of my husband's cousin this this is not good this is not sufficient I said the Hadith the Hadith of the prophet he said that there is no man marriage valid unless there is a guardian and two witnesses and in another Hadith the prophet saidat whoever does not have a guardian like you whoever does not have a guardian then the sultan or the judge okay uh okay so the judge is the the guardian of the woman so you have no problem anyhow you have no problem you can only go to the Imam of the Islamic Cent where you live if there is an Islamic judge and rectify this in matter of seconds inshallah zah so uh yes so that sister is in still in the state ofam she has to go back to Makkah and the duration is not that long if it's half a day or a day in the morning and the evening she can straight away go to S but if it's a little bit longer than that then it's recommended that she perform ta and then she perform once again ABD is complaining she has the best husband alhamdulillah and she's complaining that her IM is weakened and she is feeling that she's unable to recite the Quran she doesn't want to fast usually if there is nothing new introduced to a person's life I would recommend and I would say that this is usually an evil eye now don't I'm not going to go into the dungeons of evil eyes and envy and gin and black magic this is something I know out of experience maybe someone saw you practice uh praying night prayer it can also be your husband maybe someone saw you read the Quran mashallah and they gave you an evil eye with good intention they're good people an evil eye can come out from a good person it come it can come from a father to his son he sees his son working out or doing and wow look at his uh uh energy and the sun fall uh uh sick this happens it doesn't mean that there is ill intention an evil eye can happen I remember and I have very little time remember one of the D and she called me and she was crying and she was telling me that she has exactly the same sentences she's a she's a a student of knowledge well known so I told her immediately go to Haram make and and supplicate to Allah to clean your heart from this 5 6 hours later on she called me and she said I feel as good as new this comes Froman so what can you do ABD if you're unable you're in Saudi Arabia if you're close to Haram if you're in jida and you can make Om go ahead and believe me after the OM and supplicating to Allah and insisting on Allah to cure you and to restore the IM back to your heart immediately everything was would go away if you can't if I don't live close to the Haram I don't have this privilege bring zamzam water if you don't have Zam Zam water no more water recite fa recite the last two verses of Bak recite recite the last three suras of the Quran and recite this group three times each time you recite it you blow on the water and drink from this water in the morning in the afternoon and before you go to bed and if you wish you can wash your face wash your body with it and believe me in no time yeah I would not give a limit but in no time you will back uh and strong uh inshallah and good as new now I think that the calls are gone and we have and and I'm and I'm told by the control room that we're out of time until we meet
