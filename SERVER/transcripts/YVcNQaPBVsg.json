  "transcript": "watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is so right as the first start we here tonight with family around the nice meal we're making do I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode of Virtues of fasting where we will continue to read from the chapter that deals with fasting from the book Hadith number 36 this Hadith was narrated by may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam has prohibited fasting on two days the day of F and the day of sacrifice or Al and this Hadith was agreed upon in this Hadith the prophet Alat is is telling us about two days that reoccur every year where it is totally prohibited for a Muslim to fast them and these two days are which is the festival the Eid the feast which comes immediately after Ramadan the month of fasting is over so the following day is called and the second day is the day of the sacrifice and it coincides with the 10th of the last month of the lunar year of the Islamic calendar the month ofah and it's called because people slaughter their sacrifices in or on that day so these two days the prophet Alat prohibited fasting them no matter matter what the reasons are so it is totally prohibited and if a person fast them then his fast is voided even if a person is obliged to fast three consecutive days or two consecutive months once theid is due he has to in uh interrupt his fasting or continuous fasting for that day and then complete and Carry On from the following day as we will find inshallah uh when we discuss the following Hadith where where it talks about the three days of a and we will talk about this inshallah now if we look and analyze for Ramadan it's very obvious because you fasted 29 or 30 days so as part of celebrating as part of showing your gratitude to Allah and your jubilance to him subhana wa taala it is a must that you break your fast and also Scholars say that Allah it is putting sort of um buffer zone if you wish is putting a barrier between fasting of voluntary days and the F the mandatory fasting and that is why the prophet Alam forbade us from fasting a day or two before Ramadan so you have to eat generally speaking because a day or two before Ramadan if you fasted then it would be all mixed and you wouldn't know which is mandatory and which is voluntary and it wouldn't have any taste for it and likewise afterwards you have to break your fast on the day of so this way you would have this segregation between the Sunnah fasting and the mandatory fasting so if a person makes a vow and I say it's NE on me that I would fast the day of his vow does not take place okay so should he compensate on another day the answer is no he has to pay experation for breaking his oath because whenever you are unable to fulfill your vow then you are directed to expiate the experation of someone who breaks an oath now this Hadith is talking about two days that happen every single year the following Hadith and it is Hadith number 37 uh it is narrated by may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaih wasallam said the days of that is the three days following the 11th the 12th and the 13th of the days of are days of eating drinking and remembering of Allah me meaning making Vick the most gra uh the most great and glorious and this Hadith was related by Al IM Muslim so these three days also happen every year however the prophet Alam did not include them with the previous Hadith and he kept it or kept them segregated or separate why is that see it is totally prohibited to fast the day of whether Al or we have no problem with that not a single day is permissible to be fasted on these two days now or the days of Tash and why do we call them the days of Tash because because when the people Slaughter on the 10th of on on the 11th 12th and 13th these are the days that they stay the pilgrims in Mina and they usually used to cut thin the the meat and put probably salt or something to it and put it under the Sun so that it would become dry and it can be stored they didn't have any refrigerators at the time so this is the only way to preserve the meat from going bad so this is why it was called so now the prophet separated these three days from why is that because not fasting the days of Tash is not for all see the general verdict is you cannot fast them except meaning that there isn't an exception while in there is no exception none whatsoever and none is accepted at all so what is the exception in the days of well the scholars said that the prophet Alam allowed those who are performing or so what what are these well if we go into this we have to explain the Hajj and this would come inshallah in the uh uh chapter that deals with Hajj but the rituals of Hajj are divided into three types and andan are the top two because they involve a slaughtering of a sacrifice ifrat does not have mandatory sacrifice but if you want to give then this is up to you now one would say how about if I cannot afford the sacrifice in this case Allah mentioned in chapter 2ah Al Bak that those who are unable to offer a sacrifice if they're doing in this case they should fast three days in Haj and seven days if they go back to their uh Hometown home Home Country Etc so the three days of Haj begin from the time you initiate your pilgrimage this can be in sha this can be in this can be when performing for and it ends by the end of the 13th of which is the last day of so therefore if a person is unable and he was squeezed till the very end so he cannot fast and he's left over with three days 11th 12th and the 13th but we're told not to fast them except for someone who's unable to find money to slaughter a a sacrifice in this case he may fast the 11th the 12th and the 13th so only for a pilgrim who is unable to find money for his sacrifice what about if someone says okay my habit is to fast the three white days that we spoke about yesterday the 13th the 14th and the 15th of every lunar uh uh month so now you're telling me that I'm I'm not allowed to fast the 13th what to do can I be an exception as well the answer is no because you're not a pilgrim you have to refrain from fasting the 13th you may fast the 15th the 14th and the 15th and you may add any other day throughout the month as wellat if you fasted it then this can take the place of the third day inshallah and the prophet Alat wasam Justified not fasting these days of a by saying they are days of eating and drinking so one should celebrate Allah's favors and blessing upon him if you're ordered to slaughter on the 10th which is theid and then order to fast the following three days without being able to enjoy your uh sacrifice and eating from it then this would not be appropriate and that is why Allah's generosity upon us that he orders us not to fast in these three days of the however the prophet because he knows that people when they Feast when they drink and eat they neglect they forget that is why he told them or he told us that the days of T are days of eating drinking and remembering of Allah making VI so he is reminding us when you eat and drink don't be neglectful don't ignore and forget Allah's favors upon you but rather make vick and the thck we know that in uh uh the three days of T we remember Allah uh after the five daily prayers by saying repeatedly until the sunset of the last day then it stops and also one of the benefits is that the slaughtering of your sacrifice extends just to the time of the sunset of the last day of the which is the 13th so if you did not Slaughter Slaughter on the day ofid you have the right to slaughter on the 11th 12th and before the end of the 13th and this helps a lot of the people because especially in in Muslim uh countries the prices of sacrifice Rockets high on the first day of Eid and it goes down the second and the third and the fourth day which is the last it becomes quite reasonable so this is good for a person who is is interested in buying uh uh something that is Affordable moving on to Hadith number 38 and this Hadith was narrated by andar may Allah be pleased with them all they said nobody would was allowed to fast on the day of Tash except for those who could not afford the Hadi or the sacrifice and this had was related by Imam Al bukari may Allah have mercy on his soul so this Hadith is report or narrated by and may Allah be pleased with them so did the prophet say thisam or they said this from their own knowledge and isad most likely such things are not said by own isad this is something that they're relating to the prophet Alam and if you recall is it a or is the opinion and the saying and the wordings of the companion is when they related to the prophet wasam and most likely it is to the prophet sallam so sacrifice is known in Arabic as Al and there are a number of slaughterings that we do in Islam so there is which we Slaughter when we are blessed with children two for a male baby boy and uh uh one for one sheep for a a female baby girl there is what is known as and this is a ram that is slaughtered by those who did not go for Haj so on the day ofid we slaughter a sheep as sacrifice to Allah so that we and our brothers and sisters who are performing pilgrimage we have something in common there is what is known as and this is an experation for a mandatory Act of Hajj that you did not do or for something that is restricted in your and you had done that and there are others uh uh to be slaughtered for the sake of Allah Hadith number 39 and this Hadith was narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said do not single out Friday night that is the night preceding Friday among all the other nights for performing the night prayer also do not single out Friday among other days for fasting unless it coincides with the days one regularly fasts and and this was um reported by IM Muslim in theah the following Hadith Hadith number 40 and it's in the same topic Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him says that the prophet of Allah sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam said none of you should fast on Friday unless he fasts together with with the day before or the day after and this Hadith was agreed upon so what do we understand from these two hadiths the first Hadith may Allah be pleased with him the prophet is forbidding us from two things one of them is to specify Friday night with night prayer and the prophet said do not specify it this means that if you have a habit of praying the whole week then you have no problem if you select alternate days for example you have no problem the problem is that when you specify Friday thinking that it has virtues more than other nights when it comes to praying night prayer and this is a serious thing because a lot of our Innovations are driven through such interest or such care so the prophet is telling usam do not specify it with night prayer there is another Hadith though if I recollect correctly it is weak but the scholars use it often where the Prophet says do not specify the night of e and in Islam the night precedes the day so if the sun sets then this is the night of tomorrow not the tonight as we some uh uh say it so if today is Saturday and the sun sets at 7:00 for example now at 7:30 it is the night of Sunday the following day so the prophet is telling us that the night of Friday which precedes Friday you're not allowed to specify it with night prayer because this is something that is not part of the dean however if you pray other nights and you pray as well uh uh the Friday night they have no problem also if someone is totally busy throughout the whole week and the only day off he has is on Friday which he wants to pray night prayer do we prevent him the answer is no we ask him are you praying tonight because it's a Friday or because it's your day off says no it's because my day off if my day off was a Sunday I would have prayed it as well in this case we tell him that this is permissible and there is no problem in that the second prohibition that the prophet forbade the this from doing is to specify Friday for fasting from all the week days I choose Friday to Fast and the same goes here why are you doing it this is because Friday is the best day of the week and I want to fast it so that I would get more reward the answer this is not permissible and in the Hadith the following Hadith that we've read the prophet said Alam do not fast it unless you want to fast a day before or a day after so either you fast Thursday with it or you fast Saturday with it but should not isolate it without uh uh any justifiable reason the prophet also in theah entered once at one of his wives Jia on a Friday and she was fasting so when he saw that she was fasting he asked herat do you want to did you fast yesterday that is Thursday she said no so the prophet told her are you going to fast tomorrow which is a Saturday she said no so the prophet told heram break your fasting and this shows us that isolating Friday by fasting without a legitimate reason is not something that is permissible what are the legitimate reasons that can be allowed well for example if a person fasts alternate days in this case you can fast Thursdays and Skip FR a Friday one week but the following week you're going to skip Thursday and fast Friday and Skip Saturday so in this case this is permissible because you're not fasting Friday for the sake of Friday Also if Friday coincides with as if it coincides witha and you didn't fast the eth no one would tell you hey wait because you didn't fast Thursday you cannot fast on Friday because Saturday isid and you cannot fast Eid so you'll be isolating Friday no can there is no problem in doing this inshallah because it was not intended for itself now from the Hadith it is Crystal Clear to us and it's in theah so you have no doubts and I ask all the brothers and sisters do you have any doubt in these hadiths and definitely they will say no they are in theah they're logical do not specify Friday with night prayer and do not specify the day with fasting except if it is a fast that coincides with your normal fasting alternate days as Etc or making up for M days of Ramadan fasting expiations or vows on them there's no problem in that or isolating it for that reason so specifying a form of worship is not permissible as the prophet has indicated you all agree with this inshallah do you yes I can hear that I hope now the $1 million question if you apply this Hadith to all our forms of worship you will find and figure out that so many Innovations have creeped into our religion so when you find someone celebrating the M what are you doing says it is the day of uh uh the birth of the Prophet Alam and I'd like to celebrate it by doing this or that by having a party by reading his by we say specifying such a form of worship is not permissible he says it's a great day and said I know it's a great day Friday is also a great day yet Allah prohibited for us to fast it specifically or to pray the night prayer in it if you look at the hundreds of thousands of Muslims specifically choosing the 27th of Ramadan to go to Mecca it's a blessed night and it's a blessed place and it is a possibility that it is the night of decree how however none of the companions used to specifically go and select that night or go to Mecca and especially if we know that people don't go there because it is the night of decree but rather just to hear the Dua of the Imam that takes like half an hour and this is not part of Islam so you must be careful you have to take all the necessary means means to avoid falling into to avoid doing something that the prophet did not doam so if someone thinks that okay how about specifying the 15th of Shan with with reciting the Quran said has no origin it's baseless what about specifying the 27th of rajab it is the mirac the night of the miraculous journey where the Prophet Prophet ascended to the seventh heaven Etc said there is no evidence backing this up and it's baseless and even if it was proven even if the prophet was raised and elevated on that specific night did he ever celebrate it or specify special things to be done no did his companions ever did something like that or similar to it the answer is no so whatever you do if you're not following his his footsteps sallallah alhi wasallam if you're not following the footsteps of the companions may Allah be pleased with them you will be innovating in the religion of Allah and all of this would be rejected in your face on the day of judgment as Allah Asel does not accept anything except that goes side by side with the Sunnah of the Prophet s we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back their lives again for them happiness let

even okay you get me so then he didn't tell me that he's going to to to visit his mother until when he reached to the airport then he gave me then when I asked I called him he was telling me stories before then he told me uh me now I want to go to to my country to visit my mother is it right in in Islam he didn't left anything for me okay I will answer inah we have Amin from bahin I have three questions yes uh first question is do we need to play two before going on on so to India or Pakistan okay second second second question is about the prayer last time I went and prayed in in India and one person came and started shouting at me he's saying this is Mak time before Z how dare you pray like this I said no it is allowed he said no it is not allowed it is forbidden time okay third question third question is Sir for zakat can we give zakat to a lady uh who not having any source of income but she has a gold about 50 g gold which is less than the Zak criteria okay I will answer your question inshallah from Saudi I have a 12y old son yes he's trying to memorize Quran okay and he knows everything about Salah can you leave me in prayer or no okay any more questions oh and then the other thing is like um my other son is younger and sometimes he WS the bed okay when he W the bed and it dries up and I sleep on it are my clothes impure okay thank you so much and we have om Huda from Saudi Arabia shake what to do with the teenage kids when they don't respect the parents although you have been trying you have been watching Huda TV taking your guidance implementing in house on kids and sending them to Masjid but now they start saying that it's like a sh you are forcing us to do these things we should do our own selves and uh whatever you listen from you shakes uh and from Quran and Sunnah we try to tell them and sit with them teach them Quran and um you arrange everything even Arabic teacher but still they are they have started disrespecting they have started even they say that we don't want to live with with you nowas enough is enough because the FNA is so much outside they they go with the FNA they say you see other parents they don't care but you are too much you we are the only one who are in Masjid and you are forcing us to go Masjid where do they study uh before they were studying in Indian school then we transferred because of the Arabic Arabic was very weak then we sent them to International School British but there was because it was Arabic you know the children were Arabs mostly Egyptians but uh you know we tried to teach them Arabic uh Saudi Arabic so the books and uh we put a teacher also in home Egyptian teacher but now the Elder son and you I will answer you insh I will answer too much now I I'm being a mother I don't know what where to stand what I will answer you I will answer you inshallah ABD Rahman from Saudi Arabia she says that her brother and father called from India they said that the people there pray witer three like and we know that the prophet forbade praying W like M and that the Sunnah is in the second R you don't sit like M for t but rather you stand immediately for the third Rak so uh they say what to do the answer is if there isn't any Masid of or of salafi Masjid or someone who follows the Sunnah in this case pray with them there's no problem with that the the sin is on them but there isn't any sin on them actually because this is the max of their knowledge and they are following a trustworthy Imam who is Abu hanifah and his school of thought is is also trustworthy so by you following them inshallah your prayer is accepted uh um Iman from Saudi my first question is about the night of Eid we have heard that we we Muslims are supposed to pray and invoke Allah tala and for the blessings like we are are we supposed to pray the whole night and my second question is uh are we like in the condition of the world today are we supposed to are we supposed not to buy things that are that belong to the non-muslim Traders or non-muslim uh Muslim non-muslim world like you have uh things from the west and okay I understand the question insh you're welcome saying that is is so what is uh uh the reward are they the same the the answer is that they're all fall under the category of night prayer now is to be prayed at the beginning of the night tud is to be prayed at the end of the night because the prophet Alam whenever the 10 nights were uh due of the last 10 nights of Ramadan he used to wake up his wives he used to revive his nights and he used to tighten his apron so that he would really give it all to prayer and to Vick and to remembering Allah so one should try his level best to do that and the third question that if she has two lcks or whatever in her bank account is uh it zable definitely any savings you have any money that you have any Investments that you have you you've got to give uh zakat 2.5 after one year passes if it reaches aab we have uh from Saudi I have uh two questions yes um first is uh while praying yesterday um we could not tell whether the Imam is going um there is a you know for the surra so uh he did the Sasa but we went into Ru and then when he got up uh we uh got up from the ru and then he went in Ru that was our second Ru and then we completed the Raa like that with him um so there was this mistake so um I don't know how to um you I cont Rectify it or know that there is such you know and if we miss it what to do then okay second question second like um if you go for we go for we PR and then for even for um yeah camel we also pray um every every time we go we have to pray is it a m okay for the mid and um another question was like um uh is it okay to stay in the mosque till the time ofam after doing your t or you have to come back home and U like if your home is really far from the mosque okay I will answer you inshallah okay thank you you're quite welcome we have khad from Saudi my question yeah my question is my question is mute mute your television please Khadija mute your television my question is that my husband he left to to his country to to visit his mother but yeah I don't have anybody here and I'm sick even to go and buy me medicine to buy for me and bring for me here I don't have anybody and I don't know what what I can do what will I do I don't know if this is allowed for a husband to leave his wife without any assistance okay in Islam I don't know if it is right I will answer you inshallah uh we have is from Kenya and maybe he's the last caller inshallah so that we can answer the questions I have two question yes yeah one question I want to ask for example if you want to go and pray and maybe you did not get get only the that they will write for you PR not get okay and the second question is that they can you can pray at one night you can pray two viory acceptable or not okay I will answer your question inshallah okay thank you you're welcome okay AA from the em says that what's the ruling on reciting uh the Quran while in the state of menus reciting the Quran is no problem at all touching the Quran is a pro is problematic the majority of Scholars forbid this but if you read it from a PDA from your computer from your mobile this is uh uh no problem in that inshallah and uh she says that if a woman sees brownish dischar should she stop fasting or this does not affect her fasting there's a difference of opinion among Scholars some Scholars say that if it is the time for her menus and she sees the brown discharge she should stop fasting because two three days it will come others say and I follow this opinion and I feel comfortable with it that no Allah Asel told women to refrain from fasting and praying pring when they get their Menses and brown discharges in the beginning of the Menses is not Menses why because so many cases women see these Brown discharges a night or two and they refrain from fasting and praying only to realize that a third or fourth night they don't have nothing and they're pure again so they skipped the prayers and the fasting of two nights over nothing so therefore you should remain to fast and pray until you see the flow of the blood from Saudi Arabia he says that if there is someone from a a family relative that does not pray at all and says that it's not mandatory why we should we pray every single day and every single night this is an act of apostasy whoever says this and believes this and he does not pray he's an apostate he has committed an act of kufur so you should treat him as such give him advice try to advise him try to remind him of Allah if he's still in insists and continues then you should shun him completely and he says that are all the hadiths in bukari and Muslim considered to be authentic and the answer is yes it is uh uh accepted among all Scholars of Islam and the public that the bukari and Muslim are all authentic but do they include all the authentic hadiths or there are other hadiths that are not included in no there are other hadiths that are not included in BK Muslim that are authentic in other books as well she uh he says that uh can we give zakat up in advance for a number of years this needs explaining if you have your assets with you you can give 2.5% of what's available for the last year and you can give 2.5% for the next and the third year no problem because you've got the manone the money you've got got $100,000 in your bank account so you can give 2.5% for this year and the following year but if you're anticipating that inshallah I will get money maybe in five months six months no you cannot pay something until the asset itself is there can you pay for a number of years the maximum is two because this is what the prophet did when Al Abbas his uncle gave the zakat of his money two years in advance so to go more than that would not be uh appropriate Khadijah from Saudi Arabia she says and her question is also similar to Khadijah from Saudi Arabia maybe it's the same probably uh they have a problem and or she has a problem her husband did not go to see his mother for few years because of debts that he owed to the company and then they gave him a release and he called his wife from the airport and he left and she is saying that I'm sick I don't have anyone to buy me medication I don't have anyone to take me to hospital I'm all alone here is this right the answer is no this is definitely not right it's not even manly to run like a coward leaving your wife stranded behind now I know your allegation you'll probably say a if you know my wife she is so nagging and she's so hyper and she was going to make my life hell and I would not have been able to do anything except by escaping like the way I did even though this is not the right way of doing it if you are unable to communicate with your wife your marriage has a big problem and maybe sometimes if communication cannot be established sometimes it's best to call it off because this cannot go on for for forever you cannot be married to someone you cannot communicate to maybe the F first 5 years Allah would guide him or guide her second five years it's spent 10 years now in marriage and we have two three kids yeah inshallah things will be better and you end up divorcing each other after 20 30 40 years why because of lack of communication you have to find the solution and the answer to this problem before it escalates out of proportion now his actions are totally unacceptable running like a coward is not the actions of a man but at the same time you have to look into the way you deal with him and I'm assuming that you have no problem at all that it is all his then it is 100% responsibility over him for you as a sick person you have to try your level best to get some help from the neighbors or from any uh one you know that could give you that uh help uh Amin from uh bahin says is it Sunnah to pray two rakas before traveling the answer is no when you want to shorten your prayer once you travel you start shortening your prayer there is no Sunnah that before I set off on my journey I pray two raas and he says that he went to a Masjid somewhere in the subcontinent and he was praying and one of the people there usually they are the the the elders shouted and scolded him and said no you should not do this you should not pray it's a time of uh prohibition and it's Mak and this is the opinion of Imam Abu hanifah and other Scholars as well and it's a respected opinion but having said that does it doesn't mean that it is the opinion see we have four schools of thought if someone says right the other one says left the third one says stay uh uh uh go forward and the other one said uh says go backwards one of them at the side of Allah is correct they can't be all four correct at the same time so one of them is correct how to know that know that you have to go back to the Quran and Sunnah so to this brother we tell him okay you say that we we are not allowed to pray at the time of restriction which is after ass till Sunset and after fer till uh the sunrise and I agree with you the prophet forbade us from praying there but is this prohibition for all types of prayer he said what do you mean said okay let's analyze now can I pray prayer if I forgot to pray it and I prayed with the congregation and and I remember that oops I forgot can I pray it now in this time of restriction he says hm yes you can is okay now what about if after they brought a funeral can we pray funeral prayer on it though it's a time of restriction said never thought of that yeah yes you can definitely there's no point delaying it until so I ask him again what about if a person was in the Masid after praying and all of a sudden we have a sun eclipse do we pray the eclipse prayer or not said yes we do said these are three prayers and there are more if you wish they all have a cause and a reason and that is why you allowed it likewise the prophet said whenever you enter a mid Do not sit down until you pray two Ras so it has a Reas reason and it's a legitimate reason therefore it is a must to pray it so give them this analogy inshallah they would understand he says can we give zakat to a woman who is poor poor doesn't have any source of income but she has 50 gram of gold answer is yes see in order for her to be legible for zakat it doesn't have to be that she has not a single penny women by nature must have jewelry to Adorn themselves so if she has a bracelet if she has a necklace even if it's like 50 60 70 grams of gold no one says no you have to sell it be Stone broke then we can give you zakat no this is not right she can take from the zakat ABD from Saudi Arabia she says that her son is 12 years old and he memorizes the Quran can he lead her in prayer if your son does not or if you do not live next to a mid the answer is yes he can read you and he can lead you in prayer but if he lives within the vicinity of a Masjid he's male and it's mandatory upon him to attend the Salat in the Masjid if he hears the aan so if he doesn't then it's okay if if he want if you want him to Lead You In night prayer which is voluntary again this is okay and no problem with that her younger son uh wets his bed and then it dries and then she sleeps on it so does the uh impurity does it is it transferable does it catch her if your body is not wet then it it's not transferable but it's not hygienic I you can smell it it's bad you have to wash it so that you would keep it uh clean omuda says that the teenage that they have don't respect their parents don't obey them this is the trend unfortunately but you have to give them a lot of love and compassion unconditional love and you have to discipline them so don't be very harsh treating them as if they're in the military and at the same time don't spoil them by ignoring their negative remarks as if they had done or said nothing no most likely putting them international schools especially in Saudi Arabia this is a a very infested place it's it's very bad because you get people who are interested in teaching their kids English so they're part westernized part uh uh normal people not usually with an Islamic background and it's very rare to find a school that is driven by Islamic management and teachers and it's International so you would have music you would have the boys and the girls in that school sometimes they're mixed unfortunately and sometimes they have bad ideas coming and and and fully equipped from their homes so you are doing bad when you put them in such schools and this uh backfires so you have to try to advise them keep on advising them reminding them of Allah and you have to reprimand them if they cross the line you have to be firm in that you have to cut some of the things that they take for granted their pocket money their uh uh smarts phone smartphones their access to the internet their uh Games Etc until they're disciplined so they do well we reward them they do bad we reprimand them and may Allah make it easy om man says that we always thought that praying the night of the Eid is a good deed it's an innovation and it is prohibited and she says that in in times of tribulation as we see now is it isn't it a must that we bycott the uh uh merchandise and the goods of the West America Europe Etc who are supporting um what's happening in uh Palestine who are supporting our the enemies of Islam obligating it is not permiss missible because the prophet even at the times of Wars he did not buycott the uh uh bantian uh uh products or the Persian products but would it it be something good and showing our solidarity it would and I would you uh uh uh raise my hat for you if you are able to do this and for every Muslim if they think that they would inflict harm and there is a substitute elsewhere alhamdulillah do not their products buy cot it uh for good and you will be rewarded for that but don't look at those who refuse to bcot as lesser Iman or lower people Amber says that um they made the mistake the Imam went for the recitation prostration they thought he was going for R so they made R and when he raised up he said Allah he didn't say so they figured out that he went for U uh restor um recitation prostration what to do nothing your mistake is Forgiven inshallah she says every time we come to the mid do we have to pray two for answer is yes if you come for and you leave and then you come for and you leave and you come for every single time before sitting you have to do that she says can we stay in the Masjid after till night prayer says yes and you intend this to be and inshallah Allah would reward you for that is from um I don't know Kenya probably or Kuwait he says that um if someone wanted to pray night prayer and he missed the night prayers with the congregation and only prayed three raas of Witter so would he be considered to have prayed the night prayer uh the the night of decree that is no he prayed only portion of it he should go back and he should pray home like for four or five hours and recite the Quran and his final question was can we have two Witter with or if I'm going to be pray tud the answer is no the prophet said there are no two Witter in the same night so this is a Prohibition if you pray with the IM in and you want to go home and pray night prayer you pray Two rakas by Two rakas by Two rakas endlessly without another Witter or if you pray with the Imam and he prays wi when he offers Salam you stand up so your wit becomes two so you add another ra and by this you have prayed 12 r with the IM instead of 11 when you go back home you pray two two two and then conclude that with one single ra of Witter this is all the time we have until we meet next time in lighting this day is all right as the first time we tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do on I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can oh"
