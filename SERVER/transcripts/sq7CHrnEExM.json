  "transcript": "so here in the United States you cannot like drive a car without car insurance nor get like any medical treatment without uh health insurance and there's also like life insurance and what to do as a Muslim like in regards to that first of all car insurance is mandated by law so if you drive without it they'll find you and maybe they suspend your license and maybe they'll put you in jail life insurance is not mandated by any law and it is not permissible in any case medical insurance the vast majority of Scholars say that it is like gambling it's like a lottery and it's Haram however in some countries where the laws are designed to make life difficult if you don't have or even impossible if you don't have have um um medical insurance so if it is only to fix your tooth you'd pay like $5,000 which is not extravagant it's ridiculous so they're twisting your arm to have one whether you like it or not in this case this is a necessity as some Scholars say because it is and not RBA or Gamble Ling there is ambiguity in it and whenever the is needed and a person has an urgency to use it then it is uh forgiven inshallah and one can use that and Allah Knows Best"
