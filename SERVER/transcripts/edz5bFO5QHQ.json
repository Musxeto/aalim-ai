  "transcript": "when to say this Dua the scholars differed some say before after you do the then the salutation or the d as in in U then you say in conclusion before you offer you say and you offer and this is the most authentic opinion according tol and the likes why because they say in Salat before Salam it's a time for Dua after Salam it's the time for Vi unfortunately the vast majority of Muslims after Salam they raise their hands Dua then they wipe themselves and shower themselves and and do the whole nine yards what are you guys doing said oh bar Bara blessing okay again let's go back 5 minutes do you have evidence from the prophet he used to do this if yes I'm going to share it with you I'm going to do it from today if not you're innovating so they come to you and say yes we have evidence okay come please share it with me said the prophet Salli wasallam before going to bed he used to cup his hands and recite the last three and wipe over his body okay so this is your evidence du this is before going to bed you in you're in you're in where is this said yeah but he used to wipe himself before going to bed before going to bed he didn't do this during the five daily prayers never ever once it was reported he could it be he lived in Medina for how many years 13 20 10 where is Ronaldo what's his name Cristiano I think where does he play n mallah Saudi Arabia come on guys this is your prophet and you don't know how many years he lived in Mecca and how many years he lived in Medina which year did he die in long time ago right masallah you know your history give me a year huh 10 close but no cigars H 11 11 on the 11th Fe the prophet lived 13 years in Mecca 10 years in Medina and he died in r on the 12th of RAB which people now celebrate that's mind-blowing all Scholars agree that he died on the 12th of R they differed if he was born on the 9th or on the 12th so those who celebrate the M they're actually celebrating his death isn't this mind blowing and it's an innovation but this is not our topic come on you've stretched it too much another word we're going to beat the heck out of you okay I respect myself so it's best to give the Dua before the Salam because the prophet told us thisam after you conclude the salutation ask whatever you want then conclude your prayer but he never said to do the same after the Salam you have Dua why do you raise your hands after Salat and make Dua uh because I want Allah to answer me okay the prophet told you you want Allah to answer you make Dua in the closest you are to Allah when you in sujud this is a prophet's Hadith the closest one of you is to Allah when he's in suud so choose whatever Dua you like this is what the prophet said this is what he's recommending you to do said no no no I'm not going to do it in I'm not going to do it before Salam as he requested I'm going to do it after Salam shoit yourself that's your problem not mine therefore"
