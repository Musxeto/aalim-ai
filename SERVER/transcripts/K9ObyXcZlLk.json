  "transcript": "now knowledge when we speak about it it's derived or divided into two types Islamic knowledge and conventional and non-islamic knowledge Islamic knowledge is the one that is praised in the Quran and the Sunnah which refers to the tap the Quran the the and above all and everything related to IM these are the Islamic Shar sciences that cleanses the heart and purifies the soul nothing on Earth does this nothing on Earth can grant you tranquility and peace of mind except these Sciences nothing when someone has a Calamity his father dies his son dies his loved one dies he loses his business he's afflicted by an chronic illness he's devastated he's depressed nothing can comfort him yeah she there is drugs drugs comfort you for what for a short period of time and the moment you're sober and it gone you become more depressed so you need need a bigger dose and a bigger dose until you overdose and he's dead but when you have the signs of in your heart and you know that this is this is the decree of Allah the Divine ruling of Allah you're content like the prophet said the heart is saddened and the eyes weep and we don't say anything except that pleases Allah and by Allah Oh ibraim by departing you we are sad but we're content yes we're humans my son dies I am sad but I'm content I don't bang my head on the wall I don't pull my hair I don't have hair but if I had I would not pull my hair because I know this is something Allah wrote upon me this is the first type [Music] of the Islamic Shar related the second T type of is the non-islamic the permissible and this is divided into two types permissible and impermissible so the permissible that is not related to Shar such as engineer engineering mathematics physics medicine anything that we study in conventional schools and this type is beneficial and can be rewarding if you have good intention what's your intention to become a doctor oh I want to become rich mu I'm asking you guys is it Halal Oram to study medicine and work as a doctor to become rich it's good are you rewarded for it no but it's Hal I'm not doing anything Haram if someone says w because it's a beautiful science and it helps me cure and treat many many people and through which and I know personally doctors like this W Subhan Allah they're doctors and they're rich h no doubt in that but every time they treat a patient the first thing they say and the patient is Moana who's this is the IM I'm I'm coming to the doctor alhamdulillah okay let's see this Allah will put Allah will put cure and he relates all of his work to whom he's going doing da why are you doing this he said because I want to get the people close to Allah Subhan Allah he becomes rich and he is on the path of Da and he's getting benefit and reward and everything you do in life if you have a good intention Allah will reward you for that even drinking tea you wake up in the middle of the night you want to pray tahajud but you're sleepy like me so what do you do I'll make some chai and I make this chai I drink it now I'm awake my intention is to get awake drinking the tea is a form of and Allah will reward me because my ni is to strengthen myself everything you do if you have good intention it becomes so this is part of the non-islamic knowledge or science that can be permissible can be also rewarding there is a branch of this knowledge which is Haram and lots of the the people are indulged in it such knowledge and science that has no benefit neither in the D nor in the such as astrology they study for hours and for years about astrology this is the SC scorpion this is the zodiacs this is and they ask you when were you born why just tell me when you when you were born I was born this this month okay this is what will happen to you in the next 5 years huh how did you know I can see it in the Stars okay the brother also was born in the same date and this one and this one and this one we're all going to have the same events um I never thought of that yeah I think so yeah the the Stars say and this is Haram reading Zodiacs do you have Zodiacs in Kenya yeah in the newspapers they say this H at at the end of the newspaper he said this will happen to you will meet a good friend Subhan Allah this happened to me last week I met a good friend how did you know and you will be disappointed yeah Subhan Allah I was disappointed this morning as well how do they know the future all of this is nonsense now the prophet saidat whoever goes to a soothsayer a fortune teller just for the fun of it I'm reading it for the fun I don't believe in this baloney but um yeah I just read it or listen to it the prophet says 40 days of your Salat will be invalid Allah will not accept you praying 40 days from that day but if you believe it then you have left the fold of Islam you have become a cafir how do you believe it you read it and it says that uh watch out this week there will be a huge accident and tomorrow while going to work you see this huge accident should you this is what they told you believed it you're a cfir now done deal because you believe that someone other than Allah knows the future and also part of the knowledge that is Haram is the knowledge of acting we have Hollywood Bollywood Nollywood inshallah you don't have kinwood I know they have kinwood which is you know like Sony and uh and the likes but I don't know the knowledge of music you get people going to uh school and colleges and studying musical instruments in D and and the likes and the notes and how to play and Mah he's a good guitarist he's a good pianist he's a good violin he's a good ballet dancer a man wearing tights like this shame on you go wear pajamas wear something decent but they have this and they consider considered to be something nice knowledge but it is Haram knowledge that Allah does not approve of and you're sinful for doing it"
