  "transcript": "we stopped last session at the timing of salatul jumuah and that the majority of scholars say that the timing of salat al-jumu'ah is the same as salat except for the hamburi school of thought where they say that it can be offered earlier but they go to an extreme where they make the time which it can begin similar to the time of raid and this is too extreme and there is no evidence backing it up and that sheikh bin baz and even i mean say that it is possible to before the whole time according to the authentic hadiths such as hadith of jabber please with a man with with his father's muslim and elsewhere"
