  "title": "Can I go out with non hijabi women in public It may be tough pill 2 swallow for them assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in the U.S except Allah so I know in general it's Haram to go out with family members who don't wear proper Islamic clothing but what are the principles and respect to this let's say someone has family members who aren't practicing at all and feel like this would be a tough pill for them to swallow and also feels like this would help them be a bit more comfortable around them um and it would be easier for them to give them dollar at the end of the day I'm accountable for my actions I don't care about how people feel and whether they can swallow it uh well or not I follow my religion if I'm a hijabi if I'm an akabi and my cous or my sis or relatives of mine want to go out wearing nothing virtually not hijab not covering their hair wearing perfumes I would be endorsing their sins and I would be tarnishing the reputation of hijabis exactly like when you see a hijabi or a nikhabi in a a talent show or a concert attending a concert or listening to music or watching a movie these people are damaging the image of Islam you still don't know where hijabi you know you're not a hijabi if you're attending such filth and such uh sinful places so don't care about what people say or think or believe or the impact of Your Action upon them think about what pleases Allah"
