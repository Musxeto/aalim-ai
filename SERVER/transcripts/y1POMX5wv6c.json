  "transcript": "um you know the islam so that you will cut out and stand up and do the like moderate prayer so should i leave before that they're there and pray at home or what should i do in that case the vast majority of scholars say that offering winter in the same format as maghrib prayer is not permissible and they have a hadith which was authenticated by at half of the bin hajj may allah have mercy on his soul and other scholars only the hanafi school of thought go against this so if you were to go and pray in a hanafi masjid and the imam who's most likely is a layman doesn't know he just follows what his forefathers found and he prays witter exactly like he prays maghrib what should we do as followers scholars say that we should follow the imam and the sin is on him if any and there's no sin on us because our imam follows a reputable school of thought and he has his ishti had if he believes that this is the right thing to do then as his congregation we must follow him and our reward will be complete inshaallah"
