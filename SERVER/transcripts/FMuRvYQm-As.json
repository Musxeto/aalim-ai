  "transcript": "philippines says what's your ruling on learning boxing so learning the sport itself is halal aspiring or fighting is haram why because what is the intention of boxing it's not self-defense it's inflicting harm to your opponent and specifically to the head area and the prophet asam has prohibited hitting the face totally not even in wars you must avoid whether he's a muslim and non-muslim avoid the face so boxing is revolving around strengthening the face the head whether it's a jab it's a combination is this a ja or that this is totally prohibited to practice but to work out to learn it to uh do the ropes and and to hit the the bag boxing bag and do the drills and know how to move here and there to avoid to to dodge punches etc yeah this is permissible so if you want to learn self-defense there are other mmas other sports jiu-jitsu aikido and the rest of the things that would teach you how to self-defense without engaging in actual harming your opponent on regular basis or on competitions learning this is permissible insha'allah you"
