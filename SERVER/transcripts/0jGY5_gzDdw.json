  "transcript": "on behalf of reliance allahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad and El Alamein Sayyidina Muhammadan while he was happy human data be happy or send a mission that he needed a human D a maverick assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said 'man is 60-plus in another narration seventy plus branches the highest is la ilaha illallah the lowest is removing harmful things from people's way and bashfulness or al haya is part of the branches of Eman now you may ask yourself the topic is a tower cool did the Sheikh make a mistake and prepared something about a higher and bashfulness this is why he started the talk with this no and Allah do I have it if you want we can change the topic any time you wish why did I begin with this beautiful Hadees so many times we talk about Eman and that we are believers we are movement and we think that we have accomplished and attained these branches of the man which is not the fact scholars have listed or tried to list these branches of 'man mmm in Hollis Palani may Allah have mercy on his soul the compiler and the author of the great book Fat Albert official historical Buhari he listed these branches and he said there are 24 branches related to the heart seven branches related to the tongue and 38 related to the actions of the body because a man is what one believes by his heart otters with his tongue and axe with his limbs and organs so in order for us who always claim that we have the al-qaeda we are from ala sunnah wa-l jama'a we are Salafi s we are a low hadith we are people who are on the Sunnah of the Prophet Elisha it is important to check whether these branches are fulfilled in us or we only talk we have to see if we can walk the talk or not so one of the greatest attributes and forms of worship of the heart is a tower : and this is what most of us lack nowadays but what is at our code first of all if you read the Quran and I hope you do every day and finish it at least once a month you will find where I don't know - yet they were telling what they were killed in allaha yuhibbu motive appeal in whatever car ilaha il-allah i would so many times Allah is telling us over and over again to have to work on so Allah says so worship Him and put your trust in him you're a man cannot be fulfilled cannot be complete without having full tawakkal allah says and upon allah rely meaning after what cool if you should be believers because if you do not have total reliance and dependence on allah you are not a believer and a beautiful word or a phrase every one of us memorizes by heart has swooned Allah everybody knows this in Saudi in Jeddah where I come from when I have a dispute with the brother nurse it has to be a la una Milwaukee he gets angry why why are you making good against me I'm not making dua you just simply don't understand what the word means Allah Azza WA JAL says sufficient for us is Allah and he is the best disposer of affairs this is the meaning of Hasbun Allah WA Nimal wakil therefore it is not a door it is a declaration of dependence on Allah and this beautiful phrase was set by two great men by Ibraheem and by our prophet salallahu alaihe wa was in them Ibrahim said it peace be upon him when imagine at the age of 16 he destroyed their idols they plotted to throw him in the inferno in the fire so they built this great fire that took them one month and when they threw him he simply said Hasbun Allah WA Nimal wakil with this phrase Allah transformed the fire into something that is cold and peaceful it could have been transferred into something that was cold but people died out of coldness so Allah made it cold but peaceful banana rookery but then was LM an animal Rahim so this was the first man the second man was the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam after the Battle of hood which was on what year of hijra 458 which he the best answer will ever ask such a question long time ago when was a hood it was on the third year of hijra after the CBD feet of the Muslims when 70 were martyred of them and they were tired they were injured they were out of power what happened when the idol worshippers went back to Mecca in the middle of the way they said you didn't do anything let us go back and annihilate them once and for all so one or two came to the Prophet s salaam and his companions while they were really tired and trying to bury their martyrs etc and they said to them that the people have gathered for you that they are about to attack you the Prophet as salaam should have been intimidated the muslims should have been afraid because they are tired injured outnumbered but the Prophet said has Spoonamore venir mal wakil family boo banana metal minima he was humble lamium some soup so they returned with a grace of allah azzawajal and favor that nothing came to them because once these people went back to the idol worshippers and they told them that muhammad and those with him are not afraid and they will eat you alive they were terrified and they went back to maqam when you have trust in Allah Azza WA JAL when you depend on Allah everything in this universe comes to your service because Allah created everything in this universe and it goes by his order but what is how a cool now the presenters Allah has said tehuac√°n tawakkal in arabic is a verb so I would tell you - what color Allah yelling you go and depend and rely on Allah the noun is tell what cool so Arabic is very important and very delicate when you put the vowels in the right place or the wrong place you have a problem and one of this is an Arabic so I hope you understand it but it just came to my mind one of the reciters with reading in surat al-baqara so he recited whether to me who and what a tanky who and mushrikeen had a yoke minim the is whether to me home mushrikeen hat aluminum do not give in marriage to the male disbelievers until they believe you do not give your daughter's your sisters your women until in Arabic Putin Kehoe to give your daughter to someone thankee who to do the verb yourself to do the nikah yourself a man goes to a woman so the reciter made a mistake so he said well I thank you for MU Shekinah had two young men you do not have intercourse with male idol worshippers until they believe so one of the Arab was in the Salah said well even if they believe we will not have intercourse with them you crazy homosexuality so one single foul makes problems and this is a narration they say that after this mistake Roemer may allah be pleased with him ordered some of the tabi een to put the vows on the words of the Quran because real Arab knows it without the not even without the dotting but people who come afterwards and some say no it was a head judge who order SS for the dually to do it anyway but this is something to highlight the importance of the Arabic language the Arabic word so what is tell what cool tell what good is the noun dependence reliance and having full trust in Allah what is it actually there are many many many interpretations and definitions among them the most likely to be understood is the true dependence on allah azzawajal in attaining and getting what is beneficial and pushing away and protecting you from whatever is harmful whether in this dunya or the ocular so this is real to occur to have the dependence of your heart in allah azza wajal allah says in the quran romania tequila hire and the ho maharaja and whoever fears allah he will make for him a way out and will provide for him from where he does not expect and whoever relies upon allah then he is sufficient for him if you believe in this you're the happiest man on earth once you believe that my trust in allah azza wajal would facilitate everything when I fear Allah Allah will make the whole world come to my service when I depend on Allah so that he will provide me from means I had never anticipated and this is why some of the Salif says allah azza wajal mandated upon himself what allah mandated that whoever relies on him Allah would suffice him and whoever believes in him Allah will guide him and whoever lens meaning giving charity to him he will reward him and whoever trusts him he will save him and whoever calls him he will answer him this is something that a lama dated upon himself we know this theoretically but when it comes to practice this is when we are exposed as long as we are healthy as long as we have a good job as long as we don't have any debts upon us and nobody's asking us for something we are the best of worshipers our heart is filled with tranquility and Eman and Marshall good believers the moment we tested the moment our trust and cocoon on Allah is put on the line he is where we are exposed and here is where allah azzawajal makes our feet steadfast among all those for those whom Allah bestow his favors and blessing upon if you look as stated earlier in the Quran it is filled with examples with orders with instructions to trust allah azza wajal likewise in the Sunda the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam told us that those who trust Allah and depend upon him will enter paradise without any reckoning or any punishment of direct non-stop the Prophet says are a solution there will be seventy thousands of my Ummah who will enter paradise without any reckoning and without any punishment no torment the Companions said who are they oh prophet of Allah the prophet described them to us he said they are the one who do not cauterize what is cauterization alkane when you warm or heat a piece of metal and then you put it on specific areas of your body usually in the or under the knees this is called alkane and it is one of the three forms of healing in Islam though it is not recommended but the Prophet had approved it and he had performed it upon side the venom on earth may Allah be pleased with him when he was bleeding for a whole month and the Prophet told us are they sought or sir if healing we're to be in anything it is in free a drink of honey this is prophetic medication ER for those who want medication from the Prophet and Salaam a what drink of honey a slice of copying you know cupping when they cut the below your neck or head and they suck the rotten blood this is a JAMA excellent for those who have migraines they have joint pains if you do it once every three months to six months it's excellent three cauterization from the Prophet that is a lustrum prophetic pharmacy so they do not cut your eyes done' do not ask others to give them rukia you have to understand this point before I proceed if I come and you're sick and I say I'd like to recite Rocio so you no no no stop stop stop I want to be among the 70,000 you're wrong because I volunteering to do it no problem you doing it for yourself no problem but you coming to me this takes you out of the 70,000 is it Haram no it's not Haram but it is a degree lower than full reliance and dependence on a larger but it's hella someone has a problem and he needs someone to do Rukia no problem to ask but it is not the best thing to do so cauterization asking others for Rukia they do not believe in bad omens believing in bad omens goes against our cool I have an interview tomorrow morning I come out wearing my water arm I saw my tie and I go and I find a black dead cat on the doorway I'm Alice it's gone I see a ladder open I don't go from underneath why said no no this is this brings bad luck to you I see an accident I see anything and I believe in bad omens a paella to shake the Prophet citizen believing about omens is so this is number three and the fourth that they have their full trust full telecoil on allah azza wajal so if you have fully to encode on Allah this is carte blanche you will enter gender directly but the problem is who can guarantee that hysterical is a lot on Allah is full so how can I have full chemical analyzer oh Jenny the Prophet is telling us if you have true to what : Allah he will provide through you like he provides for the birds now the birds don't sit in their nests raising their wings saying oh Allah give me food give me food they go in the morning in they roam and they fly and they come in the evening with full stomachs so the prophet alayhi salat told us that the birds work so should you you have to go you're jobless what are you doing about it well I had nothing I'm just sitting there and praying to Allah grant me a good job grant me a good job this is not sufficient on the other hand someone is saying that from fetcher telesia I'm knocking on all doors and I call people and my heart is connected to Abdullah or Mohammed or Ahmed because it's not what you know it is business it's not what you know it's who you know workforce does not rely on your experience nowadays if you have PhDs you have long experience CV not important it's who you know I know I met the cousin of Abdullah the sister of the driver of the prince Paula you're the next CEO so you have this in between the people either they depend entirely on Allah but they don't work or they work hard with their hearts related to their work and not to Allah and I'll give you an example my child fell sick what is the first thing I do take him to the hospital the doctor the emergency room and I'm eager or doctor the temperature is 40 he's in pain please do something after the doctor does the lab reports the x-rays and the whole nine yards I pay 1,500 reals for these tests and he gives me panadol or tempera after that I say okay I will redraw here I will next door subhanAllah where was this in the beginning true dependence on allah azzawajal puts a larger priority my child is sick I do rakia I make my food then I take the means by taking the child to the hospital not the other way around and when the doctor is giving and prescribing I feel comfortable with allah azza wajal not because of the doctor said this or that and my heart is related to the surgeon or to whatever no this is to tell what cool and this is why allah azza wajal if he wanted can't Allah give us risk while we were sitting on the chair oh who said no shoot him no yes TIF he can give us risk without doing anything but he ordered us to do something and this is why if you look at noon allah azza wajal made him give terror to his people for nine hundred and fifty years and after that Allah declared and mandated and decreed that there will be a flood to overtake the whole earth but he ordered no to what to build an ark what would that Ark made of wood no steam engines no the Titanic was sunk what would the ark of new do yet he built it and with all these waves that are higher than mountains he was saved and those with him because Allah wanted him to trust Allah but at the same time take the necessary means look at Yahoo Yahoo is the Sun off it's hot he's happy the son of ibraheem yeah hope the father of joseph yeah cool when his son child came to him he said I saw a vision you know the Sun and the moon and the planets were prostrating to me he said do not tell your siblings they will pot for you when they went to Egypt to retrieve their brother and to get more food he told them enter from what different doors because if you all 11 of you come from one door be whistle wow these are siblings for one man and one wife what is this rabbit mashallah and they're all strong and beautiful and handsome in knowledge if the father is a a prophet the grandfather is prophet their grand grandfather is a prophet and their brother is a prophet so he told them he's taking the means so that they won't get an evil eye this comes from Allah Miriam came later Imran is pregnant about to deliver she is taking shelter under a palm tree allah azzawajal is telling her to shake the bank of the tree the trunk sorry the trunk of the tree of the palm tree and then it will drop right dates 20 of you come with me and take the trunk of a palm tree can you move it one single centimeter no way so how this pregnant woman is capable of doing this and having life breaks they come on her this is taking the means of allah if we wished it would have happened like when the korea came to maryam which she was in her praying home every time he comes he finds food maryam and Nawrocki harder we did you get this Allah Allah if he wishes he can gives you without you asking look at Musa Pharaoh is behind him and the whole army is attacking with a group of the Jews if Allah wanted he could have crossed the sea in Hamas yet Allah tells him hit with your staff the sea and it will be split into two the boy hit the staff if we get stuffs and we go to the corniche hitting the rocks when we have anything we'll only have mice coming out and they're as big as small Lions in the cognition so this is not something that we can do it is from Allah to take the means it's a lesson for us to learn this is not only for messengers one would say yeah yeah this is a miracle all messengers and prophets of Allah they have certainty in their heart because Allah has revealed to them this is even to normal people Hodja she was a concubine a slave given to Sarah the wife of Ibrahim by the king the tyrant king who tried to seduce Sarah and Sarah made Dora and the guy had seizure and froze was paralyzed I will not touch you believe me just call Allah to release me she calls Allah he was released he attempted it twice then he attempted a third time and then he said Hamas this is a devil this is not a human being send her away with her husband or with her brother who claims to be her brother and he gave her a Hodja she's so Haj if she gave her to Prophet Ibrahim Prophet Ibrahim took her as his concubine and she was pregnant with his mail she gave birth to his money Abraham was about 80 years of age the first child to the idea to have he gets an instruction from Allah so just take your concubine or your wife and the child and go to Mecca from Iraq to Mecca so he goes no questions asked and no Google map it's why he went there directly and Roger is looking there's no people there's no camps no tents no cities no water well no springs no plants and he placed her in Mecca and turned his back and walked away she said brahim who are you leaving us for he did not reply Ibrahim you're leaving us in an area with there's no plants no water no animals nothing he does not reply and keeps on walking she said is it Allah who ordered you to do this and he said yes look at the whole she said then leave Allah will not let us down if I leave my wife in the car and go to pray in the masjid she comes I come back and I find her screaming what's wrong you put the car next to the trash can and there are cats fighting makes it a scene out of it because cats are fighting and this great woman with full terror : Allah Allah what was the reward of her tehuac√°n she was the master or the mistress of that area few hours later she has Zamzam water where she drank from few days later a tribe of joram nomads coming asking permission to live in that area and now we have what we have Makkah we have Samsung tower we have the clock we have everything because of trusting Allah if you trust a lot the whole world would be in your hands if you do it for the sake of allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala and this is similar to the victories the Prophet had got out of his awesome in his battles Allah says in the Quran and you did not kill them but it was Allah who killed them in the Battle of better he takes some pebbles and he throws it at the Army says shahe tell mucho and they were blinded they could not see and they were defeated in a matter of minutes this is not you this is not black magic this is Allah when you are with Allah and then you have nothing to fear now allah azza wajal is not asking us to have to walk alone him Allah is ordering us it's not a choice it's not how to do say hmm yeah today I don't feel like having to acquit I'm just not gonna depend on my power my knowledge my strength my connections my contacts but maybe next month no this is not a choice Allah says in the Quran owatta what Cal I'll hi a little area mooch and rely upon the everliving who does not die who doesn't die everyone dies except allah azzawajal so if you have full to work on him there is nothing for you to fear and as I said the essence of tobacco is to connect your heart to Allah with humility with submissiveness and feeling ashamed of your sins when you're doing this with allah azza wajal now look at the prophet alayhi salat son and we have a commercial break just a little Brazilian chicken do they sell it or they stopped they still sell plastic because Marshall I feel like a Brazilian chicken with the air conditioning well when I came last time it was so hot the air conditions were not working now I feel mashallah and it is something wrong so I was wondering do you have something stored here or yeah this was for the brothers were sleeping to wake them up now coming back to having trust of Allah lead ski masks and he is good masha'Allah look at the way of the Prophet that is awesome did he have to work or when he wanted to make Hydra from Makkah to Madinah who's with you Allah Hollis go what did he do he took all the necessary preparation and precautions one he instructed that two rides camels with food to be prepared outside of Makkah he hired a guide who knows the ins and outs for the routes to Medina he had ready may Allah be pleased with him sleep in his bed so even if someone was watching he would look and he would find someone lying in the bed so this is camouflage in his work and even after taking all the precautions the idol worshipers reached him they were in the cave and they were standing next to them Abu Bakr was intimidated was afraid o prophet of Allah if they were to look underneath their feet they would see us what did the Prophet say as Salam then in namaha Marana what do you think of to Allah the third who can come next to us who can even touch us yet he took the necessary means and precautions had him l Nasim may Allah have mercy on his soul they told him you are one of the great scholars who have taqwa on Allah what did you base your tehuac√°n on among the phrases he said he said that I have the conviction the belief that my RISM no one will eat except me do you have this belief huh is it possible that Allah decreed for you a job they create for you some wealth to come your way and somebody comes and said nope I'll take this is it possible yeah it is impossible if you go every morning from your home with this trust in your heart filling it that I'll knock on old doors but my heart is hanging at the doors of allah azza wajal if Allah wants you it will open if not hamdulillah Allah is with me wallah he you will have the whole world in your hand because this is content this is happiness this is the what : true torkoal allah azza wajal now anyone who seeks RISM from other than the means that Allah had permitted has zero to occur so if you go to a shop this is a supermarket masha'Allah you have dates you have mushrooms you have soft drinks you have fruits and vegetables and groceries very good old Helen but why are you selling cigarettes he says if I don't sell tickets customers will not come does he have to work good impossible he says yeah but this is good for business but it is bad for your Eman Allah has made this Haram and you are claiming that risk will not come except through Haram means which means that you have a problem when you find someone working hard in a halal job but he is skipping Salah why well we have a meeting what is more important the horse a lot as a salat or your meeting yes but this meeting happens only once every two days oh honey you pray one day and skip one day see all the managers the directors so you have a problem with your tower code when someone deals with Haram deals with RIBA deals with bribery I know a lot of companies and people in the purchasing procurement or in the sales they say we have to under the table okay we don't have tables anymore it's direct people don't give under the table they give you this is the contract and this is my invoice and you give me 25% of the invoice first but right 25% more no under the table and everything is Masha Allah subhanAllah then how can you have to work with it if i don't do this i will not get jobs i will not get a contract don't get the contract no problem work something else but because you have been used to a standard of living and a certain salary or income you are not willing to jeopardize it you are willing to jeopardize your Deen your toach : Allah but not willing to jeopardize anything of your risk why do people cheat I taught English in a foreign school in a public school as a foreign language for 15 years and they used to call me tank hunters tank hunter because I used to I can tell if someone is cheating and I immediately expose him and cancel his examination gave him zero she has to repeat the year I was ruthless when it comes to cheating I would tell them if my father were to be alive and he cheats will lie I will flank him so before giving them the papers I would say you will claim that your young sister put something in your pocket check your pockets you'll claim that your brother wrote something on your hand where you will asleep check it before I give you the papers because if I catch something with you I'm gonna flank you I'm gonna give you zero and you're out what I used to do this regular basis handle em but people cheat 40% of them in schools cheat why because they don't have trust in Allah they don't have dependence on Allah the Eman is weak and you can say this when you have a contractor building a wall the amount of cement the amount of steel etc you can tell this when a person is working 9:00 to 5:00 where his productivity in these eight hours is actually 45 minutes this is the study about Saudi and the Gulf area in the working hours the actual productivity and working is 40 to 45 minutes the rest is full and Tami's in some massive Maliki and probably sometimes we would eat the pear which is liver and kidneys and very nice but not this is not the time for it so this means that we have a problem when we don't have full trust in Allah we start to lie we start to cheat we start to bend the rules if not break them but if we have full trust in allah that he is our Creator that he is our provider that he is alone the one who gives life and takes life that he is alone the causer of harm and the bringer of benefit that he is alone the one who brings people down and the exalted subhanahu wa'ta'ala horrible affair that he is the only one that is the constructor and the expander al cabone well bassett if we have full trust that Allah is like this and that everything is in his hands and that nothing happens on earth without his permission if we have full trust and dependence on allah azza wajal then we will not ever see people cheat or get bribed we will never see people rush to rockies asking them for repair because of evil eye because of black magic because of sorcery because of jinn possession they trust Allah they depend on Allah did not go to people to have this on them and this is why we if we claim to have the good luck in the sound Rokita we have to check we have to cross examine our Tower code is it sincerely and truly upon allah azza wajal or not heard of allah who Adam when especially will merely he Aslam I pray to Allah Allah that he grants me I knew the full trust reliance and dependence upon allah azza wajal and to make us among those whom he loved in allaha yuhibbu al-mutawakkil in so I pray store I pray to Allah that he makes us among those whom he loves through our Torah code Allahu Alem when is material meaning Aslam o sallallahu wasallam barik ala nabina muhammad you"
