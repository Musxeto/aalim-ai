  "transcript": "if the prophet sleeps like humans definitely he has to wake up like humans as well and the prophet Alat wasam pattern of sleeping was the best so for example he used to sleep in the beginning of the night after Isa prayer and then wake up at the end or just at the third uh uh last third of the night and pray whatever he could and either waited until fuder or slept for one sixth of the remaining night and then woke up for f so that was almost the best for his body and whenever he woke up from sleep he used to say alhamdulillah so he would say it is all praise due to Allah Asel who resurrected that resurrected us after our death and to him we shall return and whenever he woke up he started with the following number one he used to use the sewak or the miswak to purify his mouth and to change the bad smell or odor in it then he used to perform M and when we wake up in the middle of the night there is a certain sequence ofar that we say for example we've said this before and then you ask Allah for forgiveness and then you make Dua as much as you want because Allah will answer your Dua this is the moment you wake up in the middle of the night also the Sunnah is that you perform M so the first thing is that when you go to bed you go in the state of w if you wake up in the middle of the night the prophet saysat when you go to bed at night say ties three knots at the back of your head telling you you have a long night keep on sleeping so if the individual wakes up and remembers Allah by saying thear Etc the prophet says one knot is untight so if he makes W the second knot is untied and if he prays the third and final knot is untied so when he wakes up he wakes up strong agile and feeling good when you wake up the prophet saysat do not dip your hand in the bucket the moment you wake up you wash your hands three times because you don't know where your hands had spent the night and also he tells us to R our noses and blow them three times because the devil has slept at our nostrils and there are so many many duas to be stated and to be read the prophet used to wake up and in the middle of the night and he used to recite the last uh 10 verses ofah Al Iman uh before he goes from his bed and he used to wipe his face to shake off the sleep on it and the prophet used to sayat that woe to those who recite these 10 ay and does not contemplate upon them wo to him woe to him so it is a huge benefit benefit to us to follow this sequence of what the prophet used to do when waking up the amount of the we say the amount of Dua and invocation and supplication knowing that Allah will answer us because the prophet told usat this great Dua then you ask Allah for whatever Dua you want Allah will answer you this is a promise from the prophet alham however rarely you will find people succeeding in saying it the moment they wake up because a lot of us the first thing they do is check up up check on upon their uh uh emails or WhatsApp messages or whatever they scroll down up and down in their mobiles and they totally forget to say these AAR"
