  "title": "Can our soul identify what is right & wrong based on ayahs 7-10 of surah Al Shams? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "but allah clearly mentioned in uh verses number seven eight nine ten allah says what does that inspired it allah guided it to do what's good and to do what's bad according to the knowledge otherwise why would allah send us messengers and scriptures allah could have left us all go so we go to america we go to china we go to anywhere where in the world and we don't need quran we don't need sunnah because we have the inner compass that tells us right and wrong this is not the case so the soul is unable as i said in my previous answer to determine what is right and what is wrong yes there are few universal things that all people have if they're fitra if their nature is pure everyone kafir or a muslim know that killing others is not good stealing money is not good abusing people is not good this is inner futra nature but there are people with corrupt nature and they would think that no it's okay if i can gain money by stealing it from people why not who says it's wrong so this have to understand that this is sharia we have to abide by it it dictates whether this is right or wrong whether this is good or bad and allah knows best"
