  "title": "At what age should girls start wearing the hijab? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sumaya says what is the proper age for girls to observe the hijab we've answered this before but again we will answer it insha'Allah a girl is accountable once she reaches the aja of puberty the age of puberty is known by one of four signs one of them is sufficient if a girl reaches the age of 15 or if a girl's has nocturnal emission or if a girl's grows the pubic hair that signifies she has reached adulthood or when she gets her menses either one of these four characteristics or signs this would be sufficient for a girl to be called as an adult and she has to immediately wear the Fallujah before that she's not accountable however scholars say that part of training her to wear the hijab that we should do this too maybe three years earlier and not to be strict into it so if she is averaged 11 or 12 to reach the age of puberty to get her menses then we should train her when she's 10 when she is 9 when she's about this age to wear the hijab and of course in these couple of years she would be coming out with her hair coming out maybe wearing something that is childish and revealing or said take it easy it's not a must but not only that if and this is the second reason for us to make her wear the hijab if she blossoms before the age of puberty sometimes you find a girl that is 12 or 13 years of age and she looks like a 7 or 8 years of age doesn't draw attention does not radiates any kind of feelings in men's hearts she's a child but sometimes you find a girl that is 7 or 8 years of age and she's well-built and she looks like a young woman now she's a child but the Predators out there men who are looking don't see her like a child so for their protection and hers were ordered to make her wear the hijab if not as strict as an adult at least so that we could conceal her from the eyes of such predators and from the eyes of normal men with weak Eman who do not lower their gaze or understand so I think this is sha Allah answers your question"
