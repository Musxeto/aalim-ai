  "title": "During Taraweeh can I recite Ayahs in Arabic & then read translation in my language for Khushu Assim",
  "transcript": "confirm from India says and this is a frequently asked question I don't know Arabic I can read Arabic they say so is it permissible while praying taraweeh to recite the arabic quran and then read the translation in english or in my native language so that i would understand what i'm reciting or reading now my question to you when you read the translation are you reading something prescribed in salat there's no so it is almost like if you open a book of cear√° and you read while in salat what the Prophet did erase a lot Sam on the Battle of Badr would that be okay that's definitely not this is out of the range of the salat likewise reading the translation is out of the range of the salat you're including in the salat something that is not part of it so this does nullify your prayer and your prayer is not accepted so what to do you can recite outside of the prayer the verses you're going to recite in salat and read the translations so that you can understand the meaning and once you're in salat you only read it in Arabic and I hope this answers your question"
