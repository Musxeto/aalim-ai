  "transcript": "like Peyman snomint allahi al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he wore a surah he navy anna muhammadan wine he was a ph my mother assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh chapter 78 Surat and never and whatever comes after it it is all known to be part of Zhu Zhu and or Zhu Zhu and never the first surah is surah - never the surah that deals with the great incident or news and this particular juicer now what is meant by Joseph the scholars have divided the Quran into 30 parts now the Quran is composed of 114 chapters beginning with chapter 1 al-fatiha and ending with chapter 114 all are adorableness surah - nos so we have 114 surah and this translate surah into a chapter and the Quran itself is divided into 30 Jews 30 parts that may include one or more suitors and some sewers may include one or two parts like for example surah al-baqarah chapter 2 it has more than one drizzle in it now if you look at this the last juzu the last part which is surah number 78 onwards until hundred and fourteen this is known as juzu 30 and it's well known among the Muslims because it's the last and it's the easiest to memorize so the majority of Muslims have not all memorized it by heart and they call it and this surah surah 78 is known as surah - never it has 40 verses to it and the surah is Maki and what do we mean by Maki well scholars of the sciences of Quran which is a separate science the sciences of the Quran is a science that deals with the related events surrounding the Quran so it deals with the abrogated verses of the Quran when it was revealed where it was revealed what is meant by the general verses and the specific verses it deals with the Kira art and the difference between them so when we look at this surah and never chapter 78 we see that it is Maki what is Maki scholars divided the chapters of the Quran into McKey and Medina and what is meant by McKee and Medina Maki is related to Mecca Medina is ready to Medina and we know that the Prophet on racism lived most of his life in Mecca when he was at the age of 40 revelations started until he was 53 years old he was ordered then to migrated to Medina where he spent the following 10 years and he died when he was 63 years of age sallallahu alayhi wasallam so the scholar said that whatever was revealed before the migration this is called McKee and whatever was revealed after the migration to Madeira this is called Madame and each one has its specific characteristics and they are different to one another some scholars even went on to say that the McKee is whatever was related to the location whether it was before or after the migration and the money was as well but this is not the most authentic opinion of scholars some say that it depends on who it was addressing but again this is a weak opinion the most authentic is what was before migration this is called McKee and what was after migration this is known as maddening what are the benefits of knowing what is McKee and what is maddening well first of all it gives you a better understanding of the interpretation and the explanation of the Quran when you know that these verses are addressing the disbelievers are addressing the idol worshipers and it's different if it was in Medina then it was addressing the Muslims in general or specifically the Jews and the Christians so it's different and among the benefits that we know which verse abrogates the other so if a verse was revealed in Mecca and then few years later another verse was revealed in Medina and we're not able to combine and join them together then we know that the latter abrogated the first one and this is mentioned in the Quran abrogation is part of the Quran because Allah Azza WA JAL reveals verses in accordance to the situation of the recipients for example we know that the Arabs were so into wine they loved wine so allah azza wajal with his kindness and mercy did not prohibit wine immediately it was prohibited on three different situations so the last one abrogated the - in the beginning so the first one stated that the people ask you about gambling and toxicants tell them that there are benefits in it and a lot of harm and the harm is far greater than the benefits so it didn't tell them don't do it but it gave them a hint then another verse came where Allah told them not to pray while in the state of intoxication so now okay then there are times that we can drink which is after Asia problem because from Asia prayer to the Fajr prayer it's like seven or eight hours maybe 10 hours well this is a long time to become sober and then the last stage where Allah said that this is work of Shaitaan you should refrain from intoxicants it's completely prohibited so abrogation is there in Quran so one of the advantages of knowing which is Maki and which is Metheny to know the timings and then we could tell that this latter one is the one that abrogates the others also to know that the history of the revelation and how it was gradual and how the Sharia law was given to us in this form of segmentation if you wish or in coming in parts it also tells us that there are different ways of giving Dawa so giving dower to idol worshippers is not like giving Dawa and calling those who are Muslims there are different means and methodologies and subjects to focus on I cannot go to a university and talk to them without evidences that appeal to their logic while if I go to my congregation all what I have to say is this is what Allah says and they take it for granted and they are accepted so you have to be selective and this shows you that when addressing the people of Mecca it was different than addressing the other people of Medina and it also gives us a glimpse of the biography of the Prophet era so somehow he managed to live in Mecca and how he managed to live in Medina and it also gives us light on how the Quran was preserved and how the scholars managed to document each and every stage of the revelation of the Quran and by this they know what was revealed in winter what was revealed in summer what was revealed in Makkah what was revealed in Medina what was revealed in the expeditions of the Prophet Ostrom etc now there are specific characteristics of Makkah Sora's so certain neba is a matka surah so what are the characteristics of the Mecca sewers how can we differentiate between Maki's and madness if we did not know when they will reveal scholars gathered few points not entirely 100% fitting all the mecca sewers but in general it is so they say that every surah that has an oath where Allah so gel swears with something and Allah says wash em see what oh haha by the Sun and the daylight a less wearing so all sewers that have an oath then this is Maki every saw that has Cala which is named then this is a Maki surah surah that begins with disjointed letters and if me Mara Haim etc shooters which have a verse of prostration and we know that there are number of sewers that you recite a verse and there is a sign saying that you have to prostrate for recitation stories of the prophets except chapters to al-baqarah it has stories our prophet but other sewers these are all in the Macan period beginning with all you people yeah Yunus so this is a sign that it is mceachern all sewers that begin with a humm do so we have surah al-fatiha we have surah al-kahf we have seward father etcetera surah al-anam all of these begins with a hampt then this is a maki surah as scholars say now does this surah have any abrogated verses of the Quran and the answer is no it is a surah that has no obligation in it what so ever so what is the general theme of the surah the surah speaks about this great news that allah azza wajal has sent so it is addressing the great news and never and what is and never what is the great news that they are asking one another and they are arguing about well this is what we will find after the break inshaallah so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back so what is the general theme of the surah in the beginning it speaks about the disbelievers and how they are inquiring and asking about the great news and then it moves on to talk about the day of judgment the day of reckoning and also it talks about a las great favors and blessing upon his servants and then it talks about the day of judgment the day of separation and what is the result of disbelieving and what is the a'dope of the disbelievers and what they will suffer of torment and at the same time it concludes with what the believers would be rewarded with on the day of judgment and how the disbeliever would wish on that day that he was nothing and that he was not created so let us begin with verse 1 a lot of almighty says I'm and this translates to the meaning of what are they asking one another now when we have such a question is Allah asking us definitely not because Allah those are those so in Arabic there are different types of questions some of them are rhetorical some of them are to draw your attention some of them are to give information through asking you a question so it's like saying to someone who does something wrong and inappropriate are you crazy I'm not expecting an answer to be yes or no I'm telling him you are crazy so in the sense when Allah is saying I'm a attesa alone what are they asking one another about so this is a question that brings the people's attention so when I hear such sequester's it hmm what are they asking one another about this is an interesting question okay what is the answer the answer is I need never allow Veeam they are asking one another about the great news and what is meant by the great news now the quran one of its beautiful attributes is that it is in arabic and it can carry more than one meaning for the same thing but bear in mind that the general theme of the quran the majority of the verses of the quran have one meaning everyone understands these meanings there is a portion of the Quran that has more than one meaning yet these meanings are an evidence of the diversity of the Quran not any contradiction or conflict in Arabic is the same thing because one thing could mean two or three or four things but they do not contradict or conflict rather they go in the same line for example in surat al-fatihah we say do not show up on the mustaqim guide us to the straight path what is the straight path some say it is the Quran some say it is Islam and if you look into these two different meaning and it's different than Islam but they all go through the same stream so if you follow Islam you following the Quran and if you follow the Quran you'll fall into Islam so it's the same meaning so when we look at this great news and never that they are asking one another about what is it some interpreters and when we talk about interpreters we're referring to the school of thought now hold a minute what is the school of a math or can I register in that well it's not a school per se in the sense that it is a school of thought now when you come to tough Siro Quran you have two major schools one is a deaf ear will help those who only give the fear through a hadith or a narration and there is another tafseer which is the right which is by intellect and logic in a sense so at FC Erbil either means that I would not interpret a verse of the Quran unless the Prophet Isum interpreted it or the Companions or the tab you aim the students or the companions and these are the best of generations the Prophet said Alice or some high Peroni are me the best of generations is my generation and those who follow them and those who follow them so it's the generation of the prophets and the companions the tabby in the followers of the companions then tabby tabby in the followers of the followers of the companions these are the famous and most trustworthy and the best generation ever to walk the earth this is what the Prophet said RA salat wa salem this means that if you would like to explain or make a tough seer of aya let us see what the Companions said and who are the best of the Companions to give the fear of the Quran where we have abdullah al masud we have obey even a cat we have Ali bin Abi Talib on top of the list we have of the Lana bath and other great companions of the prophet Isis and the other school is what is known as a tough shield Bill Nighy they do not depend on the narrations but rather depend on other tools such as the Arabic language poetry poetry is the thing that preserves Arabic so to understand the meaning of words you have to go to the origin of the Arabs which is the poetry so they understand this with it and that is why there are levels of explaining and giving the fear of the Quran the best is the zero Quran the Quran the best way to understand the Quran is to explain it by itself so we will come to mention those of shala while going through what summer you apart a pyramid or a came apart what is a party Allah explains it in the third verse and nazma socket so we know that a natural socket is the tafseer of akbar and we will come to explaining this if we do not have a verse of the quran to explain this we move on to the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so when allah azzawajal talks about a particular thing for example on passing on the Sirat which is a bridge over Jahannam over hell and how would people pass on it verse in Surat Maryam were aiming kamila Larry Doha that each and every one will pass over Hellfire and I shall may Allah be pleased with her asked the Prophet Azam how is that and he explained that to her so now this is the prophetess and explaining the Quran with the Quran or him explaining the Quran with his own saying salah larsen if this is not possible then we go to the companions and if we don't find the explanation of the companions we go to the tavern and if not then we use the arabic language with the previous forms of tafseer so that we would get everything else into line so what are they asking about it is the great news so what is the great news some scholars say that it is the message of the Prophet or a sorcerer others say that it is the Quran and others say that is the Day of Resurrection and finally others say that it is the torment and the horrific events of the day of judgment and all are almost the same because what the Prophet came with his message is based on the Quran and the Quran is warning the people of the day of judgment and what they will face and it is also warning them about the horrific events that will take place on that day so there is no difference in all of these four things so this is what the disbelievers are arguing about and all prophets and messengers of Allah came with this message to establish worshipping allah azzawajal submission of each and every one's soul to the commands of Allah Azza WA JAL to know that there would be a day of reckoning and to tell the people that there would be heaven and that there would be hell this is all the time we have inshallah we will finish some of the beautiful verses of surah Tauba chapter 78 when we meet next until then fear Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
