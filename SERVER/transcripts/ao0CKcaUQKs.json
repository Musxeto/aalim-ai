  "transcript": "thank you so much for your help firstly um whenever i rang you i'm very grateful so my question is that i've i've told you about my difficulties at my um job with the prayers and you gave me some good advice and alhamdulillah i've been provided my dream job an interview for my dream job um i'm going to apply but during the application i was wondering is it permissible for me to listen to quran while writing i have to give a presentation a lecture may i listen to quran while i'm producing this lecture over the coming weeks while i prepare for the interview what is the purpose of the quran is it like background music um yeah i'll be listening to it sort of background music but just to help me when my attention diverts from the work i can focus on the quran as well my advice to you is not because quran is not background music it was revealed to be listened and adhered to with your ears and heart so just to play it in the background like we do in cars while driving and we're chit-chatting with the family and the reciter is reciting on the quran you stop it and say boys girls misses what is the reciting they said i don't know he's reciting the quran okay which chapter i don't know then why are we playing it oh for barakah no this is not permissible so if you're not listening to it turn it off and do your work once you feel bored or need to chill for a while stop what you're doing turn the quran listen to it tentatively and inshallah things would move on smoothly abdullah from kenya"
