  "title": "Ruling on interest through savings account - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh brother tajen has a question and he says that I uh that he has his money uh in a saving account in a bank and he receives interest from it currently he is taking the interest amount from the bank and giving it to the poor without expecting reward from Allah is this allowed uh or not please advise if you go to a bank usually according to what I know you have the choice of having a current account or a savings account a current account is an account that they give you a checkbook and you deposit the money you withdraw the money whenever you want as much as you want and they don't give you any interest on it a saving account is different it's an agreement between you and the bank that you save a certain amount of money and they would invest this money in their business or in any fashion they see fit and they would give you a fixed interest 1% 2% 5% dep depending on what they generate or what they agree with you if this is the case if the bank has these two accounts and you choose a saving account this means that you are dealing in riba this means that you have committed a major sin because the choice was yours you're the one who chose to open this bank account knowing that they will give you interest while you had the choice to open a current account with no interest so you wouldn't be dealing in riba if you open the current account but you chose not to in this case it is sinful for you to have this bank account and the interest you're getting definitely it would be logical that you give it away to the poor as a form of cleansing your money but you will not be rewarded for that and this would not exempt you from the punishment because you chose this and you decided to deal in riba now the the the second scenario is a different one and that is when you open a saving account because there isn't any other account there are certain countries and certain banks that don't have a current account or they merge the two it is a current account but at the same time they deposit or they give you interest on the money you have in their Banks whether you like it or not so if this is the scenario if this is the bank that does not give you the room or the opportunity to open a current account in this case what you're doing is right you take the interest and you dispose of it in means that are permissible as a form of cleansing your money not as a form of getting closer to Allah or seeking the theab or the reward from Allah the almighty now having said that I know that there are some Scholars that would say if it is an interest based Bank a a a a traditional andc conventional bank I know that whatever I depos deposit with them they will deal in riba with it they will lend it to people and they will get interest from them so if I decide to open a current account it would be as if I'm saying saying to them keep the interest for yourself and this would add to their wealth and would make them stronger and richer that is why I'm opening a saving account so that I would deprive them from this interest and I would utilize it in the goodness of humanity at the first glance this is a very noble cause but if you analyze it islamically at the end of the day on the day of judgment when you come and stand in front of Allah Asel and Allah is questioning you my slave my servant why did you open a saving account and charg interest for that what would your answer be would you say oh Allah I took the interest I dealt in riba but I paid the money for the poor and the needy this does not change the fact that you dealt in riba that your transactions were Haram which Allah forbade you from doing Therefore your noble cause is not going to help you because you did something wrong it's like someone saying that I have a noble cause of calling this beautiful lady to Islam she's not a Muslim so I will invite her for dinner and we will have this chat together for 3 4 hours maybe go to a nightclub but only for the sake of Allah I'm doing this so that I call her for Islam this is a noble cause but the method being used is Haram it's forbidden for you to do this to chat to to socialize to do all of these acts even if you have a noble cause it has to be in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah and that is why in numerous places in the Quran Allah says that those who believe and do righteous Deeds you can believe and have a noble cause but if the methods used are not proper and not in accordance with the Quran and Sunnah you would be sinful for doing this"
