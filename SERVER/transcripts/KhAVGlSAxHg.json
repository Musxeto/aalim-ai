  "transcript": "his second question is regarding custody and from his voice it's obvious that you've reached the age of puberty and it is up to you to choose between your mom and your dad and it's up to you to evaluate if you know that going back with your mom to the uk would be an irresponsible move that would have negative impact on your religious commitment definitely the uk is not a muslim country while malaysia is so many messages so many halal places and above all you can practice islam without anyone objecting because the upper hand is for muslims and for islam it's a muslim country nothing beats being in malaysia and living with the muslims so i would highly recommend and advise that you look where your religious commitment is more honored because if you say that if i stay in malaysia my father is not a practicing muslims he goes to shrines he drinks he brings girlfriends and it's a toxic environment he said no this is something that you have to weigh the pros and cons and definitely staying in a muslim country is your priority"
