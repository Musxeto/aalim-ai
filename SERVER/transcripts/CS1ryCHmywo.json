  "transcript": "is help from the philippines how do we control anger there is a number of video clips on my youtube and among them is to remember that anger is not something disliked in itself the consequences of anger is what is haram so what you say because of anger what you act according to your anger is what is haram and we have to look whether your anger is selective or all the time is it four wheel drive or rear wheel drive because some people anger only appears on their wives or children but he does not expose or show his anger to a policeman or to his boss at work or to someone who's 6'4 from brussels and he's full of muscles as they say no these guys are scary they can't they can punch back but your wife and children can't so such anger is not true anger and if you watch my videos inshallah you'll get the answer my food from you"
