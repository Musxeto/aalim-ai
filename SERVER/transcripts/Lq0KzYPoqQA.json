  "title": "Not celebrating Eid due to the situation in Palestine - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the prophet allah islam was afflicted by many calamities we know what had happened to him and to his companions in the battle of uhud where 70 of his companions were martyred his own uncle hamza may allah be pleased with him was mutilated and gutted was martyred we know what had happened to his companions in in bitter maruna and the cowardly assassinations of them yet despite all these calamities this did not stop the prophet alaihis was from being happy on the day of eid from allowing his wives and family to use the duff on the day of eid to sing songs and chant and play despite all of their calamities and tribulations and sadness which indicates to us the wisdom of the sunnah that a lot of the muslims don't know despite what is happening in palestine despite the atrocities despite the barbaric attacks over civilians whom a hundred years ago opened their homes to these refugees coming from east europe and from all over the world barefooted no clothes they took the men they hosted them in the middle of their houses only to be kicked out of their houses of their own houses by these refugees and now they're trying to kick them out of their own porches and now the owners of the land are becoming refugees and they're killing them and they're bombing them and they're putting them in a concentration camp as if they themselves were not in a concentration camp decades ago as they claim when we see this a lot of the muslims due to their ignorance say that we should not celebrate hate we should mourn the dead we should react to what's happening and this is not the way of the prophet alaihis salat the day of eid is a day of jubilation the day of eid is where you express your servitude your submissiveness to allah azzawajal through being happy through being grateful and expressing your gratitude to allah for completing the month of ramadan by doing this you are expressing your servitude to allah azzawajal tomorrow when everything is back to normal when the aid is over we can begin our mourning we can begin our relentless defense of the cause of our own brothers and sisters in palestine to expose such atrocities to expose such in gratitude of these zionists who took the place of the house owners and kicked them out and unfortunately the whole world is standing at their side against all the laws of the united nation against all norms so we have to balance these feelings according to the quran and to the sunnah and not just jump the gun and accuse people that you don't care about palestine you should not celebrate the eid you should not be happy we have our role model muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam to follow his example in sadness and in happiness in grief and in joy in comfort and hardship and by doing this inshallah we would strike the correct balance"
