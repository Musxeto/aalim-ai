  "transcript": "that we recite hopefully once a week at least and this is inah chapter 18 the Ayah is number 28 one Ayah if we were to spend hours talking about this Ayah it would not be enough but unfortunately it's our habit to skim over important things and focus and spend a lot of time over trivial things this is human nature unfortunately espe was addressing the prophet Ayah number 28 Allah commands his messenger sallallah alai wasam by [Music] saying it's composed of three sort of paragraphs so the first one would be and keep yourself patient oh Muhammad by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his face meaning out of sincerity for the sake of Allah now be or keep yourself patient patience is divided into three types as we all know to be patient on doing good deeds you need patience you need to be patient to wake up for fer prayer and make W with this in this cold weather and to walk from your home to the Masjid to attend the Salat in the congregation with the congregation nobody can do this seriously nobody can do do this except those who have huh patience because they're doing this seeking Allah's face so they have the energy so this is the first type of patience the second type of patience is to be patient not to do Haram and Haram is very easy to get because it is going downhill and always going downhill is the most easiest thing you just drop while climbing up is difficult and in this country and many other countries nowadays FNA is all over the place whether it is in buying a house in mortgage riba based loan one of the seven major sins in Islam sh but we have to live pay rent I've been paying rent for the past 40 years alhamdulillah for two houses not one foror me I don't have a property I don't have a house so what I'm pay I'm living no sh I have to have this condo it's been my dream and I have to have this 50 in uh uh TV screen and then I have to have the and automatic garage and and the whole nine yards well suit yourself so to be patient from doing Haram is also one of the types of being patient so much FNA outside for us men I'm a family man if you push me too far I just might so they say third type of patience is the patience on Allah's calamities and this I have nothing to do with because an earthquake took place a volcano a tornado a cafir country is bombarding us with bombs and killing our children and displacing our families what did I do nothing this is Allah's test for you what are you going to do be patient but again this is not our topic patience this requires an extensive explanation and elaboration so that you would understand what am I doing on Earth am I just supposed to work 9 to 5 commute 2 hours to job and back this is what Allah created me for Allah is testing you each one of us is being tested are you passing the test are you being patient suit yourself so Allah says and keep yourself patient by being being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening so what kind of patience is this number one number two or number three half an hour later what are we doing here guys it's it's not we haven't had lunch yet what type of the three patients is this number one to be patient upon upon doing good deeds so Allah is telling commanding his messenger and by default this command is for us to be patient so many times it's difficult for us to respond to an invitation of a friend to attend a talk or a Circle of Knowledge or a banquet for or which I'm obliged to uh respond to but I feel tempted to go elsewhere to attend a hockey match maybe some sports event maybe some Gathering that has Haram elements into it or watch a movie so this is the Temptation we are getting you have to be patient make yourself patient by being with those this command fits us as a glove in this cfir country if you neglect having buddies Muslim friends Society Community an environment that would you would hang out with be with people that would have your back it's not long before you go astray why this is human nature the prophet said a wolf would not attack the herd of sheep because they're together he waits until one of them sheep says I've had enough with these guys I'm going for a smoke and it drifts a little bit away from the congregation this is when the wolf attacks and likewise this is what Shan does if you're on your own Shan hits you the hardest but when you when you are with the Muslims with the community this is some this is some we have this we have that let's go play football together it's a Muslim environment you still belong you have this belonging you have this identity but when you don't you start drifting you start going astray tomorrow maybe do your hair like Mr T you shave it from the sides and I don't know what Tomahawk or what they call it whatever and then a few weeks later maybe a little earring looks cool in one ear not both huh so that they they don't mix you up then maybe you get a tattoo a little bit yeah The Bling blings mashah and whoa what is this and then you change your name huh from Muhammad to Mo mashallah everybody knows short for  anyhow so what is this you've lost your identity and this is dangerous you have to have people that have your back what are you doing Haram when we're eating you're eating with your left eat with your right okay I need someone to put me back on the straight path to remind me you're wearing the finger in the Haram finger you can't wear it in the index and the middle finger this is Haram I didn't know know that now you know and so on people tell me I haven't seen you for in in Sal for a couple of weeks watch out you're in danger last jum I didn't see you and and they remind you you remind them and you keep on doing this until you meet Allah in Jenna but if you don't you have a problem um seeking his face that is acceptance and for sincerity phrase number two and let not your eyes pass beyond them Desiring adornments of the worldly life they do but even if I go to Alaska I could do things you know I could uh yeah misbehave nobody knows me but here everybody knows me this is the difference what's driving you what's pushing you Affairs is is is ever in neglect so this is a description of an individual whom Allah told us not to obey what is this description so that we be aware from meeting such people and stay and keeping our distance from number one do not obey one whose heart we have made heedless of our remembrance so characteristic number one he does not remember Allah he does not make vick whenever you sit with him all what he talks talks about is worldly matters cars real estate interest rates movies music celebrities women partying anything that is worldly sometimes it's fun to sit with such people because we like spare time we like idle talk but it hardens your heart it's like quick sand the more you stand and try to move the further down you sink without you knowing it so Allah is telling you someone whose heart is heedless from my remembrance keep him out of the agenda keep him out of your contact list then the second characteristics and who follows his desire so someone whose Compass is not the Quran and the Sunnah he does things because his heart tells it tells him to do it he follows his desires and whims this is har yeah but it feels good yeah I have I'm having fun when doing it well it's an issue of dispute among Scholars everything is an issue of dispute among Scholars everything IB Jin one of the scholars and he was a linguist used to have a a seat like mine here and preach his people one day he had to go for an errand for half an hour so he asked his father to fill in his place so the father said I don't know what to answer people he said to him listen anyone who comes to you and asks you a question say there is an issue of dispute there are two opinions in it so a guy said sh I was in Rage and I said to my wife I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you three times in one setting it's an issue of dispute she I ate camel's meat should I perform W it's an issue of dispute she I did this I did that everybody's asking he two opinions two opinions he's right sometimes more but two it would do one smart alec stood and said she is there doubt in the existence of so he said yes it's an issue of dispute the whole Masjid came to beat the heck out of him and it so happened that his son came said what are you doing said didn't you hear what this crazy man old man said said yeah yeah what did he say he said we said and he said there are two opinions yeah yeah this and he took it to the linguist side of interpretation whether this is ETC and he of course being who he is gave them a lecture in like 20 minutes and the guy said okay sounds good so unfortunately most of us follow this methodology when judging things my wife wants to go to visit her uh um mother in uh Tennessee I can't go so she insists I Google it and she Google says it's a the shift dispute so go my son wants to buy a um these I don't know what they call them headsets sound blasters or whatever and I know he listens to music and I tell him it's Haram he said there's an issue of dispute in music okay fair enough interest one of the funniest fatwas I've heard that's really damaging if you are in a cafir country it's okay to get an interest based loan for mortgage for your house but only the first house Mah cuz you're in need well but that's a major sin it's okay we have a fatwa from XY Z the fatwa Council in uh North Alaska or whatever I don't know or Zimbabwe and they said it's okay providing it's the first house you can get a house a mortgage a riba one of the seven major sins Allah curses those who deal with it and waste war against them it's okay the first time because you're in need I thought to myself I don't have my wife and I have a knee so can I find a fwa that says it's okay to yeah have a one night stand same thing what do you guys think I'm in heat this is nonsense this is playing around with the rules of Allah and the problem is that the Muslims who follow their whims and desires well a big Sheikh with a big beard yeah not as big as but it's it's considerably big he said it's so I took his F what what's his name I don't know where does he work I have no no idea how do you know he's a she maybe he's a DJ W I never thought of that I didn't see any bling blings but so how do you follow in your religional andam people you do not know you cannot trust says this knowledge the and and the this is religion so look and search and scrutinize those you are learning your religion from because this is not an easy thing to do finally because I I've already went over time Allah says and um whose Affair is even in neglect the third characteristics his Affairs are in neglect whether in D or in never you will find him doing something that has benefit in this or in the three characteristics number one that his heart is heedless whoo these three characteristics are about the individuals we're supposed to what not associate ourselves with with or or obey correct but aren't these characteristics in US aren't aren't we number one heedless from Allah's remembrance number two we follow our desires and whims number three our Affairs are ever in neglect we have a big problem what are we going to do about it we need to fix things and you need someone to tell you that you need to fix things and this is not your everyday reminder this this is a slap on the face though slapping the face is Haram in Islam but this is metaphorical don't sue me so this is a wakeup call for all of us to check our contact list who do we have on our contact list are they among those who remember Allah in the morning and the evening are they the ones who get us closer to Allah are they the ones who are steadfast on Islam and not heedless if they are then you're in good hands inshallah you'll end up in Jenna if you're not this is dangerous and you have to rectify your Affairs before it's too late think they have like questions or question okay anybody had question it reminds me of Saudi it's too hot yeah I I I get like Dr Jackal Mr Hyde I go outside I'm freezing my backside I come here I'm sweating I don't know I'm not wearing even a jacket you have eloquent English what you what what you're saying is 100% true Arabic is the language of the Quran and it's my tongue it's my tongue not my mother's my mother she died she had her own tongue but I it's my tongue but the problem is that how many of us know Arabic raise your hands take a look take a look how much anyone has a we have only five minutes and it should to our real life and you don't know the answer then ask I'm not going to choose the the the MC chooses where is he by the way where did he go oh you choose earlier you said something about the Rings being har to wear on certain okay the brother is asking about a comment I made where I said that it is not permissible to wear the Rings in in the index finger nor in the middle finger this is related to a Hadith narrated by may Allah be pleased with him IM Muslim so it is one of the highest authentic hadiths he said the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam prohibited us from wearing rings in the index and the middle finger that that's the evidence this young boy this young boy let him let him this every single time right then you after each time you do it like first of all the brother is asking a person who has problem of passing wind every time he makes w and this is continuous so it's one of two either it comes at a specific time continuously like for half an hour and you will miss Salah with the congregation but after the congregation there is another hour or an hour and a half where the time of the prayer is still existing it's not out in this case you must not pray with the congregation you must wait until your uh stomach is fine and you're not passing wind you make and you and pray in your home case two someone who keeps on passing wind like 24/7 so mashallah he like is like a jet the GU is don't eat tacos number one secondly if this is continuous this is known in the books of as a one who's excused so because there's a lot of hardship for you and the Salat time would be expired before you could do anything there's nothing you could do about it Scholars say that between the beginning of the Salat and the end of the Salat whenever you make W then you can pray even if you pass wind because you're Exempted from that and there is evidence for it as in the Hadith of FAA who used to have may Allah be pleased with her and the prophet instructed her of the same and Allah knows best why you have a security my second question us if I do that do what okay why you come here first of all I have a security guard because I can afford it second secondly SE secondly I have not stopped anyone from coming to shake hands with me or to take selfies with me and I don't have a glow around me where I prevent people from getting close to me this is not me the organizers are thought that I am a VIP and maybe mixed me up with Malcolm X I don't know so they brought me a bodyguard and so what what I do and the guy is the is a brother mashallah I I don't see any problem in that next time maybe people will argue why are you wearing this Saudi dress on your head May why don't you wear a hoodie or come on guys any you utilize the time in asking things that are related to your religion so many people ask questions not I'm generally speaking and if you ask them what are the conditions of Salat said the I don't know what is the what are the pillars of Salat what are the mandatory acts of Salat what is the zakat threshold of the camels of the cows of the sheep said I have no idea there's a we have a a big problem when we do not ask things that would get us closer to Allah and Allah knows best so what's your advice for the ones that they follow the fedas they follow the's opinions and Scholars opinions what is your advice for those people that they Allah said twice in the Quran ask the people of knowledge if you do do not know so we are instructed in the Quran to ask the people of knowledge now this is different to those who cherry pick those who go and want a solution that fits their desires and whims not that is complied complying with the Quran and Sunnah I'll give you an example a person who loves to listen to music goes to the vast majority of Scholars of Islam the four schools of thought they all say Haram the school of thought of Abu hanifah sha Malik Ahmed they all say music is Haram I still have this in me Tay has a concert in Las Vegas I want to watch that so what should I do I go and look in books of f until I find a an old yellow paged book that is like a gazillion years ago and the guy says and it's an issue of dispute and it seems to be Mak that's a one so I take that now later on I have another need to allow my wife to travel without a m whether for Haj or for anything else and I know that the prophet said it is not permissible for a man of a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a m this is in theah this is what the prophet said do I need a fatwa if I'm a Muslim no but still my wife is nagging what's no anyhow so I go and open the books of and I start with the the yellow paged book the old one that said that music is makr in the first sentence it's Haram I go to all all books Haram Haram Haram and then I find a group of Scholars who said I yeah okay it's it's Mak and I take that okay but these guys said in the beginning that music is Haram why aren't you following them this is cherry picking this is like taking your cart in the aisles of the supermarket and choosing and picking whatever you want this is not Islam because at the end of the day when you start cherry picking you'll end up formulating a religion that has no relationship to Islam it's a new religion your religion something that is custom made and this is not Islam Islam is like Allah said today I have completed your religion Islam is complete it's finished you no one can come and say okay at the time of the Prophet wine was Haram today we have screwdrivers so it's okay no it's not okay will scotch on the rocks it's not okay teila Haram it's not wine but it is intoxicating so people who want to cherry pick will find many many ways to go about and this is not for the Layman Layman cannot go through books book books of and cherry pick you have to be a student of knowledge who fears Allah not follow his whims and desires you want to find which is the closest to pleasing Allah not the closest to pleasing people and this is why IB may Allah have mercy upon his soul said that the scholars are free the scholars are three categories number one a scholar of the state when Simon Says something he just signs and stamps whatever the uh rulers say he does exactly what they want and he manages to do a good job because people trust him category number [Music] two a scholar of the nation in the sense that what do you guys want to listen to I'm I'm here just tell me okay so he caters for the people's needs and what they need and what they want to hear and this is not a genuine scholar unfortunately a lot of us are like this we want people to have a good time and if we can't break the rules might as well try to bend them a bit the third one is is the scholar of the religion he says what he says could care less about what the people say because he's giving what pleases Allah he's following the footsteps of the prophet of Allah sallallah alaih wasam and not looking for likes followers people to praise him or compliment him and Allah Knows Best security"
