  "transcript": "says in pakistan after shaving a newborn's head on the seventh day most people either bury the hair or throw it in the sea or the river is this from the sunnah if not then is it is there any haram in doing it it is not from the sunnah all the hadiths that govern this issue of burying it or throwing it in the desert or in the sea etc they're all not authentic there are some narrations of the companions but still they're not authentic so if you do this no problem but if you throw it in the dustbin like everybody else does again there is no problem there's no harm of the gin coming and making things over it as many people may think"
