  "title": "My husband is not regular in prayer, am I a fornicator for sleeping with him? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm at Allah's third question she says that if my husband does not pray frequently he's not regular on his prayers so would I be fornicating if I sleep with him the answer is no he's still a Muslim though a sinful Muslim and in great danger if he does not pray a single prayer and he's defiant we tell him pray he says nope I don't want to pray I don't believe in praying he this guy is a kafir you should immediately split and leave him and file for divorce but if he's praying on and off he's a Muslim but he's a sinful Muslim you need to approach him differently and amatulla to tell you the truth with a marriage such as yours you do need to have counseling you do need to know where you are going wrong because every person has a key to his heart some men have a key to their stomachs instead of their hearts so it is your obligation to change your strategy if your current strategy or your past strategy is not sufficient is not efficient and it's not working this means that you need to change your strategy you cannot maintain the way you're dealing with your husband because it's not working out and inevitably you will resent him and he will not love you and then the marriage will break this is something we do not want so you have to try to understand how he thinks try to listen from someone else if what you're doing is right or wrong and how to change your approach then this might help insha'Allah"
