  "transcript": "sh I have a question on Islam QA it says that when we make Dua we should be certain of the response so if I'm asking Allah to never punish me in Janam should I be certain that I will not be punished in Janam meaning that she when I'm getting when I'm thinking good thoughts of Allah that Allah will not punish me in Janam I get a thought that and I'm being certain of something that I should not be certain of and when I'm being uncertain that I might my my Dua might get rejected some I get a thought that I'm getting I'm having SW of Allah I'm having negative thoughts about Allah so I don't know how to manage this should I okay you have you have a typical uh classical symptoms of overthinking and I've said this many times overthinking is the biggest weapon in the Arsenal of shitan the moment he opens the door for overthinking you're doomed because it is a vicious cycle that goes round and round and the more it goes round it gets Tighter and Tighter around your neck until it suffocates you now you develop due to overthinking anxiety and panic attacks you think that you've committed kufur you think you committed shik you think that oh Allah is not going to accept my woodo you repeat your wo 20 times and you say the shahada 50 times because of overthinking and all what you it boils down to what came first the egg or the chicken and you spend hours and hours trying to figure out H was it the egg or the chicken and it's fruitless it has no benefit none whatsoever ever for you so when you overthink like this you're doomed you're finished you need a counseling session the the issue is whenever you make Dua you are certain that Allah would respond to it either by Allah giving it to you in this dun Allah deflecting harm equivalent to it in this D or Allah storing it for you on the day of judgment providing you do not transgress in Dua someone who goes to dgas someone who believes that the prophet Alat wasam answers his prayers so he prays to the prophet instead of praying to Allah and asks the prophet and seeks refuge in the prophet instead of Allah or who he does this with alii or he does this with Hussein or with a orani or or whomever this is shik then he says oh Allah I seek refuge in you from Hellfire no this is not applicable this is transgression and Dua because he's worshiping other than Allah he will end up in Hellfire no matter how much Dua he does make Dua the the Dua of the disbelievers is in vain and this is said by the angels to the hell dwellers make Dua it's not going to be answered so if you make Dua and regular things with positivity while acting upon it Allah will respond"
