  "transcript": "shall we shorten the time of the lecture so as to take more questions I'd rather finish the whole thing by an hour to an hour 15 minutes instead of an hour and a half okay level is crazy coughing bye Sharla that would be good no problem chef Sharla young I'm ready whenever you are right I'm ready yes Sophie yes last time we stopped at page six yeah which is if you were asked regarding the three fundamentals we did not go through this okay we did not go through it I don't think so okay yeah yeah yeah yeah true yes true sure okay [Music] wasabi has made a mother do a ceremony or a ketchup and we continue business reading and explaining this beautiful concise book on issues of a penis that each and every Muslim has to it's a must to learn so that his Islam would be complete so let us start in sha Allah so J and this Mila so it is said to you what are the three fundamental principles that mankind is obliged to know they say the servant knows his Lord his religion and his prophet may peace be upon him so these are the three essential fundamental the most important questions that Muslims and in general mankind is obliged to know and this knowledge is not sufficient when it's theoretical and not put into action because anyone can answer these questions nowadays and memorize them so if you ask someone who's your Lord and you tell him you say Allah what is your religion you say Islam who's your messenger you say Muhammad Ali his Lobster anyone can answer these three questions but when you are in your grave as we know once a person dies two angels would come to him they look horrible and they carry a big staff in their hands and they get hold of the deceased in his grave and shake him strongly and ask him in a very authoritarian voice and tone who's your Lord what is your religion and who's that man who was sent to you only those who are believers through Muslims who used to act according to their belief they would comfortably say our Lord is Allah our religion is Islam and I and the Prophet Muhammad Ison is our messenger and they would be saved and Allah would tell the Angels to open a window from paradise to him and to furnish his grave from paradise and he sees his own spot in nice and he would say oh Allah make the hour now so that I can enter my paradise in Allah so Allah tells him remain calm and he stays where he is while the disbeliever or the hypocrite would be asked who's your Lord what's your religion who's that man who was sent to you and he would not be able to answer he would say huh I don't know I heard them say things so I said it as they had said it so the Angels would strike him with this big hammer this big staff on his head and he would turn into salt and then they would get him back to his human form and they hit him once again and he would shout so high and so loud that every creature on earth would hear that which includes animals birds insects fish etc except the men and the jinn they do not hear that and this hadith is authentic and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam told us that this would happen and then it would be a window to hellfire that is opened so that the one who's in his grave would see his seat in hellfire and he would say o allah do not let the day of judgment come and he would remain in torment and in punishment until the day of judgment so these three fundamental principles are extremely important and these are basics and the essence of your art EDA if you are interested in entering Jenna yessiree now that we fundamental the first fundamental principle so if it is said who is your Lord then say my lord is Allah the one who nurtured me and natured all creation through his favors and he eatle okay this is this is the answer it is a must that you acknowledge that allah azza wajal is Subhanahu WA Ta'ala the one who nurtured us and he's the one that exists with his bounties Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala is the creator of everything and he is Subhanahu WA Ta'ala the one who created us nurtured us supplied us with all what we need whether it is physical or spiritual in that he is one and only carry on and the evidence nam unless the proof for this is Allah statements all praise be to Allah love of all the creation what is this in Arabic and hamdulillahi rabbil al-ameen alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen so here we acknowledge and append clearly say that Grubb is the Lord so allah azza wajal is the lord of what of al al-amin what does Allah demean mean al al-amin is the plural of alum and eylem in there it means world so Allah is the lord of the worlds with the zappy we have a world of the angels the world of jinn the world of mankind the world of animals different pH creations of Allah Azza WA JAL different worlds so all of those are in need of a creator and a lord so who is they'll their Lord it is Allah to whom all praise is due for him and I am just a member of these worlds yes aji the word eylem refers to everything apart from allah and i am part of that creation so if it is said to you how do you come to know of your Lord then say ok then this is the logical question people may ask now what you're saying is beautiful but prove to me show me I can't take what you say for granted I need proof of what you are saying that Allah is the Lord so what should my reply be inna by way of his sign and his creations and among his signs at a night and a day and the Sun and the moon and among his creations at a 7 level of heavens and the seven levels of Earth as well as whoever and whatever lies in them and between them the proof follows the proof for this is Allah statement first of all first of all through his signs and creation how do we know allah azzawajal so there has to be something that is logical where people can know Allah as Oh through for the believers there are ayat there are signs what are the signs a sign is anything that indicates over something so we have a big sign saying no parking so it indicates that you cannot park and the signs are divided into two types and ayat in Arabic one is legislative and the other is universal so the legislative signs are the Quran all these verses of the Quran that indicates that explains that guides us they're considered to be signs or legislative signs lacking sharia and all what Allah has created around us are considered to be I act on Konya Universal signs such as the Sun the day and the night the moon the seven layers of the heavens or the sky and the seven layers of the earth which we know through the Quran this is mentioned in the Quran that Earth has seven layers exactly as the skies are seven now this scholars of word day sciences may agree or disagree but it doesn't matter for us it doesn't matter to us because we're Muslims we believe in that and this is one of Allah's creation look at the Sun look at the moon look at the stars it all indicates to you that there is only one creator of this universe and that is a clear sign to anyone who contemplates nothing can create this perfection except someone who is so powerful so knowledgeable so capable of doing things that are way beyond our imagination the evidence this is what the IMP mentions yes sorry ma'am and from among his sign at a night and a day and the Sun and the moon do not prostrate yourself to the Sun or to the moon but rather prostrate yourself to Allah who created them if it is he whom you would truly worship ok the following ayah now verily your Lord is Allah who created the heavens and the earth in six days and then rose over the throne he brings the night as a cover over the day which it follows rapidly and he made the Sun the moon and the stars subjected to his command surely to him belong the creations and the command blessed is Allah lord of the worlds so these ayahs are two of so many in the Quran that keep on reminding us that only allah azza wajal can create these heavenly bodies the sun is so huge is so powerful is so hot without it we will die no crops can grow no human being can live in the dark forever and if we have too much of it also it is fatal this is why Alma's mercy came with the balance of day and night even in the Scandinavian countries they have day that is way longer they're ours and then they have night that also can be way longer than ours but the balance is still struck there the people in their early ages when they drifted away from toe heat they used to look at the Sun and worship it like the Pharaohs who thought that the Sun is their Lord now in Japan they also believed that the Emperor is the Sun is the Sun with an O of the Sun with a U and they believe that the Sun is the Lord and all of these beliefs because they see something of huge magnitude and power Allah says in the Quran do not prostrate neither to the Sun nor to the moon because it was allah azza wajal who created both of them all of them everything was only created by Allah the one and only and this is why in the hadith the Prophet that is awesome says there was Allah and there was nothing with him so allah azzawajal is the first without the beginning he cannot have a beginning he's the one and only and he's the last without an end this is allah who we has we have to believe in okay the wardrobe means one who is worshipped so so first of all let us explain what is the meaning of the word arabic in arabic this word can be used with many other things so we can say that I mean the Lord of the Worlds and we can also use the word rod with rubble bait which indicates the father or the owner of the house he's known as bull bait raghu dabba rambu and now the owner of the house the owner of the camel and etc so all of these indicates that the word rub has a linguistic meaning and it has a legislative meaning the linguistic meaning is the owner so when we say they have found their owner by the door then this is an indication that this is the owner of the house the legislative meaning has a broader meaning and that is our rob is the creator our Rob is the owner and our rob is the facilitator the one who gives sustenance the one who gives life and death all of these are embedded in the meaning of a Rob and this is why scholars throughout time said that actually the definition of Rob is the one who deserves to be worshipped some books may refer to our club by saying the one who is worshipped but this is wrong because Buddha is worshipped a cow to the Hindus is worshipped but they're not deserving to be worshipped only allah azza wajal deserves to be worshipped subhanahu wa'ta'ala yes sir name the proof for this is Allah saying o mankind worship your Lord who created you and those before you so that you may be dutiful to him he is the one who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky as a canopy and sent down water from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you so do not set up rival with Allah in worshipping in worship normally so this is a crystal-clear verse stating Allah has ability and why allah azza wajal is worthy of being worshipped one he created you and those who were before you can you bring someone else similar to that who can bring proof that he had created us know okay allah azza wajal made the earth a place of dwelling and a place of resting for you he made this heavens as a canopy on top of you he is the only one capable of sending rain down to you he's the only one capable of bringing vegetations and fruits as provision for you so would it be logical to have others with him subhana Allah and to associate others with him this is not logical what does email in min Cathy say yes sorry now America still saved me upon have mercy on him the creator of this things is the one who truly deserves to be worshipped the title so so definitely the creator of all of these things the one who sends down to us without which we would die he's the only one worthy of being worshipped and this is all what happy day is about acknowledging that Allah Azza WA JAL alone is worthy of being worshipped then worshipping Allah subhana WA Ta'ala without associating others with him okay now the types of worship that Allah commanded such as Islam amen and xn which includes application to our fear and hope hope Roger yeah reliance the what cool longing and dread in submissiveness you repentance seeking assistance they can refuged asking for help offering sacrifice making oath and all the other types of worship and Allah commanded all these belong to Allah alone by the the version I have the translation I have they did not mention any of these things that you have just read simply because it will be cascaded one by one later on but what do you learn from these things that you have just mentioned whether it's fear supplication hope reliance etc it shows you that worshiping Allah Azza WA JAL is not like what the vast majority of people think most of the Muslims believe that worshiping Allah is only to bow and prostrate Institute in salat and to fast from online that's it but they associate others with Allah Azza WA JAL and this is why we who follow the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favourite generations we face a lot of resistance and people tarnish our reputation slanderous curse us say evil things about us and the easiest thing that could say to tarnish our reputation is calling us after the author of this book the three fundamental principles is Mohammed Abdel Wahab so once you preach al-qaeda they would say ah you're a hobby not too happy my name is Asma I said no you're a hobby you follow the school of thought of Mohammed in my guru ham but did not have a school of thought excuse me what are you talking about so no no no you're a hobby you have a new religion okay let me analyze where you're coming from why are you saying this circuit and the answer would be shocking to you because they would say because you make people into disbelievers you make Muslims into mushrik so where do we do this said if I where to call Adi and I say yeah I'll II save me from the problems I have I'm having before if I call an SN ya Hossein send us water send us rain so we say to them you're calling someone other than Allah this is what we defined chick bi said see I told you you are wahhabis you're classifying people as mushrik but this is what you're doing these are forms of worship only acceptable for Allah so again if you prostrate to Ali it would not be acceptable should know this is ko friendship so the hamdulillah likewise if you just take the time to read the Quran and to learn the sin of the Prophet that is a sin you will find that all what you're doing is and when you go to grave worshippers those who believe in the tea journey or the shadowy or al-jilani or Almada we of the tariqa and they tell you we believe in times of calamities if we say whether we chill Allah as I say that he will relieve us from whatever we suffering from oh this is there was a man who was newly married and for 10 years after his marriage his wife could not conceive and he used to go to the Kaaba every week making Ramallah asking a large division but his a man who wasn't intact so he was calling Allah not certain then a man asked him and said to him why don't you go to the grave of al-hussein and send him a small message on a paper asking him to help you get your wife conceived so he did this and he went to Cairo and boom nine months later his wife gave birth to a healthy boy and the man used to say ten years have been going to the Kaaba and nothing happened look at the blessings of al-hussein upon me Allah this guy left the fold of Islam because he invoked someone other than Allah believed that someone other than unlock had give his wife a child what Islam is there even if this guy prays ten hours a day or fasts half of the year or performs Hajj every year he is doomed in hell for eternity for his share this is why our dida is extremely important because it can make it or break it it can make you a Muslim and it can take you out of the fold of Islam if you're following wrong practices okay the proof for this is Allah saying and the most masala sajid khan unto anyone so this this is a clear proof that the massage gate is for allah as the origin and that you cannot worship other than Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and what is meant by a massage it is the salat the prostration the acts of robada yes so whoever direct any part of this act of worship to other than Allah then he is a polytheist disbeliever the proof of this is Allah saying and whoever called unto another God beside Allah of which he has no proof for his reckoning is only with his Lord surely that his believers will not be successful so here allah azza wajal described them as what as disbelievers for doing what for invoking other than allah azza wajal asking praying calling other than allah would make you a disbeliever just making dua for other than allah o Gilani abdelkader saying do this for me do that for your calling someone who's dead and this takes you out of the fold of Islam and makes you a kafir this is what the ayah is in front of you it is saying and whoever invokes forward or worships besides Allah any other Ilah any other God of whom he has no proof can anyone bring proof that such gods exist or have the ability to answer you the answer is no so if you relate this ayah with the ayah before it and the message are for allah alone so invoke not anyone along with allah you we'll understand that this takes a person out of the fold of Islam the following ayah and also it is stated in a hadith this application is the call of worship the power before before that there is another ayah Lord and your Lord said in vogue with me okay and your Lord said supplicate to me I will respond to you verily those who are proud to worship me will enter the Hellfire in this verse so Allah soldiers that invoke me supplicate to me and then he said those who what those who do what who are too proud to worship when worship those who are too proud to worship Me so at the beginning I said invoke me supplicate to me if I don't want to Allah said those who refuse or so proud to him to worship me which means that dora is worship and this is exactly what the Prophet said in the hadith is salat WA Salam hmm the supplication is the called worship okay the hadith is wife is not authentic the authentic hadith is invocation or dua is worship not the core of worship the authentic hadith ooh hoo only bother the one that the Sheikh mentioned in the book is at dura oh ma la banda the core of ebody but this is not authentic this is weak the authentic hadith is adorable a better invocation or supplicating to Allah is better so this is an indication to do ha which is a form of worship now we may take some time to elaborate a little bit on some of these issues because generally speaking when we say we are referring to something our minds goals our minds go to somewhere particular let it be known that door is divided into two types there are interlinked first of all is the supplication or the invocation of praise whenever you praise allah azza wajal you are calling him so this is why the prophet said alehissallaam son the best of dua is to say Allah Allahu Allah Erica what this is DRA scholars say yes this is dua this is called what do I of praising allah azza wajal here you're not asking for anything you're just praising him glorifying him giving him the magnificence he deserves by glorifying him as the origin this is called do are you f Anna and I'll give you something which is a bonus this is not included in the package deal this is a bonus from me Muslims when you pray and in your core you say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah what does that mean in English Nasser moderator now stir okay the viewers in your comments what does you are old seer Sammy I know send me I mean to hear not to see so what does Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah means I'm winking Allah hears whatever okay here's whoever who calls him here's those who praise him okay all of your answers almost said that Allah hears Allah listens I will think you went for your coffee breaker again what is this with you anyhow what does send me I love him and having me that means no sir unlike kill those who pity okay Allah hears those who praised him this is not true because Allah hears also those who curse him Allah hears those who say foul things so Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah and this is the bonus huh means Allah answers those who praise Him in suratul mujadara or the semi allahu allah Lettie to J Dilla calf is oh gee ha Allah has answered the woman who is objecting to you and debating with you and arguing with you about her husband and this is why Allah answers those who praise him what do we say in response I love bana well he'll ham ham Dan Cathy Empire band Mubarak and feet so Allah answers those who praise Him because they are doing dua not the dua you think of the door of Athena of complementing Allah and praising him I'll give you another example to set what I'm saying what is the du-ha of your loss prophet Jonah when he was in the belly of the whale no sir like ionica in the container gardening la ilaha illa and there is no God worthy of being worshipped except you so behind a glory be to you in the countryman of Alamut I was among the wrongdoers what did the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam described this he said do I win noon he said the supplication of the noon ok well did they don't ask for what did Yunus asked for Dan says I don't know the statement is beautiful la ilaha illa anta subhanaka inni continually he did not ask he glorified so this is dois Afeni to praise and glorify Allah as the origin and this is the greatest type of drug now there is another type of door which is known as doing of begging do I will miss ADA oh Allah give me health o Allah grant me children or Allah guide my wife or Allah pay off my debts you're asking something from Allah soldier this is only to ask well the first is only to glorify and there is an inter link between them so when we come to the door what color abu qamha the Rooney Astra G block o supplicate and invoke me and I'll answer and when the Prophet says at door oh who la boda supplicating and invoking Allah is a bad this indicates that the door is two types glorifying Allah and asking things from Allah as whoooaa okay now so the proof of fear is allah saying do not fear them but fear me we are true believers so this is another form of worshiping allah azza wajal fear and allah says do not fear them but feel me if you are true believers but this is difficult share how can we only fear Allah and nothing else okay let me explain this and break it down for you fear is divided in two types one of them is natural fear so you fear darkness you fear fire there's a lion about to eat you and you say mmm no I'm gonna continue praying I don't fear it except the lines that was Elly may you rest in peace he's gonna eat you run said yeah but then how would I be only feeding a lot of it hey this is natural fear one of the brothers once asked me on Twitter if I'm praying and there's a lion coming to eat me should I continue my prayer I said most likely your would have has been broken so your prayer is invalid run this is natural fear it has nothing to do with no heat and this was described the prophets were described by it Musa when he killed the Coptic Allah described him as for us behalf in Medina teja if any a de Vaca he would the following day he was afraid in medina looking right and left anticipating whether something is going to come his way or not so this is no problem in it because this is natural fear there is the fear of of something that people worship others with so those who stand in front of a statue of Buddha and they have this fear in their hearts towards that statue not knowing what is causing this fear this is shirk because they believe that this statue has the ability to do something has the ability to impact them so they're afraid of what others worship Him and the third type of fear is the fear which is the most among mushriks is when you are in your room in my room there's no one with me no one is watching me yet I'm afraid of disobeying an order or I'm afraid of the that person in his grave so for example I steal money they catch me I said I didn't steal money they say say wallahi I did not steal swear by Allah so although I did not steal so one of the smart people around them say no this guy is a follower of a Jelani oral battery say by Al Bayda we I did not steal he said no I cannot do that I did steal I confess why did you swear by Allah I can swear by Allah in light no problem but I can't swear by the dead person in the grave I cannot swear by the grave because it will haunt me it will cause harm to me this fear is shirk it takes a person out of the fold of Islam likewise I remember once a man came to me before Juma prayer and said to me shake people are circulating this paper on our cars and houses what is it it is about a woman called Sakina don't know who that is probably from the descendants of at Hossein may Allah be pleased with him and she said that there was this girl who was fourteen years of age and in her dreams she saw Cetina and Sakina put something in her eyes and she regained her sight and she told her and gave her advice and she told that girl print this paper for 20 times and distributed to others if you do that you will get fortune from allah azza wajal a man in bahrain did this and he won ten thousand dinars and another one in bouquet did this and he passed his exams but if you don't do this a catastrophe and a calamity will strike you a man ignored this paper and did not copy at twenty times his child died in the afternoon another hadn't car accident a third one his house was burnt to the ground so I read this and the man who brought it to me said all of this rule is nonsense look at what they are spreading around our neighborhoods so I said to him this is true okay this just tear it down and throw it in the dustbin the man looked at me and said oh if it's okay if you tear it down you tear it up so it's Rama why you're just telling me that this is shaken you don't believe in this nonsense it's best to be safe than sorry you tear it up so I said so hang on la partida is in the heart so what good is on Allah fear can only be from Allah soldier so in the Friday khutba I said to the people in your neighborhood you found this paper and a man came to me and he was afraid of tearing it up and subhanAllah where it is you're a man and I tore it up into small pieces and afternoon my car was stolen nothing happens to you you have to believe in a large there were jelly but when there is a breach in our Qaeda this is the result this is what happens when you're afraid of everything you're afraid of everything without a proof from Allah and I'm not talking about being afraid of a snake or a scorpion this is natural you have to be afraid and you have to kill them even if you're in prayer as the Prophet said are a history of stone even the feeler and prayer don't continue you have to kill them while in prayer but I'm talking about the fear that can only be fit allah azza wajal the fear in secrecy the field when you are not around anyone the fear that only Allah can inflict upon you while all others do not this is what we have to pay attention to do you have time now sir or should we stop here I think I think we should stop you and then take questions and find yeah bismillah and the first question is a inter-are way instead of holding a phone to it the surah and I put an iPad on a table in front of me the problem is I may have to take a step to turn the pages or swipe it down to read the rest of the is it permissible a Tamiya is not permissible because the movement is excessive first of all second of all when you want to lean down to the table you will be simulating record and this is an addition in salat that is not preferable use a mobile phone or holder must have or better more read from your memory your short surahs and repeat them that would be sufficient insha Allah now the next question is regularly if I do taraweeh in the last at night in the last head of the night do I need to do tahajud would is considered night prayer right okay I think I've answered this before but I don't know I've been doing so many programs here and Zaid TV and elsewhere I may be confused anyhow taraweeh is a name given to the congregational prayer offered in Ramadan this is the definition taraweeh is night prayer in congregation offered during the month of Ramadan why do we say night prayer because any prayer that is prayed after a chant before that an affair is called night prayer this is a general name so why do we say in congregation because if I pray at home this is not taraweeh this is not prayer and if I pray it other than Ramadan in other months this is night prayer it's not called taraweeh so this is the definition of taraweeh now with the lockdown we all pray it 90 prayer of Ramadan home so this is not taraweeh this is not prayer and the best time to pray night prayer whether in ramadan or elsewhere is in the last third of the night which we call the hatchet so why didn't the companion pray it at that time because when in congregation you want to make life easy for the rest of the people not everyone can wait until the last third of the night a lot of the people want to pressure pray taraweeh and sleep so if this is the case in message this is what we do but if you're not praying in the message nor in congregation you're praying home in this case it is best to pray it in the last third of the night but if you pray that after Isha totally permissible and legit yes I'm sure can you answer the question of the grid in languages other than Arabic can you can you answer the questions of the grave in other languages other than Arabic how would you know what the questions of the grave in which language are they going to be this is something from the unseen this is like asking questions that are illogical to ask when someone comes and says share the youth who were in the cave for 300 years plus Allah I mentioned that they had a dog what kind the dog was it was it a German Shepherd or a government or a small Chihuahua I would why would I know Allah didn't mentioned that to us Allah did not tell us about it which has no significance someone says okay what about Ibrahim when he saw that planet then the moon then the sun saying this is my lord this is my lord this is my lord this is bigger what planet was it was it Mars was it Venus was it Jupiter beats me Allah didn't tell us and as the origin neither did the prophets awesome so this is of zero importance to us so there are questions that should not be asked Danny you guys speak English so if the question was posted to you in Arabic and you don't know Arabic you think that Allah will throw you in hell because you don't know that answer you don't know what language the question would be and would it be a universal language something that allah azzawajal makes people communicate with all of this is a waste of time and we have no knowledge from the Quran or from the Sunnah and what will be the position of people that is believe in Allah as the result of normos and no message reach them during their existence these people are known to be a halal fatwa these are the people of the period where no man ginger was sent to them and Allah stated in the Quran woman could not V beam had an ax at her a Sudha and we were not to torment a people until we send them a messenger and the people of tafseer some of them said that Allah does not throw people in hell if they did not have a messenger and this ayah is an evidence other people after she said no you misunderstood the ayah the ayah is saying that Allah would not send a general punishment and torment of for a people on earth before sending them a messenger so the people of Noor Allah flooded the whole earth because Allah sent them a messenger the people have had the people of the mood the people of loot the people of Pharaoh they were all sent messengers but this doesn't mean that people who did not receive a messenger will not be punished on the day of judgment so the most authentic opinion is that those people who did not receive a previous revelation such as people in eskimo or people in the jungles of Africa where no Muslim no Christian knows you had ever set foot there to give them dower they don't know so these people will come on the day of judgment and they will complain to allah azzawajal some would say oh allah in on earth hours deaf and blind so i could not get any information about islam or religion in general some would say i was born as a with special needs I could not understand some would say that I was born in a very far place with nothing to show me the way only then la tells a neck and e ck from hellfire to come so this neck comes with an open mouth and Allah says to them enter it those who enter it willingly it will take them straight to paradise because they're believers they complied how could they not comply when they see the heavens and the and hell and they see the people are thrown here and admitted there and they see the day of judgement those who deny and say whoa this is a neck from hell how do you want to still go into it no I'm not going it will take them and throw them in hell as disbelievers and there's a hadith that was authenticated by a shell Advani if I'm not mistaken about this and Allah knows best now this Christian is a can a Muslim man marry Christian lady Allah mentioned our social I think in verse 4 or 5 of chapter 5 and mérida that the women of the people of the book are allowed to us providing that they are chaste and do not have boyfriends so it is permissible for a Muslim man to marry a chaste Christian or a Jew this is permissible in Islam and some of the Companions had done this though nowadays it is not advisable and the reason is that I have many cases especially in the West where a Muslim man is out there studying or working meets a beautiful Christian woman and they marry and he loves her and cares for her but few years down the line after few kids he's demanding that she's a bit more conservative he demands that she doesn't wear miniskirts or revealing clothes that she doesn't meet ex-boyfriends or at least colleagues from work she does not mix with the opposite gender or drink intoxicates with which all of these are okay in her mind and religion so after a few years life becomes unbearable so she divorces him she takes custody of the children and she changes them into Christianity and he cannot lift a finger he cannot do a thing because this is their country and this is the laws of secularism I have a Saudi friend who was in the same place 40 30 30 years ago and he comes to me and complains crying I have two grown-up beautiful daughters living in America and they go to church every Sunday they refused to speak to me what can I do and I say to him in grief there's nothing for you to do now it's over this is the consequence of marrying someone who's not a Muslim and Allah knows best and I'm sure is impermissible to move to another non-muslim country from the one you're currently in are you living in the Muslim country now presidency so far well I did not see that the person you specify I think the person is living in a non-muslim country now I must move to another non-muslim country ok migration to an non-muslim country is not permissible for a Muslim living in a Muslim country or holding a Muslim nationality because this is a downgrade yes it might be an upgrade when it comes to worldly matters so you have infrastructure nice country laws pensions etc but it is a Kaffir country so for people living in India for example yeah this is okay people living in the Philippines in countries that are non-muslims yeah this might be okay because they're moving from a non-muslim country to another non Muslim country but for people in Pakistan which is a Muslim country then this is not permissible to go and live in migrate and seek the nationality of a Catholic country give your pledge to the Queen or to their constitution that's not permissible generally speaking and there might be exceptions analyzers and Ozzfest I mean you shake this will be the last question ishow Allah I actually can't explain more on blasphemy and apostasy this apostasy is rejecting something from Islam that is known by default so apostasy in Arabic is called a ridah and all books of sucker of jurisprudence have a chapter on this how it is done when it is done what is to be done with a person who does this so apostasy is like when someone rejects something that is known by default from Islam he says I don't believe in five daily prayers so this person is in great danger he has committed an act of apostasy now to condemn him to label him this is only done by the Muslims it's done by the Muslim ruler so a panel of Muslim judges talk to him ensure that the conditions are fulfilled and that there are no obstacles to prevent from his thick fear and then they asked the Muslim ruler to take the verdict of execution and that would be only carried by the Muslim ruler but not for any Tom Dick or Harry someone says that I don't believe in toxicants are prohibited someone says I don't believe marrying my own sister is Haram or marrying my father's wife after his death is prohibited and so on all of these acts are acts of apostasy that exits a person from the fold of Islam and the Prophet has said that his salatu salam his ruling that whoever changes his religion then he must be killed of course this is addressed to the Muslim ruler and the panel of judges not to any Tom Dick or Harry so a person who changes his religion from Islam to Christianity if he's in a Muslim country he has to be tried by Muslim judges but if he's in a kafir country we can't do anything about him just leave him be and by caught him and I hope this answers the question all right mathematically Sheikh I think we kept two tiny home was a call off a run and we sincerely apologize if I sometime take my time explaining few things but as a teacher I may think that clarification in this point is needed and people most likely don't know it as in the case of semi Allahu Liman Hamidah and as in
