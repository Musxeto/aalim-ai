  "title": "Which Prayer Timetable should we follow in our Apps (Umm Al Qura)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "we supposed to follow em malpua or are we supposed to follow ISNA or the University of Karachi or the muslim world league etc to the best of my knowledge following the calculations of ohm malpua is the best when it comes to fajar Lahore Nasser and Mary you must not follow it when it comes to Asia because they have an error which fixes raesha timing to be an hour and a half 11 months of the year after sunset and two hours in Ramadan after sunset which is totally bogus and not correct usually Asia is about an hour to 70 minutes after sunset so if isne is within this range after sunset or the muslim world league then you should follow that in asia but the rest you should follow Omar :"
