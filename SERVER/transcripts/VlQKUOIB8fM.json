  "transcript": "and welcome to this new series of the islamic faith and in this series we will go through a book that was published by usol or islam house and you will find the book on the website to for you to download was written by a renowned scholar sheikh abdul aziz may allah preserve him and the beauty of this book that it talks about artida from the perspective of ahlu sunnati you see akida is a terminology that has been misused and abused by many factions of islam so the shaykh as the previous scholars as the way of the self wrote this book to clarify the meaning of akida to normal muslims you see when you speak about akida the first thing that comes into your mind is the deviant sects and their disbelief and their innovation and how they go against the quran and the sunnah while in the midst of studying such things without knowing people divert from their own actual akida so if you go to a salafi person and you ask him who doesn't have knowledge of course what is your akida he says um the self so you ask him again what is the arcade of the seraph he said that we are not murji we are not hawaii we are not murtazilah we are not this we're not that we are not rafael we're not yet you are denying all of these sects cults and factions but you're not telling me what is your apida so it is quite important for us to go back to the basics not to indulge in what scholars said about this faction or that faction which is sometimes quite important but uh on itself but it is not our akita so what is first of all the definition of alpeda what is the arcade that we believe in comes from the word a not and it's your strong conviction of something it's your belief it's your ideology and usually we define it as affirmative belief in allah his angels his books his messengers the hereafter and the divine decree both good and bad it is also to believe in all what has been mentioned in the glorious quran and the authentic sunnah of the prophet regarding the foundations of religion and the facts of the unseen so all of this comes under the definition of akida and to break this down we will have to go through this book which is composed of 16 chapters we will try to devote one chapter per session which is doubtful but we will give it a try and maybe it will take a little bit longer but the essence is that we want to come out of this course or of this series with solid knowledge of what our akita is so for instance when someone says where do we take our akita from some say from sheikh so and so from abintaemi from this from that no the source of the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the righteous predecessors the three favorite generations this is where hapida comes from it doesn't come from people it's not based on their whims and desires it's based on evidence so without further ado we will begin in the book with chapter one we will skip the introduction and go straight to where the beef is and on page 13 on my pdf it says chapter one islam is the only divine faith and here we have to give a pause what do you mean it's the only divine faith we have christianity we have judaism we have the religion of ibrahim we have this we have that well before we go forward you know by default that when we use the word islam there are two meanings of it the broad meaning which is to submit your will to allah and this broad meaning is what the sheikh is talking about at the moment in the beginning of chapter one the second meaning is a specific more specific meaning for it and that is the religion the law the sharia the practice that the muslims believe as a religion other than other religions such as christianity judaism etc so we have our set of prayers different to any set of prayers and other religions we have fasting we have hajj pilgrimage etc so what is the difference between the two the first islam definition with the broader sense means that all those who were sent by allah azzawajal as prophets and messengers they believed in islam the broader sense so they submitted their will to allah they accepted nothing but what comes from allah azzawajal therefore islam is the only divine faith check this box god allah does not accept anything else from any one of his servants be the human or jinn so allah does not accept anything but islam the evidence be uh backing this up allah says in the quran he who seeks a religion other than self surrender to god it will not be accepted from him and allah azzawajal says the only true faith accepted to god is man's self surrendered to him in medina in the islam so this is what's only accepted to allah so define to us what do you mean by islam the sheikh goes on to say islam is the faith preached by all prophets allah azzawajal says before you your time we never sent a messenger without having revealed to him that there is no deity other than me therefore you shall worship me alone so um this is the eternal message the divine message to all prophets and messengers to worship we have sent revelations to you just as we sent revelations to and to the prophets after him as we send revelations to ibrahim and we have given the azabu so dude we gave the book of the divine wisdom and as we inspired other messengers whom we have mentioned to you previously as well as other messengers who we have not mentioned to you and allah has spoken his word directly to moses these were messengers sent to bring good news and to give warning so that people may have no argument against allah once the mess these messengers had come allah is almighty and wise so all of this clearly states that they had the same message and after allah azzawajal has mentioned the prophets of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala as mentioned in the book after that allah says in the quran after mentioning these listing these messengers and prophets allah says those are the ones whom god has guided follow then their guidance this is the instruction follow their guidance what guidance the prophet came with a new religion he came with a new law a new sharia the religion is the same since the time of adam not to worship other than allah not to associate others with him and to submit your will to his law so each law came and all of these laws have something in common and that is to submit your will to allah azzawajal the religions of all prophets are the same in their fundamental concepts and principles how is that possible sheikh the jews are different than the christians the christians are different than the muslims in essence they all worship allah they're all supposedly not to associate others with allah not to invoke other than allah not to offer sacrifice other than to allah azzawajal and to submit their will entirely to allah subhanahu but these religions vary in some details but not all okay what are the details that they may vary in well you have to study each and every religion so for example details may be different but the fundamentals are the same both musa peace be upon him and isa peace be upon him they were sent with the same message divine message to the children of israel they were sent to the jews but allah gave the gospel to jesus as his message he abrogated some of the rules that were in the torah revealed to moses so during his message isa peace be upon him said to his people and i have come to confirm that which has already been sent down of the torah and to make lawful to you some of the things which were forbidden upon you i have come to you with a sign from your lord so remain conscience of god and obey me now all of this clearly makes sense because jesus and moses were sent to the same people same tribe but they had differences in their message so if this is the case with two prophets and messengers of the same tribe how would it be with other nations and tribes as well if you go to the following page you would find that the sheikh talks about other religions he says every divine law suffered distortion and alteration this distortion and alteration is clearly manifested if you look in the scriptures of these religions look at the torah look at the injil the gospel and you will find many different copies that are not alike so one would say and one would argue then why is it so why didn't allah preserve the torah and the gospels aren't these allah's words that's a good question and the answer is yes they are allah's words but allah did not pledge upon himself to protect them like he did with the quran and allah says there are some among them who twist their tongues when quoting the scriptures so that you may think that what they say is from the scriptures when it is not from the scriptures they say it is from god when it is not from god that thus deliberately say of god what they know to be a lie this is what is happening when you look at various scriptures you have the bible the revised standard virgin the new revised started virgin the do we virgin for the catholic the kings james virgin for the protestants and they differ immensely and they don't have an original script that we can go back to and verify whether this is true or not so if this is the case with the scriptures that the people have with them nowadays how can we know how can we identify which religion is authentic which religion is not corrupt among those before us the sheikh says this people could not know the truth as allah revealed it due to this distortion and to this alteration the proper way to correct the situation was to send a new prophet so all these messengers and prophets were sent to their own tribes the prophet said in an authentic hadith allah has given me five things that no other prophet of allah has been given and he said number one i was sent to all of humanity and to the jinn while prophets and messengers before me used to be sent each one to their tribe so allah azzawajal chose to re-establish his true faith with the prophethood of muhammad sallam this meant that there is no true self-surrender to allah and no true faith except that of the prophet alaihis was salaam allah azza says in the quran he who seeks a religion other than self-surrender to allah it will not be accepted from him and it and in the life to come he will be among the lost now to muslims this is very clear because we believe in the quran allah azzawajal gave this message to all communities to the arabs and then arabs to the humans and to the jinn allah says and we have not we have sent you to all mankind so that you bring them good news and give them warning in an authentic hadith may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam said by him who holds muhammad's soul in his hand who holds muhammad's soul in his hand so this is a poetic way of swearing by allah instead of saying by allah no you say you you emphasize the majesty of allah by indicating your total poverty and helplessness and allah's total power and reign over everything so the prophet says by him who holds muhammad's soul in his hand any human being jew or christian who hears of me but dies without believing in that with which i have been sent shall be among the people of fire allah has guaranteed to keep the quran safe from distortion and alternation or alteration he says it is we ourselves who have bestowed this reminder from on high and it is we who shall preserve it intact now this is the first chapter coming back the prophet says indicating that after his message all religions all faiths have been abrogated and nothing is accepted at the side of allah azzawajal except islam which we believe in at the moment how is that he said and he swore and the prophet does not need to swear because he is the truthful the honest the one who is believed yet he says no jew nor christian and why did he specifically mention the jew and the christians why didn't he mention the medus the fire worshipers or the agnostics the atheists the buddhists the hindus the idol worshipers etc because the jews and the christians are the closest to the truth because their religion originally was from allah their messengers are among the messengers of the strong-willed messengers in islam so they are the closest to us yet despite their being close to us the prophet said alaihis that any jew or christian or any human being who hears of me but dies without believing in that with which i have been sent shall be among the people of hell so this is a serious issue how many jews and christians are there how many non-muslims are there approximately five billion of them out there living at the moment how many have heard about the prophet many yet how many disbelief in islam and in the prophet sallam and in the quran many so those who received the message those who heard of the prophet with all these good things of him that came their way and still rejected his message rejected accepting him rejected learning about islam when they die they will go straight to hell and this is not extreme at all because if you ask any christian what happens to shaykh asam who is a devout muslim as seems to us and who he who calls to islam and teaches people and according to his religion he does good things what is his fate on the day of judgment any christian would tell you as long as he doesn't believe in jesus christ to be his savior he's bound to hell for eternity every single religion has the same concept if you don't believe in drama then you will go to hell if they believe in hell because they believe in reincarnation so in the next life after you die you probably going to be a fish or a mouse if you go to the jews if you're not from the sons of israel you're doomed to hell and to us all of humanity are mules that we should use even if they look human they are not as to be respected one second please so all of this indicates to you that there is something that should be adhered to there's some something that should be sought after and that is the truth if you're a christian if you're a jew if you are a follower of any other religion i urge you to do your due diligence take only half an hour of your time in your life just to look at what islam preaches if someone comes to you with an investment and tells you that this investment the return of it is 500 folds and the possibility of loss is zero and you say nah there's nothing like this wouldn't you be regretful and remorseful if in two three years time you see your friends who had invested in it are now multi-millionaires while you are where you are wouldn't you have hoped that you gave half an hour just to look into it and to study it islam is far more than that islam is your salvation you have to study half an hour be objective ignore the issue of hijab polygamy the things that are controversial to some who don't know what is the wisdom behind that ignore all of that all what you have to do is look at what islam preaches meaning what are the good things in islam one percent five percent ten percent thirty percent eighty percent and it's more than that but i'll assume it is eighty percent only what are the bad things you don't like about islam 10 20 now if you try to look into other religions you will find it reversed or even worse you'll find that what you like in other religions is less than 20 and what you dislike and disapprove is more than 80 percent yet it is human nature to make a choice is difficult islam is a religion of nature meaning that it's a natural thing it calls your nature it talks to your nature it addresses your natural needs unlike other religions that prohibit you from getting married prohibiting you from doing this or that while your natural needs acquire it then why aren't you thinking about islam now this is the warning of the prophet you may say but what's in islam is also found in christianity and judaism it's not the same islam has the divine miracle that will remain until the day of judgment islam started about 14 centuries ago and it's the fastest religion in the world the spread of islam is huge masha'allah and it's enormous what is the miracle of islam when people come and say okay jesus christ gave life to the death cured the leopard and the blind and the death and the mute and he had so many miracles musa peace be upon him had the staff that turned into a snake he had the ability to split the sea so that he would cross with the sons of israel while drowning pharaoh and his troops he had many miracles other religions claim the same muslims believe in most of this if not all because it's mentioned in the quran it's mentioned the sunnah however we usually tell the people that we would like you to prove to us that these miracles did take place and they did exist usually people are stunned they can't prove any of this because there are no deaf blind leopards there are no dead to be brought back to life all these miracles were limited to a specific space and time and these miracles have gone with the death or with the ascension of the messenger as in the case of jesus peace be upon him we don't believe that he died no muslim believes that he was ever killed or harmed or died so all of these religions cannot prove their religion their miracles while muslims are proud to always present the quran that has remained for 14 to 15 centuries unchanged it's the same quran that was revealed to the prophet the miracle is that it is preserved in the chest of men and women they memorize it by heart letter by letter and it's written in millions and millions of copies allah the almighty has pledged upon himself and guaranteed that he would preserve this quran by saying [Music] it is we allah says who have bestowed this reminder who have revealed this quran from on high and it is we who shall preserve it intact and allah azzawajal kept his pledge without any doubt now one person like me who's been leading prayers almost for the past 33 years as an imam imagine that if i were to go and pray asha prayer tonight and i make a mistake in the recitation of the quran a nine-year-old child praying behind me can easily correct me by raising his voice where everyone in the masjid can hear him and reciting the verse correctly a nine-year-old younger than my grandchildren yet he corrects me because this is part of allah azza keeping the quran intact you know how many people memorize the quran in the world they are in the tens of millions tens of millions of muslims memorize the quran by heart million muslims speak the language of the quran and their natives if not more and there are few hundred millions more non-natives who speak the arabic fluently so the quran was preserved the language is still spoken and preserved what more evidence do you need you want scientifical scientific evidences you can go through the various articles talking about the miracles that the quran hinted to why do i say hint it to because the quran is not a book of science it's not a book of geology or uh as astronomy or embryology but it gives you signs that prove to you that this is impossible to be man-made a layman from arabia who had never traveled outside of arabia who had never studied in colleges or universities when he puts forward such a miracle a book that provides spiritual guidance that provides scientific theories miracles facts that scientists still date are struggling and confused how this is possible and when you fail as a human being to acknowledge that this is from allah azzawajal this is not man-made simply because the prejudice in your chest the arrogance the pride of accepting a religion that does not suit your ancestors and was not practiced by your parents this is the separation between hell and heaven and this choice is yours so every non-muslim should be fair to themselves take half an hour of your life not of your day just take half an hour to talk about islam ask any of the duat the callers to islam the scholars the students of knowledge the imams of the masjid about any doubt you have you can come to me ask me about islam if i know i will tell you if i don't i would say i don't know i'm not gonna lie to you what would i lie to you and put myself in hell or in harm's way this doesn't make any sense so take half an hour of your whole life and devote it objectively to figure out whether islam is true or false in comparison to the religion you actually believe today and this can make it or break it for you believe me the depression you have the intimidation the anxiety you're going through the confusion the many times you felt that you need to commit suicide and end your life all of this would vaporize it will all disappear once you give yourself a chance to believe whether this religion is true or not and once you find out it's true then you will find the eternal peace in this life and in the hereafter in sha allah so um i think we don't have any questions for today because this is the first episode and i don't think it's wise to go to the second chapter but we will insha allah study the second chapter and take your questions on the first and the second chapter uh on thursday so until we meet next time i leave you for a minute my"
