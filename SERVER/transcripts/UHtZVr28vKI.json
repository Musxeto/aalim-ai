  "transcript": "noreen says i prayed sunnah fajr in the home and i came to the masjid and the comma was given and the congregation has started now bear in mind i did not pray to raqqa of tahitu masjid greeting of the masjid so i joined the fajr prayer after concluding the fajr prayer do i have to stand up and offer the haitian masjid the answer is no the question is why the prophet said allah any one of you enter the masjid he must not sit until he prays two raka's the answer would be you have just entered the masjid and prayed with the congregation this suffices you from the two raka's because you've already prayed two raka's or more with the fajr so there is no need for that at all"
