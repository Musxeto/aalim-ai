  "transcript": "why do we pray the and us are silently because the Prophet Isis and prayed it silently what do you want me to tell you why do we pray further loudly because the Prophet prayed it loudly so it is an issue of following obedience implementing the Sunnah and your life without any reason you don't need the justification for that I tell my son son go bring me some water please he says why all what he sees is someone punishing hitting him on his face and all what he sees his eyes swollen well why are you asking me when I tell you do something you do it you don't question me and Allah has the highest example soprano Sol Allah tells us to pray silently why do you ask this is how allah mandated it"
