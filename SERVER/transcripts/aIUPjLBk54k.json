  "transcript": "Maurice from Saudi yeah sure so my question is so my question is actually I'm asking regarding a relative of mine uh who recently came out of the closet so my question is regarding this confusion I have about the ties of relationship that I should be upholding should I God of ties with them or should I not invite him to okay should I not invite him to family parties or what kind of connection should I have with him okay first of all those who come out of the closet if you are able put them back again because this is the natural thing the terminology they came out of the closet means that they announce their homosexuality or their inclination of being transgenders or not the gender that Allah has created them in so a man comes and says I just came out of the closet and I feel like a female and I'm a female and address me as a female this is not permissible in any religion known to man and this is a western concept introduced by The Westerns trying to shove it down the throats of normal human beings and they have the media to back them up they have their forces and everyone doing whatever they can to shut mouths and to restrain people who dare to speak against it well we say as Muslims this is unacceptable as per the Quran the Sunnah how to deal with such people this is a sin like fornicating like consuming intoxicants like cheating like dealing in riba so if the person is keeping it to himself and not transgressing and influencing others and not publicizing it is not coming to my home wearing a drag queen as a drag queen no he's he's a man and nobody knows about him he doesn't speak about it publicly I should deal with him like any other human being and whatsoever is in his mind and between him and Allah it's between him and Allah I have nothing to do with it but if he is trying to transgress and spread his evil and ask people to join him and invite others to come out of the closet like him or participate in such filth in this case he has to be we have to not invite him to our Gatherings because it's an evil that is trying to spread Among Us it's like cancerous cells trying to spread so we have to uh keep him out of it and keep his limits and just maybe call him every now and then and give him dawah so that Allah May guide him"
