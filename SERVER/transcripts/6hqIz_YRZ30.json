  "transcript": "foreign oh my God pees TV TV the solution for Humanity person is going to follow the way of his friend so you have to be careful the most important thing in raising our kids is not following our opinions or other opinions one of the qualities you have to look in the man that he will look after you and the girl has to pay them this is exactly what happens and he needs to have a supplement with religious commitment is that a lot of the Muslims nowadays don't this is foreign Bullock and today we will discuss Iman and the pillars of Iman and again with me today I have Sheikh rahimakati foreign and last but not least the first pillar of Faith so we finished in the last episode obviously the pillars of Islam and now we're going to Iman alhamdulillah first pillar of Faith or Iman is to believe in Allah so what does it mean to believe in Allah you believe in his Oneness and you believe in its existence and the existence of Allah is well established and people the majority of you study the history of mankind only minorities or handful of people who denied his existence because the belief in the creator of the heavens and the Earth or a Creator it is something innate something instinctive built within every human being in Islam we have many proofs for those who deny the existence of Allah will find they claim that they don't believe like in our time in the time of difficulties they return to Allah exactly exactly that's what I want to say there are many proofs there are rational proofs number one the moment he says there is no God according to Logic the Greek logic or theological you know principles of logic that means there is God yes sir tell him thank you very much you just said it and he said there is no God that in itself is a proof that there is God how you don't deny something doesn't exist you don't deny something doesn't exist when you deny something it means that thing exists in the first place do you deny absence do you deny nothingness it has to be there for you to deny it has to be there that's why you deny its existence so that's number one no argument will take place about something doesn't exist no argument will take place about something doesn't exist for example might be arguing about this table or the color but the table is there so if we are arguing I'm saying it though you see the support of the seat is black and you say no it is white black white the third one steps and the guy says stop hold on let me have a look so he will conclude that there is a topic that's why there is an argument going on because if there is no topic no argument in the first place so are you following so now when we have two parties one party said there's no God another party says saying there is God it means what it means there is God otherwise there will not be any argument in the first place so always the argument takes place only in when something exists and you can argue with those atheists who say well I don't believe in God you say fine just let us use our intellect this gray matter let us use it you and I now we exist that's why we are arguing so how can you explain to me your existence how did you come into being and I will help you to do that okay either you came from nothing or you created yourself or you are created and you will not find the fourth probability so let us have a look at these three possibilities or probabilities did you come from nothing this is ruled out because nothing gives nothing so that's ruled out secondly did you create yourself the answer no so what's left what's left that you are created that you are created by a creator by a creator who is that Creator we call it Allah we call it God almighty you want to call it something else you call it mother nature that's not the point for argument but there is a Creator who created you in the first place now you are putting him in the corner this guy so he might pop up the question or pose the question and who created that creator then I'm fine I will answer your question but do you accept that there is a Creator oh yes yes I do now I want to know who created that Creator the question is wrong in the first place because if he is a creator then you will be in a vicious circle who created that Creator and end but the answer is I want to ask you another question what is the origin the existence of this Creator or the non-existence of this creator fine if he says the origin is the non-existence of the creator that there is no Creator then let's ask him well if there is no Creator there shouldn't be any creation but the fact there is a creation you and I so this proves that the origin is not the non-existence the proof is that the existence of the Creator who is the first and the last of the Bible called the alfandi Omega so this is one of the proofs the rational proves about the existence of God and mighty they are proofs scriptural mentioning the scriptures in the Quran in the Bible in the Torah new testament old testament they are material proofs which are the Medicals that happened upon the hands of The Messengers and our Prophet Muhammad sallam one day he was giving the sermon Friday sermon and the man came and asked him to pray for rain and there was no single cloud in the sky he raised his hands and the sky immediately was covered with clouds and by the time he came down they came walking in the rain and the rain continued for one week so much so that the man came that second Friday and the prophet sallam happened to be giving the khutbad delivering the sermon and he said oh prophet of Allah the houses because they were made of mud started to crumble livestock started to die and bearish the floods are washing them away so ask Allah to hold it and this is here the material evidence the prophet saws around us not on us and he was doing like this with his hand in the air and the clouds are departing in the sky and they came out walking in a sunny day and many they experienced this you are in need depressed you need help you say oh God help me and you get the help that means someone there heard your supplications what's a very interesting point you mentioned is that you know until recent times you know the majority of people do believe in existence of God and you'll find that in the Quran Allah himself most of the time is addressing the people who believe in God but are making sure worshiping others and I think it's maybe only one or the only verse that I'm aware of is the verse where Allah says this is actually this Ayah is what we just mentioned that's why we need to understand the Quran the Quran the way he dealt with those atheists agnostic they are rational proofs in the Quran but again like you said this is a minority we don't see many many verses addressing because these people didn't exist I mean and just from my input here I remember when University was studying some origin of the western civilization and we covered some extent how this atheism actually arose in as a large movement and you'll find a lot of it is connected to a person like Darwin who obviously really he's the guy who started all of the the major atheist movement is that he was a man who was a bible-believing Christian until he went on his voyage and he had a book with him called Lyle's principle of geology biology so this was proven science on geology and biology and it was contradicted in many parts of the Bible so then he disbelieved in the Bible because he said if this is from the creator of the heavens and the Earth and he's saying the Earth is flat when the earth isn't and he's saying the Earth is such and such years old but it isn't and various other things he then disbelieved in the Bible and went that step further to disbelief in God altogether whereas we know in Islam and even now they are discovering scientific facts what do you mention is a good point actually and the problem this what we call scientific errors sometimes this could be due to the translation because the Bible was not in Greek Jesus Christ did not speak in Greek so it was in Hebrew or Aramaic and it is Eastern language and it is full of metaphors so to read and a scripture in the Easter language through Greek eyes it is a problem Greek glasses that's the problem and then you blame the scripture we really talking about some of the you know very uh the different proofs and logical rational proofs behind the existence of a Creator what have you got to you know add to this well actually we went through a lot of it when we commented on the shahada the Kalima we're saying that there is no God worthy of being worshiped other than Allah azzawajal so the existence of Allah azzawajal is something that humans are programmed to believe and there isn't a lot of evidences addressing the issue of atheism because they did not exist except recently when they went against the church usually people believed in a God or gods so you would not find people coming saying that there is no God except for the exception of pharaoh who thought that he was God himself and everyone around him knew that he was a liar a God does not go to the bathroom a God does not need to be taken care of when getting sick a God is Not created so driver not go into more detail because it is so vast of a subject that we Muslims could talk about for ages about Allah's Beauty Allah's names Allah's attributes about Allah's actions it goes endless but as you mentioned earlier this is the top of the list when it comes to the pillars of Iman and we all know that the pillars of Iman are six they believe in Allah his angels His prophets his books Divine books and in the Hereafter or the day of judgment and finally in the Divine decree whether it is good or a bad as it may seem to us so I believe that we should then move on if you allow me sure to the second pillar which is the belief in Allah's Angels now what is the difference between Islam and Iman so people say why are there five pillars of Islam and six pillars of Iman isn't it all part of the same religion and the answer as Scholars say without prolonging the answer in a nutshell they say that when they are mentioned alone they mean the same so when we say Islam and we talk about it it's the same thing and when I'm I speak about Iman Islam is also included but when we address them together like in the case of skin the poor and the needy when they're separate they all mean the same when they're together this has a meaning and the other one has a different meaning so Islam and Iman when combined together Islam means the things that appear we don't know about what's in your heart and Iman means the things that you are believing your conviction we cannot know it then this is Allah's knowledge outward actions in the inward when they're together yes when they are together and that is why we find verses in the Quran amen the nomads say that we believe Allah say to them do not say we believe say we have accepted Islam because the belief has to yet to be manifested the Iman or the belief in the Angels what are the angels angels are creatures of Allah have you seen them nope have any of us seen them no so the atheist those who do not believe they say then they do not exist and this is not logical because I haven't seen electricity no one has seen electricity we've seen the traces of electricity no one has seen our souls and just because I cannot see something that does not mean it doesn't exist and I want to see in Love No One have seen your brains so I cannot go to someone who's an atheist and say listen you have no brains why I haven't seen them so do you believe in the Angels is to believe in the Unseen and this is something that the Muslims are highly proud of because Allah complimented them of believing in the Unseen but what are the Angels the angels are creatures of Allah as she asalam pointed out before they are created from light the Gin are created from fire and the humans are carried from clay so they are created from light they have different levels and their number is unknown to anyone no one can count them the prophet tells us Allah that on the seventh heaven there is a house called it's like the Kaaba on Earth and pilgrims of the Angels come to it every single day they come 70 000 of them and that was from the creation of all creation until the end of time so you can imagine that Allah azzawajal has so many angels not only that the prophet said in the seven Heavens there isn't a place of a hand spam without you finding an angel either standing in prayer or bowing or prostrating there isn't any it's packed with angels and the features of these angels that they do not sin and they obey whatever Allah azzawajal orders them to do and uh head of these angels are the greatest three and these three are responsible for giving life subhanallah Archangel jibril he is responsible for the Revelation which is the life of the hearts the angel Mikhail is responsible for ascending the Reign down which gives life to the whole of Earth and Israel is the Angel who is responsible for blowing in the trumpet where all the dead would be resurrected for the day of judgment and be given life and of course I mean even we have the angels on uh obviously recording on our shoulders that certain angels have certain names that we know Allah has told us other ones we don't know they have certain duties as he mentioned gibril the greatest of the Angel his duty was to bring the most important form of life which is the life of the hearts of the Hulu which is to with the Revelation from Allah and jibril he's the one who brought the Revelation to all of the prophets and obviously is in charge of the rain in Israel we know he's in charge of the blowing in the horn the trumpet on the day of judgment that will it will killed who was ever on the land and then the second time to bring back to life those who are the dead to bring the dead back to life to be held accountable for what they did in this life on the day of judgment and as you mentioned we have the ones who are with us on the right and left ones who are writing down are good and bad Deeds so on the day of judgment you have no excuse and Allah he doesn't oppress anybody and he will see on the day of judgment everything has written down the biggest and smallest sins that you have done in this Dunya and also we have the ones who are responsible for example who's in charge of the Hellfire medic and we have for example the ones who hold up of the gender as well and the one with one and we have also the ones who hold the Throne of and there's many descriptions to the angels and some one of the greatest descriptions Allah when he mentions there's a difference between the angels and the humankind is that they do not sin they do not do mistakes they are constantly in obedient and never go against his command and here I just want to point out something very early I always like to focus when we talk about issues of Iman and belief issues in Islam in general what do we gain from this because it's not just something we have information about but what do we gain from it I'll give two examples the first example is what we just mentioned the fact they do not disobey Allah which they were commanded to do and this is an encouragement to the human being to also be like that to try to we have the expression when they say he's like an angel he doesn't do anything wrong I mean obviously you might all of us have mistakes as the professor sent me a very clear that all of the children of Adam they make mistakes and the best of those who make mistakes are those who repent from them so we're going to make mistakes we're not going to be Angels but it's still it's an encouragement to encourage you to try to do as best as you can as a Believer and secondly the fact that everything is being written down when you think about that Iman because you get weak in your Iman all of us do and the fact that Allah is he's any very compassionate very merciful all for giving subhanahu it kind of makes us sometimes stuff a lot but take advantage of that and fall into sin into Arrow when we remind yourself also you have two angels with you who are writing everything down that kind of you know it helps you as well to strive to do good deeds and the fact that when you were talking about the belief in Allah that there's proofs and he would say you can't see but there's proofs of the existence the actions of them when it came to for some of the battles when they were battling Allah sent his angels because also some of the duties of the Angels is to protect the human beings there's aims just for protecting you and these Angels were sent as an extra protection I guess extra backup to say for protecting the Believers help them Victory ever be victorious in this battle and they would see the effect of the Angels there on the battlefield with him and the angels have been seen by the way it's important we point out but they're not seen in their original form the only ones who ever saw them in the original form was the prophet Muhammad when he had 600 Wings they covered up as far as you could see in the Horizon and he obviously needed something and he very massive and it's not something normal for the human being to see but he did used to come in the form of humans as well and they would seem in that form but not in his original form so they have been seen and we see uh one of the battles I can't remember if it's the the quraish they said they saw men on Horseback who were fighting with the Muslims and they and they said that they would actually be coming behind them with their sword and they would see that the head go without even seeing anybody as well so I mean obviously they were clearly there on the battlefield in general we go back to this belief and it's not difficult to believe in this once you believed in the basic which is the belief in Allah you've seen his signs you're going to believe in the angels and everything that he has revealed to you to believe in what's I think an interesting point is we've obviously heard however Angels they never seen and they never disobey Allah and I remember when we did some studies and they were talking about this point about the belief in angels and they said that some of the scholars had said that the righteous human is considered to be of a higher status than the angel because the angel cannot sin he's not tested whereas we have that thing where we can choose right or wrong so the one who is human is very righteous and stays away from all the Temptation he can be raised in his status even to that above the angels and we've got about one minute left so I don't know if you'd like to end any particular points on this topic there are so many angels that are there to protect us and this gives you extreme love to Allah azzawajal who created all of this Perfection for us there is an angel his work is to blow the soul and defeat us and to write whether he is happy or doomed in Hell whether what is his provision how long he would live there are angels that are Protectors of us there are angels that come into our houses only to pray to Allah and seek forgiveness for us and that is where the Prophet tells us take out of your house these things that prevent the angels from coming such as statues portraits pictures dogs all of these prevent the angels that seek forgiveness for us at the side of Allah azzawajal from coming into the house and so many people are deprived from these angels and the angels are not there the Devils take their places at the end of them just to point out really quick also obviously which we did mention whenever I mentioned everything I was just a quick reminder of What Muslim believes also the angel of death and you see the angel of death when he comes to yank out the soul and you see how the human body reacts to him coming and the human being when the soul is about to get pulled out you see how the eye is going how the body racks it also shows you that president of that angel which also once again proves to you and it reminds you to be ready for that that Saint to be at the best of States as a Muslim but when that does come to you as it will come to all of us well again we've come to the end of this episode for the viewers inshallah we've discussed today and recapped really on our previous episodes on the the belief in Allah and we heard some logical and rational proofs of Hell there has to be Creator and then we went on to discuss the belief in angels and the various information that they are created from the light and they have different tasks one of the most noble being in jibril who Bringing Down the Revelation so please tune in again in our next episode as we continue talking about the pillars of Iman and until next time foreign foreign welcome again to another episode I'm your host Ismail Bullock and in the previous episode we discussed the first two pillars of faith the belief in Allah and the belief in his angels now we will move on to the belief in his books and in his Messengers under him since we're in front of me belief in his books explain to us we know the Quran and we know from other Christianity that this is a Bible and this so do we believe in the Bible for example what are these books we're talking about it's good that we you know pointed this out here is a confusion for a lot of Muslims and a lot of non-muslims what do we believe when it comes to the scriptures that Allah sent to His prophets and it's important we talk about the belief in the scriptures or in the books that it comes in the plural form because we believe in all of the books all of the scriptures that were sent by Allah To His prophets and Messengers and in the Quran Allah mentioned some of them did mention all of they mentioned some of them by name and the ones that we believe in that were mentioned by name we believe in all the books obviously but the ones that were mentioned by name and specific to us as Muslims was obviously the Quran itself and the children the Torah and the NGO or the gospel and the Psalms of War so these are the ones that are mentioned in the Quran of the Psalms is called English dawood or David so these are the ones we believe in in they were mentioned how do we believe that these scriptures are still the description to be following no because we believe the Quran was the last Revelation sent to All Mankind and that's the reason why it hasn't been changed until now and it won't be changed until the end of time inshallah because Allah sent our beloved Prophet Muhammad sallam as the last messenger to all of mankind and in order for his religion the religion of Islam to stay and for people to be able to follow it then the scripture has to be protected that's why Allah he mentioned that he sent down he said that we barely we sent down in the Quran with the names of the Quran and barely we will protect it has set itself and promised to protect the Quran so we as Muslims we believe in the other scriptures but we believe the only true scripture to follow is the book of Allah and we believe that the other ones will change but they did come obviously in the original form it doesn't mean everything was changed in it and it's important we remind ourselves and remind the Muslim viewers that you cannot be a true Muslim if you don't believe in the Bible if you don't believe you don't believe in the engine the engineer and you don't believe in the the Torah as well obviously translated as the Bible the NGO okay but the thing is now obviously we're talking about the original form the one that's been changed and he still has obviously some things that are authentic in it they're going through great changes throughout the year and obviously they admit this themselves the first 300 plus years where was it they don't know then it was changed around different writers different this every few years they change it and make it new versions of it whereas the Quran it never changed I have a story but I don't want to take any too much of the episode myself so I'll come back to it when it comes to scripture just remind me until later I have a story talk about the three scriptures to give an example of the change and not change just one point that should relate to what you said about you know the fact that the changing Etc what Springs to mind is if we look back in history you go to this event that took place called the Council of nicaea around 3 25 of the time of Jesus and you'll find at that time they had 56 gospels and many of these were you know writings maybe more like a Hadith than the actual Bible or the actual in jail but they were teaching things written down by the Disciples of Jesus so you can imagine they'll be very authentic in his and you find that the Roman emperor Constantine that he basically decided that he would burn 52 of these gospels and keep four so that's you know you see a lot of the real teachings of the Jesus message written down by the disciples were all burnt and then part of what we have now is the Bible is a mixture of that with the writings of Paul and obviously the what they call to be the Old Testament that's something I wanted to mention there but I believe you had something to add to this the true Christianity the master of Christ did not reach the Europeans this is a fact the Christianity or the message of Christ reached them already distorted and they not the guy who distorted the massive Christ was Saint Paul so the true teachings of Jesus Christ never ever reached them so what they think it is Christianity today it's not the message this is a fact and people who are really sincere and seeking the truth they have to take the matter seriously and the Bible is not the injeal Bible is just means a book I believe so it is just means a book and it is divided as we know into the Old Testament and the New Testament the Old Testament supposedly to be equivalent to the Torah which he was giving to Moses and the New Testament supposedly to be the in jail so we Muslims when we say we believe we believe in that original Massachusetts was inspired and revealed to Jesus or to Moses I don't have anything to add more to what the shoe had said except that our belief is part of our Iman as shahbrahim said that we believe in the whole picture that is anything that was revealed from Allah we believe in it but this does not mean necessarily that we follow these books because in our belief we're distorted and the Quran is dominating all of this so we believe in a principle but we follow only the Quran which brings me also to the fact that a lot of the Christians don't believe that the New Testament is related to Jesus and I met one missionary in Saudi Arabia which is quite weird and I knew that there were a lot of them working there undercover and some of them maybe does not find it difficult to say that he does do this he was telling me that we do not as Christians believe that Jesus Christ was revealed to a book you only Muslims say that this was the angel he had the audacity to go even further so that he knows that he cannot have something to provide because the New Testament is not the wordings of Jesus peace be upon him it was not revealed to him it's a history of what's happened to him and even what happened after his death which definitely is not a revelation as Muslims we honor and love our book the Quran and we are proud to say no Nation on Earth can provide us with their own scripture that has not been changed not even one single letter for the past 15 centuries and it's not a new language it is the language that all the Arabs understand and it's a living language on the other side when you go to the Bible you'll find that the do a virgin is different than the new King's James virgin and every year they produce there are chapters and chapters books that are deleted from the King James version this form of alteration and Distortion means that this is not a Divine book that was preserved but when you come to Muslims to the Muslims their book has been preserved and it's not only in the written form it's preserved in their hearts they memorize it as we've seen so many times I make a mistake in pronouncing one verse everyone else corrects me even if I am reciting the Quran in my Masjid in Fajr prayer in the morning prayer and I make a single mistake a child of seven years of age would correct me the story I want to mention really quick about the change in the Quran and the other scriptures in earliest Islamic history about that that there was a Jewish man was living there is a Muslim State and Muslim majority but there were a few other religions and this guy has to be living there in Baghdad his his neighbor who was a scholar of Islam used to always call them to Islam and show them the book that Islam was the original truth hoping that he would accept Islam and the Jewish guy kept refusing sometimes they hadn't seen one another and one day he saw him that he was a Muslim and he was shot he said well what finally made you budge because they would debate and a lot of times when you debate you know with Christians or Jewish they'll say tell you yeah I know what you're saying is true but I just I don't want to be a Muslim I'm Christian I'm going to stay like that even though what you're saying is the truth so they admit it but he couldn't get the guy to change so he said what made you change he said I want to prove it to myself before I made that step so as I went down and I wrote out a whole bunch of copies of the total and then later on of the Bible later of the Quran and he said I went to and I changed it all around I put this in the front that in the back erased this added that from my own thing and just mixed it all up and he said all the Jews they bought it from me it sold out nobody ever said anything nobody ever noticed anything and he said then I went again to the Bible to do the same thing sold out you know once again nobody noticed anything from the Christians he said then I try to do it to the Quran he said immediately just with glencia he said they knew they said this is not the Quran the Muslim knew immediately and he said a book like this it has to be the book of Truth this has to be religion of Truth and he entered into Islam after this test had proved to him there was no doubt the Quran it's the only book that challenges the reader imagine a book any book you pick up you'll find the author is apologetic in the introduction and telling you if you find a mistake or this or type of graphical mistake please this is my address this is my email but the Quran from the beginning is challenging you this book has no doubt to add to that many people you've heard stories of people becoming Muslim because they I've heard stories where they said when I read this I said no one ever has the audacity of a man or anyone can come and say there's no doubt in this book so they said when I saw this I was like whoa you know this was so that's why I'm saying the book it challenges the reader it's telling you go it would have contained a lot of discrepancies which means if you find any discrepancy it is not from Allah that's simple so the Quran because it is meant to be the last Testament it is meant to be the guidance for the entire Humanity establishing the proof for the people about the truthfulness of the messenger ship of the Prophet salallahu so if anyone comes today what is the proof that this is from that Muhammad is one of the messengers of Allah will say this is the proof this is the Everlasting Miracle of prophet Muhammed so if you want to check whether he is a prophet of Allah a messenger of Allah or not let's read the Quran so this is the and the Quran is the Criterion I as a Muslim when I read any Scripture for example the Torah the Old Testament or the New Testament I can figure out this must be a fragment from what has been revealed why because I have the reference I check it and that's why Prophet Muhammad warned the Muslims not that you deny whatever the use of the Christians say nor a proof of because you never know but we have the reference which is the Quran and even the Christian theologians today they help you they have a Bible called Red Letter Bible okay so they would what they think these are the words of Christ they put them in red and if you make it just a small calculation you find it is very few pages I would like to point out for the viewers that it is not permissible for them the Muslims to go through the Bible to study the Bible it was the same thing I was about to mention myself and it's very important so yeah it is extremely important that this is not permissible for a Muslim to study any other book than the Quran because we have the ultimate truth one would say okay let's examine no you don't see that you're a healthy person and you go and throw yourself in places with viruses and bacteria and say let me test my immune system we have the ultimate truth but those who reach a certain level of knowledge who have a strong background and foundation in Islam yes they are entitled they are requested that sometimes to go through to study to compare Apple to Apple to show to the people that look at the differences and that is why the prophet is once the second caliph the second man reading a paper of the Torah so he told him what is this and he said oh prophet of Allah it's a paper of the Torah I found I just went through it and the prophet was angry with him he said that if Musa were to be alive today he would only follow me not because the prophet was doubting Omar was extremely knowledgeable but the prophet some wanted to preserve the purity of the Quran so that no one would mix other things to the Quran nor to the Sunnah and people would not be confused nowadays everything is settled the Quran is settled the Sunnah is settled and I give this warning to the youngsters especially who you know at the prime of their youth they think that yes I can debate I could do this let me study the Bible let me study the Old Testament the New Testament who said no first of all learn your religion it is not a good thing for a person to go and debate and look into the Bibles and he does not even know the interpretation of the Quran what is the meaning of this the I don't know so if you learn your book first then move on and I want to just add to which awesome exact thing I want to say but there's nothing to add to that but what the youngsters are doing now now they see that who have gone that route that's not for everybody that's for somebody who's specialist somebody has the ability and unfortunately like Chicago mentioned we see it's the Quran and what suffers is your understanding of the Quran this is also what I want to point out with this is this not the origin of the dawah of the Prophet Muhammad sahaba who had the ability they could have went to the Christians and said huh here's your Bible look at this page and look at this and they could have done that they could have used sahaba like they could have used it but they didn't use this style I'm not saying we don't do it I'm not saying it's not important but it's not the original form of dawah the original form we use for Dao is the Quran itself we use the Quran if we get to America to a level and that you waged that you had against them the major Jihad which is the Jihad of the Quran so this is the thing we need to point out to the Dua I'm glad we remember this now is because it's a common mistake that people make now in giving Tao is that they focus too much on the Bible and trying to bash with the Bible and actually that could cause more harm than good there is a stage for that but it's not a stage for everyone and it's not all the time and it's not the origin of how to give that word not only this I mean the mission it is they have changed their tactics they know that you are strong in this area you know the Bible but they know the weak link you're weak and you are the slab so they will attack you from that angle that so they will come to you and say there is a Hadith says this uh you don't know so this is the problem so first of all before you flex your muscle you have to understand your Islam so those Scholars when they started refuting like Islamic after he became an Imam in the Islamic teachings and mastered all the disciplines of knowledge the true Christianity the Mastery of Christ did not reach the Europeans this is a fact the Christianity or the message of Christ reached them already distorted and they not the guy who distorted the massive Christ was Saint Paul so the true teachings of Jesus Christ never ever reached them so what they think it is Christianity today it's not the message this is a fact and people who are really sincere and seeking the truth they have to take the matter seriously and the Bible is not the injeal Bible is just means a book I believe so it is just means a book and it is divided as we know into the Old Testament and the New Testament the Old Testament supposedly to be equivalent to the Torah which he was giving to Moses and the New Testament supposedly to be the in jail so we Muslims when we say we believe we believe in that original Mastery which was inspired and revealed to Jesus or to Moses this is the first pillar which is the belief in the prophets and Messengers and our belief in them that they are human beings but they are the Supreme and the cream of the human beings they are the creme de La Creme the top of the old top because they are the carriers of Allah's message to humanity you have a king or a president and he wants to send his ambassador to the people and Allah has the highest example of course he chooses someone who is perfect because he's a representative and who is better than the messages and Prophets to be sent with the Revelation from Allah and I think it's important to show the difference what is the difference between a prophet and the messenger there are so many interpretations but the most authentic opinion of Scholars is that a prophet is sent to his people without a new legislation he is ruling with the legislation of a messenger before him while a messenger has been sent with a new Sharia with a new law with a new religion and that is why we have the numbers of Messengers far less than the numbers of prophets because the prophets were so many they were like teachers they were like kings ruling their subjects while The Messengers there is a Hadith that is disputed upon its authenticity has authenticated While others did not which first two their number being as 315. messenger throughout the history we have them mentioned in the Quran less than that as for the prophets also there is a Hadith but this Hadith is not authentic authenticated by some nevertheless we have to know that they were the perfect of all humanity and each one was given a certain Miracle a certain characteristics certain qualities that would Excel them over the people and here we all know that Allah sent for all nations so the number is so great so every nation they had a messenger we have sent Every Nation a messenger proclaiming them worship Allah and shine all these false objects of worship then we mentioned the numbers the numbers in the Quran that we mentioned was 25 by name and obviously the ones who were mentioned in the Quran the most story was a story about who about Muslim and this is something that we would like to point out to the animals that the prophet Musa even Isa Jesus and obviously one of the goals one of the things we want to gain from the stories of the prophets and the stories is reflection so we can reflect on what happened in the past Nations and benefit ourselves from Muslims from their stories that's what we have for example the whole story of Yusuf Islam and the whole chapter the whole chapter of the Quran very long chapter with all of these beautiful stories that happened from his childhood until he reached what he reached as a prophet Allah we have the smaller chapter of new of Noah and what he went through calling to the pure message of monotheism and what he faced from his people and that and The Story Goes On and On Ibrahim new chapter about Mary about Maryam and I was in her school all of the messages it's all in the Quran and this is an actually a call to our non-muslim viewers to actually go back and to read the Quran read about these stories and how many Christians have really been affected when they go back and they read the chapter of Miriam and they see the belief of the Muslims in the prophets and perhaps in the next episode we could talk a little bit about our belief and Jesus Christ May the peace and blessings of the Lord be upon him that's right well like I said we've come to the end of this episode to the viewers obviously today we've discussed the belief in well quite detailed the books and how we believe in the different Revelations but they changed over time and that Allah sent down the Quran as the final revelation is the Criterion between wrong and right and what as a final Revelation to Mankind and we touched upon the messengers we've just started to talk about The Messengers and that to Every Nation a messenger was sent so tune in next time be sure not to miss the next episode where we continue on the belief of Muslims in the messages and until next time her a remember foreign"
