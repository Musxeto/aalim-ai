  "transcript": "alhamd we move on to study the chapter that deals with and is translated into English as seclusion it is when you put yourself intentionally in the Masjid and not leave it except for what is needed this is called and Allah mentioned it in the Quran and the prophet Alat encouraged on it by doing it himself and also his companions and the reward of it is great and high but it is not mandatory it is only Sunnah and it's recommended and what is the use what are the benefits of one would say don't we always encourage people to stay away from deviant sects and their doings so isn't part of what they're doing and the answer is definitely not takes time once in a year and it's only 10 nights of the year and it is so great that those who have tried it would not think of leaving it what are the benefits of each one of us needs from time to time to be alone with himself to be alone and think and contemplate we are in this life like things put in a windmill we keep on moving and running and turning unable to stop and think from the beginning of the day till we go to sleep people who are not practicing they don't have this at all not only those who are not practicing even those who are practicing they're so engaged in so many things but they don't have time for themselves to contemplate to reflect about what they had done that is why you need these 10 nights to reignite recharge your heart because when you sit these 10 nights in what are you doing I'm sitting with my buddies with my friends with chitchatting laughing jokes playing games in the Masjid mashallah this is not this is summer camp maybe this is Sunday activities maybe but this is not is that you go and you talk to no one you occupy your day and night by Prayer by reciting the Quran by making Vick and believe me once you do this after 3 hours you feel bored because I'm not used to this I need music I need movies I need something to make me chill and make me relax I need a friend to talk to so I go to my friend and my friend is not paying any attention mention he's making VI he's reading the Quran whenever I talk to him he saids M yes no that's it after a day or two you start to taste the feeling the beauty of being alone of thinking you start to look at people and see mashallah this guy has been praying for 7 hours and he's still doing it and he's over 70 that's strange that guy mallah is reading the Quran and he finishes so much of the Quran masallah that guy is making Vick that guy is and I'm the only one who's just watching people I have something wrong so is one of the great deeds in Islam however some Scholars said that can only be in three masjids Alam Al Masid of of Alina MWI and in Jerusalem and this is the opinion of albani may Allah have mercy on his soul and other Scholars because the prophet said that there is no except in these three masjids but the majority of Scholars like and other Scholars said no this Hadith means that the perfect and the most rewardable is in these three masjids but it is per ible to do it in other masjids because Allah stated in the Quran that when you are in you should not approach women and do not approach women while you are making in the m and he did not say the three Masid he said any Masid so on one hand people restricted to be only in the three Masid on the other hand people made possible in any place even in prayer Halls even in offices even in any place that people pray in and this is also wrong and the most authentic opinion is that is permissible in any Masjid that has J that Friday is being prayed in why because if you're going to stay for 10 nights what will you do in Friday if they don't have a Friday you'll be forced to leave and go to a Masjid but this is not the way it should be you should from the start have your in a Masjid where it has a Friday speech but prayer holds no this is not permitted and it's not acceptable moving on to Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her who will read that for us narrated AA the wife of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to practice IA in the last 10 days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice IA after him in another narration he used to perform every Ramadan he would enter his place when he has sprayed F now this Hadith made some Scholars say that the prophet used to enter when he prayed F but the prayer of fer means that he is making on the daytime what about the night before it because the night before it is the beginning of the day so Scholars differ and the most authentic opinion is that the prophet would begin his after Sunset he would pray and he would start his but he would not enter the tent Des at or the place where he makes except after and this is the most authentic opinion when to begin the answer is after Sunset so for me if today is 20 when the sun sets this indicates that the 21st has begun right so once the sun sets I enter my because the beginning of the last 10 nights is the 21st and when do I come out from my is it f the answer is it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is no you exit from your when the last day of Ramadan is over and the last day of Ramadan is over when the sun sets so after praying M you go home if you would like to stay until fer this is up to you but it is not part of Ramadan because if the sun sets today do we pray if tomorrow isid no why because Ramadan is over and that is why if someone makes omra After the Sunset of the last day of Ramadan is he considered to be performing om in Ramadan and he has the reward of Hajj with the prophet the answer is no it must have been before sun set so so in this Hadith we learn that the prophet used to all every year offers and so did his wives after him only one year the prophet skipped of course that is when he is residing there are for example when he went to the conquest of mecah it was in Ramadan did he make he was traveling but through his stay in Medina he never skipped except once as inar when he started his he had a tent for himself and for Aisha and it appeared that Aisha was responsible because she's the first one who requested the prophet's permission and then ha came and requested permission from AA and haa and AA were always on the same team so ha requested and AA immediately gave her the permission when Zab saw this she came and put her tent as well not caring about not caring about anyone when the prophet came after F and he saw these tents he said what is this the Masid is is full of tents I had one only for me they said this is for AA this is for Zab this is for H and then the prophet figured it out and said are they seeking Allah's pleasure no by Allah they're not seeking Allah's pleasure it's their jealousy only move all the tents out and I'm not making and the prophet skipped we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right assalamu alaykum and welcome back so that Ramadan the prophet Alam did not offer however after they learned their lesson in sha the prophet offered 20 days as a compensation for the 10 days he added 10 more days of but since then the prophet continued to make as mother AA tells us may Allah be pleased with her so if you go to what do you do well Scholars say you spend your time in worshiping Allah but they made an exception and that is if a scholar goes to is it permissible for him to dedicate some time to teaching people Scholars some of them said no no he shouldn't others said well this is one of the best forms of getting closer to Allah is by teaching others so yes but providing it does not take a lot of his time and that is why a lot of our Scholars like Allah have mercy on his soul used to devote a portion of every night in the last 10 nights of Ramadan to give a lesson in Alam until he died so this was his habit and it was attended by thousands of people mashallah it was always on the roof he used to give it and usually it was between and and it was full of knowledges alhamdulillah it's all been recorded and you can get a lot of benefit out of it so so other than that what can I do you stay there make vick read beneficial books no novels huh you read books that about about Hadith about and make every now and then it's okay to chitchat for couple of minutes just to refresh yourself and go back okay what about if I have to go to the toilet is it permissible the answer is yes and what about if I have to eat eat well if they can bring you the food then you have to eat in the Masjid but if eating in the Masjid would make it dirty or smelly or it's not permissible in the Haram for example it's not permissible to bring food only dates and water so if this is the case it is permissible for you to go out and eat your meal and come back but while doing so don't go shopping don't go traveling around and looking at prices just go go for what you went out for and come back Hadith number 208 also sheds the light on some of the things that are permissible for us and what are not permissible for us to do narrated Aisha Allah's Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to let his head in the house while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair when in EA he used not to enter the house except for a need of human in another narration she said I would not enter the house except for a necessity while the patient is in it and I wouldn't ask about his health except while passing by In This Hadith mother AA tells us that the prophet used to let his head in the house while he was in the and if you don't know the prophet's house one would think who this is something from Allah the prophet's neck is so long that his head goes there no no no no don't over exaggerated the prophet's house was separated by from the Masjid by a small wall by actually a door so all what the prophet had to doam was open the door and let his head in while he's doing and what would mother AA do she would wash his hair and apply oil to it and come that hair of the Prophet which indicates that it is permissible for a woman to touch her husband in as long as this touching is not part of intimacy normal touching when you're in don't say don't touch me or put it on the table I can't take something from you because I might touch you no this is okay intimacy is not permissible she says that the prophet would not come in except for the human needs such as answering the call of nature this is the human needs that would allow the prophet to come out from the Masjid so if a person needs to shower is it permissible yes it is a person who is inaf can change his clothes can shower and clean himself there is nothing wrong in that some of the brothers may stay 10 days in the Masjid with the same clothes they smell bad and after one two days maybe they have smell after five six days they have odor on the ninth day they have odir it is so bad that you would say whoa what is this so no Islam is a religion of cleanliness you go and shower perfume yourself and come back change your clothes no problem and in that mother AA tells us about herself she says while I am in I would never enter the house except for a necessity and if I enter the house and I find one of my family members is ill I would not stop by and say how are you today are you feeling well no I would while walking back I would say I hope you're feeling well and move it shows you that time should not be wasted outside of the Masid even to visit a sick person now a lot of the times people ask is it permissible for us to for example follow a funeral if we pray funeral prayer in the Masjid and then they're taking it to bury it can we follow it Scholars say no you can't if I heard that someone is ill can I go out and visit him as Scholars say you cannot you cannot meaning that if you do your would be cut and interrupted not that it is Haram because the whole process of is Sunnah so even if you don't complete it even if you make one and leave it's okay and Scholars say what is the minimum of is there a minimum for it some Scholars say one day some Scholars say half a day meaning a day or night and some Scholars say 1 Hour 1 hour if you intend that I'm making between for example and I'm staying there for an hour and I intend to be like so it can happen and it appears that Allah's grace and favor is so great that we would not restrict it the following Hadith well let's postpone this to the second episode if you have questions if you don't well it appears you do yes brother regarding nice if we pray isan congregation and fan congregation so we are getting the whole Saab for whole reward for the whole night so what's your opinion if he gets ler than that usually if you pray you get half of the night as a reward the prophet said as if he prayed and whoever prays F in congregation as if he prayed the whole night but he did not pray the whole night yet the prophet said whoever prays with the IM until he finishes Allah will reward him and this is especially in specifically in Ramadan therefore if you pray and in but you don't pray with the IM you will not be rewarded night prayer of Ramadan you'll be rewarded like any other night but you will not get the reward of Ramadan yes brother assalam alayum sh is it permissible to perform at home because in mid most of the corners are reserved for the IM or the muin I've stated before that there is no at all except in mids and specifically the mids that have jum prayer but if a Masjid does not have a jum prayer yet it is a full-fledged Masjid it is permissible for a person to make but only for the seven days in then he has to attend J as for the IM and the MU they have their own houses but the is done in the Masid itself so usually what we do is we designate the last corner of the Masjid and we put a screen and people sit and sleep there and eat there they have a pillow they have a mattress they have a blanket and they spend the time there not that they go to the imam's house or to the M's house this is not part of because it's outside of the mids is it not for to do no no no no it is not at all F when you say it's f means that if no one does it they're all sinful but the consensus of Scholars they all agree that it is must it's a Sunnah if no one does it up to you giving the choice of cutting off the and following the funeral or visiting the sick what will be advantages do you have the permission to cut your no in the sense like suppose if I want to earn Saab by attend following the funeral or visiting the sick so what would be advisable can I no no no no no this is a different story if you are in your you must not come out neither to follow a funeral or to visit a sick person the theab is to remain in your The Only Exception would be if that there is someone who is close to you like your father or a relative who's about to die and if you don't visit him this would cause a lot of trouble and if he dies and you still don't attend this is no you have to go and cut your and visit that sick person or follow his funeral if you know that the consequences are far greater this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
