  "transcript": "Santa says my question is regarding the property earned through corruption well if you earn money through corruption this can be through RIBA through stealing people's wealth through bribes through whatever other means and generally speaking you have to cleanse your wealth because whatever you got and invested in your property this is how long money you have to cleanse if it's stolen you cannot keep it you have to return it to the person if you earned it from how our money we have to look if you can afford to give in charity something equivalent to the Haram earned in this case the property becomes clean and pure and Hallett if you're unable due to your poverty and this is the only thing that you have to live in Islam does not tell you to go and live on the street and sell it as long as this is a necessity to you repent to Allah ask for forgiveness and insha Allah you will be forgiven analyze L knows best"
