  "transcript": "sophian says a christian woman who says jesus peace be upon him is one of the three or considers jesus as god and not a prophet is it permissible for a muslim man to marry her or to marry a jewish woman what type of christian or jewish women can muslim men marry now this question is frequently asked and the problem is that people usually confuse the issue of muslim men marrying christian women why would they confuse this because in the quran allah says to us that do not marry idol worshipers or women who commit shirk until they believe so this is black and white a muslim man is not permitted to marry a hindu woman to marry a sikh woman to marry a buddhist woman to marry any other religion where they associate others with allah end of story but we have a verse in surat ilma'idah that clearly states that it is permissible for a muslim man to marry a woman from the people of the book who are the jews and the christians so now people come and say okay the ayah in chapter five surat al-maidah where it is permitted for us to marry the people of the book women is referring to jews and christians we have no problem with that but today's christians believe in trinity so they are idol worshipers you go to a catholic church and you would find statues of mary of uh jesus christ on the cross so they claim of saint paul saint petersburg whatever they they have their saints and they worship them you you find them in their houses putting these idols and they're calling them this is idol worshipping so the confusion comes here and people nowadays say hmm yeah these are mushrik we can't marry them christians at the time of the prophet hassan we can marry but this is not true because allah azzawajal addresses the christians in the quran which was revealed upon the prophet sallam and addresses them of believing in trinity so allah tells us for example in in chapter verse 72 chapter five in s those who say that jesus christ the son of mary is allah they have committed blasphemy and also says in chapter in the same chapter verse 73 he they they they who say that allah is one of three they have committed blasphemy so at the time of the salam the same beliefs of the christians of today wear the same beliefs at the christians at the time of the prophet who told us that it is permissible to marry people of the book therefore there is no ambiguity in this sophian a muslim man can marry a muslim woman he can marry a christian woman and he can marry a jewish woman there is no ambiguity in that inshallah is it recommended this is something for you to weigh the pros and cons because through the track record we found out that in so many cases when marrying a christian woman this has a very negative impact on the children and in times of dispute a woman takes her children she goes back to her country and makes your children raised up as christians leaving islam so was it worth it at the end of the day this is for you to decide"
