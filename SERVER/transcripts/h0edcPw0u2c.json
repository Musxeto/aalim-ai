  "title": "Leaving a sin not for the sake of Allah but due to people, is this shirk? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "said that it is shirk if someone refrains from sin for fear of people because he will not do it for the sake of allah but for the people and he says refraining from sins is a form of worship that's why it is shirk so is it shirk this is a very sensitive issue because a lot of the muslims have problems with ocd with thoughts that are intrusive and destroying their lives due to these in truth intrusive thoughts so it causes hardship it causes them confusion and anxiety and if you don't tackle this tactfully and smartly you would fall into into the traps of shaytan so how to tackle it and how to deal with it first of all with knowledge if you have proper knowledge this would build a very high firewall that neither shaytan can penetrate or climb over so you have to acquire knowledge about your akida about your religion so that you can have the necessary tools to fight satan and when we talk about knowledge we talk about the knowledge of apida of the quran and of the sunnah the prophet said alaihis whenever a servant of allah attempts to do a sin and he does not do it allah orders the angels to write it into one hasanah one good deed because he left it for my sake so if you left a sin for the sake of allah you are rewarded now this is not the question the question is a person left the sin for the fear of the people and this is where it's a bit sensitive when we say for the fear of the people is he showing them off that yeah i don't drink alcohol it's i don't i'm a good muslim where actually he would love to but he wants to make an impression he wants to impress people he wants them to praise him and look up to him so if this is the case this is different than someone who doesn't drink publicly not because he's seeking people's praise rather he is bashful he's shy he doesn't want his reputation to be tarnished or maybe for a more noble cause because he is considered to be righteous in their eyes or practicing muslim in their eyes so he fears that the reputation of islam would be tarnished because of that so he refrains these are two different scenarios the first scenario which is saeed talking about when someone leaves sends not for the fear of allah rather to gain praise from the people so this becomes sinful because doing things to impress people and for the sake of their praise such as a person who fixes the way he prays and prolongs it just because his boss is watching what is your intention aki nothing i'm it's it's time for the increment in the yearly bonus so this is why i'm doing this oh this is totally prohibited this is showing off this is riya and he's sinful for that it's a major sin why are you prolonging your prayer simply because i love to pray long and i love to please allah whether people are watching or not this is not sinful you're rewarded for that so the intention is extremely important in this first scenario he is refraining from haram from sin simply to get credit and the praise of the people and this usually is not done by any individual this is usually done by a full-fledged hypocrite not alone he's not sinful only he is maybe exiting the fold of islam because no one leaves sins to gain praise of people while inside if there's no one i'm gonna take a glass or two because i don't care if allah is watching no this is a kafir but this is very rare the second scenario when you leave it because you're bashful you're shy of the people this is not something to be ashamed of in the sense that you're leaving sins because you're afraid that your reputation will be tarnished or that someone would tarnish the reputation of islam this is something that you may be rewarded for now having said that remember a lot of the us a lot of the people may leave sins not for the sake of allah alone but rather for the fear of the prescribed punishment he doesn't fornicate he doesn't want to be flogged he doesn't drink intoxicants he doesn't want to be flogged he doesn't slander or do anything that is a major sin that has a prescribed punishment he is afraid of the punishment or of the jail time not because he's afraid of allah would we say that this is shirk no this is not shikh and is he sinful for that no he's not sinful for that because he didn't do it for the sake of allah but he's not rewarded like in the very beginning hadith which i have mentioned so i hope this answers your questions"
