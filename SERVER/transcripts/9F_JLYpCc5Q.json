  "title": "Forming a second row instead of filling gaps in the first, in Prayer - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Navid from Bangladesh he says that what's the ruling sometimes we come to the Masjid and we find that the first row has gaps from the right and the left sufficient for four or five people yet the late comers they were so lazy when they came late to fill up these gaps so they made the second row so that they can attend the first raka because if they walked all the way to the sides the Imam would raise his head from rock or and they would have missed the first record so they make a second row what's the ruling the row is correct the prayer is correct and they lose great deal of reward because they missed the first row for their laziness what is not permissible in the VDA is that you come alone and start your prayer when there is space in either side you just come along out of arrogance or out of laziness or for any other reason your prayer is invalid why because the Prophet said that is a lot of Salaam the there is no prayer accepted for a person who prays alone behind the rope and a madman taymiyah may Allah have mercy on his soul explained this and he said if someone out of his own choice decides to make a new row on his own while there was space sufficient in the first or in the row ahead of him then his prayer is invalid but if he one comes and if the row is fully packed you cannot squeeze yourself at all in it in this case you can pray alone because you are doing the best of your ability and Allah says for top Elohim a certain fear Allah to the best of your abilities"
