  "transcript": "I asked you was I'm an orphan and my father died when I was very young I haven't visited his grave in years but I'm thinking of visiting soon God willing or inshallah what I wanted to ask you was would it be sinful for me to enter the graveyard wearing shoes or is it just like a recommended sinner thank you first of all Muhammad you just started your question by saying I'm an orphan and this is incorrect because with through the uh analyzing your sound you've definitely hit puberty and probably exceeded that by light years um therefore the definition of an orphan is a child whose father is dead and the child has not preached the age of puberty once a person reaches the age of puberty he's not labeled as an orphan anymore secondly it is not permissible to wear shoes while stepping on a grave while walking through the graveyard and on the corridors that is paved and there are no Graves underneath there's no problem in you wetting your shoes all the way so the prohibition is to wear shoes and with these shoes you step on actual uh Graves and Allah Knows Best"
