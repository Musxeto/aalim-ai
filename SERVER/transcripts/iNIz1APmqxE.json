  "title": "Can we open an account in an interest based bank if islamic bank is too far? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "cd from germany i've read that it is not permissible to have an account with an interest-based bank when there is an alternative in an islamic bank this is the fatwa however the bank that is islamic is far away from my home and there is a lot of hardship for me to do this so what is the solution in my opinion if there is a lot of hardship upon you as in your case it's very far and you need to do a lot of banking transactions withdrawals and that would cost you money and time and effort to go to that bank or the islamic bank is not a professional bank their transactions are lousy they always are late they're not professional they don't deliver and a lot of the time they cause me hardship if this is the case i believe that it is permissible to open a bank an account with an interest-based bank providing that it is a current account so there is no interest in it plus you don't put a lot of money in it so you have both accounts you leave the chunk of savings in the islamic bank and you leave an amount sufficient for your daily transactions and wire transfers and cash withdrawals to the minimum so that the bank would not benefit from it and allah knows best"
