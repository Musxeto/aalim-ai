  "title": "How to deal with disbelievers / Kafirs mocking our islam? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is that in universities where I live people uh usually the disbelievers mock us and mock our religion so I get very angry and very agitated and I start to you know get into a fight with them but I also see many Muslim Brothers making fun of their own religion and mocking uh the things taught in a religion so what should I do in such case I always tell people this when you are walking in the streets of Delhi or mumbay or Chennai and a dog barks you will you ever fall on your hands and knees and bark back of course not he's a dog so when such ignorant imbeciles mock your religion shrug your shoulders and move out move away don't listen to them don't even give them any attention don't fight with flies that come and bug you because they're flies you don't go down to their level the Muslims who uh uh retaliate and start to curse their religion and make fun of their gods they're doing a big big sin and something that is wrong Allah stated clearly in the Quran do not insult the idols that they worship if this would lead them to insult Allah though insulting their Idols is a good deed why because they're false they worship private parts they have temples of private parts and they worship them they worship monkeys they worship uh uh rats they worship uh uh cows they worship dun they worship anything they have like 65,000 Gods this is their intellect This Is How They think good for them don't insult their gods if they are going to insult our Shar and our own religion in Allah this is what is mentioned in the Quran so let them say whatever they say shrug your shoulders and move away from them and don't even pay attention to any dog that barks at you and Allah knows rest"
