  "transcript": "hombre Yan she says when we give Vidya do we need to inform the receiver that it is Vidya and the answer is the the recipient of the Vidya is poor but that does not mean that he has no dignity so when you come to the poor people and you say this is a cat money this is charity this is Vidya by the way I broke a promise to Allah this is kaffarah expiation that would break their heart so you should not tell them what this is but rather go ahead and do it now there is an exception when it comes to zakat if I were to know that this recipient of the cat does not accept the cat if anyone were to tell him that this is the hard money he says no I don't take second I could not give him something that he does not want to have but 99.9% of all poor people that I know would have no problem in getting zakat money yet it would not be appropriate to tell people that this is the cat money or this is Vidya or this is an expiation because that would break their heart and in a sense humiliate them and break them a bit"
