  "transcript": "what are the valid reasons to delay efforts a lot depends if you mean that delaying it until the time is out there is no valid reason if it's not an issue of life and death if it's not a person traveling and he's delaying the Horde to pray it with a sir which he has a concession to do so the permission to do so if there is no legitimate reason for combining then there is no such valid reason a person cannot delay Fechter until the Sun rises unless it's an issue of life or death an issue of real necessity other than that he has to pray it on time no matter what but if you're talking about delaying it within the time prescribed for it so uh sir you can pray it until just before sunset due to necessity there's no problem in doing that insha'Allah and there are so many excuses because you are praying at the end of the day in the prescribed times of ASSA in the prescribed time of the hor so delaying it for example door if someone prays it five minutes before us of a then no problem is he sinful no it's not sinful this is the prescribed time for it so there's no sin on him but delaying it till after the time is over this is problematic"
