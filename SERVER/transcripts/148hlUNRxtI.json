  "title": "What if Muazzin is late in giving athan: should we rely on watches more than Muazzin- Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] what is the maximum time until which we can eat during suhoor what is what if the mo Advan is a couple of minutes late to give the event should we rely on our watches more than the Methvin as per the first question the maximum time until which we can eat during suhoor this is a misconception among the Muslims they have in their Rama ban calendar of over time a certain mother rip time which they break their fast aja time and then they have what is known as in satya time and then fetcher time and usually it's about 15 minutes between the Adana fetcher and the in sack time where this emsac time come from I don't know beats me it has nothing to do with Islam none whatsoever the prophets of Allah used to eat and drink until the advances Allahu Akbar so you and I can eat and drink until we hear Allah ho Akbar from the Adan which announces and declares the break of dawn to put a buffer zone of 5 10 15 20 minutes is an innovation it's not part of the religion at all on the contrary the Sunnah is to delay the last thing you eat just before the Adana future the more you delay it the best it is for you as a follower of the Sunnah of the Prophet re salat wa salam so there's no time limit now the question is the more anthony's two minutes late this is not your responsibility what do you mean if the time of Bajor is due either you can tell this by visually looking at the east and being able to distinguish the white thread of feather from the white the black threat of night so once you see this horizontal white thread of Roger this is the break of dawn refrain if you are unable to do this because we live in the city and the city lights prevent us from doing this from seeing this we have to rely on the Methvin because it is his responsibility yes yet what we have watches your watches can be wrong your watches are not always accurate and Allah did not tell you to rely on your watches either visually rely on seeing the break of dawn and the sunset or rely on the advent likewise if I'm waiting to break my fast I'm at the seaside and the Sun sets in the sea in the West where I come from in Jeddah so I'm at the seaside then I see the Sun going down going down going it disappeared the more then did not call for the other who cares bismillah I eat Sharon is two minutes three minutes who cares Allah tells me to eat once the Sun sets and the Sun I can see it it had set if I can do this with Fajar good if not then I have to rely on the more effin likewise in sunset if I'm in home the food is on the table if the more Evan doesn't call the Adhan I should wait until he calls again it's his responsibility and then I can eat so I hope this answers the question because the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was Salam that then is entrusted and the Imam is a guarantor a guarantor mean he's guarantees the validity of my salat if I make mistakes he takes that away from me because I'm following him sometimes he sits for the first a shout I'm neglectful I stand up for the third raka and few seconds later I open my eyes everybody sitting down whoops I sent down immediately is my prayer correct it's valid because a man carries mice my mistakes and Marvin is entrusted ha he's a minute late and minute early it is his responsibility Allah will hold him questionable now a lot of the Muslims are a little bit flexible according to their logic so people say ok I woke up late for suhoor and as I opened my eyes the Imam started saying Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar so I rushed to the fridge I opened it I took a turkey sandwich and a glass of milk and some hot Tabasco and I started eating because I knew that I had time until the amount of the mother then finishes by saying la ilaha illa llah well bad news my friend you have to make up that day why because the van started you are not allowed to eat or drink after the event starts except in one condition the Prophet said that is awesome that if one of you has a cup a jug a vessel with liquid water coffee tea whatever and a van is called then he may consume it until he's satisfied so this means only with drinks and it's in my hand when the event is called not that it's like this and the Adonis calls oops come on I have to finish it this is not valid if it's in my hand and there then is called I can drink and drink as long as in my hand until it's over of course not for half an hour or in my hand I am I'm not gonna put it down no but it means that drink even if you finish it if it's a joke drink drink drink drink and until you you satisfied hamed Allah not food so if I have a big sandwich in my hand and I took a first bite and then it's cold I cannot finish it haha so it's finished what's in my mouth have to swallow it and that's it and likewise by the way excuse my french if someone is having intercourse and then is called it is not permissible for him to continue say oh it's like water I have to continue until I'm satisfied no Habibi you have to stop immediately or you will fast two consecutive months my friend it's not worth it so this is something that people must know that I then is not a time for you like a yellow traffic light that okay I can still drive no the van is a red traffic light stop and if you cross you'll be fine [Music] [Applause]"
