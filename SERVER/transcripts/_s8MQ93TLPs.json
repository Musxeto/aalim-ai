  "title": "How to behave in Itikaf (do's & dont's) and when to start & end Itikaf? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "can you please uh tell us all we need to know about it cup like when we start when we end and what other things that we can do and i cannot do please mark a logic again this is too generic but in a nutshell you should go to erticaf after the sunset of the 20th day of ramadan when the 20th day of ramadan has set you enter your ertikaf and stay there until the eid is established so if it is the 29th of ramadan the sun sets after a couple of hours they've cited the crescent then you go back go out of the masjid and go home what to do you try your level best to stay in seclusion devote your time in these nine or ten days to praying on time reciting the quran making the care being alone this is a quality time people have meditation people have their own [Music] projects and missions to cleanse their souls in islam we don't have this issue of meditation where you go and seclude yourself and try your level best to devote the whole time for worshiping allah azzawajal now some people defy this purpose by taking their laptops their pdas their smartphones and engaging 24 7 on everything that is usually haram outside let alone in the machine some people even run their businesses and sell their stocks and buy new stocks from the message and saying no we're an ertikaf this is not etikaf yes you may chit chat with a brother for 10 minutes every few hours just to refresh you may engage in things that are beneficial kids come over to greet you and give salaam this is mubach this is permissible as in the hadith of mother safiya who came to the masjid while the prophet was in etiquette he spoke to her for a while and then he went out with her to walk her back to her home so such errands such meetings for a legitimate reason is permissible what's not permissible is to waste your time in things that are not related to ibadah is to have intercourse or in to be intimate with the wife is to go out of the masjid unnecessarily such as to follow a funeral to its burial place or to visit someone who's sick all of this is not part of the sunnah and is not part of ertikaf and allah knows best"
