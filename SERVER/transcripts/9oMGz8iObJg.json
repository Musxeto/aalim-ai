  "transcript": "my question is my question is can we use sir Omar for non-muslims not intending to honor them but because it is the norm is a nation and it can refer to an Imam it can also refer to a religion and it also can refer to a period of time these are all mentioned in the Quran so it can refer to a nation or a group of people whether Muslims or non-muslims there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
