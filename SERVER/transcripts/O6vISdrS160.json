  "transcript": "unique everyone claimed that they're upon the Quran but in reality we see that al-muslim they have different tafsir of the Quran first example about Allah itself and how they interpret the Ayah about Allah is different for example the ishtiwa of Allah the Muslim Moon they have a different opinion what do you think about this alhamdulillah Allah azzawajal has revealed the Quran in the language of the Arabs so it is in Arabic language and also part of our Akida as Allah that we follow the methodology and the way of the prophet and of the Salah so the companions the prophet says the best of generations are the companions then the tabian then the table in these are the best of the generations that had ever walked on Earth and none of them in these three generations had any difference of opinion when it comes to al-stiwa so an Imam Malik One the Imam of he said Allah's being over the throne overloom and the how is majul this is in Allah's knowledge because you cannot comprehend Allah and he said how how is it done this is Vida so all the salaf agreed that Allah azzawajal has attributes and these attributes are as they are so when Allah azzawajal says to Iblis why did you not prostrate to whom I created with my two hands not one hand and one says no no Allah doesn't have hands are you crazy Allah mentions this in the Quran said no no we don't believe that Allah has hands because this means that Allah has organs how dare you speak like this about Allah he tells you he has hands we believe how I don't know and Allah says Allah has a face Allah's eyes Allah has a hand Allah's fingers the hearts are between two fingers of Allah's fingers how this is none of your business because it is like saying how Allah is all hearing all seen how does Allah see things Allah hears the footsteps of a black ant over the stones in a dark night Allah sees it and hears it we don't say how because we believe in it so those who follow other than the Akida of the prophet we tell them you are in great Danger so many Muslims when we speak to them where is Allah which is everywhere Allah is everywhere so Allah is here no no no no don't uh allies everywhere this is not logical the prophet said to us Allah Allah is over and above the whole universe and Paradise the ceiling of it is and Allah is above Allah is above everything in the height this is where Allah is above everything so you cannot say that Allah is everywhere but when you apply your logic he said I can't understand this so the hell with you you can't understand it this is your problem not mine Allah says to us something we believe in it this is the same thing that Satan did why didn't you prostrate to what I created with my two hands I said logically I am better than him you created me from fire and you created him from clay so why would I prostrate this is what Satan used logic what was his fate you're in Hell Fire for eternity so I replied to this question again that the prophet said um will be divided into 73 sects all are in Hell except one which one who is following the prophet Allah and the companions so now these new sects these new understanding of issues of aqida that the prophet never said anything to us about it and the companions believed it as it is if you come with a new understanding you are from the 72 my Allah protectors"
