  "title": "If we speak during Adhan, we will not be able to say the shahadah on our death bed? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um i know that um during the adan call to prayer we we are not allowed to um talk or reset the quran right so so um like if if we this if we recycled talk um speak during the during the event um our um will be we will be will be on able uh able to pronounce the kalima shahada on our dead bed or is it is it is there anything on the hadith or something okay first of all this is a misconception among the muslims when they say that it is totally prohibited to recite or to speak with one another while the adhan is being called and someone even goes a bit further and say it is prohibited to be lying down during the adhan and all of this is bogus is not related at all to islam and they say that if you speak while then is being called allah will prevent you from uttering the shahada or known as the kalima on your deathbed and again this is all baloney false baseless has no impact so is it permissible sheikh to speak while the adhan is going the answer is yes there's no problem in that and is it sinful the answer is no whoa so is it recommended the answer is no it's not recommended because when that is being called this is a blessed time for you to gain a lot of rewards by repeating after the adhan the more than says allah until he ends you offer the salutation upon the prophet salaam and then you say that muhammad so this is all part of the authentic sunnah if you do this you will receive the intercession of the prophet islam but if you don't want to say and repeat after that you you are in a heated conversation there's no sin at all in doing that allah knows best"
