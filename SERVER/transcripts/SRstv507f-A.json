  "transcript": "Mona says is a husband entitled to provide for his wife when she's not living with him what if he is working abroad and she's staying at her parents place is the ruling the same in this situation as well the issue between the spouses the issues are plenty and among the top ten would be the issues of provision of financial expenditures of maintenance especially when the wife lives in a different place now if the man is living abroad or if he is living in the same city and the woman leaves her husband's house to her parents house it's one of two either he allowed her to move out or he did not allow her to move out so if he did not permit her to go to her parents house then she is a disobedient woman because she left without his permission and she does not deserve any maintenance and he is not obliged to provide for her but if she has children he is obliged to provide for them because they are his responsibility even if they were on the moon if she left the house with his permission in this case he is obliged to provide for her as if she is living with him even if he's working abroad even if she's staying with her parents because this is his responsibility and I shocked how would a man coat and coat be considered a man if he stops providing for his wife for his children if he deals with them like dealing with his business partner asking about every penny spent where and why and interrogating them this is not befitting for a man to do a real man knows that Allah Azza WA JAL stated that men are Guardians / women due to what Allah has favored them with and due to their big financial expenditure upon them a vigil a woman Anissa Helou Baha Barba hamana baht will be man and fuku mean my him what they spent from their own wealth but when it comes to this type of dealing I get so many questions from sisters saying that their husbands refuse to support to provide for them though they are well paid and they demand that the wife takes a job because his mother wants her to work and to contribute to the financial expenditure of the house or to do this or to do that I'm shocked when I hear such questions and stories of so so-called quote unquote men this is totally prohibited and woman's place is in her house takes care of it takes care of the husband takes care of the children if she's not married she takes care of her mom and her father she's not obliged to work at all while the man's role is to work to provide and to food on the table this is his responsibility in Islam"
