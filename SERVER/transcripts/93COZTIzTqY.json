  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good in lighting this day is all right as the first time I wasted night with family around a nice meal we're making doing how nice it is to be so neat to those I love foreign and welcome to what I presume would be the last episode in our series of Virtues of fasting because we have five remaining hadiths and inshallah we'll try to conclude them in today's episode hoping to see you inshallah afterwards the first Hadith is number 53 and it is narrated by Abdullah Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the one who is performing atikaf does not have to fast unless he obliges himself to do so and this is not a Hadith that is or related to the prophet Allah and the most authentic opinion it is the opinion of IBN Abbas may Allah because with him himself so we describe this Hadith to be maupuff but the meaning is correct and this is against what we studied yesterday from Aisha's own words may Allah be pleased with her when she said that ertikaf or seclusion cannot be except in the case of fasting and we said that this is not correct and the Hadith is more correct and in according to the rules and regulations of the Sharia the prophet Allah and he wasn't fasting so this means that it is not mandatory also told the prophet Islam that he vowed to make articaf and he allowed him to do so in Makkah and he wasn't fasting at the time so it is not mandatory however it is recommended now IBN Abbas says that except may Allah be pleased with him except for someone who obliges himself to do so so definitely if you oblige yourself to make articaff while fasting then you must be in the state of fasting moving on to the following Hadith Hadith number 54 may Allah be pleased with him and with his father narrated some of the companions of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam were shown in their dreams that the night of Qatar was in the last seven nights of Ramadan the messenger of Allah said to them it seems that all of your dreams agree that the night of other is ha is in the last seven nights and whoever wants to seek that night should do so in the last seven nights now the prophet Allah is telling us about a situation where a great number of companions may Allah be pleased with them all saw in their dreams while they were asleep an indication a sign that the night of decree is on the last seven nights due to this and due to the fact that the prophet salaam already knew that it is only in the last 10 nights of Ramadan he told them that whoever wants to detect that Knight whoever wants to seek that night he should do so in the last seven nights now this is an indication that it is not a must to try and detect it and we will come to talk about some of its signs and the ways of detecting it if this is possible moving on to Hadith number 55 may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet of Allah said regarding the night of al-qadir it is the 27th night of Ramadan and this the scholars say that it is the opinion of may Allah be pleased with him and it is not a Hadith that is Marvel like the previous Hadith like the previous Hadith may Allah be pleased with them all this is his opinion however there are other evidences stating that the most preferred of all 10 nights to be the actual night of decree is the 27th and there are numerous opinions of Scholars with regard to laylat but first of all what is the meaning of foreign means the status the value this is one of the meanings so it is because it has great value in Islam and nothing to prove this more than to read the Quran and find a specific Surah by the name of al-qadir specifically talking about the virtues of this night now we have 114 chapters of the Quran 114 Surah to give one single Surah on this topic and to call it by the name of this night this definitely shows you the value of this night Allah says that we have revealed the Quran during the night of decree or the night of other and Allah azzawajal highlights the importance by saying and what do you know about Leila it is a night that is better than a thousand months which do not include imagine a night a single night that doing good deeds in it far exceeds not equal to it far exceeds the deeds done in about 84 years in one night and Allah told us that one of the virtues of this night that the Quran was revealed in it and it's sufficient to show you the blessing and virtues of this night to know that the prophet said Allah whoever prays the night of decree Allah would forgive all his previous sins providing he does this out of belief and anticipation of the reward so the same Hadith came for the whole month of Ramadan if you pray the whole month of the Ramadan allow it to give your previous sins if you do this out of belief and anticipation of the reward to praying one single night and that is the night of decree the other meaning of al-qadir is Destiny or decree and why is that because Destiny is divided into three types or maybe more there is the general writing of the creation's destiny and this happened 50 000 years before Allah had created the creation so Allah when he created the pen Allah ordered the pen to write and the pen said what should I write Allah told the pen to write everything that's going to happen till the day of judgment and that was 50 000 years before Allah created the creation there is another type of decree that is when the soul is breathed into the infant while it is in its mother's womb and this takes place when the child is 120 days of age the angel comes and asks oh Allah is he a good person or an evil person what are his deeds what are his knowledge or what is his knowledge and what is his lifespan and Allah urges him to write it so this kind of decree takes place just before the soul is briefed and there is a third type of decree and that is the annual decree so this is what takes place on the night of al-qaddar where Allah decrees what's going to happen throughout the next year and this is part of what is written in the preserved tablet the Angels don't know of it Allah really reveals it to them every single uh year on the night of decree and there are signs that we May know some thing about the night of the queen but again this is not something that is fixed and no one on earth can be certain that it is this particular night you speculate you think you doubt you hope but you cannot be firm and certain that it is that particular night among the signs is that it is peaceful as Allah mentioned in Surah it is peace until the break of dawn and what kind of Peace are we talking about because during the last 10 nights of Ramadan people are being killed are dying there are Wars Etc we are speaking in general terms on the individual basis so people would feel in that night the tranquility and calmness within so they they're peaceful maybe there are Wars maybe there are people who are being slaughtered as in the case with our brothers in uh Palestine may Allah liberated and may Allah defeat the Jews and those who are backing them the victory that we all are looking forward for but there is this inner peace among the Muslims among the people so there is calmness in the night there is brightness even during the night that is similar to the brightness one sees between the break of dawn and sunrise so there isn't any source of light but because we have electricity maybe we fail to see this but if you were in the desert you would have seen the glow during the night which indicates and it is significant for the Muslims when they have this Tranquility in the chest and they feel calm and they feel that Allah is supporting them Allah is providing from them to make thicker to read the Quran to pray night prayer unlike other nights so it is part of the signs of that you get this energy to get closer to Allah azzawajal to invoke Allah to feel happy to being in seclusion with Allah and calling him one to one and asking him and humiliating yourself for him the almighty there is another sign that comes afterwards so after the night is over when the Sun rises Scholars say that it should rise as indicated in the Hadith should rise without uh brightness so as if it's rising and you can look at it directly it's clear and there is no such glow that would uh harm you or hurt your eyes you can look at it so this is one of the signs that the night before was probably the night of Al qadar now when is Scholars differ and there are lots and lots of hadiths and to the extent that uh IBN Hazard may Allah have mercy on his soul as he wrote it wrote here he said that there are about 40 opinion of Scholars that I've mentioned in when you hear the the the word 40 man this is a lot there are only 10 nights so how can you have 40 opinion of it well you have to go back and look what the scholars came up with the most authentic opinion that the hadith's proof is that it is in the last 10 Nights from the 21st night till the end of the month and it is most likely in the odd numbers of these nights the 21st third fifth ninth a seventh and 9th not only that it is most likely in the last seven so you skip the 21st at the 24th uh first and 23rd is included so now it's limited into four nights and most likely it should be on the 27th so it's a single night however this does not mean that one should only select and choose this night the 27th to pray offer night prayer and to read the Quran in vocalize this is totally wrong because the most authentic opinion is that it hops from one night to the other and we don't know what night it is exactly and for certain and why did Allah hide it so that you would Excel yourself so that you would devote yourself in these 10 nights to worshiping Allah you would dedicate your time utilize all means possible to getting closer to Allah during these 10 nights because if we knew that it was on the 27th we would have neglected the whole month I personally if I know that it is on the 27th I wouldn't pray that our prayer or night prayer during the whole month what's the point I would only select the 27th and pray it and this insha Allah would get my sins forgiven but Allah wants us to show him how we do our level best in seeking his pleasure it is like the last hour on a Friday the prophet told us that there is an hour during Friday no servant of Allah prays and supplicates to Allah except Allah would give him what he's asking for the most authentic opinion is that it's the last hour of the day so it is an hour before Sunset of Friday but there are many other opinions as well so we cannot be certain that it is this one but we are hopeful those who only select the odd nights to pray they may be shocked to know that not necessarily the odd nights to be the 21st third fifth seventh and the ninth why because there is an authentic Hadith where the Prophet Allah told us to detect and seek the night of decree from the reverse from the opposite way so he said seek it for nine nights remaining remaining for seven nights remaining for five nights remaining for three nights remaining for one night remaining now when you say that remaining means that I cannot know how many nights remain until the month is over this means that if the month is 30 days in this case the odd numbers would be 21st 23rd 25th 27th and 29th but if the month is even meaning that if the month is 29 days so one night left makes it the 28th two three nights left makes it the 26th the 24th the uh the 22nd so this is what evantemia says may Allah have mercy on his soul that you cannot detect the odd numbers until you know the month whether it is 30 or 29 and this you cannot do until the month is over therefore those who Gamble by only praying on the odd number of nights according to the calendar they are falling into this mistake therefore every one of us should Excel and do his level best to try and seek and detect this night through praying through offering as much as possible during the whole 10 nights and among the best forms of worship is the Hadith which motherha Isha may Allah be pleased with her said this is Hadith number 56. excuse me Allah be pleased with her said I asked the messenger of Allah and I said o messenger of Allah if I know what night the night of other is what should I say what should I say during it so the prophet said by the way we're reading Hadith number 56 it should be displayed on the monitor on the screen here we go so I asked the prophet of Allah or prophet of Allah if I know what night the night of other is what should I say during it the prophet said oh Allah you are the pardoner and you love to Pardon so pardon me now in this beautiful Hadith may Allah be pleased with her is doing what every Muslim should do what is that to ask the people of knowledge because without knowledge you do not know and there is no way for you to learn without asking so she went straight to the prophet and told him okay now I know the importance of the night of decree and I know that it is better than a thousand months but if I know that this is the night through some of the signs that were mentioned earlier what should I say so he told her to repeat this Dua this invocation for one you are pardoner and this is one of Allah's beautiful names Allah the one who pardons and you love pardoning now this also is something that is mentioned in the Quran that is mentioned in the Sunnah in so many places hundreds of them yet the people of desires the people of deviation come and they falsify this so the people like asharis the people like martezilis they say that Allah does not love and Allah does not hate okay it's mentioned in the Quran mentions that he loves them Allah says in the Quran say if you love Allah then follow me Muhammad and Allah would love you he said no no Allah does not love subhanallah Allah Allah has a face no Allah doesn't have a face these are people of deviation unfortunately the majority of Muslims now follow this corrupt Akida or so on because they have deviated from the Quran Sunnah the prophet says say Allah you are partner and you love pardoning so Allah does love and if we don't have a God that loves us and can be loved then what kind of a life is this so you ask Allah azzawajal by his beautiful name to Pardon you to forgive your sins and to erase these sins as if they did not exist and by Allah no one does this except Allah the almighty who Pardons and forgives and has Mercy over his servants now usually one would think that if I am worshiping Allah in the night of decree it's a blessed night then definitely Allah would forgive me why should I ask for forgiveness I should ask for more money I should ask for health I should ask for a victory Etc well because you are in the last 10 nights of Ramadan and it is a blessed and favored night you may feel a little bit arrogant and you would like to boast about it thinking that wow I've done so many good deeds definitely Allah has forgiven me uh the prophet Assam is bringing you back to Earth and you have to humiliate yourself and ask Allah for forgiveness because this is our life story we do good deeds and we are hopeful and we're wishful but yet we don't guarantee that Allah has accepted our Deeds we never guarantee that Allah has accepted our repentance so we are always fearful so that when we die and we meet Allah to discover that he has forgiven our sins then we will feel safe and secure but if it's the opposite if we're safe and secure here thinking that everything is gone now I can do whatever I want of sins because my records are white and clean then on the day of judgment I will begin to fear Allah the Almighty finally we have Hadith number 57. this Hadith was narrated Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of Allah said one should not undertake Journeys except to three mosques in Mecca Al-Aqsa mosque in uh and my mosque this mosque or uh the mosque in Medina the order is different in in Arabic it should have been Haram the holy mosque in Mecca and my Masjid which is the Masjid in Medina and then the prophet said the Masjid of Al-Aqsa in Palestine if you look at this Hadith the prophet says Assam no one should undertake Journeys so one would say hmm does this mean I cannot travel to study another one says but I have to travel to this country to buy merchandise and sell to my people a third says I have to go for medical reasons a fourth says I want to visit my families a fifth says there is a book fair I'd like to go and buy books but this Hadith tells us don't do so no no the Hadith doesn't say that the Hadith is specifically mentioning the journey with the intention of worshiping Allah azzawajal to allocation so if someone says which Allah spoke to Moses next to can I travel there to see it it's a blessed place the answer is no you must not travel and to undertake the journey for such a place and this is what the companions told pleased with him when he traveled to a similar intention they told him you should not have done this because the prophet said and they reported or read this Hadith to him if someone wants to visit the Grand Mosque of XYZ in a country architecturally wise it is one of the best in the world so I say okay tomorrow I'm gonna travel to see this beautiful mosque and pray to arakizing it this is totally prohibited someone of course by default says okay I'd like to go to home or to an najaf to visit the shrines of the awliya of Ali of Hassan or Hussein or any of these imams of the that they have this is totally prohibited and you cannot do this but if you want to travel for the sake of worshiping Allah you can do this too Haram why because a prayer there is equivalent to a hundred thousand elsewhere and which Masjid Haram the whole of Haram area so I can go to any message in Mecca or the Masjid of al-kaba the answer is it has to be the message of al-ka it cannot be done in any Masjid and you can also travel to the Masjid of the Prophet Assam in Medina where a prayer is equivalent to a thousand prayers elsewhere other than or you can travel to al-masjid Al-Aqsa which is occupied by the zionists and by the Jews and it will be liberated and Allah will grant us the privilege of praying there with the grace of Allah but we have to support the brothers in Palestine we have to support them financially politically by all means they are the true mujahideen and in a prayer in that Masjid is equivalent to 500 elsewhere other than the Masjid Haram and the message of the prophet and it's a common mistake that people say when they travel I'm going to the prophet's grave this intention is not right you cannot travel for visiting a grave even the grave of the prophet change your intention and say I'm going to travel to the Masjid of the prophet and once you reach there of course out of the etiquette you have to go and offer salaam to the prophet as used to do and the rest of the companions may Allah peace with them all so the issue of traveling for religious purposes to locations to places to shrines it is not permissible in Islam and the Hadith is Crystal Clear we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back Allah commanded Us in the Quran saying hasten to the Forgiveness of your lord and to Paradise the width of which is the heavens and the Earth prepared for the righteous and pious brothers and sisters in Islam especially in the month of Ramadan the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that when the first night of the month of Ramadan is here the devils are chained o Seekers of goodness come forth yeah every night in the month of Ramadan and learn how can we hasten for goodness great helping them to build their

act on this sign but uh from there on we get signs that are opposing what we first thought was the sign uh what is the procedure do we pay istikhara again and uh do we go by the signs we feel after that or do we still uh base our decision on what we initially got this is a common mistake brother Waseem that people think that when they see ishara then a window from the heavens would open or they would see a dream or a cat would die no this is all uh nonsense there isn't anything as such as a sign what is there is I have an option of buying this blue pen or a red pen I don't know which one to do I have to make a decision before making this so okay I'm gonna go for the blue pen finish finished then I pray to arakavista and go ahead in buying it if there is good in it it will happen no need for seeing any signs so if I want to marry a woman I pray to uracas alhamdul I go and propose everything goes well alhamdulillah that's it if no they rejected me something happened and it did not uh go through then this is Allah for me we have Salma from Saudi foreign of the Deeds I personally don't know this they say that it's 84 years of prayer so one raka is equal to so and so but there isn't any specific evidence on that the most authentic is it's better so leave it to Allah it's better than a thousand months leave it as it is don't start getting your calculation because you don't want Allah to calculate your Deeds because if Allah calculated your good and bad Deeds you're doomed you just want it in Allah's General generosity and mercy second question a prayer till foreign Just Before Sunrise the time of sunrise that we have in the calendar I will answer inshallah thank you you are quite welcome Nadia hello yes my question number one as you mentioned just now about traveling for any other mosque or any other place I just want to ask you that if your intention is not to worship but just to see like most of the time the people go to Makkah and Madina they go and visit the places of Battlefield this these places so is it also not permissible to go and see not to worship just to see where the battery was bought okay my question number two about uh I heard some time that to pray to nafal in Masjid Kuba is equivalent to one umrah so is it wrong and my question number three that traveling as humans said about traveling for Masjid but like in our area if two three mosques are there and what is on your footsteps so the other is you are going by car but maybe you if you are going to listen more melodious voice or like my husband is going to the other mosque because in front of my uh home the mosque that is too long and my husband gets so tired it's too long too long I get your questions that is also not permissible I will answer you inshallah okay thank you very much I have two questions yes the first question is about umrah like uh uh can I perform uh umrah on behalf of my uh multiple people like my grandmother grandfather mother and father side all together I can do one umrah for four people or I have to do one by one okay on their behalf second question and the second question is about traveling uh if I travel apart from my home country if I travel to some other country vacation so uh for 10 days or for 12 days so I have to shorten my prayers or I have to do the full prayers okay from Saudi Arabia foreign first one I want to know do your Sims uh wash off or shed during illness and because some people think when you're going through um illness you're shedding off your sins as well okay second question uh second question um I know is it like I don't know how much other will a person get for giving zakar whose income is not Halal it's somewhat Haram but he gives off a lot of zaka and poor are benefiting from it though but how much reward will that person get for giving off charity okay and third question is how many times should we read Quran in Ramadan because I have just I have just finished one and I've been reading it through translation and really taking care and reading my Quran but I know people who have read more than two four Quran okay during Ramadan and last question is do you think wearing uh Stones like a cake they say Prophet used to wear a cake stone rings or carrier toughby is uh affects your health or has a good effect on you like uh feroza or something you wear it's really because Prophet used to do that is that a Sunnah I want to know that okay thank you so much you're welcome yes I want to ask about uh the interpretation explanation of uh verse number 34 of Surah Nisa in that in that verse in that verse husband is permitted to hit a beat wife and as my I must go on my wife's behalf she is as women feel offended by this why a husband is allowed to beat his wife because not obedient to have been even itself not around these evidence to Allah so why man should be a human person should obedient another person why not to Allah Allah said why husband is the jobs here number two sir yes number seven there is summary is that there are some verses clear some verses not clear and people are using this this clean not clear verses to discuss and distort Islam so can I give some examples from this verse of clear and not clear how are these being used nowadays and so another question if you are allowed okay so that I asked you to inquire about wikislam's defamation of Islam uh so you you are telling a lot of millions of our websites like that but which is very very famous website all over the world everybody knows I am telling just two free Muslim or ulamas of English expertise should and I think must defend Islam and we all Muslim as a part of the ummah cannot fund this by order from charity fund our fund if necessary some scholar especially from Huda TV and others who very well vocal in English and well-oriented in Western cultures they know Arabia it was me who called you uh about half an hour before to confirm the number okay uh just now just one question which day we should fast for yomul arafa in India when the Eid is one day later in from Saudi Arabia over there and normally means ninth is the day for Arafat in our ninth day is coming when um it is not it means that easy easy is coming here and our nine days I understand I understand and yes and one more shift yes uh with the mandatory that uh prize the prayer should be shortened and if I want to pray full prayers when uh when I'm on some some places for two three days like that yeah Amina from Nigeria I think I just want to ask if if what you're supposed to do in what I want to get the latest ideas what you're supposed to do okay I will answer inshallah thank you you're welcome so Selma second question was what is the last time for the is it the answer is to the majority of Scholars yes not to the hanafi school because the hanafi school of thought they delay very long so the Sunnah is when you have an erected object this is an erected object the shade of it is the same length then this is the time of Asar in the hanafi madhub they say that it has to be twice as long which means about 40 minutes or more difference and this is totally wrong and if a person prays his daughter at before that time of assured in in hanafi school he is praying it outside of its time and it would not be except accepted from him as for other end of time there is a chosen time and there is a time of necessity The Chosen time is when the sun is still bright once the light Fades and you can look at it which is approximately 40 to minutes to an hour before Sunset then this is not recommended for you to delay to this time yet you can still pray it until just before the sunset once the sun sets answer is no more and answer extends to the time and Maghrib extends to the time of Russia which is marked by the redness in the West when the sun had set there is redness in the Horizon in the Zenith once this redness is gone this means that the Maghrib time is over and Isha time is on and Asia time extends until the middle of the night after that it's over and Fajr time extends until the sun begins to rise not the full rising of the sun no as soon as the tip of the Sun appears khalas for your time is over and Allah from Saudi oh my question is it obligatory prayer or is it just a prayer that it is let's say if you are praying and you come and the the the hungry supper and the prayer is finished and the Imam is about to make a um and then I come and I came in the prayer is finished so I want to ask can I did I get Jamal prayer or I didn't get or can I form another foreign on Friday night seventy Thousand Angels will ask for forgiveness until we are forgiven if so which Surah is that okay and the second question is um okay if we have regular in our morning and evening after the obligatory prayers but some for some sometimes if we miss them like morning if we don't have time and until sun rise and similarly sunset in the evening and after the obligatory appears if you don't have time can we say these after the like the Sunnah prayers for example third question and the third question is when we are reading the Quran um if I want to start if I want to pray voluntary prayers night prayers if I start from like the 25th and uh I finished it in the in the night period I finished five plus the last five prayers and while reading outside the period I finished the first 25 Paris so is this a complete Quran reading complete the Quran or we have to read it completely okay and the last question is uh the intention for ethical does it have to be before entering the measure can we make the intention after even after entering the magic okay I will answer your question inshallah okay thank you okay we will not take questions until we finish most of what we have I believe we have almost 12 minutes left Nadia says that is it part of the prohibition to uh uh undertake Journeys to places of battlefields going to special areas in Medina they call it for example or going to uhur or going to butter if you're going to Medina for this purpose yes it's not permissible but if you're going to Medina to visit and this is the intention of the vast majority of Muslims no one goes to Medina to visit Earth they all go to visit the Masjid of the prophet and from there they may go and visit the battlefield of uhur or Badger Etc this is permissible going to the seven messages in Medina this is all fabrication it has no basis in Islam and never the prophet Islam did encourage us or said that you should do this or no there is nothing in regards of these seven method except of the Masjid of Cuba which she has asked and said um we heard that praying turakas is given to amrada Hadith is correct and the prophet Islam used to walk every Saturday two from Medina from his home to Cuba to pray to rakas and come back so this is permissible okay what's ruling on me from Jeddah traveling only to Kuba Masjid to pretura as I come back this is not permissible because Koba is not one of the three masjids mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet now if we have three four masjids in our locality in my city and I'd like to go from one Masjid to the other would this be a prohibited no this is permissible because you're not traveling this is within the city limits so going and choosing and following some uh Imam whose recitation is better than the other this is up to you and there's no uh nothing wrong in that okay what about if I travel to another city to attend the lecture would this fall under the prohibition the answer is no because I'm not going for a location or a Masjid I'm going for the lecture my travel my journey is for the lecture my traveling journey is for business for medication for uh uh visiting a friend this is not a form of worship that is prohibited Omaha says that can I make multiple intentions for in one umrah so I'm going for one umrah I have only four hours so I make intention for my father mother my grandfather my uncles my no this is not permissible each Hajj and each umrah should only be performed on one single individual and uh traveling and shortening prayers I forgot the the question probably she is asking that if I travel other than my home country if I travel to uh for fun I'm going to a new country for 12 days three two weeks three weeks should I shorten the answer is yes you should shorten us this is the Sunnah Amber says what's the relation between sins and uh um calamities such as illnesses do they expiate sense answer is yes the prophet said that Islam that The Fever is Allah's cleansing of a Believer from his sins and that is why the Sunnah that when we go and visit a sick person we say insha Allah which means that this is a purification it expiates it forgives it erases your sins providing that you are patient and not complaining if someone's income is Haram and he gives a lot of zakat is he rewarded the answer is nope he's not because zakat is not permissible on Haram money he's a thief he's a drug dealer he's got like a couple of billion dollars he's a drug dealer and he goes oh I'm gonna give zakat today no this is not your money this is filthy money this is Haram therefore don't be fooled by someone who gives a lot of Charity and zakat when his income is Haram because this is not gonna help him how many times should we read the Quran in Ramadan as many as you wish should I read a lot or should I read few but with comprehension and pondering comprehension and pondering is the best thing for you to do but if you can have the balance which is uh pondering for an hour or so and reading for a lot as much as you can for a few hours this is a win-win situation thinking that Stones affect your health so wearing for example uh it's a stone or uh eye of the tiger or emeralds or whatever thinking that it improves your your sex drive or improves your health gives you protection from illnesses this is Major shirk if you think that these things help you in such a fashion by themselves because they're Stones this is Major that nullifies a person's Islam if you think that Allah helps you through these Stones this is and it's bigger than major sins so one should not do this she says that because it is no way it is the prophet did not wear such stones the prophet wore a ring not because he wanted to look good as people think the ring was a seal so that when he ever whenever he wrote letters to the Kings and to uh the rulers of the world they told him that they would not read your letter unless it was sealed you know you get wax and you put it and then you uh seal your letter so it would not be opened except by the person intended to this is why the prophet had a ring not it was not that it was uh had the stone of this or that uh and now it says that the verse in Surah his wife is offended well your wife should revise her Islam again you're offended by Allah's words are you a Muslim are you nuts what does Allah shall give the permission for men to beat their wives first of all understand the verse and second of all you have no right to question Allah Allah tells you whatever he Wills you believe you go to Jannah you reject you go to hell up to you choice is yours you feel offended so many people got offended and ended up in hell for uh ever like Pharaoh like Abu jahl you want to be with them what's wrong with you are you a Muslim secondly do not I repeat do not ever doubt the Quran doubt your intellect doubt your mind doubt your husband doubt whoever you want to doubt never in doubt Allah's words thirdly you have to understand the text Allah says to the men who are the guardian who are the controllers who are the bosses who are the managers of the house if you fear that your wife would misbehave and we're looking at the bigger picture we're looking at the boat we have one Captain steering the boat so we don't want this boat to sink and we have a conflict and we have the a cope Captain wanting to make a rebellion and he wants to take over the you cannot steer a boat like this so Allah says for those who fear that their wives are going out of track you should do first you have to advise them you have to keep reminding of Allah not for five minutes and then smack them no like for a week for two for five weeks keep on advising them reminding them telling them that this is Haram from the Quran and remember what you're doing is a big mistake if this doesn't work number two ignore them in bed no intimacy no kissing no hugging no nothing and not for a day or two for a whole month maybe until she feels neglected and she till she feels that wow I've made a big mistake what have I done in my life I'm about to ruin my marriage my family is going to be ruined this is the bigger boat we're looking at if this doesn't work then the prophet Allah says in the Quran then you may spank them okay now I get my baseball back come my lovely wife bang no the prophet said that you should not shed blood you should not leave a mark you should not break a bone you should not touch her face you should not insult her face what kind of spanking is this it's like this or use a tooth a brush which is known as miswak this one so if if you beat the heck of a person for like hours it's not gonna affect it's not gonna leave a Marcus so it's not a physical punishment the more it's a Sentimental way of expressing that we've come we're coming to the fork of the road you've done something that is so serious and Grave you don't do this because she failed to put salt in the food that would be a who does this it would be for something that is extremely serious like disobeying orders or abusing your family or her in-laws or being impolite not taking care of the kids properly but this has to fall into sequence so let your wife think it over the uh the Ayah he referred to the second Ayah in Surat uh and Imran this would take a long time and I have only a couple of minutes so I'm gonna skip this uh ARA talking about Wiki Islam um again I cannot address this the scholars that come on Huda TV can barely make a living they're not multi-millionaires that can spend time on such projects they have very little time and they have so much on their plate and they don't have people to finance them so it would be a little bit difficult to ask them to do something about it but rather go to a businessman tell them to make an effort inshallah this would take a place in India well actually it's not the day of arafah in India it's everywhere it is the ninth month of the Hijra whether people are celebrating it in Mecca or not in your country citing the moon if it's cited and the ninth day of delhija is equivalent to the eighth day of al-hajja in arafah or in Makkah this is no problem they can differ because Maghrib time when we break our fast in Haram in Makkah is different than when you guys break your fast in India so Sunset is different moon sighting is different as well do we have to shorten prayer no you don't but it is highly recommended Amina says what to do in the last 10 nights of Ramadan invoke Allah make a lot of vikr read the Quran and try to give charity as much as possible Mahmoud from Saudi Arabia is mandatory the answer is no it is voluntarily and recommended if the Imam is about to offer Salam to conclude the prayer what should I do you have to enter with him even if he is about five seconds from saying you have to join him and not wait to make another Jamar Aisha says is there any Surah to be recited at the night of jummah with lots of reward this is all fabrication if I miss them can I make them up the answer is yes you can uh reciting the Quran in for prayer or and completing it in tarawih or doing it in this entire would this be considered to be reciting the whole Quran the answer is yes and finally can we make the knee for atikaf before uh during uh sitting in the Masjid or it has to be before no you can the the most recommended and rewarded is that you do it before but if you entered the Masjid and half an hour later you said what what's the heck I have like six hours uh to stay in the Masjid I'm going to make article this is a permissible this brings us to the end of Virtues of fasting this concludes our uh program so I do apologize for not appearing uh and meeting you in the remaining four or five nights of Ramadan but I pray to Allah that he accepts My fasting and prayer as well as your fasting and prayer and that he makes us among those who are Freed From Hell Fire And I pray to Allah he grants Victory without an end to our brothers in Palestine to our brothers in Syria to the Sunni Brothers in Iraq to our Sunni Brothers in Yemen and to all those who are oppressed worldwide may Allah accept all our Good Deeds until we meet you in another Series tonight with family around a nice meal we're making doing how nice it is all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can on foreign"
