  "title": "Masjids have women section on upper floor or beside men with partition, salah valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so some masjids have a barrier for men and woman and the Masid is built with a K slanted so sometimes in these masss in these masss there will be men and women praying in the same row when the mid is packed but the men's side but the men the men's side start separated and eventually you have men and women in the same row but each to their respective sides similarly sometimes the is straight but the Masid has built a sister's area upstairs and one packed on the men's area some men pray on the first floor under the sisters and the sisters would pray up always above and sometimes in front of the men um and from when looking at it what from looking at it from an angle so is this permissible and is the Salah valid the Salat the Salat is valid especially if we talk about people praying uh in the second or in the above floor so women praying on the above floor and Men praying in the floor below them is fine it's not the ideal situation because the ideal situation is men up front women at the back this is the Sunnah but if for one reason or the other this is not followed as in the case where unfortunately in some places they would would have men and women side by side with a partition this is wrong nevertheless the prayer is valid and Allah Asel Knows Best"
