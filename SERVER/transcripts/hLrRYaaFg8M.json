  "title": "While reciting Quran can we make dua without praising Allah & salutations on Prophet assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so the first question says when reading the Quran can we make Dua directly without praising Allah and giving salutations to the prophet the answer is yes when you pass by a verse where there is mentioning of Allah's mercy and forgiveness or the description of J of paradise and you want to ask ask Allah to Grant you such a thing you simply ask Allah to Grant you his Mercy his forgiveness or to admit you to Jenna there is no need to praise Allah or to offer salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaih alh wasallam and the evidence is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he used to pray night prayer and recite the Quran whenever he passed by a verse that contains uh contained Allah's Mercy he would ask Allah for his mercy and whenever he passed by a verse that talked about Allah's wrath he would seek refuge in Allah from his wrath and torment so it was not mentioned that he used to praise Allah offer salutation upon the prophet Alam which means that you can go ahead and directly ask for it"
