  "transcript": "some 900 Laos office hours with that we go on to varys's history I think this Co compilation the history of compiling the quran and allah azzawajal has pledged that he will preserve the quran and we believe that this will be until the day of judgment or a little bit before that because before the end of time the quran will be uplifted it will be gone from Earth and the day of judgement would not be except upon the worst of people so Allah says in less than a dick wagner the half a zone and there are three stages for or two stages for compiling the Quran or two ways of compounding the Quran and there are three stages what are the two ways they are dependent on each other they cannot be separate the first one is to memorize the Quran Allah Allah tells his prophet Ali salatu salam move not your tongue with haste to recite it it is for us to collect it and give you the ability to recite it la to hedrick be healy sanika determine a bit the gibril when he used to did the Quran to the prophetess m the prophet used to hear it and repeat immediately well still he is reciting the rest holla tells him why is he doing this Tony would not forget it so when someone tells you i'm going to tell you the number again 65 one in six I marker so that you would not forget it Allah forbid him from doing this and likewise what people do in prayer some happens when the amendment areas I think they recite with him so lop symbiote me a PM without removing a single menu I'm reciting with him this is not permissible listen if he makes a mistake collection but don't recite with him it is not permissible to recite the party huh while the Imam is recited in the fatty huh after yes and if you leave the gap but if he doesn't leave a gap you don't have to recite it this is the most authentic opinion as long as he decided it this is enough inshallah now is better I was shouting all the time those Zechariah going back to the first time the first form of collection is memorizing and this is how the Quran was relayed buying memorizing it the Prophet did he write it is a la basura he memorized it by heart and the Companions also memorized it by heart the second form of collection then compiling the Quran is to write it so if someone says that listen I have memorized the Quran and I have a sound chain of narrations to the Prophet Alex la tercera and he gives this gives us something that is different to what is written in the Moose how would we accept this no you do not accept this and when someone comes and says listen I'm going to write the Quran rewrite it again in my own telegraphy the threat to the automatic calligraphy and it would be like typing normally it does not go with the recitation of the half of the party exactly match to match this is not accepted they have to go side by side not only the writing written form it has to be coincide with the chain of narrators to the Prophet is officer and this is a science by its own okay what are the three or four or five not four okay what are the four characteristics of memorizing the Quran first of all it is the most important thing because by eight we preserve the Quran so there has to be people who memorize the Quran and hamdulillah we have millions of them but thousands hundred movies literally millions my son-in-law who's my cousin as well he was eight years old when he finished memorizing the Quran he was eight years old he's my nephew then he's married to my daughter now he was eight years old he was in passing he memorized the Quran until now mashallah his Texan at heart he memorized a larger runia it's a book in Arabic teaches you the grammar he memorized it had a pro heat he memorized a las una pelota he was with like a mean this young age towards not with the shader tell but in the circle so this leads you to realize that Islam his own division that can be easily memorized nowhere nowhere you can find someone who memorizes the Bible not even the exact night he doesn't memorize the Bible he knows parts of it you will not find edition coming saying charted songs / so and so it's impossible maybe you find one in 100 million maybe but not more in Islam any one of us can memorize the Quran put the place of a lot would you mind to it it doesn't take much well after the sermon or analytic filming with the kid memorizing the Quran will continue until the end of time this is not only limited to the time of the companions on the contrary the more you go on in time the law people would recite and keep the Quran by heart and also has said the only scripture on earth The Tempest memorized nothing unless you have scripture of 2 pages that is a new division we make a new religion we have to pay the scriptures in this is only copy with everybody memorizes but then you have to challenge it and you have to prove that it is the word of Allah and there's nothing like this every Muslim must at least memorize part of it and the least eater memorizes this is a pillar of your prayer to recite al-fatiha is a pillar that you must decide if you're an imam or an individual if you remember it's an issue of dispute among scholars so the question may arise grab some coffee Manish I have so many demands one would ask was it written at the time of the Prophet a yourself some quad no yes now who says no raises his hands okay one two three four five five six seven okay it who says yes this is an and masha allah for and 48 so the rest of the sisters they ok let me rephrase the question so that it would clarify the little bit more was the Quran compiled in one who's half at the time of the Prophet Elisha Oh does anybody think else why another area okay so it was not compiled at his time but was it written yes it was written every single verse was written this is no doubt but it was not compile how was it written it was written in different forms as we can say I will see shopper but why wasn't it didn't what was it it completely well scholars say forgetting the moose her at the time of the Prophet is our son was out of the question why because he himself memorized it by heart not only that a number off of companions memorized it by heart he instructed us to take the Quran from Jay the Mets have a for Homer Bailey car from Abdullah even measured from Simon motor because Abby rhodesia who is the father no papa differ by the way no no hey banana man is different but they five million I was a companion who was with the Prophet Elise Islam his father died during the Battle of effort and because if they were Kaos you know when the people the archers came from the mountains are higher if he was a mushy at the time came from behind him and they took their places and started shooting the Muslims they were clears the Muslims were confused they did not know what was happening so they started killing each other pen among those who killed fine young man the problem of Haditha and he was shouting my brothers this is a problem that my father and they killed him so after the bathroom the Prophet came to him I saw and gave him the blood money the deal Denny said profitable why they did this out of goodwill I give it to Allah and His Prophet so the Prophet doesn't never forgot this her days of the DNA is known to be the secret holder of the Prophet because he knew the hypocrites the Prophet told him that this guy's a hypocrite disguise a hypocrite sarama used to come to him and say I asked you buy a lock am I among the hypocrites that the Prophet cold and named he said no you're not that i will not clarify anyone else should not open the door because after a while it seemed as it what about me what about me so he goes to do is different to a believer who was an immigrant from Mecca to Medina he had a slave his name is Salim who was one of the best exciters of the Quran and this is a big story of suckling the old because he was old and his wife was complaining to the prophetess firm he instructed her to circle him and this was an isolated case by the elimination to the prophets none for this situation we don't know go and ask our secretaries in the officer know so that we can become madam some people is encouraging this saying if you have a driver in the house let your wife said to him so that he becomes her son and then she can go with him alone shanna this is insane this was a specific isolated case who who was an operator padutha was the son of one of the leaders of the pagans ultima him it'll be a ultima he'll know be I was the father of Abu Hanifa was also the father of head bent ova the wife of bubbles appear an urban hub may Allah be pleased with them all so going back a lot of people of companions memorized the Quran by heart so there was not a great need to write it down the whole new it letter by letter among the reasons though the order of the verses was not finalized in the sense that if the Prophet will ask them to write vamos happen and then a verse comes and the Prophet says put this in the middle of we did not have cut and paste you cannot do this so they had to write the whole thing all over again and this was not possible as will be said before the verses used to come by in the morning and fight in the evening and the project himself is a son used to tell them this verse put it between that verse and that verse of this surah it was not revealed all together order it was separate here in there so this is one of the reasons why it was not written at the time of the Prophet item in one book and also because of obligation then when you come to talk about this because if they write the verses in the surah and then is obligated they cannot it is it it's difficult than men would be confused whether this was obligated or not was it whether this from the Quran or not so that is why it was not compiled in one book plate I don't know what this is but this is a fact the Prophet aristata salon had going back we will finish with the memorizing it now we go to writing it the part that is fraught with saran had more than 20 scribes 20 people writing for him among them mahalia table abu sufian the fourth caliph abu bakr umar uthman re the chief one was they didn't chabot he was the chief scribe through the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they were a lot of the they were more than 20 so many make the number to be 24 but all of them used to write for the Prophet Alex la pasaron how was it written it was written on anything they could take it put their hands on they did not have papers so they could write on cloth they can write on stones if they have some type of songs that is thin and why they can right to equality right on it they usually palm leaves on saddles and shoulder blades shoulder billions of animals you have this big shoulder blade that they can write on this ride or anything they could lay their hands on and in the very beginning it was forbidden to write anything except the Quran and that is why the property owner that I did whoever wrote anything about me except the Quran must erase it this was at the very beginning to release anything why just to preserve the Quran and that is why when the Prophet is unsure Roma may allah be pleased with him reading a paper and say no more what are you reading you told them this is a paper from the Torah from the Old Testament he got mad and furious at his muslim angry he took it from him and he said he have not her part by Allah if Musa was alive he could not do anything but follow me so don't go to here and there you have the source so he forbade him from reciting anything except before and this was at the very beginning but at the end and the 50 years 60 before that pop Hedra when the Prophet meant to medina s la tercera this became a normal practice he was once giving a football and a nomad came and said o prophet of Allah I cannot understand what you say I'll confused ask someone to write for me so he called Babylon now from the last and he told him right and he wrote the hadith for this bedroom which indicates that writing became a habit and that is why when I will parade on a very pleased with him said that i used to memorize at the london armored glass used to write so hero masta baggage of the prophet is a lot Sarah so at the beginning it was submitted but then this will not repeated in the Prophet allowed them to write salalah party who are you certain ok there are stages of compiling the Quran then the first stage when Homer advised abu bakr may allah be pleased with him to compile the Quran when did this happen after the death it's definitely after the death of a prophet because our bucket was a hey I'm Monica tell you mama what is not a Cattleya mama 17 people of Harvard night why accident road accident what kind of war between Christians and Muslims those who committed the act of apostasy they committed Dorinda they said we used to pay zakah to the professor on he passed away we don't pay zakah and some say we don't drink shoulder Abu Bakr never pees with him managed to get an army is it one fight home I said how can you fight people de salida in a lot of work I said her mother in the jaw Helia you were courageous now in Islam you coward what is this by Allah I will fight those who differentiate between salat and Sekot why Allah if they prevented even a rope that we tie a comment with if they prevent prevent prevented it from coming to me I will fight them then Roma says when I saw that Allah has opened our book is hard to this subject I knew that it was the right pencil it happened and they fought those are people and during the fighting they fought messina I'll catch up the liar who said that I'm a prophet and i can make fabricate quran and he could not and they killed him in Hangul Allah and who killed him washing the same man who killed 100 not in my pocket and he said that I killed the best of people and I will compensate this by killing the the worst of people in this battle 70 of the reciters of the Quran died not reside eous normal reciters Saudi happen and before that at the time of the Prophet RSS ran in there miruna that took place on the fourth year of Hedra also they were sent to lashed to the center of Arabia Muhammad nematic his name as reliable a cinder came to the prophet s and Medina and the proper choice in Islam and he did not reject it but he did not accept it so he told him send us an invoice from your side you know people to call the people organized they may they may find it attractive and we may accept Islam so he sent you large group of them among them were happen people when they say 40 some say 70 and they went to meet and a blue profane abemolik and this a man who was the leader of the tribe was not a safe person he did not honor the word of honor heaven malik who was the tribesmen and a dignitary of them how amiable had the uncle of penicillin malik went to give him power and this honor given a profile pointed to

annihilate it they killed all of them except to one of them was at the guard guarding this is not zero this is the last brick shop let's move on hey how 17 of those have died in this here on the 4th year of bedrock which means that a lot of companions memorized the Quran by heart so how do we interpret and understand that only take the Quran from these four four wave niqab Zeta Phi Beta belong
