  "transcript": "um Chef how are you I'm fine alhamdulillah I want to ask you one more just a little bit clarification you give a very nice advices on that if we should not remind people our we should not avoid people or what we do good for the other people it's not nice it's not recommended in Islam and what is the people if they ungrateful they are thankless and they they remind you that you did not do nothing for them and although you've done lots for them and still you're doing for them but even in return they are they are ungrateful thankless so what is so what is uh a person who's doing good okay first of all Heidi Those whom you have done lots of goodness too and then they come and face you and lie to your face and say you've never done anything good for us one of two if you were to confront them and say no I did this and I did this and I gave you this and I helped you in this the outcome is one of two either they will confess and say I am sorry I apologize you're right you have done so many good things for me or they will remain defiant and continue to lie and say no this was not done for the sake of Allah you did not do this for me you did not do anything there isn't a third option so if this is the case number one if you know that they have forgotten and you remind them not to rub it in rather to open their eyes and remind them of what you had done so that they would not be ungrateful and they would excuse you this is self-defense and there's no problem in that it does not fall under the category of element which is reminding others of your favors upon them but if you know that these people are by Nature ungrateful and no matter what you show them even if you show it to them in video they will still deny it and say you have not done anything the best course of action is to give them a big smile and not reply to them and not give them anything from date and ignore them and move away de-escalate why I feel I want to avenge myself don't what you have done was for the sake of Allah keep it for the sake of Allah the moment you want to avenge yourself this is when your reward goes down the drain so there is no point in doing this and it's best for you to have the upper hand and to be the one who's who's patient and tolerant and give your back to them and just de-escalate and leave"
