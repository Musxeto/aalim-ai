  "transcript": "go ahead with your question okay can you hear me yes we can okay my question my question is if you can hear me um they said a woman is a woman allowed to recite the Quran in front of men since Allah subhanahu waala said okay okay sister thank you for your question uh we're glad to be having uh so many calls and so many emails from  Nigeria uh she any advice for the sister well uh um again I'd like to thank the brothers and sisters in Nigeria because the amount of questions coming from there tells you the thirst thirstiness they have towards knowledge and it's an Islamic State it is one of the biggest Islamic States in Africa and the people of Nigeria are are known to be committed to Islam committed to daa committed to pract practicing the authentic Islam from the Quran and from the Sunnah for alhamdulillah we're getting these calls from our brothers and sisters in Nigeria as for the question uh she's asking about reciting the Quran in front of men if the men the sister who is reciting the Quran if they are strangers to her they do not relate to her her they are not Maham to her then this is not uh uh uh permissible but if uh she's reciting to her father son husband Brothers uncles and so on this is uh uh permissible and it is a form of worship and why do we say it's not permissible to uh to recite the Quran in front of strange men because the verse that the sister was going to mention where Allah says to the wives of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and to the women of uh uh the Islamic Nation they should not soften their voices and beautify their voices because this calls for those who have illness in their hearts they have hypocrisy they have temp they they are tempted easily this would cause them to be tempted so therefore we try to eliminate this women should not be should not soften their voices and beautify it because they are a place or they are a reason for tempting men okay thank you"
