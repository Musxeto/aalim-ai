  "transcript": "foreign originally from Morocco and free mixing there is widespread uh and because it's from oxygender they mix a lot to the point where they sleep in the same apartment or even the same room and they make the excuse and say oh he's like my brother or always she's like my sister and so my question is how do I advise my cousins on this for Zach Lopez it is like any other sin we as Muslims have to do our level best in advising people showing them the proof from Quran in Sunnah these people who say we have no problem in free mixing they're like my brothers they're like my sister we end up showing them facts from people they know that fell into Zina and Haram relationships when they were prior to that thinking like you were thinking no way on Earth that Allah prohibits something and you come up with something that goes against it thinking that it's fine and it turns to be fine whenever Allah prohibits something or the prophet Allah this is for your own good and only Allah knows what's best for us because he created us doesn't he know what or whom he created so he knows exactly what is best for us and what is not therefore when the prophet says a [Music] do not enter upon women folk non-mahram's meaning one of the companions stood up and said oh prophet of Allah what about my what about alhamu what about my brother my uncle my nephew I trust these people what about if they would were to enter upon my wife and mix with her the prophet Islam replied two words your brother your uncle your nephew are death meaning if you allow them to mix with your wife this is like allowing death to come and encounter your wife disaster is gonna happen inevitably man versus woman in one location in seclusion fire would ignite fuel next to fire so you advise them to the rest of your ability it works alhamdulillah it doesn't it's not for you to guide people it's for Allah the Almighty"
