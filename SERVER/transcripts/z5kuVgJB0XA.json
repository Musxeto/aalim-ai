  "title": "Blackmail with nude pictures by her ex so that she gets divorced with her new husband Assim alhakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so I have a friend who was um divorced and um her ex-husband yes and her ex-husband had used to take like pictures and videos of her when she was sleeping or when she was changing clothes and now that they divorced they were irrevocably divorced and now she was supposed to get married today and um he had sent these pictures to her to Blackmail he had sent these pictures to her cousins and Friends uh to blackmail her and now he wants her to um get married to this man and get divorced to him so that she they can marry again but she does not want to do anything so he had he had told someone that if they don't divorce within a month uh he would do something so my question is is she uh allowed to tell this new husband of hers that um he might get some pictures or videos something so because this ex husband might try to create problems first of all this is a legal matter alhamdulillah that these pictures and video clips were taken by an ex-husband and not by an ex-boyfriend which developed through a Haram relationship so no matter what this ex-husband sends of her no matter how filthy or heinous these pictures are it was with her husband see she didn't do Haram especially if it was taken without her consent now can she tell her husband to be the answer is yes but I would even escalate this further by reporting this to the police and this is a crime worldwide the man would be placed in jail especially if there are evidences like a witness this mediator this person who came to her and told her that if she does not divorce her husband after a month he will do something bad this person heard it from her ex-husband so he's a witness and she has emails she has text messages all of these must be reported to the police and they would inshallah put him in jail and confiscate all such offensive material and Allah Knows Best"
