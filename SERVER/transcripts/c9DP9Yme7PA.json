  "title": "Muslim daughter, Kafir son - want to gift daughter for her fasting & not the son- permissible? assim",
  "transcript": "sh I'm a reverse to Islam and I have two kids one alhamdulillah she's conver she converted also and the other one my boy he didn't accept Islam and then now it's Ramadan my girl she's fasting she's doing very hard on fasting and she's doing her best and I wanted to give her gift after uh Ramadan so what about my uh my other kid who is not a Muslim how I will uh manage about giving gift them how old is your uh uh boy uh my boy is uh 16 and my girl is 14 and she's the one uh working hard for the fasting and doing her best but my boy is not doing anything because he didn't uh convince you to me it seems that it is permissible inshallah to favor your Muslim son with gifts or your Muslim daughter with gifts and depriving your non-muslim son because of his kufur and disbelief and why do I say this because when you die your son will not get a single dime of your wealth while your daughter would inherit you because it is a wellestablished fact in Islam that a Muslim does not inherit from from a disbeliever cafir and the cafir does not inherit from a Muslim believing individual so it seems to me that favoring your Muslim daughter for her I for her fasting is permissible and Allah knows best now I have to also bring to your attention that it is not permissible for you to serve your cafir son breakfast or lunch during the daytime of Ramadan though he's a cafir yet still he is addressed by Shar laws which entails that he has to pray he's not he's a cfir he will not pray okay he will be punished on the day of judgment because he did not pray in addition to being punished that he's a cfir and also he's obliged too fast which means that we as Muslims must not serve non-muslims food during the daytime of Ramadan except if these non-muslims are not addressed to fast such as children beyond the age of puberty they're not obliged to fast so we can cook forood for them or elderly like our parents or grandparents who are disbelievers but they are over 78 80 years of age and they are unable to fast if they were want if they wanted to fast in this case we can cook them food and Allah Knows Best"
