  "title": "How you spend your youth - 50 Year old Teenagers! #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay the prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasam said the son of Adam will not be dismissed from before his lordel on the day of judgment until he has been questioned about five things we will not move from in front of Allah asael until we are held accountable for five things questioned his life and how he spent it his Youth and how he used it his wealth and how he earned it and how he disposed of it and how he acted upon what of knowledge this youth is a gift from Allah asael however it's a a fa it's gone for the likes of me alhamdulillah we've passed that stage and we have our regrets indeed we have our regrets because once this phase is gone you can never ever retrieve it therefore the most happiest of all people are those who and they make the best of it so when they get old when they pass this phase they reap the fruit and enjoy what they had done in the well-known Hadith to you of those who are shaded in the shade of Allah asael on the day of judgment one of the seven are or one of the seven is a young individual whether a man or a woman whether a boy or a girl a young individual who grew up worshiping Allah I go to many Gatherings and I see lots of the youth coming to me masallah in their teens memorizing the full Quran or or memorizing the Sunnah or being active in DAW and they're young and you feel that you are a bit envious I wish I was in their shoes my foot is a bit bigger than theirs but you get my point mashallah they are growing up in worshiping Allah so a young individual who we Envy is a righteous Pious individual who's always smiling honoring the elders having Mercy on the youngsters dutiful to his parents connecting to his kinship always optimistic always thinking positively of Allah if you look at him you identify the sunah in his appearance and in his actions every time you see an opportunity of goodness you find him at the Forefront and he's excellent in his studies and at his work he mixes only with the righteous and the Sinners fear Him and whoever fears Allah Allah will make the whole world afraid of him and respecting him this phase of Youth is like any other phase in life so when I say that I have missed this phase because of my age it doesn't mean that I have alhamdulillah reached safety no by Allah no one reaches safety No One Is Safe And this this is why Imam Ahmed when he was asked oh Imam when does an individual find this taste of comfort and security when do we find this is it after retirement is it after securing a huge chunk of money he said when you put your first foot in Jenna this is the only time you will taste the sweetness of comfort and security before you put your foot in Jenna you're always at the brink you're always at a threat of being snatched and thrown to hell or depression or any other thing only when you put your first first foot in Jenna this means that there's no going backas you're safe therefore those who are in this phase of Youth are being tested big time and why excuse them for this fan I'm like a shark you know sharks here in Kenya a lot if I'm in Still Water I suffocate and I die so I have to have this current of air all the time so this phase of Youth is the longest when you're a child it's maybe few months then you start to crawl on your hands and feet few months and then you walk and you trip and fall and once you reach a certain age maybe 13 14 then it is another 30 or 40 Years of strength power smartness sharpness of the brain and you think that I am here in this life to stay all of us when we were at that period of time we never ever thought of death we never ever feared death I remember when I was like in my 20s I used to drive cars Speed cars doing 200 220 kilm per hour at that time in the mid 80s and I was Fearless now I go 20 kilm per hour wearing my helmet and my seat belts and my protective gear and I'm afraid of everything why because this phase you are impulsive you are you don't think you shoot then ask questions unfortunately this is why this phase of Our Lives is challenging so many things are obstacles in our way and when I say in our way When We Were Young you guys are still mashallah have the whole world in front of you and your whole life is ahead of you so what are these challenges and how can we react to them one of there's so many and we can spend time until talking about these challenges and it depresses you every time you hear them but we're not here to depress ourselves we're here to find the problem and identify the solutions and this is the biggest problem patients face when they come to therapists they come come to the therapists with foggy glasses they can't see the therapist take the glasses and cleans it puts it back on their eyes and whoa mashallah you're a magician you fixed everything no I just help you to see so as a youngster what is some of the challenges I face number one what we call in aric to be a teenager and teenager is not restricted to 13 till 19 there are teenagers who are in their 50s but they can't say 15s because this is 15 no the 5 Z teens so it's a phase it's a mindset that actually it is is a fight between good and evil truth and falsehood and this fight is within us day and night when you are in your teens the voices of evil are far louder than the voices of goodness and every single one of you has Whispers In Their Heads correct who doesn't have a head who doesn't have Whispers everybody but these Whispers by the way are not all evil do you know that half of The Whispers we have are good are from an angel the prophet saysat and this is an authentic Hadith the Satan has some hold over the son of Adam and the angel has some hold over the son of Adam in the Arabic language so the prophet says As for the hold of the Satan it is reminding him of evil and disbelieving in the truth as for the hold of the Angel it is reminding him of goodness and believing the truth whoever find the latter let him know that it is from Allah if you hear good Whispers telling you yeah she let's go next week for omah you hear these voices sometimes oh I have some extra money let me go for one week for omra and then go for two days in Medina you say who yes who's who's talking to me who would be talking to you it's an angel but if you hear the earlier then if it's something of the former let him seek Refuge with Allah from the accursed Shan if you hear voices in your head oh after this boring lecture let me go and listen to some songs of Tay Taylor Swift yeah wooo hey who's this who's this who's talking to you Shan So This Whispering is 24 hours 7 days a week every every time you pass by m oh they have a lecture yeah I don't have anything let me go listen who's this telling you to go Allah loves you Allah sends this Angel to you and you heard what this Angel is telling you you're in good hands this fight between good and evil the youth have it every day and they good and evil have Advocates so Advocates of good are your parents are your Mash your Scholars your teachers they are The Advocates of good they're pushing you to do good things and The Advocates of evil are your bad friends bad media not you guys I'm not so happened I spoke about the media the bad media you know uh uh Instagram Facebook H Facebook um all these things found on the internet that suck you in and take you to Hell Fire if you're steadfast on the straight path and you fight those advocating evil and you are with those advocating goodness you're safe but if you slip and slip is what a lot of Muslims youth had fallen into if you trip and fall in the Shan's traps recovering is very difficult do you have mountains in Kenya to go uphill is very difficult once you reach the top it's rewarding to go downhill it's just like this very fast so it is difficult in the times of Youth to reach the peak and this is why all the hadiths in the Sunnah praises the youth who have went up and Allah has given them the power to go up because going down is the case of the majority unfortunately now the phase of being a teenager for the Youth unfortunately it's like a cloth hanger what do we mean by cloth hanger when you enter home you take your jacket and you put it on your cloth hanger take off your head gear take off your th take anything you put on your cloth hanger a lot of us use this phase of teenager to be a cloth hanger so when my son does bad things oh he's a teenager when he doesn't pray faer it's okay he's a teenager when he goes to nightclubs and has a girlfriend it's a teenager so it's it's a phase it's going to pass when he does bad at school when he does drugs when he do storing he's a teenager Subhan Allah is being a teenager an excuse a legitimate excuse at the sight of Allah no if you look at the time of the companions may Allah be pleased with them you will find that the teenagers were the leaders of the companions when you look at us 18 years of age approximately leading an army at the time at the life of the Prophet Alat wasam and in the Army who's under his command Abu Bakr Omar and Ali whoa the best four under his com this kid yes the prophet appointed himat and he kept Abu Bakr to his side to be his advisor and the likes and when Abu Bakr became Khalifa Abu Bakr requested Omar to be at his side but the rest went under his command Z zabit 15 years old boy one of the Learned companions with abilities that would blow your mind if you read his biography 15 years of age the prophet said Alam learn the language of the Jews learn Hebrew and in two weeks he mastered it two weeks he picked up Hebrew and he used to write for the prophet alham letters in Hebrew and translate whatever came of correspondences to the prophet Alam from the Old Testament from the Torah zabit was he saying oh she I have Pokemon to play I don't have time can I have the day off no they were dead serious because they had Iman and they knew whatever starts on the right track would end always to have positive among the challenges and their many the biggest challenge the youth face nowadays is free mix ing this is putting fuel next to the fire inshallah inshallah it will not ignite you get again closer and closer and closer and Houston we have left off boom this is killing the Muslims worldwide the non-muslims don't have any anything in them they're out of service expired the Muslims are Hot Blooded baby can't you see they have this fever of 103 they're too hot Muslims why because usually they lower their gaze so that's why you have a lot of energy in them the non-muslims they look everywhere so they're out of service the free mixing is one of the greatest weapons of Shan the prophet so she I said yeah how did you know she said no I know when you sayum it's a man sayum it's a woman and see don't know maybe she's making this up I know that I am not soft with women at all with the grace of Allah this is my my root so that Shan would not come between and those who call and they sometimes address this and say why I hang up in their face I don't even answer andan does the prophet says is whenever she goes out Shan raises her up and beautifies beautifies her so that men would look and Subhan Allah this is human nature if you have 20 women and you have the most handsome person on Earth inside there's moving out only maybe one or would look the rest would nah not but if you have 20 Pious beards short thbes M putting a tree in their uh pocket M and you put one bomb her father is she's a bomshell let her walk in front of them what will it doah like Radars this is human nature and Shan utilizing it to the best so this is the first step for fah sins how stop this it's not easy it is not easy because it's a system it's not an injection you say please give me an injection and I can look gaze you can't it's a whole system of belief it's like so many people say how can I pill it's a system of life knowing who Allah is so among the ways of free mixing and sending your gay har things you have to first of all I have of material time is not going to be in our sight so I have to wrap things up the prophet said this to to he said the first is the first look is yours the second is against you you are held accountable for it what is the first look some brothers say wow I'm not blinking blinking still I'm not blink I can't I blinked what said look no Habibi this is the hund look The First Look is when and woman comes in front of you you look so that you don't you know cross her over and and run her over with your car then you look somewhere look it is halal because you can't looking the light pole wall and go and fall into a well this is not illogical the second look is when you intentionally look to start measuring is it's okay 36 no this is Haram you cannot do this so the second way help you lower your gaze and avoid free mixing M get married and I was shocked to find a lot of the youngsters in Kenya they don't young how old are you I'm 36 mallah Allah how many grandchildren do you have I'm not married yet she why if you're not married be pleased with him whenever he saw a man who's not married he bluntly say to him one of two reasons you're not married either you are impotent you're not a real man orator you're doing Haram there can't be a third reason why aren't you married sisters are available and the means are available so so get married soon and don't say the right woman did not it will never come and don't my the sisters don't say that I'm waiting for my knight in his shining arm horse he will come on a it's good still alhamdulillah he still has a ride but don't put high expectations and then fall and have nothing whatever is available say bismah is in the eyes of the beholder so many people things and get and so many people don't expect anything Allah gives them aid from Paradise this is in Allah's hand thirdly stay away the fire away from the fuel this is the don't mix at school at universities at workplace don't mix at family gatherings so many households here in and elsewhere in Old Muslim World Unfortunately they don't follow Islam they follow culture you find the Brothers dining with their sister-in-law they live in a joint family so the father wants to sit with his sons and their wives and the children but they're not Mah I sit with my sister-in-law and I look at her and say mallah she's very nice very cute very beautiful and wife why is this this would corrupt my marriage this would my life no if I only no one other than my wife she's a mermaid from Jenna if I see other options Shan is there and also when she sees other options and looks at me of course he will not say but she might one day be tempted byan to say w his brother is his cousin is more handsome he's this and that and Shan is always there the prophet saidat no man should be alone Anam Woman except with someone to break this seclusion otherwise whenever a man is alone with a woman the third one with them is whoan what is going to do say say say do you think is going to say of course and in order to curb at Haram have to always remember who's looking at you why do we say this the one of the biggest hurdles in front of the youth today is pornography and I've done counseling for people who are addicted Ed to pornography and those who are usually carrying dumb uh phones or smartphones and laptop their iPads and insist on sitting in any with their back to the wall why they the moment they go into uh yeah I think here is is a good place nobody can watch me and they give their back to the wall and they innocent Mah they're answering emails and doing legitimate but they're watching Haram nobody knows this except who but they don't know that Allah is watching which shows you the biggest problem the youth and the Muslims and the whole world has the ignorance of Allah presence and watching and listening doing we don't pay attention because if someone came to him and say do you watching you and listening to what you're listening to he would close say yeah of course I know he gets two seconds later he gets because he forgot he forgets you have to know that Allah knows whatever your eyes is cheating and whatever SE in your chests also good companionship something we lack the more good companions you have righteous compan the less sins you do because Shan cannot come and try to influence surrounded by good people and this is why you are a lone wolf when you like to sit in your home you don't like to meet people you don't like to people Shan is your time filling your spirit filling your head with evil thoughts and I don't have any other option nobody is there to be with me so I in investigate I do whatever I can and Shan will have a say in it you need in such challenge of lowering your gaze to seek refuge in Allah to make Dua to do a lot of good voluntary Deeds so that support you and help you and make you able to overcome addiction are other challenges face oh we're not over no no this this is just the tip of the iceberg among the challenges PE pressure the youth is driven by the peer pressure and it depends on who you associate yourself with that you are either good or bad how is that the prophet a man follow the his close friend so let one of you look at who he takes as a close friend is following the same religion as his best so who was Abu bakr's best friend friend Prophet Muhammad what happened immediately and the moment Abu Bakr embraced Islam of the seven of the 10 heavenbound followed him he was the six of the 10 tolam because he had influence over them and do not underestimate the influence of your friend I know so many people who are not practicing the moment they mix with practicing people after two or three days you will see the over them how they come to us and say sheh after meeting you for two three days and sitting with the and the people in the Masjid people are noticing changes on us and say what's wrong and I say why he said because every speak to them say inshallah and we use Islamic terminology that we've picked you though we don't mean it but it becomes of our system and life this is influence others on the other because they want what do these movies impact them WTF whenever they say see something WTF what the the car is coming and they're about to die Muslims say they say they say anything relating to Allah those influenced by movies WTF well no I don't think is dying says L but you get the idea this is how the media influences us this is how friends influence us and this is why if you look at the beautiful Hadith the authentic Hadith where the Prophet saidat a man killed a 100 an assassin he killed 100 people he went to a scholar and said to him is there anyone who repent The Scholar said of course who would prevent youting to Allah but you live in a community filled with Bad Company you repent with them leave that go to town y z and worship Allah because the inhabitants are good people so the man immediately without any questions packed his bag and left in the middle of the journey that he was dying he got a stroke and like these sprinters when they come to the Finish Line he did this chest towards the good town and died Midway angels of Mercy came down the Angels Came Down wanted to claim his angels of Mercy said no no no he's ours he came with to repent the angels of hell like hell he did he never had never done a good thing in his life he's ours and they started to fight every know he's ours so Allah sent an angel but gave the angel the form of a man to honor men and to arbitrate between them so the angel came and said let us measure the distance between the two towns he died whatever town is closer the Angels take him so they started measuring with a long measuring tape Allah the almighty The Good Town come close and said to the bad Town go further so they found him closer to the good town and the angels of Mercy took him to Paradise never ever done any good thing but this shows you the of what of good companionship so look in your list how many righteous practicing good brothers and sisters well the brothers have brothers h have good sisters M no how Brothers do you have on your contact list and how many sisters you have on your contact list you'll be shocked seriously because you will vast majority are not classified as righteous or or something that you would like to meet Allah with so start cleaning and adding righteous comp among the challenges that we have is a lot of free time when we have free time this is one of weapons of Shan when you're not occupy time with something beneficial what are you going to do up with something harmful it's very simple it is like a cup if you fill it with good things you can't add anything if you fill it with bad things you can't add anything to it but if it's half half you can add whatever you want and it's going to be a mixture and this is why said this there are two blessings which many people do not make the most of good and free time when you were young and had good health what did you do to it oh Sheik I worked out I did my cardio I did resistance excises I did this I did good for you that's good you're utilizing your health what about the food I have good diet she mallah very good the vast maj majority eat junk food the M majority don't exercise the vast majority of the youth and I was shocked to see this when they stand straight they can't see their toes Mas some of the brothers said W this is my foot I did not why a Muslim has to be fit has to looking good not to impress the the opposite gender rather because he wants to be healthy he wants to be strong whenever there's a a need your family to protect your country to protect your religion you're fit but when you're not then you have a problem so the prophet says there are two blessings which many people do not make the most of good health and free time so many people play games they waste 8 to 10 hours on video games I know people from my relative used to sit for 10 hours in front of the screens playing video games okay what have you gained big butts they've exercised a lotah and they're getting smaller smaller bigger and bigger and bigger in size there's no benefit of it no knowledge but they're wasting their time utilize your time you become a scholar you want to become a scholar W from six months to one year if you utilize your time from 6 hours to eight hours you'll be a scholar that easy Bo that easy because you have to walk the talk learn Implement teach you're a scholar but when you have free time I don't know what to do Sheik uh I'm going to play cards and they play cards you see them on the streets doing nothing but playing cards six hours eight hours what are you doing oh she killing time and what is the crime of time to kill it what did time do to you oh I'm just killing time utilize your time and utilizing the time YouTube and the likes do you know in one of the old surveys and this I got from Islam they have on Facebook the number of views of videos of course Facebook obsolete now nobody uses Facebook except those who are 50 years and older the youngsters Facebook what is this your stone age they say the views of videos on Facebook is 4 billion a day imagine 4 billion views a day on Instagram there is 70 million photos uploaded a day with 2.5 billion likes yeah the people don't have anything in life except to waste on trash on this filth and if you go Tod or's page how many likes three four but if you go to scum of the earth actors actress celebrities those called huh influences they are scum of the earth and they have 10 million likes 20 million followers what are they bringing to the table nothing oh she you're envious because nobody you I walk every single day day and night try my level best to call to Islam and I look behind me nobody's following me and they say you have followers nobody is following me figuratively speaking H but those scum they have been followed by the youth and they're impacting their lives negatively oh I saw this guy or this girl were eating this food at this restaurant let's go and try it I have to buy the shoes one of the sisters told me that she had to buy a shoe from Dubai 177,000 R how much is that hello calculation 177,000 R yeah you know you do the math yeah are you in your mind wearing something in your foot that is more than a th000 Shillings so brand name sheh brand name need the brand name to lift yourself I don't because I don't need things material things to lift me up my knowledge lifts me up my Iman lifts me up my acknowledgement that Allah is my Lord lifts me up I don't need a fancy watch or a fancy pen of 6,000 7,000 or nice glasses or robes or cars to lift you up you are empty shell a real Muslim is a knowled and assessed by his actions by what he says by what he believes this is why the are following the scum of the earth and these influencers did not come become influencers because you only because them if you did not follow them would anyone took them as influences no so it's an obsession and an addiction among what time we have no any Pages take your time five minutes and take your time this is one of the challenges the old people face when the youth come and control them anyhow so among the challenges the youth face and this is for of Education of the sh and the spreading of thoughts of atheism M and this is worldwide they attack the concept of Allah and his existence and they cast and spread their doubts whether Allah exists or not whether the Quran is true or not you've heard of the qur those who say that only Quran is the source of sharah is not valid this is their step to dismantle Islam so the these atheists or people without without any religion or without any God they're trying to infiltrate the youth by phrases of Liberty being a free thinker being being someone yeah not associated to the old regime and unfortunately some of the youth some may listen and follow knowledge and this is dangerous it's evener for Muslims to watch debates to be able to sit and watch a Muslim defending Islam in front of an atheist or a cafir or uh an islamophobe he spreads his Venom counter that and maybe there is no time so the thoughts and The Whispers have already infested your mind it's dangerous don't do that the prophet saidat whoever hears of the do you know the Jal if you heard that theal came in Nairobi what will you do go and take a look huh hoping that he he's not a politician you just go and take a look so if you hear of him you want to go just just look the prophet says Alam whoever hears of the Dalal let him keep away from him o why for by Allah a man will come to theal thinking that he is a Believer yeah I go and let me check the deal I'm a Believer I'll go and just look at him then he will follow him because of the confusion he causes and the FNA he has so the prophet is warning you when you hear of places of Calamity of fitna of confusion of tribulation run don't think that oh mallah I have strong Ean I I'm going to be the one who counters it no you're not you're going to be one of the followers among the fitan and and the tribulation and and challenges the youth face smoking and drugs and it is something that is invading the Muslim world where I come from alhamdulillah the custom agents every single week catch millions of keagon I don't know what this called drugs small pills that the youth take in addition to C in addition to crack in addition to marijuana and has they do a beautiful job and inshallah they are doing it as well here but this needs a collaboration of the whole Community if you see a drug dealer or someone who is trying to spread it and you turn a blind ey say may Allah make hi may Allah give them hi you are causing the problem go to the police report him go and and show the authorities where his hideouts are to inite at and to totally get rid of this disease finally there so many things but I will uh conclude with this among maybe before the last among the challenges inferiority complex as a Muslim are you proud yes or no well they're asleep I bet you they are asleep sleep they're not even opening their eyes guys as Muslims and girls are you proud to be Muslims okay the vast majority of the Muslims are not and I get hundreds of questions every week the time of prayer is due and can I combine and at the end of the day woof what kind of combination is this this combination lock they said because um I am shy to pray in front of the people in the airport or in the garden or in the souk or in the workplace so you're shy to be a Muslim to announce that you're a Muslim they used to call thean in the middle of New York and London and you're shy this shows you that you have an inferiority complex Allah says so do not weaken and do not grieve and you will be the superior if you are True Believers a True Believer is not ever feeling down or humiliated no he's proud am I doing something wrong I'm doing and for Allah who am I insulting or offending so be proud of your religion the prophet says whoever imitates a people he is among them the vast majority of the Muslims today imitate the disbelievers I've seen in Muslim Arab countries the youth wearing a cross what is this oh she is like bling bling you know they're becoming homies They Like Rappers they see the Ws I've seen Muslims born and raised as Muslims wearing tattoos what is this so everybody's doing it and now find me one footballer that doesn't have a tattoo I don't know I don't watch them but I've been told that they're all over the place boxers MMA and they all wear tattoos and the Muslims feel inferior Ya Allah if I don't do this maybe people would look down at me while when they do after y shave your head no I can't shave my head what will the people say about me no no just cut this little little little bit be proud show the world that you made omra go for the Shaving said they have an inferiority complex our religion is based on going against everything the Jews and the Christians do imagine the prophet Alat wasam used to tell the companions to do things to the extent that the Jews and this is in sah Muslim notice this and they said this man doesn't leave anything from our Affairs except he's telling his people to do the opposite the Jews are saying this everything we do this man Muhammad alai is telling his people to do the opposite so if you go to wearing the Beards growing the Beards of course for men not for women sisters don't do this don't try this at home so growing the beards for men the prophet said go against the Jews and the Christians and the idol worshippers grow your bead when it comes to trimming your mustache is the same to pray in your shoes and sandals this is a Sunnah a lot of the Muslims don't do you're in the airport you're praying Outdoors don't take off your shoes pray with them the prophet said pray in your sandals and shoes the Jews do not pray in their sandals and shoes so the prophet is ordering us to go against their way he ordered us to delay the pre-dawn meal and to make F the breakfast after fasting early to go against the Jews and the Christians anyhow there is a lot of challenges that face the youth among the last inshallah is being indecisive the youngsters need a compass need mentors need Scholars to guide them so many of us when they have finished high school don't know what to be majored in in University so they don't know what specialization to choose so they're indecisive they don't know what to do in life sometimes you adhere to your parents wish oh we would like you to be a doctor so they go to Medicine two three four years and they fail and their life is ruined some say no I would like you to be an engineer they go while their inclination is to admin Administration or to be a pilot or to be a doctor or to be a farmer or to be a businessman so this indecisiveness requires mentoring guidance requires consultation so this is where we need Scholars to intervene and to give their views and a helping hand and finally I hope this is really finally the issue of impulsiveness the youth are impulsive they are Hot Blooded they have so much energy but they don't have a safety valve and without the safety valve they explode in the battle of the Prophet saidat wasam along with the elders we will stay in Medina and let the enemy come and we will will fight them from our own homes Medina is a fortress we will beat them in a heartbeat the youngsters who could not make it in bad the the previous year said no no we want to go out we want to meet them in the open we want to destroy them and they started fighting the youth along with the elders the elders say no this is not wise when the prophet saw thisat wasam and there was so much AR argument and and and loud voice he retreated to his home and when they saw him Retreat to his home they thought to them to themselves I think we made something wrong so after half an hour when he came out wearing his gear for war they said okay okay okay Prophet Alam we acknowledge and concede we will fight from Medina we will not leave Medina the prophet said it's too late when a prophet puts his gear he has to go out for fighting and you know what happened in because of what the impulsiveness of the youth this has to be harnessed by the elders wisdom by the scholars knowledge by consultation yes we don't disregard the youth's opinion rather we harness it we control it we put it in the right direction because we need the youth this religion cannot stand except on the shoulders of the youth but it has to have the wisdom and the guidance of the scholars and the elders and I do apologize for putting you to sleep early but inshallah this nap is part of the sunah because the prophet said take the Siesta this nap before because do not have it so inallah we follow the Sunnah"
