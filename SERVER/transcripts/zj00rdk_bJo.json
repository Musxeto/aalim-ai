  "title": "I keep repeating sins even after repenting, what should I do? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a lot of people do repent back to allah but they still go back to the same scene and sometimes it's not that they want to do that particular scene but they sing they go back the scene they go back the scene they go back in this situation what does one do this is not a one side is that fits all it's different sizes different people stroke strokes for different folks as they say as they say so so a person person who falls back into sin must must analyze why i and i tell people are you addicted to pornography change your smartphone or your stupid phone stupid phone into an old nokia 870 for example you know only send and receive and maybe it has a flashlight that facilitate he's not gonna say it to me did you see the last thing or did you hear the last of the song oh did you see this you see listen i was reading the quran and i came across it so hard allah yes she said she said go [Music] you feel and you think of yourself yourself and i have to wake every day at 4 30 go to the message and this guy is enjoying himself what kind of a life am i living i'm fasting mondays and thursdays those around you facilitate your sin if you don't choose your companions wisely they'll drag you down if you choose your companions to be righteous and on top they'll pull you up it depends on who you accompany but and there are so many factors but the time is limited example someone sends me a whatsapp message with a video now i can tell that if i open the video there will be maybe background music or a woman anchor saying the news this is haram sometimes if i'm not fasting shaytan may laugh don't listen to just take the best of it when you're fasting mondays and thursdays this doesn't happen so for allah no i'm not doing what what am i going to benefit of it and this cascades to the other days of the week when you're not fasting because you've learned your lesson every monday and thursday so when it's tuesday you want to listen something pulls you back because you've you've learned how to fear allah azzawajal in your fasting and the fear is coming closer to you on other days so if we take this and implement it this ramadan would have an excellent taste inshaallah"
