  "transcript": "canada says is there any mentioning of dinosaurs in the quran or in the sunnah the answer is no there's no mentioning to such an issue because it is of no great importance to the muslims so this can be a fact that they were there and this can be a hoax either way it doesn't make a big difference to us as muslims so islam quran sunnah is not necessarily going to tell you every single thing about the beginning of time about history about geology about archaeology or whatever no this is not quran and sunnah allah tells us all what we need to know about living on earth about where we are going after death where we came from what is the purpose and objective of our creation what are we supposed to do islam governs everything that deals with our lives things at the past whether they were flying dinosaurs or they looked like this or that this is of no great importance and this is why islam doesn't tell us does not confirm it and it does not deny it likewise is there any life on other planets does the quran say anything no it doesn't confirm and it doesn't deny because of its no great importance to us so if there are different worlds out there good for them it doesn't have to do anything with us focus on what is important if you're running a marathon you do not look right and left enjoying the scenery or watching a car racing another in a drag race or reading the advertisements you focus on your race and this is what you should do in life and allah knows best"
