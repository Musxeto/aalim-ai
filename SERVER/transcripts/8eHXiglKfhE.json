  "transcript": "foreign [Music] so let me let me understand your question are you telling me if my parents are pleased with me is this a sign that Allah is also pleased with me and that I'll be protected in the grave from the torment of it no yes yes okay the the answer is that no this is not true if your parents are satisfied with you yes this is a great sign that Allah is pleased with you the Hadith of the Prophet Allah the pleasure of Allah is in pleasing your parents however this has to be looked at and understood within the Sharia law if your parents tell you to divorce your wife and this unfortunately is coming to me in counseling sessions like crazy I get people coming to me and say my mother doesn't like my wife I love my wife I love my children and she and my father are insisting that I divorce her I say to him does she work in a strip club is she rude with your mom and dad she never meets them rarely meets them so I said don't divorce her and he says my mom is compelling me to do this or she will commit suicide she will jump from the balcony she would curse me till the day she dies your mother is a transgressor your mother is a wrongdoer don't ever obey her and no matter what she does don't even pay any attention to that without due respect then you have to be dutiful to your mom you have to be respectful but if your mom is of such a caliber don't even look at what she's doing because she is disobeying Allah and not only that wanting you to disable Allah if you want to go to hell with your mom be my guest but if you want to go to Jannah don't uh uh divorce your wife so not everything that your parents order you to do is part of pleasing Allah on the contrary there is no obedience to a creature in disobeying the Creator subhanahu azzawajal so be careful so your statement is not entirely true yes if you please your parents and you are a person upon the Sunnah with the correct akid and they tell you to do good things and you comply and you try to seek their pleasure in making them happy and and and and laughing all the time this is a sign that Allah is pleased with you this has nothing to do with the torment of the Grave unfortunately and Allah Knows Best"
