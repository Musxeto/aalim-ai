  "transcript": "he is asking about shortening the prayer and very simply once you leave your hometown or the town that you're resigning as in his case in Riyadh you are allowed to combine for her and a sir this is one set or Maghreb Anisha this is the second set and you may combine it forward or delaying it which means that if I'm in the way I can pray at the time of the harp to rehearse of the and then proceed answer to be prayed with it afterwards after concluding my prayer now or I can travel the whole known time until it's due for a sir and then I pray 2 rakats all over and pray 2 rakaats of a sir at the time of Assam in your case you arrived at your hotel it was Margaret time and you were unable to check-in and do all the paperwork until it was Asia time so this means that you are allowed to pray the three records of mother it at the time of Asia and this is combining between Madhuri Benicia and delaying the first one this is no problem and then you pray 2 rakaats raesha afterwards but most likely you would pray in with the congregation in the message so you have to pray with the Imam so if the emember is for you pray for if the Imam shortens the prayer you pray - so in this case yes you would have been allowed to combine and join even if you reach your destination this was your question reaching the destination you're still labeled as a traveller the only time that the destination matters is when you go back to your hometown or to your residing city so in your case if you're saying in Medina for 4 days 5 days a week and then going to Mecca for 5 more days and going to Tyee for going back to Medina the whole journey you shorten and combine if you wish praying on time is the best shortening is the Sunnah but if you pray in a message or you're next to a message it's mandated upon you to pray full but if you're on your own or you miss the Salah and you're praying in the message you pray shorten the for occurs in t2 Mallory Ben fetcher they are not affected the number of Records that is once you go back to your hometown or the the city you residing in which is met which is Riyadh then all the excuses of traveling is over so the minute you enter the border of Riyadh you cannot shorten and you may only combine if you delayed the prayer to later on"
