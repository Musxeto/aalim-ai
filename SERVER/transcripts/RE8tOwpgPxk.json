  "transcript": "ahmed from egypt he says if a person lives in a corrupt country and the scholars that belong to that country they follow what the rulers say in corrupting the religion changing the verdicts of islam so what to do this is happening everywhere what you have to do is to follow real trusted scholars it's not something that deals with your passport or with your country or the with the soil you live on islam is a universal religion so you're bound to follow quran and sunnah even if all of you the scholars of your country go against that you don't follow them or believe them or obey them"
