  "transcript": "okay this question from my friend uh she I got married two months ago and I'm still waiting for my official documents to get ready and I'm still not allowed allowed to work meanwhile someone stole a lot of money from us and now we're struggling too much and soon we will have nothing to eat we know that getting a loan is Haram and we don't want to do it but in our case would it be okay so the answer would be no this is not permissible and getting a riba based loan is one of the seven major s it is like taking a painkiller when you have cancer it will reduce the pain a little bit but the illness is still there so this loan would not relieve you from your problems it will give you a month or two above water but then you'll drown again and you cannot seek what is with Allah through Haram means so ask Allah for Provisions ask Allah to facilitate your Affairs ask Allah to ease them but stay away from any interest-based loan"
