  "transcript": "there are certain actions that invalidate the prayer so if you learn them and master them you don't need to ask she I did this I did that would that invalidate my prayer if you master these alhamdulillah so what are the things that invalidate my prayer number one to break my woodo because one of the conditions of Salat is to be in the state of Purity so if a person urinates defecates passes wind Etc invalidates his Wu then his prayer is invalid imagine someone in prostration and he takes a nap he sleeps wakes up after 57 minutes and whoops I took a nap yeah your prayer is inv because you broke your W number two to be in touch with an impurity an impure substance so if it comes in contact with a worshipper and he's aware of it this invalidates his prayer unless he removes it so for example while praying I remember that I have a an impurity on my head gear so I immediately take it off and throw it away and continue to pray your prayer is valid but if the the impurity is in my underwear I can't take those off while praying so I have to break my prayer and move remove it and purify myself and go and establish a prayer once again number three to expose or to uncover the deliver iately so a woman while praying takes off her scarf fixes her hair puts your scarf again and continues to pray no you've exposed your a deliberately someone taking off his uh um waist wrapper and his our is exposed deliberately your prayer is invalid number four to give your back to the deliberately and we we spoke about movement and turning away from the this breaks your prayer number five to speak deliberately so while in prayer someone says to you where did you put my wallet and you said it's on the table there and you continue to pray this breaks your prayer because Allah ordered us in the Quran by saying and stand before Allah devoutly obedient and this Ayah was revealed at a time when the the companions used to communicate during prayer so while in in prayer they one would would ask the one next to him so what happened yesterday so are you coming to lunch today that was normal until this Ayah was revealed the companions say so we were ordered to uh uh be silent and not to speak while in prayer number six to laugh out loudly so if someone laughs out loudly during prayer the consensus of Scholars that this invalidates his prayer number seven among the things that invalidate a person's prayer whether a man or a woman is for a woman to pass in front of the worshipper or a dog or a black dog would W would walk between the prostration spot and the standing position of an individual the prophet saidham when one of you stands to pray he will be screened if he has something in front of him that is like the back of a saddle if he does not have something in front of him that is like the back of a saddle which mean that is this height then his prayer will be interrupted if a donkey a woman or a black dog passes in front of him and this Hadith was was narrated by Imam Muslim now I know that many people would say whoo you're resembling women to dogs and and and and donkeys I said no I'm not this is the Hadith of the Prophet Alat and this is part of worshiping Allah without asking for justification or IL legitimate reason we comply without arguing and this invalidates the prayer of a man praying or even a woman so if a sister passes in front of her mom or her sister between her prostration position and standing position this invalidates her prayer number eight to abandon one of the pillars to emit an essential part or condition or obligatory part of the prayer deliberately without any excuse and we spoke about this before when we talked about the pillars and the obligatory actions number nine to eat or drink deliberately reported the cons the consensus of Scholars that whoever drinks or eats during his F prayer deliberately and intentionally that his prayer is invalid and he has to repeat that all over over again number 10 deliberately adding a pillar or putting a pillar in the position of another pillar so someone adding a fifth RA in deliberately or prostrating before doing R deliberately this invalidates the prayer number 11 canceling the intention and this has to have the firm intention to leave the prayer not a an intrusive thought that comes to your head while praying saying oh I think I'm going to leave prayer to do this and that it's it's an intrusive thought no we're talking about a sincere firm intention to leave the prayer and to break it this invalidates the prayer now when we talk about laughing that breaks a prayer laughing as the scholars divided into categories or levels one level one is just to smile so someone is praying and then he does this this does not invalidate his prayer laughing out loud this breaks the prayer without any doubt especially that type of laughing where you have these loud voices because this shows that you're playing around with the Salat and this defies the purpose of Salat so someone ha makes a sound number four laughing that is in between it's not audiable and it's not smiling the majority of Scholars say that this invalidates the prayer if one or two letters have been uttered so these type of sounds would invalidate your prayer even if you don't make a sound if you start shaking your shoulders this invalidates your prayer and Allah Knows Best"
