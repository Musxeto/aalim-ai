  "transcript": "the UK yes I'm doing great alhamdulillah I'm sure I wanted to ask about um I have been learning about the names of names and attributes of Allah and alhamdulillah it has helped me to realize the greatness of Allah but when at the time of sin or if I'm thinking of any sin um I am unable to generate the fear of Allah in my heart the thoughts of Allah's mercy and forgiveness overwhelms me and I end up sinning and then I regret that all the knowledge that I've gained and every like Allah like Allah's hearing and seeing and his severe punishment all the all the knowledge that I get has no benefit because I am unable to fear him I don't know how to generate the fear of Allah like during the time of when I am getting thoughts of sins that's I don't know how to do that it goes without saying that learning the beautiful names of Allah and his attributes is the best motivation to abandon sin because the more you know him the more you love him the more you fear Him and the more you hope in what goodness he has in store for you however sometimes this is not sufficient by itself because as human beings though we have the knowledge though we have the passion by knowing Allah's beautiful names and attributes to worship him as he commanded we fall short and due to our weakness and the circumstances around us we tend to fall over and over again in sin the good news is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave us the Glad Tiding that whenever such weakness overwhelms us and we fall into sin and immediately quit repent have remorse and ask Allah forgiveness Allah will forgive us because he knows that we did this out of weakness and he knows that we're not arrogant or bragging about it the bad news is that the more and more we fall into such sin the amount of remorse decreases and we tend to lose such fear and remorse and regret over what you had done and this is dangerous what to do you have to keep on conditioning yourself how by constantly reading the Quran remembering Allah doing thicker and surrounding yourself with righteous practicing people most if not all the time in addition to cutting and preventing means of sin from being available so if your sin is in looking at Haram or listening to Haram you have to seize the means stop them by eliminating ways of such entertainment methods that may creep into your life social media YouTube Tick Tock and and the likes and once you do this you will find that your struggle against sin is far far less with the grace of Allah if not eliminated all together about"
