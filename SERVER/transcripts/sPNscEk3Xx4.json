  "title": "How should I recite in silent rakahs? Only move tongue & lips or recite in low voice Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and should he only move his mouth and tank and without voice or should we make with voice but sign as possible because if i try to make science possible it still sounds loud if i praise congregation so should i only move my mouth and tank okay the silent prayers or raka's means that it's not audible so some scholars say that it is recommended that when you recite silently that you hear yourself as in the case what i say you barely hear whispers and this doesn't annoy people unless i raise it a little bit and i say alhamdulillah now it's audible to those beside me so i should not annoy those in congregation with me because this defies the etiquette of praying in congregation if i'm praying alone yes i can whisper to the extent that i hear myself without any problem even if i recite loudly that would go against the sunnah but still the prayer is valid however in congregation if you just simply move your lips and tongue by just saying that would be more than sufficient and a little bit a knows best"
