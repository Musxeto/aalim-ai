  "title": "Why did Prophet ï·º marry Aisha at such a young age? #Assim #assim  #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um sh I got this question once um and I just want to justify as well so I recently got this book called the sealed nectar and um I've been trying to find the answer in the the book I couldn't so I don't know what to do uh can you justify why uh Muhammad s Alam married Aisha why not I sorry I such a young age come again why uh sorry uh why did the prophet marry uh Aisha at such a young age why not what's the problem I don't I don't understand to be honest because many people say that um bit strange and um you don't care or give any attention to what others say if you have unconditional love to the prophet Alat if your conviction of the Quran the belief in Islam is unequivocal there is no doubt in it you should not even listen to dogs when they bark as we don't fall on our hands and knees to bark back the I've said this so many times I've explained it in a prolonged uh video clip answer it's on my YouTube channel you go and check it and you'll find that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam did not marry AA except because Allah ordered him to do so and AA was engaged before the prophet sallai wasallam proposed when she was that young and she loved him as she loved no one else and he loved her as he loved no one else her father and mother were so pleased with it everybody in the family were so honored with it there was no one to complain among the idol worshippers themselves his enemies the Jews the Christians at the time no one ever said whoa what is this it was the norm this was the normal marrying age only 100 or 150 years ago that this started uh surfacing for 13 centuries nobody ever complained it was normal so don't listen to the dogs when they bark because this is the only thing they found to be dubious in their sick minds and those among the Muslims who have weak man may be fooled by it and may listen to them may Allah protect them to Soul"
