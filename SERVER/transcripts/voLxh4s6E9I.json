  "title": "Can I pray extra 2 rakahs after dhuhr, 4 rakahs before Asr (unemphatic sunnah) daily assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so we know that two Raa after the mandatory prayer of D is from the 12 raas that we pray to get inshah Palace in jna what's the ruling on praying like four raas after D should we do it regularly or should we do it like sometimes and does the same ruling apply to four ra before these two after the emphatic two of and the four before which is also not emphatic they're recommended but they're not part of the 12 that the prophet wasam used to observe but he recommended it so if a person says okay every day I'm going to pray four raas before two and two ra after and four ra before till the rest of my life you're doing good and you'll be rewarded highly for that inshallah without any problem and don't listen to those who say that oh the prophet did not pray them all the time so we should pray them on and off no ignore them the prophet recommended it so you could do it all the time till the rest of your life without any problem with the grace of Allah"
