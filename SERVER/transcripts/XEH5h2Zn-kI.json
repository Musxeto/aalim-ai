  "title": "Is khatam of Quran in taraweeh & qiyam from the Sunnah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] is there special reward for Imams who rush to complete 30 Paris of the Quran 30 Jews in Tel Aviv and the hydrat prayer is this proven from the Sunnah first of all it is a Sunnah which is highly recommended for you and I every single month to finish the Quran once at least especially in Ramadan it is more rewarding so in Ramadan every Muslim should try to at least finish the whole Quran by reciting one juice a day of course the sky is the limit in the sense that the hadith of Abdullah even alas may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet ordered him to finish the Quran once a month he said I can do more he said then finish it once every 20 days he said I can do more finish it once every 10 days he said I can do more finish it once every week he says I can do more in a narration he says finish it once every three days and you cannot understand it if you recite it less than that so 10 juzu every night would be fine or day and night of Ramadan so every three days you read it again and again and again to conclude ten times a month this is recommended however what a lot of the Imams do when they take it as an obligation to complete the Quran during the month of ramadhan in taraweeh this has no basis of for it saying it has no basis for it does not mean as the bidder I know it is something recommended but to choose quantity over quality is not permissible what do you mean chef by quantity and quality this is a very important issue in Islam and I have a lecture on this I did it in peace TV in 2007 2009 you can see it on YouTube which is quantity and quality Islam focuses a lot on quality for example the Prophet said allah√≠s a lot was said on that the Huaraz offer a lot of worship they pray until you present your prayer compared to theirs you resent your fasting compared to theirs you resent your recitation of the Quran while they recite the Quran but it does not exceed their throats the Prophet said though their quantity is far greater than ours they he said that they penetrate the deen like an arrow penetrates a prey it leaves and goes away the Prophet described them as the hounds of hell and the worst people killed under the heavens though the quantity is far greater than ours but compare this their prayers to the hadith of worth man may Allah be pleased with him when the Prophet said alayhi salat wa salam whoever performs perfect evolution like mine and prays to rekha only - he does not whisper in them it is not he's not distracted in them he has full concentration and submissiveness to allah azza wajal allah would forgive all of his previous sins now compare the prayers of the Huaraz a thousand bracha maybe to two simple records but with quality so Islam is a religion of quality and not of quantity what does that mean there is a clip on YouTube I think it's called the Ferrari Imam a guy in Turkey I don't know I mean what is this I can't even pronounce it and the way he's praying is seriously not like a Ferrari maybe like a Lamborghini it's so fast if you speak about speed maybe it's a Tesla from zero to sixty two point two seconds what is this he says well my hey this guy's taraweeh and I hear this in drama Bonn where are you praying taraweeh tonight Allah praying this message oh I'm praying in that message a guy says hmm I'm going to downtown in the souk area there is this Imam subhanAllah Risha plus eleven records of taraweeh he does this all in 12 minutes four minutes what kind of prayer is this well I could care less I just want to pray taraweeh and it's quick and easy no this is not the right approach the Imams who recite the Quran though they are half of but because they want to wrap up things quickly you do not taste the Quran the reciting they're so quick sometimes as Arabs find it difficult to distinguish the words they are reciting because too quick there's no taste for for for the Quran we reciting just bowing and prostrating and with no spirit in it no I'd rather pray behind someone who reads ten verses Baraka yet he praises with nice to sweet with nice paste I can feel the Quran I can understand it penetrates my heart I find result of what I'm hearing rather than praying behind someone who is a Ferrari a Lamborghini or even a Porsche [Music] [Applause]"
