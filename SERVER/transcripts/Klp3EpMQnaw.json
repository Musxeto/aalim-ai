  "transcript": "all right um she what's it called we know that there's 12 highly recommended Sunnah prayers after F prayers and my question was that after prayers what do what do you mean what do you mean like we know that there's two what's it called Sunnah Sunnah prayers before the F of f f and for true true and four before two after two after two after yes yes yes my question was uh does all sorry the what's it called the sunna prayer for zor the one before the FB we have to pray that we have to pray that on do we have to pray that on two twos like separately or do we have or do we pray that all in one like all four okay so this is an issue of dispute and we've addressed this question many times some Scholars say that it should be prayed for like you don't conclude it after two rather you stand up for the third and the fourth and sit for the tah and conclude it with Salam like the and this some Scholars quote a Hadith and even albani authenticated this Hadith other Scholars say this Hadith is not authentic and the general trend is that the Prophet saidat The Prayer of the day and night in twos but some Scholars even do do not authenticate this addition of and the day they authenticate the night prayer to be two and two but not the day so it's an issue of dispute I personally am inclined in praying it to offering Salam then offering to because this is the safest approach all Scholars would say you've done well but if you pray for the scholars who authenticate the Hadith would say you've done well the others would say no this is wrong you should not have done this so to be safe rather than sorry beats uh All Odds and Allah Knows Best"
