  "transcript": "My question was today while playing Madrid I was almost standing instead of sitting for the second. Then I remembered that I have to sit down. So I sat down instead of standing fully and finished the prayer like this without giving the frustration of forgetfulness. Is my prayer valid? Why did you not Why did you not prostrate for sahu? Just like this. I didn't I didn't know. I I can't I can't understand your question to begin with. Navidida to tell you the truth. I only am answering you hoping that you would clarify. Did you or did you not make a mistake? I don't know. Nabida, if you don't know, how would I know? See, if you thought that you did not offer the right number of raka and you rectified it, then you have no problem. You have to offer. If you thought that no I am doing the right thing and this rwas is coming to me every single prayer so I am ignoring it and I'm continuing my prayer as usual and you did not offer uh frustrations of forgetfulness. You've done the right thing because it's reoccurring and Shayan wants wanting to miss up to mess up your uh uh prayer. But if you were doubtful and this comes to you once every week, once every month, once every year, you were doubtful whether I prayed two or three and you were inclined that no, I prayed two or you were inclined that I prayed three and you continued according to your gut feeling and the best of your knowledge. In this case, you have to offer sujud sahu as well at the end of the prayer after salam. If you did not offer due to forgetfulness, I forgot. I did salam and I went and I remembered half an hour. Your prayer is valid. If you knew that you have to offer it but still did not want to perform it, then your prayer is invalid and you have to repeat it."
