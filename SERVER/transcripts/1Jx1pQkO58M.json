  "transcript": "about Allah appreciate my question is regarding prayer that when I prayed behind an Imam and whether it's a silent namas in the first two records I know that the Imam reached Surah and then he also recites Anaya and in the third and fourth he doesn't do that and I do the same following him but I have noticed and it's not regarding one particular Imam whenever I am praying in the market that they recite Surah probably with a much faster phase in the third and fourth because it quickly go into that when I'm reciting this so is there any case is there any ruling that you have to recite Surah faster in the third and fourth letter the answer is no the fatty has paced is the same in all four rakas so if you're praying the speed of which you recite the Fatiha as an Imam or an individual or a follower is the same unfortunately a lot of those who lead the prayers don't have knowledge and a very essential part of knowledge for the Imam is to be aware of those praying behind him so even if you recite the Fatiha and most likely you'll recite it in a fast fashion you have to pay attention that behind you there are those who find it difficult to read it as fast as you they have problems with pronunciation so if you recite it in an ex-given amount of seconds you should add more seconds to that just for those behind you so that they would not be rushed into cutting their Fatiha and then their prayer is invalid because you did not give them time to recite the Fatiha unfortunately the vast majority of those people who lead prayers especially in small messages don't have knowledge so so they just read the fact but not paying attention to the Fatiha to how it should be recited to how they should contemplate in our episode is about pondering contemplating up uh on verses of the Quran how did the prophet assalam react to such uh verses these people don't all what they care about is how many rakas they're concluding how many verses of the Quran they have read especially in tarawi if they finish the Quran during Ramadan or not and this is not the right thing to do"
