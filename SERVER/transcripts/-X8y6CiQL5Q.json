  "transcript": "um for your talk very um insightful um I want to ask you im's life is very humble you know he wasn't attached to the D so uh my person Liv me living in London with a lot of luxuries available a lot of food and you know a lot of this D available how do you advise us because it's not possible to would eat how mentioned hard dat I think um it's for us very difficult so we indulge ourselves in a lot of the luxury how do you advise us practically to First of be more humble and not let these kind of luxuries overcome us uh first of all I have to point out that our role model is our prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and not Im so when we say that he limited himself to eating bread and dried figs and uh uh dry food and and and harsh food this does not mean that we have to do this I have to look into the diet of my Prophet sallallahu alai wasam and follow that and if I look at the diet of my Prophet I find that he used to eat meat he used to love the shoulder of the sheep and this is the most beloved part of it he used to love to drink water that was sweet and that is why they used to leave uh some dates in the water until it becomes sweet the prophet used to love to eat food that was good and was brought to him and and if you go to the book of Z you would find the different kinds of uh uh collection of food that the prophet used to loveat however this was not the trend with the prophet Alam may Allah have mercy on his soul asked his aunt pleased with her and with her with her father and and he said what uh how how was his diet how what what did you used to eat at the time she said to him we used to see the Cresent then the Crescent desert Crescent and the the fire would not be lit in the houses of our Prophet meaning that they would not cook for two consecutive months so said then what did you eat she said we only ate dates and drank water this is the only intake we used to have dates and water for two months this is what the Prophet this was the norm therefore for those who are living in London it is not the point by mentioning that his food was so hard and he did not wear good and fancy designer clothes no Calvin Klein and and no narichi or whatever this did what I meant was that life was not So Glamorous to him to the extent that he would go out of his way looking for it now now if you go to a normal family you and I for example we have our objectives so for the people of London and I've been to London and I've met a lot of the brothers uh uh and sisters in London there for example the main objective is to change the 40in plasma screen into a 52 LCD this is wow the greatest objective and they work over time and they do this and they do that is this what Allah wants from you definitely not so you don't go to extremes the sense that I'm in London therefore I'm not gonna take the tube I'm not gonna take buses I'm gon to walk and I'm not going to put shoes on I'm GNA wake a walk bare with it and I'm not going to eat at all and I'm G to starve myself for three four days so that I would become a scholarly like person well I guarantee you in a couple of weeks you either go to uh uh uh a different mood and state completely you'll be insane or after a couple of weeks you will go back into indulging Full Speed Ahead into this life and taking everything that is permissible and not permissible as well no this is not the balance we're seeking this is not the balance we're looking for by giving the example of the life of IM nawi it shows us that we should not have this world this life controlling our hearts we have to reach a Lim a limit or a level where we uh uh take control of our lives and this is why we fast we fast because Allah instructed us to fast but one of the benefits of fasting is that you control yourself the permissible things in life eating drinking and having sexual intercourse with your wife you make this forbidden for you why because Allah instructed me to do this so if I'm able to stay away from these permissible things then definitely I would be able to have the willpower with the grace of Allah to stay away from forbidden things in London you can be righteous you can be God-fearing by not doing Haram by not letting this uh uh life control you and instead you control it don't let your objectives be worldly materials don't let your main goal to boast about your car or your house or your body or your knowledge on the contrary devote all your forces your uh uh concerns and your uh ambition to attaining what pleases Allah Asel and to be as far as possible from this uh uh glamorous beautiful world in the sense that it would not divert you from worshiping Allah and part of worshiping Allah is to excel in your school is to excel in your job is to be the role model to your co-workers by giving them the best example of a practicing Muslim who looks well who smells well who is polite and at the same time who does not fall into sin neither major nor minor unon"
