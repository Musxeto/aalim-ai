  "transcript": "foreign how do you feel hungry a little bit tired but the feeling of seeing Muslims willing to waste their time to come and Listen to Someone Like Me is very nice they could have been playing badminton or going to the movies or spending time with their friends but they instead wanted Allah to be pleased with them so they came to the Masjid and this is where true happiness is so wherever I go masha'allah I am blessed to see these faces that are clean through Guru okay their faces are white bright shiny with Iman with wudu with purity so whenever you look at them you feel alhamdulillah overwhelmed that there is in this ummah a lot of um okay the feeling was normal because I haven't met any of my family members since I was born and raised in Saudi so they don't come to Saudi and I this is my first visit but alhamdulillah I managed to meet some of them in Jakarta and job Jakarta and to a day after tomorrow I'm meeting a lot of them in Medan so this is and this is to reconnect with one's roots and with one's blood and family in Allah so tonight again foreign [Music] I don't understand Bahasa very well I don't understand Bahasa at all but did I hear it correctly that you read the Fatiha yes and then Surah after father yes yes and then why do you recite the Fatiha I don't want to come on the day of judgment and on top would say why they make this Innovation and you did not speak ever in the books had the prophet Allah recited the fact he had like this yes or no never you know more than him no I don't so this is why I have to clear my conscience so that on the day of judgment I told them promise I go so it is not Sunnah in Arabia when we have marriage contracts or engagement and nobody knows there is their bodies and they scrub their backs if you go take a shower what are you doing and also because marriage is like death when someone is dead he said oh Abdullah is dead this is not from Islam is recited in the Salat the greatest Surah Fatiha is reciting in European as is I have illness in my throat every time I drink water and I think but not in a gathering so excuse me I'm supposed to speak about how to be happy but I will make you unhappy first so happiness who doesn't want to be happy raise your hands alhamdulillah so we do have one two three don't know English very well who does not want to be happy everybody wants to be happy sometimes we spend so much money just to be happy happiness is Paradise on Earth because if you're happy on Earth you are in paradise and not Muslims only look for happiness even Catherine evil atheists Buddhists Hindus Christians they all look for happiness the rich and the poor the educated and the illiterate everybody works hard to reach happiness nobody wants to be unhappy willingly but the problem is the vast majority of people have missed the road to happiness on the day of judgment how many people are there how many types only two on the day of judgment only two types of people Allah says in the Quran the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission and among them will be The Wretched and the prosperous so on the day of judgment there are two types either you are happy or you are wretched you're doomed there is no third party which one are you insha Allah okay in the Hadith that bukhari and Muslim reported the angel comes when the pregnancy is four months old to blow the soul and to ask Allah azzawajal oh Allah a male or a female a happy or wretched so all of this is written and if you ask people on the day of judgment what is the ultimate goal of course is to intelligent Allah says in the Quran so he who is drawn away from the fire and admitted to Paradise has one may Allah make us among the winners this is the ultimate goal why are you here in the Masjid General if one says to you there is a million dollars here there is this big house there is this beautiful woman but no Jannah so all what we're doing in our life is revolving around Jannah we want to reach Jannah so how can we be happy now happiness is relative what does it mean it means that what makes you happy may may not make him happy usually so for those who have money in wealth and big houses for a poor man like me I think he's happy because he has mashallah a big house big car and a heedless nerd youngsters when you ask them who's happy they say especially those who are not married he said oh employee a Playboy is happy because he goes to nightclubs every night he's with another woman and he parties and he drinks he's very happy I am an introvert I can't speak with a woman I'm always shy to someone who is sick who is happy [Music] a healthy person so when someone is sick like me and I see people drinking Pepsi Cola with ice I wish I can do that I can't I have a sore throat so everyone has a definition of happiness in where I come from if you want something to be done in the government if you want a paper to be signed you have to spend one week two weeks every time you go with a big file that oh there is a one paper missing come tomorrow you bring it tomorrow uh where is your photo come tomorrow you bring the photo and say oh you need a stamp so one week every day you go you take permission from work what is happiness to Someone Like This to have influence to have power to know people in the government one phone call s everything is finished so each one of them has a definition of Happiness likewise in Islam this type of Happiness a house a Playboy health is limited not forever it goes and comes and this is why the prophet said in an authentic Hadith four things are from happiness what are they a good woman a righteous practicing woman and that big spacious house and a good neighbor and a comfortable right so these things the prophet says is these things are happiness but are they forever they're limited but when you have them inshallah you will be happy now happiness is always changing unfortunately on this life and this life never stays on one platform it changes if you go to the hospital you think everybody is sick if you go to the streets you think everybody is healthy what happened yesterday is not going to happen today and what's happening today is not going to happen tomorrow life goes up and down and we come and go so this definition of happiness wrongly sought after by sinners I'm a sinful person where will I find my happiness maybe in drugs maybe in alcohol maybe in women maybe listening to music watching movies maybe in cheating I'll be happy but this happiness is limited and immediately after the sin is gone what will happen you become depressed listen what to Allah says and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life all Sinners are depressed even the most famous the richest the most beautiful they take drugs and some of them even commit suicide because they cannot find happiness and they try but they fail because they have turned their back to Allah's remembrance now this is not the same in Islam who was the happiest man on Earth a prophet was there anyone happier how was his house this was a very small room the companions say if we stand straight our head will hit the ceiling so it was very short small tiny room but the prophet was a happy man no peace be upon him and Ruth peace be upon him had a cafe wives they both their wives were covered but they were happy because they were messengers of Allah Prophet Ayub how many years he was afflicted by illness approximately 18 years he's a prophet prophet he makes Dua I get illness in my throat and I said three days why I'm not recovered 18 years and he's a prophet he had no problem if you are not angry with me I'm happy so this is what real happiness is not in wealth not in power not in health rather it is in being content [Music] real happiness is something that you cannot see with your eyes you cannot contain involts you cannot buy this is something that you feel within you it is the purity of your soul it is the Tranquility of your heart it is the expansion of your chest and it is your conscience being relaxed this is true happiness I wonder how many people of us when they go to bed they make the atkar and then they sleep like a baby and how many of us think or he took my money or I took his money oh I should beat him up I should do this I should do that and they're fighting in themselves how many of us has this true feeling of happiness you want to taste happiness listen to The Prophet Allah he said he has tasted the sweetness of Iman who who's ever pleased with Allah to be his Lord with Islam to be his religion with Muhammad to be his messenger if you're happy and satisfied you will find the taste of amen the sweetness of a man now we what is killing us today social media Instagram Tick Tock we see people riding expensive cars living in expensive houses traveling and private jet and we feel that online they're happy and we don't know that all of this is a punishment huh let Allah punish me don't laugh there are Muslims who say let them punish me when I was teaching once in a high school in Saudi I was a teacher 40 years ago and I was telling I teach I taught English but in my English I teach also Islam because English is lousy so I teach them five minutes English and then I give them High School teenagers so I was saying to them the story of Yusuf and how he refused the temptation of the wife of the Aziz of Muslim and among the seven who are in Allah's shade a man who's invited by a woman of beauty and authority and he says I fear Allah one of the boys stood up and said where is she he's saying where is she that's her come to me I will be there and this shows you how little Iman people have no Allah says to you in the Quran in two places and let not their wealth and their children impress you Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should be depart at death while they are disbelievers their wealth and their children is a punishment yes so this is something for you to see not everything that Allah gives to others is a favor and blessing it can be a punishment say alhamdulillah that Allah did not test you like them a lot of the Muslims see the westerners the Americans the Europeans and think that they are the best of people they are impressed by the way they dress the way they speak the way they eat not knowing that they are like those who were oppressed by Arun you know [Music] was one of the billionaires the keys of his bolts and saves were so heavy that a group of men could not carry the keys what about the vaults themselves what money was he richer than Elon Musk yes and he did not have a Tesla so the people were impressed and they said those who desired the worldly life said oh we wish we had like what was given to our own indeed he is one of the great Fortune so where is karun now no is that where is Pharaoh you know Pharaoh he was the king of the world he said I am your lord you worship me where is he now dead where is the mood where is hat those who became billionaires through Haram money and through bribes and through cheating and they took properties of people where are they now after 67 years they died what is in their grave Hellfire so what's the use of the money where are all these long hours that a Playboy used to sit speaking with women fooling them trying to seduce them through his different ways where are these hours all gone now all of this is in Hell Fire for the losers and the same is the biggest Blocker of happiness unlike what most of us think they think the opposite you do sin you become happy no one of the sisters came to me she says Sheikh I have a problem with my son he said what's the problem she says he watches a movie for an hour and a half or two hours and he's happy the minute the move is over he comes to me and said oh I'm fed up I don't have anything to do so I say watch another movie he watches Another Movie he's happy the minute the movie finishes this is like drugs every time you take it you become addicted to it and you will never be happy true Muslims find happiness in worship the prophet said my satisfaction was placed in sawat the prophet wherever he was depressed or sad what would he do connection directly with Allah azzawajal he feels that he has the whole world in his hand and whoever plays around with Salat then he will never be happy any person who skips Salat Mrs Salat does not give Salat a priority he will never be happy because this is what Allah created you for now if you look at the Muslim houses you will see that divorce rate is very high in Arabia it's very high I don't know him his devotionate Higher Love why subhanallah they got married they spent money and all of a sudden divorce the woman God becomes crazy the man becomes a woman and we have an imbalance we have a problem this was not found in the time of the companions we find a lot of the Muslims going for therapy for counseling I have OCD I have depression I have anxiety I have why you shouldn't have all of this you're a Muslim you should trust Allah and fathers complaining from their children they are unduteful disobedient disrespectful children complaining from their parents their abusive they are not fair they are treating us bad and all of this because they're seeking happiness not from the right source from different sources so if you want happiness you have to seek it from who has it who owns it who's he Allah you want happiness and this life within it's a life of test nobody can be 100 happy it's a test but if you manage to study hard for your test and do well you will be the happiest person on Earth how when you feel content this is the happiest person who's content in Arabic we call it whatever happens you're happy why because Allah decreed it I had a car accident here how do you feel handed good you're content you're happy other person come says you're crazy why are you saying alhamdulillah you have a car accident said yes but imagine if I did not hit another car if I hit another person he died how would you I feel oh alhamdulillah okay sugar thank you and this is asked when does the slave of Allah find comfort and happiness when life is difficult he says the moment you put your first foot in Jannah when you put your first first in general there is no going back you're happy if I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among the happiest of all his servants and that he grants us the knowledge and that he makes a steadfast on this religion until the day we meet him shall I go yes all right so um [Music] you told me you told me 35 minutes to 40. so I Am timing I took exactly 35 36 minutes"
