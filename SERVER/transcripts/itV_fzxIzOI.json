  "title": "Does using inhalers affect the fast of asthma patients? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] questions about inhalers those who have asthma's so they have this inhaler they put it on earth they breathe it in does this affect their fasting the answer is no why because they don't swallow it to their stomach they inhale it to their lungs and there is no feeding or drinking out of it and this is the majority of scholars fatwa upon it then what about the little pills that those with heart attacks put under their tongues again this is not something they swallow it is something they put under the tongue and the skin and the saliva and their mouth observes absorbs it instantaneously like in couple of seconds and there's nothing in your mouth so it goes directly into your bloodstream not to your stomach and the fatwa is that this has no impact on your fasting okay what about nicotine patches cher or creams that we apply on our body externally again this is not feeding nor drinking it has no impact on your fasting and so on you [Applause]"
