  "transcript": "foreign [Music] as you know created us for for one purpose and one purpose alone and that is to worship Him Allah Almighty says [Music] your soul existence is so that you worship Allah so it is not so that you would gain money or man or build the house or have a career and it's definitely not for the sake of the Prophet as some people may think that Allah has created the universe for the sake of the Prophet Allah this is a great misconception Allah created the Jinn and the ins only for the purpose of worshiping him and this does not mean that you have to isolate yourself in a Masjid with prayer reads that count up to a thousand pieces and says has made people think the prophet can do this so how would we worship Allah we would worship Allah azzawajal by doing what he instructed us to do and by refraining from what he told us not to go near and the sky is the limit I could have a career in my job and Excel in it and still be worshiping our mind because this is part of my worship Noah I could go to the gym and work out and play and have fun while still worshiping Allah I can drink my tea with the good intention that I may wake up so that I can be able to give you this talk and my thinking of this tea would be a form of worship to Allah therefore let's look at worshiping Allah in a broader sense and not limited only to Salat sayam are the highest fillers of Islam but they are part of a holistic picture now part of the benefits of worshiping Allah is attaining and obtaining the thing that every single human being is looking forward or looking as achieving if you go to any Cafe if you go to any Hindu any Christian any Buddhist any denomination on this Earth including the Muslims and you ask them what is the thing that you want most they will tell you happiness no one would say I don't want to be happy it's okay for me just leave money I don't want you to be happy why do you work to become happy what do you get married to become happy why do you take care of your children because they bring joy to your soul as Allah as I would just say Allah the heart of the adornment of this life the wife and children so how can we attain this happiness as Muslims we know how to do that but does the cafe know how to do that do they know how to enjoy themselves to be happy okay how would we do that how would they do that you may participate so that I can think of whatever you say later on how would a cafe enjoy himself by partying by going down and booking as they say so how else taking holidays drinking doing Haram relationships gambling and getting money through any means so gambling stealing as long as I'm not arrested drugs smoking lots of lots of lots of things that music I apologize but this is almost a religion I'm sorry so they enjoy this movies watching movies and having fun entertainment all of these are forms of getting happiness enjoying yourself but are they permanent never so you will get this happiness but it's temporary it comes for about a short time and then you have to refill you have to do something to continue this so this happens with Muslims I have a friend a young friend he says that whenever I watch a movie and there's action in it and there is racing and there's fighting and you see the hero with a gun and he shoots like 10 thousands without even changing the magazine so many people he kills him he keeps on killing and I'm having fun after the movie is over what happens to him he said I'll become depressed I need something to do I go to my mother and I tell her mother I am fed up and she says son every time you look at me you say fit up is it written on my forehead every time you talk to me you think you're set up so he says I take another film and I watch it I enjoy it and after it finishes I'm depressed again likewise those who are unfortunate those who Allah did not bless them enough and they fall into the sin of listening to music the minute they wake up is it an alarm clock no it's an FM radio with an alarm clock so the thing that they wake up on is FM music and they go to the bathroom they brought the teeth they go to the car the first thing they do is turn on the radio and they drive to work they have their nv3s their iPhone their iPads their iPods and whatever it's all the time one of them told me once Jeff I almost went crazy today why he said I got into the car to drive to work and subhanallah it's not working the radio the cassette player the DVD player it's all gone so I drove 20 minutes to my workplace and I almost got crazy I didn't hear noise of the tires and the horns of the people driving and the engines and I I'm not used to this it's subhanallah all of this is from home from that is why from the very beginning of the morning till you go to bed look at your day did you have five minutes to sit just like this and think of your relationship with Allah of the good things you have done all of the bad things that you've accumulated through the day no who's making you stay away from thinking why do you find the youngsters doing things that are simple not even the answers even the the elders the elders Among Us they waste so much time on Haram things what are you doing he says I'm killing time in what is the crime of time so that you kill it time is your life therefore non-muslims enjoy themselves but it is never ever permanent however if you look at the proper Muslim he's got the enjoyment he's got the happiness is a his heart so many times I see people who earn so little and the children are badly dressed they can't afford anything better but if you look at his face he's a janitor in a school he's got like eight children and two wives and he lives in a two room uh I would call it a hole that he lives in but since the the first thing in the morning until the end of the night the smile is from you to you foreign [Music] I have everything that I want you have the feeling you want nowadays whenever I see some of my friends in high positions in the company with fat Sundays and whenever I see him you know when a hungry person looks at another indeed season him a chicken roasted chicken because he's hungry this is what I look at my friends when they walk in the company mashallah bank accounts bank checks so I tell him friend how are you yeah the wife is nagging the kids are flanking School the daughter I got divorced I have a lot of debts the car is a year old I need my new model I'm buying a couple of I'm building a couple of buildings uh to rank but I'm short of cash I got diabetes a blood pressure is high cholesterol is high but it can be done I'm fine after all this list of complaints and then you say you're fine why because Allah did not bless him with content the prophet says richness is not with your bank account with how much you owe you you have and possess richness is Blended with content saying of good life that those who do righteous leads whether male or female while they're believing we will give them good life he said this good life is contentment if you have everything in this world but you don't have contentment you have a corrupt heart but if you don't have anything in this world except a believing heart and a grateful tongue and remembering Soul then you have got it made you are living in Paradise on this world and the paradise and the Hereafter awaits you so how is it that we can reach this level by doing what Allah commanded and staying away from what Allah forbade however we have to purify our souls we have to purify our hearts especially we're having a beautiful season one of the greatest seasons of the year which is the month of Ramadan so how can we purify ourselves do what is known as reverse engineering you want to reach to purify your soul go to the origin what corrupts your soul to begin with stay away from that then you will have a beautified soul so if you were shaitaan government but you have to think as a criminal to be able to catch one so if you were shaytan what would you do to corrupt the souls on music music purifies the heart they say if you have psychological problems listen to bark or to Beethoven or to Mozart or whatever they say no music is a sign it is one of the sins and it's a minor sin but there are much much farther further shaytan doesn't look at these small things he looks at the strategies so he first of all puts an objective management by objective how to corrupt your soul first of all I have to enter to your soul ah okay how do I enter to your soul through your side through your healing through what you eat and through the private parts okay if I enter what would happen I will eventually reach the heart the prophet says there is a piece of meat in the body if it rots the whole body runs and if it is foreign so now we have to purify our hearts now we notice that this mouth is a two-way street so things come out and things go in those that goes in has has to be Halal stuff so make your best that you do not eat anything that is how do Muslims eat hammer they are the best have mercy on our souls why because they are not quite Muslims look at the practices I'm not going to talk about Saudi Arabia and I'm not going to talk about you you wanna talk about Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia we in Arabian generally we eat Haram like crazy like jalapenos they just keep on eating it why because they don't have Ilan in their hearts how many times have you taken money from friends and did not return it back loans I know hundreds of Muslims related in where I come from how many times you got someone to work here maybe it's difficult they will sue you and sue you for your house for all what you own but in Saudi Arabia it's very easy now I bring your share I tell them to fix my sink and do the plumbing and afterwards he says I need this I said no this is too much I'm going to give you 10 percent uh this is how I'm like it or not what are you going to do how many times you have workers you don't pay them on time or you pay them every three months worth of one month how many times you invest your money in rebound or someone borrows from you I'll give him a hundred thousand but listen next year 120 you return it how many of you married people who got married to their wives and did not give them their dowry I spent like 30 years I'm married to my husband until now he refuses to give me the rest of my diary how did you marry her with this salary and until now you're not fulfilling it you don't have money right I'm afraid if I give her she might leave this is totally confinement you're imprisoning her so money wise here in the UK I don't want to go there but I get a lot of emails from the brothers and sisters about the benefits that the government gives and how they lie and how they Forge documents and how they say they're not married while they're married he's married and she's married but they don't declare this and they take benefits all and on their own she's a single mother the father is there but they lie yeah it's a cafe government is it and are you also a governor to lie my Muslim never lies what kind of Islam and then all of this goes in Allah money look what it does into your heart so make sure that you do not consume anything that is how he's one of the ten Heaven bound Companions of the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah make me or pray for Allah so that I would become among those who when they call Allah Allah will respond immediately this week is not authentic but it is always mentioned in the zeroth so the prophet told him purify your source of income and you will become among those who when they ask Allah Allah immediately respond so purify the things that go into your mouth what about the things that come out of our mouths of Allah are we accountable for what we say and the prophet saw told him subhanallah what throws people into hell except the things that they say now do we say bad things do we yeah how many times do you curse a day while walking here the f word is everywhere but everywhere aware four letter word fish but it's not that one discussion yeah subhan's youngsters all people normal oh yeah see how many times do you back bite a day this is something that all Muslims do it is normal that me and the chef sit together and we speak about the you just want to bring coffee do you like his solicitation look how he looks and when he comes in he leaves I start talking to him about the brother why did you go and get the coffee or the deep and he didn't you hold on the hands and when they both go I start to speak about myself I have to do something I have to talk about someone and we back about everyone rulers imams Scholars students of knowledge I even made facts like my mother and my father if I'm talking to my wife and if I'm talking to my mother my wife so is this a minor sin it is a major thing it's not something to be taken lightly and you can go on and on and on about the things that come out of our most Riga yeah trying to destroy what's between the brothers telling him lies and telling him lies so that I would make grudges and hated between them lies how many times do we lie a day Sheriff there is white lie and black light masha'allah I'm color blind the prophet said that is Allah is a lie a lot of the brothers when they're going daddy take me with you this is no longer to the doctor he's going to give me injection the child says okay you're teaching him how many times someone calls you tell your child to tell him I'm out and the child says father says he's out [Music] you're teaching your children how to lie to become professional Liars so it goes on and on and on all of these sins corrupt the heart now what you see in what you hear I don't have to go down that road you all know that the Muslims now consider listening to Haram something of a necessity how many times you sit in a gathering and people back by it and you don't do anything you're contributing your body even if you don't speak why not standing up and defending this brother Muslim or at least telling that listen we have enough sins if I am in my grave this is the last thing I would like to see so as long as I can help it stop if they don't stop leave they are not the kind of people you should be with how many times do we listen to Haram music and we do not do anything about sometimes and I know this for a fact some of the brothers tell me that they listen to programs that in South Islam in South Quran in South the prophets of Allah and we watch it the whole thing and I say okay why do you watch it so I just want to know what they're saying about our religion is this by watching it you like them Allah says or the verses of Allah or mocking your religion Allah tells you do not sit with them otherwise you will be identical to them how many Muslims listen to these programs and say I just want to know what the other sects say about us who are you Dr Zach and I you want to refute their allegation are you knowledgeable are you a scholar no yeah if you by listening to them you corrupt your heart and I know people who were part of the Sunni foreign to the authorities because he's flipping why because they took the initiative and thought that they had strong Iman and this is what happened how many things you look at how many things you watch out of necessity and then this changes into becoming an obsession a lot of the Muslims and I was shocked to hear that a lot of the Muslims find it easy to watch pornography I mean some of them praying that my yeah sure come on I'm not sure is different we pray and we have fun subhanallah and some of them say Allah and the prophet says one hour for your heart and one hour for your lord the prophet said this is not say one hour for your lord and one hour for your Satan is it for your heart so refresh your heart with whatever that is halal not by Halal I get system is calling my husband spends 80 percent of his time on the laptop and I say come on sister don't be spoiled he's doing this for the job he's doing this answering emails and for dawa he said sure why does he do this and give this back to the corner of the wall and his face to us if he's sincere he would let the screen open for everyone the minute you see someone sitting with the wall to his back and he's working you know that he has something to hide anyone who does not have anything to hide will not do this and a lot of the sisters complain of men chatting online and and one of the brothers they said he asked me he said sure there was a seminar about a quest for love in Huddersfield so a brother asked me said is it okay to watch two-dimensional photographs that contains nudity and pornography because we heard that it is only the 3D is how Masha Allah so even if I have a 3D HD screen in my house I just take the glasses and it's 2D now what is this shaytan is playing with us like kids play with football why because we're not looking at what pleases Allah we are beating on the bush we are looking at what pleases our desires we are looking at what pleases the shaytan but not what pleases Allah therefore in order for us to purify our souls we have to first of all block all the means for shaytan to enter and corrupt our souls and hearts now if we do this we empty from inside because we blocked everything back from coming inside now we have to fill it up with we have to fill it up with things that Allah will be happy with such as that those who believe and remember Allah their hearts would reach the degree or the level of Tranquility by remembering Allah but how many times do we remember Allah how many times do we lead the Quran a day I asked this one of the my friends in international area I finish it last time I done I finished for three quarters of it but this is all foreign the minimum was once in a few days may Allah be pleased with him the Quran once every single day in Ramadan and this was also important about Imam Ahmad and a lot about Imam Malik not only that is with him came during the season of Hajj you know whoever performed I know that usually they are out of energy he came and the companion said that after praying Isha near the arm of Ibrahim I looked and I saw a man standing and he said and he prayed only one and he recited the whole Quran in one Witcher was married he was at the time about 70 plus years old so when you were happy that you resigned the Quran once afraid so you want to purify your heart start filling it up with what pleases Allah the best thing is in the best form of remembering Allah Circle time I am astonished by the amount of people from the UK who come to me and give the kill for the rulers of Arabia for the scholars of Arabia for this initiation of this country about this just follow his coverage he's like an AK-47 you know everybody's Capital except me everyone is perfect except me and I ask these brothers do you know the Quran he said yes everybody knows do you know the meaning of um do you know Arabic no and you come and give that feel to people and allow this in Islam and exit this from Islam this is this what I want to ask you about on the day of judgment why didn't you didn't you give technique to your brother awesome he will ask you about your prayer he will ask you about your heart he will ask you about the Haram things you were indulged in he will ask you about your wife he will ask you about your children he will ask you about your Capital neighbor The Neighbor Next Door who is not a Muslim what did he do to him if you give him leaflets in accordance [Music] tell him it's not poisonous he didn't give him some soup some sugar were you kind to him like the prophet was kind of all of his neighbors all of these things Allah will ask you about so start to build your spirit your soul your heart with positive things among the things that purify your hearts being kind to believing and on top of the list are the orphans the prophet Island told one of his companions do you like your heart to be softened and to you to be able to get what you want from Allah to attain what you want from Allah and I said yes of course he said why over the hair or over the head of an orphan Allah will talk in your heart and would make you get what you want from him being kind to the others I know brothers and sisters who are not even kind to their own off Street I know brothers who don't even look at their sons and daughters and have no concern about them it's not my job my job is to bring them bingo I did now it's your job to take the rest of the job the duties it's something that I both the spouses have to work hard on among the things that soften your heart and gets you closer to Allah azzawajal is observing your prayer in this country it is a shame because a lot of the Muslims come only for membranation that's your prayer how many of you have praying how many rows four or five that's good for what people or Rose I was shocked I was thinking of moving because we have like two to three rows and we are shouting at the people what are you doing only 150 uh person praying the Masjid and we have like hundreds of thousands of nice messages everywhere and four or five people where are the best mashallah sleeping for working why then you want to know your level in Paradise look at Iman in your heart and how much you offer to this religion this is your level in Paradise but if you don't pray on time and you don't pray in the Masjid and you are full of sins and you cheat and you lie and you back by and you do all the things but the biggest thing that you have is is this Islam it is part of Islam it is important part of Islam no doubt about it but it is is it only Islam because if it's if it is Islam then Fidel Castro would qualified to leave the Salah it's white maybe put some in on it so we have a problem we have a problem of wanting to go to paradise but at the same time wanting to enjoy this life how long will you live in this life in this life 10 years 20 yeah actually make it 950 years like no please be upon him and then what it was reported that if I'm not mistaken Adam peace be upon him you correct me if I'm wrong I'm shooting from the head because I said when Adam was created and Allah showed him his offspring he saw a beautiful man a handsome man and he said who's this Allah told him that this is your son that would peace be upon him and he said how how many years does he have let's say a hundred so I don't say it no that's too little give him a hundred for me 1100. okay and when it was time for Adam to die Allah sent the angel of death and his name is right the angel of death so Allah said time to go all the prophets of Allah would not die before being asked and the question this is why I have like 100 years more or so I said no you gave it to you you're your son and he denied remembering something like this so all of it was Offspring this is by default in them they always deny and forget things subhanallah So eventually you're gonna lie no matter what Moses came to him in the shape of a man and you know Musa mashallah is really tough he saw this Angel of Death coming but in the in in the form of Amen so he will start to end now he got his eye wasted so of course the angel of death is an angel nothing happens to him but as a form of a man this happened so he went back to Allah he said Allah you sent me to someone who doesn't want to die this guy is strong of course the angel of death is stronger but he has to request otherwise he cannot do it so Allah told him go to Musa and tell him put your hand on the leather or on the skin of a bull and with every single head on that skin you have a year to live how much would you think it would be in the thousands at least so the angel death went and introduced himself listen I am Angel of Death stay away resistance so Musa spoke with him what do you want he told him so and so and so and if you don't want to die Allah told you to put your hand on the skin of a bull and with every hair you have ears to live and then watch and the angels death said then it is there so even if you live for thousands of years then what extent who's prepared to death who's the president most the most seriously most of us is prepared to them but we are expecting it not now I'm personally expecting it to come in about 11 years time so if it comes 11 years minus one day I'll be shocked no we should be always ready to live immediately and this is why that I would request you and encourage you to take the opportunity of the month of Ramadan what is the professionalism three times as he was descending from the stairs of the member so the companion said what is I mean I mean I mean he said that Jubilee came to me and said om Muhammad whoever someone by yourself whoever Ramadan comes and he dies without Allah forgiving his sins and he enters hell may Allah said cast him away advice or something so now fgb is the one who's supplicating our beloved Prophet is saying I mean do you think Allah would answer this yes definitely how many ramadans have passed upon us one twenty 60 we get closer to Allah or are we a status quo well those who are in status quo there is hope for them I know people in Ramadan who they teach go back go backwards I know our friend in Saudi Arabia who passed Ramadan who praised who recites the Quran after Maghrib after he goes and gets his girlfriend and I tell this brother what are you doing he said listen one hour for your lord and one hour for your heart I'm fasting I'm doing everything I need to do this mentality of strict thinking of split personality the majority of Muslims have this they think that by praying by doing few good things by giving charity at the end of photos this allows me to do like 150 000 cents and if I go off the limit I'll top it off like I'm using a mobile phone I'll top it off by maybe visiting my mother that I don't see except once every three or four months this is a problem you are dealing with Allah who has everything in his possession who if he wishes he would annihilate not only what's living on Earth he would annihilate the whole universe and it doesn't mean anything for him by creating the universe his wealth did nothing peace and by annihilating the holy reverse it would not be decreased if Allah gathered all the Mankind from since Adam until the day of judgment on a plain open area and each one asked him for what he for what he needs and Allah gave each one of them what they want this would not reduce Allah's wealth and Kingdom except like a bird coming to the ocean and tipping one drop of water this is Allah if you know how to worship Him He will fill your heart with satisfaction and he will purify your soul if you have full Trust on him Allah azzawajal would make this life like a right you guide it where you want if you have full Reliance on Allah if you have full on Allah but if you pray and you don't know who you're praying for if I give you an A4 paper and ask you to write what you know about Allah and you fail to fill it up if I give you a paper and ask you to write the attributes and names of Allah and you fail to do that who are you worshiping a lot of us don't know a lot because we don't read the Quran we don't treat Sunnah I don't understand do not know the prophet Muslim yesterday in the seminar I asked the brothers and sisters about some of the Companions and nobody knew I asked him about a name of one of the mothers of the believer your mother and I didn't know if she was a companion or a a wife of the Prophet or any else until when then if I ask you about the players of Manchester United probably you'll succeed give me seven or eight of them then to fulfill this emptiness in our hearts and in our souls to enable ourselves to be good and obedient Servants of Allah we have to pray on time we have to eat the Quran we have to learn not just reading it if he learned what Allah wants from you when you come to a verse of the Quran which says [Music] do you think that we've created you for nothing and that you're not coming back to us when you read this verse you start to shiver you you the hair stands in your body Allah is asking you do you think that I've created you to have fun and that there is no day of judgment and you will not be held accountable for the sins you're doing when are you going to wake up to lead the Quran with your heart and accept the messages from your Lord because they are not only for bhaga Muslims and where I come from they have the Quran in their car and whenever I asked him when was the last time you read this quranism seven years eight years so why are you having it in the car it's a protection so that I won't have any accidents if the government here believed in this we would have saved millions of pounds of insurance your cars some of the brothers I know put it under the pillow the thoughts of Hassan of either all of this nonsense Allah did not revealed the Quran so that I would hang it as a taoise where I was put it as a decoration of my reveal the Quran so that I would read it believe in it make the Asgard with it and do what is in it if we do this we will know Allah and if we know Allah we will live a lot and Allah if we love Allah we will be the happiest people ever toward the earth when you have Allah in your heart hours ago she was crying from something sure please pray for me when she's crying please pray for me so I will not pray for you how much should I pray for you who's closer to Allah me or her who's in need Allah says who is it that answers the one in distress and he leaves or yeah he leaves all calamities and make you one after the other on Earth is there any Allah any God with Allah is there no so if you have a Calamity turn to Allah not to anyone else and I speak out of experience I'm not a saint and I'm not a scholar and I'm not a a learned person I'm a normal person just like you but I have a little love you know any crooked English that allows me to go on satellite channels and speak I'm like I'm not scholar but Allah I swear by Allah who there is no God except for the being worshiped except him if you have trust in Allah nothing stands in your way so many times I ask Allah for things not out of testing but out of being sure that they will happen and from one job to the other and I'm getting raises and successes and double the salary from one card I have four cards with the grace of Allah I don't have anything I don't even have a house believe it or not but I ask Allah not because I am a good person but because my Lord whom I know and I trust so many times the children get ill let's take him to hospital said no before we take him to hospital let us do okay foreign the doctor is not there we go back to the house six seven hours nothing is there it's not a saint it's not me it's sometimes it's a wife sometimes it's the aunt that do this if you have trust in the Lord but when you don't have trust in love in Allah and you have trust in rightly but that Barclays Bank or in the government or in the benefits or in your uncle or your father if the wife only trusts that her husband is the only source of being alive then you have a problem so I I'm afraid I took enough of your time yeah for us I think I believe that there are a lot of questions and then the brothers may have something that goes into the mind maybe they've heard something they did not like this is so if you have any questions or you have any comments that I may clarify for you inshallah [Music]"
