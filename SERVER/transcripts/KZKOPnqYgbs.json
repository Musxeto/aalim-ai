  "title": "Can a person pray if Mathi (Prostatic Fluid) comes out during prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from india says i have a problem with a prosthetic fluid whenever i get evil thoughts and i imagine something or fantasize about something methi or prosthetic fluid is emitted so when it's time for prayer i wash myself and i clean my underwear and i go but i still feel it is coming out and after prayer i check and i find it there so what to do if it is continuing to come out you have to wait until it stops even if you miss the congregation because you do not have urine incontinence this is a once in a blue moon incident and it would eventually stop it takes time so maybe half an hour maybe you have to wash your penis and testicles with cold water maybe you have to do this or that either way don't squeeze your private part don't uh go and check every couple of minutes just relax maybe urinating would help maybe but you don't pray when it is still coming out and you have to wait until it stops"
