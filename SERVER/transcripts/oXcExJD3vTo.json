  "transcript": "a sh if I was not aware that my transaction with someone was re as soon as I got to know can I change the intention that I am gifting them that money and they are not obliged to pay me anything back after that Allah tells us in the Quran that once you discover that the transaction is r you're entitled to take only your Capital without any profit or interest so that you would not have any Injustice upon yourselves or upon others let so if I lent someone 10,000 that so that he would return it 15,000 thinking that this is a business transaction and after sometime I discovered that this is RBA and a major sin Allah tells us get only your 10,000 which the capital you have lent and as for the 5,000 you have to not take anything from it and this way is a win-win nowhere in Islam it tells us that no no no you give the 10,000 as well as a form of repentance there's no need for that at all"
