  "transcript": "Oh Salah rahmani rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen Ocelot wassalam Oh Alma borussia lomatin De La Mina Mina Muhammad Ali he was Xavier Jemaine a movado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith 166 from this blessed book of from the telecom and who will read it for us the brother there I shall Roger low on her reported when the Prophet sallallahu ala you seldom was ill some of his wives made a mention of the church which they had seen in Abyssinia which was called Maria Omaha beba and um miss Alma who migrated to Abyssinia mention how beautiful it was and its images the message of allah allah allah allah salam raised his head and said when a pious person amongst them amongst the religious groups dies they would build a place of worship on his grave and then decorate it with such  they would be the worst of creatures inside of allah now in this hadith the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam was ill he was sick he was in pain and agony yet when he heard what umm habiba and umm salama because Selma is different than salama salama is a man's name you remember salim abbud acquire and Selma is a female's name so though the prophet alayhi salatu salam was in pain he commented on what his wives said what did they say they were talking and discussing a church by the name of church of mary they have seen in Abyssinia when they migrated there before migrating back to medina and they said while mentioning it that they were so beautiful statues they were lots of sculptures there and drawings and colorful and this is a fact if you visit churches they are well taken care of so the prophet alayhi salatu salam mentioned to them though he was tired and though he was sick he raised his hand and said these are the worst of creatures at the side of Allah why he said because when a righteous person dies they built and they make these sculptures they make these statues to commemorate him and this is not permitted in Islam nor in other religions now from this hadith we may think about a number of issues for example number one what's the ruling on visiting churches scholars differed some say that it is completely prohibited why they said that Roman hoppip may allah be pleased with him when he went to Jerusalem to Palestine he was invited by one of their dignitaries to come and have lunch and he refused and he justified his refusal by the presence of these sculptures and statues in your church and we know that the angels do not enter a place where it has statues and sculptures some scholars say no it is completely permissible why visit because in the same hadith of remark he instructed Ali bin Abi Talib and his companions to go and have lunch he himself he did not go and when I he went in and ate and looked at the sculptures he said nothing would have had happened if Omar may allah be pleased with him came meaning that i don't see anything that prevents him from coming in and they also said umm salamah and Habiba went into the church and the Prophet did not what did not tell them how dare you go to the church so this means that going to the church is permissible yet it is highly not recommended especially if this adds value to the non-muslims by saying that look how great we are even the Muslims are coming so this is not permissible and I personally think and believe that especially for those who are not strong in their religion those who are strong it's okay like umm habiba and umm salama but those who are young and they don't have strong e-man i highly recommend that they do not go at all why unfortunately people are deceived by what they see so if someone especially the youngsters if I take my children 1617 of age not a lot of knowledge and I take them to a church and they enter the church so quiet so clean nice chairs beautiful pictures and beautiful sculptures and statues and windows are all colorful I look at the priest masha'Allah beautiful suit nice tie will shaven when he speaks mashallah he speaks in a very eloquent manner nice and calm voice not like she has and fear Allah you have to do this you have to do that and everything looks nice whew well not few people with less a man less knowledge would be deceived now I don't have to go to the other direction and telling you that there is no comparison with what you see because even with the colorful colors and the sculptures and the drawings and the crosses how many attend the church and how many attend the mosque not only that don't be deceived by the outer look the Muslims perform hustle which is total bath before they go to friday they perform woodle evolution they are obliged whenever they answer the call of nature to wash and wipe and clean their private parts so it's a whole different game and look at the interior and the inside of those who do not believe that they have to wash and that is why they urinate and defecate without even cleaning themselves from the interior it is awful the exterior may look okay like any other person who takes care of the outer flesh and she'll neglecting what's inside and raising the voice in the hotbar is part of the Sunnah of the Prophet is awesome having a Miss wok putting your trousers or your rope to the middle of your leg this is the Sunnah of the Prophet erase rostrum but those who do not have knowledge those who are ignorant those who have less e-man they can be deceived some churches have musical instruments right sheriff yusuf estes before becoming to islam he used to sell musical instruments to who to churches they worship allah by singing and dancing our youngsters say wow why don't we have something like that well because our Islam is the religion of Allah you cannot worship Allah by such things that is why it is not recommended at all to go to churches okay what about the ruling on addressing them if they ask us to go and deliver a speech or a lecture introducing Islam well it depends on from one place to the other if you know that you will be giving a platform to make Dowa to allah azzawajal this is permissible inshallah and we hope that this may help people understand islam moor among the things that we would like to also discuss is the ruling on having sculptures or statues it is completely forbidden to have in your house a statue or a sculpture have it be Buddha or a lion or a snake or a human being any statue of a living creature is completely prohibited and so many times I go into people's houses and I find crystal ornaments or the part of decoration in the guest room you know a dolphin or a camel made of crystals very expensive very nice-looking these are statues that prevent angels from entering your house only excuse that you are allowed to have is toys for children so it is permissible to have dolls for girls not for boys those are for girls and some scholars say even young boys three or four years you may bring them a toy to play with because this for children is permissible these toys are only to be used by children by girls who did not reach the age of puberty do we have any questions yes brother you said that dolls are allowed before the age of poverty for girls what type of dolls looks like animals beer dog other looks like human beings small-dollar that's a good question the brother is asking is there any specific ruling on having these dolls for children that did not reach age of puberty venereal can it be humans like humans or can they animals or not this is what you'll find after the break so assalamu alaikum and welcome back the brothers question just before the break was regarding the dolls and the toys to be used my girls are they supposed to be humans or not the toys to be humans of course any is it permissible to take a dog that in the form of a human or can they take dolls in the form of animals both are permissible I am Ella be pleased with her had in her cabinet a horse plus other dolls and she said that these are my girls and as for the horse the horse had wings and when the Prophet Isom said how could a horse has wings she said didn't you hear that shall a man peace be upon him had a horse with wings so the prophets lasa laughed and let it be why because she was a girl she did not reach the age of puberty at the time so scholars say that it is permissible to take such dolls some of them said that nowadays dolls are more human than dolls there's so much look like real infants or babies not only that they even drink from a milk bottle and you change the diapers afterwards and when they're hungry they say mama mama and they burp if you put them on your shoulder so they say that this is becoming too real and the issue is an issue of dispute among scholars the essence is that it's permissible for them to play why they say that girls need to train on caring for children so when they are taught this from an early age this grows the love and the mercy unlike boys boys when you give them a dog the first thing they do is take the head off and maybe the arms and legs and then they try to put it back again give them a car they would tear it apart and put it back again this is what boys usually do girls are unlike this they take very good care of their dolls they put them to sleep they cover them they put the pillow underneath they they're full of mercy so I personally believe even if the toys are so real to that extent it is still in sha Allah part of what was permitted originally and Alonzo gel knows best sound like a chick someone people try to manage a chance anyhow to carry the funeral on their shoulders is there any hadith backing it or it is an innovation I do not know of any hadith that supports that you should try and fight over carrying the funeral except the general concept of being haste with the funeral and being part of following it and burying it but i do not know or recall at the moment any hadith that says whoever does this allah would reward him the general hadith is whoever prays on a funeral Allah would grant him a pair up and whoever prays on a funeral and follows it until it's bad Allah will give him to karate on Alonzo gel regarding reciting the ayah from it we have created you and to it we shall return you and from it you will be resurrected again is it part of the Sunnah to throw the three handful of soil in the grave while it's being buried and recite this I do not know as soon a in it and therefore if there isn't any sooner in it we cannot do it because it is not part of the sooner if there is a hadith stating that the prophet used to do this item or his companions we may follow that other than this no it is not permissible yes brother the second row assalamu alaikum taking taking images and keeping in the mobile is allowed this is a question that allah of the brothers asked about which indicates that they have a lot of concern when it comes to halal and haram and may allah reward them for that what is forbidden in Islam the Prophet said array salatu salam that the most severe people who would be punished on the day of judgment are those who take images the word is al moussaoui rune and Ali may allah be pleased with him sent his companion i will hair gel Assaidi and he said shouldn't i send you on what the prophet alayhi salatu salam sent me the prophet sent me not to leave any grave over the ground unless I would level it and not to see any picture and without leaving it or erasing it so this is what the Prophet instructed him and scholars all agree that making sculptures or statues that is 3d is forbidden and it is among the greatest sins that a person could do Allah would give life to these images or these statues or these pictures and they will punish the person who did them and scholars differ regarding drawing 2d drawing in hand and the most authentic opinion is that it is forbidden the majority of scholars say drawing a face drawing a man drawing a portrait of a person or an animal this is forbidden now they differed when it came regarding photography and the reason of their difference of opinion was they looked at the Arabic word which is surah picture and the description of those who do it Alma so we're on those who take pictures so those who went to say that it is forbidden said what do we call a camera and what a picture comes out of this is called a picture so this is a picture what is what are you called your called mu so where the one who takes pictures so this is completely prohibited and this is opinion of shake even bass and Cheryl albani may allah have mercy on their souls other scholars said no the picture that we are forbidden from doing is the one that resembles a loss creation that is why in the hadith qudsi allah says who is greater in sin and transgression more than those who go to create something similar to my creation let them create an ant let them create a piece of barley or of wheat so allah azzawajal is angry with those who create creations similar to his creation and they said when i take a photograph of you am i creating a creation similar to allah they said that this is the creation of allah and that is why when i look into a mirror would i say that this is a different person no if I look into the water in a pond my reflection is me and that is why if I sign a check and you take it and you Xerox it you make a copy of it and I have the original and the copy would I say that this is mine and this is not or would I say both are my signature I would say both are my signature so they said that photography or capturing the shadow as they call it is not considered to be forbidden and this is the opinion of shaker beneath a mean however share Burnett Amin says that you are not allowed to keep it for or as a seven year now it seems to me and Alonzo L knows best that photography is permissible only in two cases that you're not allowed to have them one you are not allowed to have any photographs of a grown up woman why is it haram the image itself is not haram but women originally by default they should be covered and by keeping images of them uncovered or in their normal dresses even if only Muharram will see it this goes against the teachings of Islam women are excluded why because we know this laptop if I format it once twice and three times and I sell it they still can retrieve whatever was in the hardest and I had a friend he's a pilot in the Air Lines who told me I bought a secondhand laptop that was completely formatted and one of my friends told me give it to me I want to play with it for a while and the second day he brought me pictures of families and of girls of women of the owner of his look what I found on his hard drive he said I was shocked because there were private pictures but the one who sold it thought that it could not be retrieved likewise from the SD card the memory card your camera your mobile nothing can be erased it can be all brought back so women are prohibited to be taking pictures of not in weddings not in private gatherings and the second one of deceased you're not allowed to keep pictures of dead people because this goes against the teachings of Islam this is exactly what the people of Noah did when what who are we are worthwhile your oak and Ezra died five righteous people they built statues to remember them and they ended up worshipping them this is what I believe now someone says wouldn't it be safer to avoid it I tell you definitely it would but I do not have the guts nor the knowledge to say that it is Harlem I can tell you that this is what I believe but those who would like to follow more reliable shoe and banning this or not getting close to this I would have no hesitation in shaking their hands and saying that you're doing the right thing but at the same time I would respect those who say that we do not think that it is imitating unless creation rather it is a las creation and Alonzo Jill knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via mail assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
