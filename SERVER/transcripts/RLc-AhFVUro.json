  "transcript": "foreign [Music] foreign and welcome to the fifth lesson of the islamic faith and today we will begin with chapter number four now this chapter deals with a very important aspect of arpeda and that is the issue of iman and kufar which a lot of the muslims have great misconceptions in and we know that iman is something that is believed in the heart said by the tongue acted upon by the body or the limbs and that it is increases and decreases as it is the methodology or the akkida of allah and a great deal of sex and cults went astray because of this concept that they did not understand and just to highlight how important this is it's sufficient today remember remember the hadith of the prophet allah he stated that my um will be divided into 73 sects all of it or all of them are in hell except one and the there are a number of narrations this one is the gemara this one is whoever follows my footsteps and those of my companions so it is important to learn your akida so that you're not one of the 72 who are bound in hell and these 72 sects are not in hell due to the fact that they have difference of opinion in issues of akida whether touching the opposite gender nullifies or not whether i have to put my hands on the chest or under my belly button my navel when i'm praying no no these are compared to what we're discussing are trivial issues they don't consist a lot of weight that would put a person in hell or not so it is important that we understand the concept of apida the concept of iman and kufur this belief the types of disbelief because this is at the end of the day what will be the measurement tool to whether you enter jannah or not of course after the mercy of allah so the author says belief and disbelief are cases that are determined by allah alone and this is understood again this is part of the akhida the issue of judging things it's not up to your intellect or mine how do we judge things in islam this is known as which means that saying that something is good or something is bad who determines this in islam some like the martesilla say our intellect our brains they tell us what's good and what's bad and this is totally wrong and this is why the martezella is one of the 72 sects who are not part of allah those who follow the salaf those who are upon the footsteps of the prophet and his companions determine what is good and what is bad what's beautiful and what's ugly through the sharia through the quran so it's not up to me to decide whether this is good or bad in islamic terms unless i refer to the quran yes if i were to look at an object this is will ugly or this is beautiful it's an object it has nothing to do with islam but once i say that this is the siwak that the prophet recommended before every salat and before wudu and had he not feared to burden his ummah he would have instructed them to do it at every time they make wudu now this becomes a religious symbol you cannot criticize this you cannot as i say can't touch that so you have to refrain likewise if it were for my logic and yours the people in europe their logic differs from the people in india and the people in india's logic differ from the people in the middle east and those in the middle east differ from those who are more conservative elsewhere some people think that it is inappropriate for a woman to wear a bikini but it's okay to wear a one-piece suit swimming suit oh that's not as revealing some people think that covering the faces extreme while those people look at women who uncover their faces to be not truly religious so how do we determine it has to be through the quran and the sunnah because allah says whenever you dispute over an issue return it back to allah and to the prophet meaning return it to the quran and to the sunna so now we come to the issue of belief and disbelief these are cases that are determined by allah alone so it's part of the religion i don't have the power and this happens a lot when people come to me and say a man raped a woman killed a child stole money made a whole village become pois poisoned and died due to the things he put in the well of that village is he a muslim what would i say he did heinous crimes but to take him out of the fold of islam is not up to me it is only in allah's hands to take people out of the fold of islam and we have a process to do that so we have to be in accordance to the quran and sunnah when it comes to issues of great importance such as belief in this belief no one may be called an unbeliever without clear evidence from allah evidence see calling people to be disbelievers is an issue of doubt and there is a very very strong and beautiful maxim a legal maxim it's an islamic rule it states that certainty is not affected by doubt very easy but if you implement it to everything you see and get in contact with it would make your life much much easier those who whisper did i make or not is this najasa or not i have to wash myself for a whole hour after urinating just to make sure that i'm pure if they've implemented this rule they would not have had any problem is my wife divorce or not what is certain that we married 20 years ago are you sure yes i have proof i have evidences i have witnesses okay what about your divorce he says i don't know i'm i think perhaps maybe so i say okay is this doubtful or certain it says no it's doubtful but answer my question certain or doubt will say doubtful throw it in the dustbin certainty is not affected by doubts cascading this to all aspects of life you'll have no whispers of shaytan no ocd because we have rules we're applying the rules that the prophet saws give had given to us so let us apply this to the issue of belief and disbelief no one may be called an unbeliever a disbeliever a kafir without clear evidence from allah ah what does that mean it means i'm a muslim by default do you agree everybody says yeah we've been hearing you preach islam for the past like 20 years we we have videos we have youtube we have and i've seen you pray and you say you're a muslim so the default is the default you are a muslim your name is abdullah or your name is fatima this is the default when you come you say alaikum this is an indication that you're a muslim no one can may be called a kafir without a clear evidence from allah now if i get this idea that you're not a muslim why um i've seen him hang out with disbelievers i saw him dance in a nightclub i saw him celebrating new years i saw him say to a christian merry christmas so this is a clear indication to me that without doubt he is a kafir i said wait wait wait is this probable or 100 true he said i think it's 100 i say isn't there a possibility that he was just being nice to others not knowing the ruling maybe he was weak maybe he wanted to get lucky that night so he is trying to act like them so that maybe you never know he says this is possible but most likely not what you're saying is it certain or doubtful he says it's doubtful but it's 99.9 certain as long as there is this point zero one percent of doubt you have no right to breach the rule which states certainty is not affected by doubt your doubt cannot take that individual with out of the fall of islam and this is the most extreme that we see all around us when people say ah the ruler of this country is a kafir oh have you ever met him no have you ever interviewed him or interrogate him no i don't need to he's a kafir how do you take someone out of the fall of islam like that because he did this he did this he did this and all of these are not set in it and we will come to this in more detail but just to show you the magnitude of ignorance people are living in so without evidence we cannot take what's certain which is islam and take a person out of its fold without another certain evidence in their life on earth people are divided into two categories believers and unbelievers or disbelievers this is how allah azza was a divided people either with us or without or against us this is a true fact that no one can escape you're either a muslim or not you really is either a believer or a disbeliever and the evidence behind this is in chapter 64. says who has created you yet some of you are unbelievers and some do believe so this is the classifications of people on earth there is no third option i'm not a disbeliever i am a christian i believe said okay excuse me what do you believe i believe that god exists which god god the father yes what about the son he's the son of god and what about the holy ghost these three are one so i said okay then you're a disbeliever because you cannot associate others with allah you cannot disbelieve in the prophet sallallahu alaihi prophet muhammad with all the evidences that you have if you don't accept him then you're a disbeliever one says listen i do not believe in the existence of your god i'm agnostic i'm an atheist i'm anything but i'm not a believer and i'm not a disbeliever no no you're a disbeliever if you're not a muslim you're a disbeliever whether you're a hindu you're a buddhist you're an atheist you're you're a jew you're a christian you are a star worshiper you're a satan worshiper you are a disbeliever and this is what islam says in black and white no one can deny this no muslim would you know beat around the bush either you're a muslim or you're a disbeliever in hell mainly most religions are like this either you're a christian and believe in the savior jesus christ their lord or you're in hell for eternity either you do this or you are in hell and so on so this is or these are the rulings that apply to them rulings that those which allah has revealed in his book the quran and the prophet sunnah you will find it in the quran and in the sunnah in the prophetic hadith that goes beyond doubt there is no one doubtful about this okay i understand but there is a category that is in between and what is this category there are the hypocrites so how do you classify them and what do you think about what they're doing well hypocrisy is something that is internal it is not something i can see so in order to judge you as a hypocrite i have to know what's in your heart and this can only be done by allah no human being can not do that to the extent that the prophet ali islam had never executed or killed a hypocrite though there were so many during his lifetime surrounding him in medina living with him praying with him in the masjid allah told him that they are in the last level of hell fire doomed for eternity in hell yet he never killed a single one why because we as muslims we're giving the prophet as a role model and we follow his footsteps he told us that we do not judge people according to their intentions in what is in their hearts we don't have the authority to do this we judge people by what they look how they act and behave so they're accountable for their behavior what goes in their minds and what is in their hearts this is something between them and allah and again this is an important issue of our apida don't jump the gun don't judge people and claim and this is a claim from shaytan ah i did this because he's a hypocrite he intended to do this because he wanted to say this he meant and we have this a lot when you say something when you give a lecture people judge you not by what you had said in the lecture they said no no his intention was so and so and so and i said so stop here do you know the unseen do you know the rape are you allah azzawajal to know what's in my heart no no i don't but i can tell how do you tell and this is why a lot of the extremists who follow the methodology do what they do because they have zero knowledge number one number two they have ill intention so they judge people by their intention not by what they see and not what body they appear what appears to us from them the prophet allah always made clear that we judge people by what they do not by what is in their hearts usability may allah be pleased with him and he was in his teens maybe like 15 or so the prophet sent him on an expedition out of his salah so he won he came back with his people and was at the prophet's house al-islam who was very happy to see him return safely as he loved his father before him tremendously and was known to be the adopted son of the prophet salam until allah banned adoption in islam before that he used to be known by the name of zadir muhammad so when zaid was blessed with usama the prophet loved usama so much that he raised him in his house and he was known to be the love of the prophet islam and the son of the love of the prophet so the prophet loved them both zade as a son and usama as their grandson so usama was coming and telling the prophet islam we met the enemy and we exchanged blows and this happened and there was this man over and the prophet was happy because the progress of the battle showed the prophet assam how intelligent samuel was how a good leader he was like his father and everything was a reason to be happy so usama reached a point in the battle where he said oh prophet of allah there was this man and this man caused a lot of hardship to the muslims he was a strong bold fighter and he caused a lot of injuries among the muslim warriors so i went to confront him and we exchanged blows and we had a duel and i was the better man with the grace of allah so when i managed to corner him and he had nowhere to escape and he felt that i am about to kill him he said ashadu allah i bear witness that there is no god worthy of being worshiped except allah which is the declaration of islam so osama continued saying this naturally and he said so when he said this and he was already cornered i put my spear or my sword through his chest and killed him till that moment the prophet was happy and when he got to know that usama killed him he stood up straight and said you killed him after he said usama explained o prophet of allah he did not say it because he loves allah or he's interested in islam we are on the battlefield the guy has just killed so many of my companions and we're fighting and when he felt that he's going to lose and to be killed he said it as a shield he did not say that believing in it so the prophet as a son said to him did you open his heart so that you can be certain that he said it out of fear of death did he say that to you did he confess do you know the unseen what will you do with on the day of judgment what will you do with allah on the day of judgment and he kept on repeating it until osama said after regretting what he had done i wish i did not accept islam except on that day meaning so that it would erase all what was previously had been done of mistakes and he would have a clean record what does this tell you what does this tell those who keep throwing tak fee right left and center oh this guy is kafir this guy is kafir this scholar is jahmi this one is this one is this keep on labeling people left right and center did you open their heart were you able to see what they intended so this is an extremely important issue that people have to be aware of we only judge others by what appears to us their intentions will be judged by allah on the day of judgment the sheikh says a hypocrite is treated according to what he does and says in public which means that he is treated like the rest of muslims and what they do and say so a person is treated like the rest of muslims and what they do and say because we are not authorized to judge what's in his heart the sheikh goes on to divide the hypocrites into two types those who commit major hypocrisy and those who will commit minor hypocrisy and this calls us to expand a little bit so i think that we would maybe most likely delay this until thursday's class and we will take your uh questions insha allah in the remaining time so the first question is from madiha madiha says give few tips to raise our children especially teens to have strong apida first of all i wish there were tips that are easy to implement but this differs from one country to the other one environment to the other if you're living in a cafe country is different than if you're living in a half-half practicing country if you're living in a half-half practicing country is different than when you're living in a real muslim practicing country now raising people to have strong apida depends on a number of factors number one whether the parents are walking the talk or not what does that mean you cannot have your children believe in what you're preaching them unless you yourself are practicing it when you depend on other than allah and your child sees this and then you teach the child before an examination to have to depend and rely and trust allah no one else he says to you but dad you and mom take benefits from the government claiming that both of you are not married and then you justify say yeah this is a catholic country it's okay it's okay but you also lie you also don't declare your taxes you also do this you also do that so at the end of the day your son can't have a strong arceda when you're not walking the talk to have a good akida you have to have strong knowledge of allah so you need to study with your child or children the beautiful names and attributes of allah and their meanings so for example take one day the word and show them what it means where is where it is mentioned in the quran and in the sunnah show them what's the meaning of al-jabbar and when they know more and more about allah standing in prayer has a different taste to it has a different meaning we pray without such knowledge which means that we are moving like robots and we're doing it out of customs out of everybody's doing it so why not me but rarely you will find people who acknowledge the conversation between them and allah when they say allah says my servant has praised me and so on to have a strong akida you need to spend quality time with with your kids you need to speak to them you need to listen to them you need to share with them what you see the prophet is to utilize every single moment of his time not only preaching he spoke much less than what he listened to yet we have a hadith where it says that ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him was riding behind the prophet saw on a mule and then the prophet said to him oh boy i'm going to teach you words and you should pay attention observe allah and he shall protect you and he went on to teach ibn abbas who was a young child of 10 years of age maybe which says a lot to us that these children should not be looked down upon that they don't understand even when they are children of an early age i know women mothers who teach their children from an early age of one year old to point to the heavens and say and when asked where is allah so the children say above the heavens above the heavens just point upwards this is from an age of one year so to have a strong it's not only to take them to a madrasa that makes them memorize the quran which is a positive and good thing but memorizing the quran alone is not enough and we have to invest more in quality time there are a number of publications i don't know if there is such publications in english but in arabic there are so many great publications that address such an issue from a story point of view of drawings point of view for children much younger than the teenaged but it delivers the message beautifully so i hope this answers some of your question but i know it's it's not sufficient may allah make it easy for all of you and the summit says if someone while praying says allahu akbar after reaching completely the next position for example he says allahu akbar after bending in record completely and then says allahu akbar does this invalidate the prayer a great number of scholars said that this invalid is prayer and i'll examine this to you i'm in the standing position i go for record and then say allah so i said the takbir of movement after reaching the end of the pillar and some of them say it while standing and this is due to the influence of showing off and microphones so the guys the imam's recitation is beautiful he doesn't want to say allahu akbar while going for because the mics won't pick up his beautiful voice so he says after finishing women [Music] and then he moves of course by the time he said everybody is before him in the record position because he's late both scenarios are wrong and it's not permissible and a great majority of scholars said that the prayer is invalid because he's he has introduced something to recur this is not part of the bowing position to say allah it should be said between so you start moving and you say allahu akbar now when rising up saying the phrase is too long so inevitably you will have to say a portion of it while standing up so you say semi standing but this is negligible but to say and then you go for sujud this is wrong or to go for sujud after you touch the ground you say allahu akbar this is wrong why are they doing this he said so that people won't move before i reach the sujud i don't want them to to race with me and this is totally haram and prohibited does it nullify the prayer a lot of scholars say it does have mercy so said that it seems that the vast majority of people are ignorant of the ruling and to say that their prayer is invalid would invalidate a lot of people's prayers so we would say that this is highly disliked and muslims should be more careful than repeating this again and allah knows best okay yusra says is it allowed to pray with a mirror in front the answer is yes the prayer is valid but if it's going to distract you if you're going to every now and then look at yourself at your posture the way you're standing whether you are sucking your tummy in or not whether you look good or not this this definitely distracts you and defies the purpose of salat remember that the prophet islam was given once a garment a suit that had a lot of decoration and it was colorful so the prophet prayed two raka's and immediately took it off and told the companions to send it back to the person who had gifted it to him and exchange it with something that was plain the prophet said the sun because it had distracted me in my prayer so this is the garment that he was wearing so if such a distraction inevitably is going to take place uh because of the matter then this is not recommended yet this has no impact on your prayer the prayer is valid uh both ways tazrina says what is the significance of the phrase reclining on their couches in the hadith against the quran yun tasrina is referring to the hadith with the prophet isam's warned his ummah by saying let me not see a man reclining on his couch doing this on his couch or a pillow and saying whatever we find in the quran we will implement when whatever is out of the quran we would reject referring to the sunnah so the prophet said by allah i was giving the quran and similar to it with it meaning that the sunnah is similar to the quran and that he was given such a revelation together so this indicates how such reckless neglectful ignorant imbeciles behave with grave issues that they reject a main source of islam due to their whims and desires while reclining on their couches or on their pillows and allano's best risa says is it is permissible to put down the mushaf is it permissible to put down the mushaf on the prayer mat while praying to hajjut and this is an important issue because a lot of the people exaggerate when it comes to issues that do not call for exaggeration some schools of thought say that if i'm sitting on a chair and a person reciting the quran is sitting on the floor that this can be kufar which fits like a glove with our islamic faith principles that we've gone through today and what is the evidence that you're taking a person out of the fold of islam he says that when you sit above a person who's reciting the quran or even a person who's a half of this is insulting the quran subhanallah this insult is apparent or something that i i verbally said is it an evidence that can take a person out of hold of islam do you have proof from the quran the sunnah they said no but is it this is our topic so coming back to the issue of putting the mushaf on the ground a lot of the muslims say it is disrespectful to put the mushaf on the ground i'm sitting on the ground i'm reading the quran i pass by a verse of sajdah prostration i put it on the ground and i perform prostration the guy next to me holds my quran up i finish my prostration he hands it to me so it's not gonna lie but why did he do this he says it's just disrespectful to put the quran on the ground says who he said this is the quran but i am a worshipper of allah i am reading the quran i love the quran when i put it on the ground i do not intend any insult or disrespect to it now let us look at it from another perspective when you're reading the quran you're putting it on your lap is this respectful why not you're putting it on your private part what is this i didn't mean anything up to shay so we must not go into extreme some people refuse to put the quran on their tables because there are cupboards that are higher so they would like to put it on the highest thing on in the room why don't you take the quran put it on the ceiling on the roof or on the water tank on top of your home just to be the highest thing this is all nonsense yes you are praised and thanked for loving and respecting the quran but not to that extent the prophet himself used to put his head in mother ayesha's lap you know sleeping putting his head resting and would read the quran and some narration says that he was some narrations say that he was doing that while she was on her menses what do you have to say about this there is no disrespect in all of that and hence there is nothing wrong in putting your mus your quran on your prayer mat or on the ground directly and allah knows best salman sadiq says what is the ruling on attending a ceremony that has birthday together so this is the latest trend they have a birthday party the child is one years old and due to the fact that they did not slaughter two rams when the child was born on the seventh day so they want to make it now and it's hitting two birds with one stone what's the ruling on that this is prohibited whenever we have two occasions and we always stay away from the haram and there is no sin on you for not attending that and allah knows best isa says what is the ruling on a sunni man marrying a shia woman shia are not all alike some of them are muslims like us but they have a problem in the hierarchy of the muslim caliphs so they say we love abu bakr we love rama but we love ali more than we love uthman and this is how they should have ruled some of them go a little bit extreme and they say that ali is better than all of the other three some go way too extreme when they curse abu bakr and omar on earth man and the rest of the companions all of them except a handful of companions such as ammar nyasers and manila pharisee etc some even go further to slander madra isha an accuser of zina and being among the people of hellfire as hafsah the mother of the believer as well the daughter of um so you can't paint them with the same brush but the vast majority of shia who are noun who are now known to be the shia are those from iran those who are following the imamiyah or the ash or akida and these have strong issues according to our apida as we can't nullify a person's islam without concrete proof so as we are not talking about a specific individual we're talking about a belief this is easier so we can easily say that anyone who slaunders mother aisha and says that she committed fornication or adultery and by that he would be falsifying the quran where allah proved her innocence in the quran such a person is a kafir for rejecting the quran so all those who curse abu bakr ahmad man and the rest of the companions they're actually cursing this the religion they convey to us and they are falsifying the hadith where the prophet said that they are all in jannah so such people it's definitely not permissible for a sunni muslim or for any muslim to marry from these are apostates blatant kafir disbelievers we get people coming to us and say sheikh the woman i want to marry doesn't curse the companions and she does not slander mother aisha the only thing that differs with us is that she follows the of al-jaffariyah which is different than ours and in terms of she loves ali al-hasan and her saying okay we all love them yeah but she prefers them more than the the rest but she respects the rest and says that they are companions of the prophet so in short that individual is a muslim however marrying a shia with such a belief would negatively impact your children because she sits with them more than you and not only that their uncles maternal uncles and aunts would be from the shia so they will have feelings towards shia and the worst thing of all is if she's using which is lying in order to protect their beliefs as it is part of the beliefs of the shia and she's saying this to you so that you get married to her and then she shows her other face this is even the worst of all so in short i would say that it is not permissible to marry someone from the shia sect due to what you have heard earlier and allah azzawajal knows best rabia ahmed says i like to know if it is permissible to recite a verse or a dua number one rabbi nilly render now this dua was said in the quran when asia the wife of pharaoh was put to death and tortured before her death she made this dua to allah that oh allah built me a house next to you and in jannah and save me from the oppressors and the wrongdoers this dua is a beautiful dua so if you say it in sujud and before salaam this is permissible we have the prophet's dua where he says that whenever someone asks allah for jannah three times the jannah says o allah admit him to me so when you say rabbi yes allah so whether you say this or that both seems to me uh permissible and no problem with that the second dua the dua of ramadi allahu allahu um and something else i cannot understand but generally speaking he's asking for martyrdom and to be buried in medina and we know that medina and around it there are no battlefields the whole area the whole region has embraced and accepted islam so such a dua was quite weird to want martyrdom while dying in medina but we know that he was assassinated while attempting to pray fajr and lead the prayer in the masjid of medina and that he was buried in medina to ask allah to be buried in medina is legitimate and one of the good deeds the prophet said isam whoever among you is capable of dying in medina he should do so for my intercession would benefit him or he would attain my my my intercession and asking allah for shahada is also a positive good thing the prophet said that who does not wish for jihad and does not even think about it and hope and and wish for it then he would die as a hypocrite and scholars say and i think there's a hadith around this meaning that whoever asks allah for martyrdom for shahadah sincerely allah will grant him this reward even if if he dies on his bed so i see no problem in asking allah azzawajal for martyrdom and to die in medina as omar did but be careful that you must acknowledge that this is not from the sunnah this is a good dua you do it not because the prophet did it because it he didn't but because it's a good dua and you hope that allah would respond to you and allah knows best the final question with us today is from neslin can the dead before they are buried and end their grave hear the recitation of the quran of the family members i know the hadith about the dead can hear the footsteps and the salams of family members what about the quran's recitation well neslin what you have said is crystal clear the prophet told us allah what will a disease encounter before his soul is taken and what would happen when he is placed in his grave from the time his soul is taken until the time his body is placed in the grave and buried there was never ever any mentioning of the deceased hearing anything or feeling anything whether they washing shrouding perfuming praying as a prayer carrying the deceased on their shoulders until they put him in his grave then bury him all of this time he does not hear a thing the prophet tells us only when they start to leave the graveyard he hears their flip-flops he hears their sandals as they're walking away so he doesn't hear their weeping or crying he doesn't hear their dua for him the only thing he hears is their footsteps are there as they are walking away from his grave therefore there is no evidence none whatsoever that when you recite the quran the deceased hears it or benefits from it or that he's happy with it and hence we cannot say that this happens because the prophet did not tell us that it would happen and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet you next thursday i leave"
