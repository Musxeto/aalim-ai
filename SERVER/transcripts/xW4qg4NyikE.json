  "transcript": "[Music] um and we have few questions before we conclude our course so we will go through them insha'allah and this is our last class with the grace of allah azzawajal on islamic so with this we will conclude inshaallah our classes hoping to meet with you again soon in another course if allah azzawajal wills it the first question of today is from sheim shiam or see him or say him it says i am divorced i have two children a girl and a boy if i get remarried can i let my daughter alone with her stepfather the answer is that a stepfather or the husband of the mother is a permanent mahram to his step-daughter which means that if you were to die or to get divorced he will still be her mahram forever they can never get married because he was married to her mother so yes you can leave your daughter with your step with your husband who is her stepfather without any problem in that insha allah azzawajal and we're talking about normal conditions normal people people who don't we don't have any reason to doubt them and hence this is okay and permissible inshallah after summit saleem says if someone in prayer says instead of as allah does this invalidate the prayer the answer is no because both words are so similar to one another so even in arabic if we were to drop intentionally the it would have been as in the quran but the person concluding his prayer says not clearly which is part of his laziness yet the prayer insha allah is concluded and it is valid and allah knows best says is it permissible to remove the niqab for eating outside when we are outside this depends if removing it to eat would mean that people would see you and see your face no this is not permissible eating outside is not a necessity it's a luxury you can take away the food you can eat in your car you can take it back home and eat it home so this is not permissible if there are men going to see your face this is why you were nepal in the first place i hope but if you are giving your back to the restaurant and only your mahrams are in front of you and the wall and there's no one in a side so if a woman unveils and eats nobody's going to see her there's no problem in that what counts is that she's not seen by men and allah azza knows best yama champs says i have one question and i need an answer the question is during lockdown i have lost my job now i have delivery job at amazon in the uk the issue is i am missing i pray only fajr and asia on time please tell me what i have to do shall i leave my new job if your job as you claim won't allow you to pray on time yes you have to leave your job but i don't believe that under any circumstances this is applicable on daily basis to any employee you can't convince me or tell me that you don't have a coffee break of five minutes every couple of hours you cannot convince me or tell me that you are not allowed to go to the toilet every couple of hours what about if a person is diabetic and he has to go every half an hour will they prevent him from doing this or order him to wear diapers no this is not at all applicable sometimes we tend to put barriers and hurdles in front of us convince ourselves that our superiors are monsters and they are going to fire us even if we breathe and this is not the case you have rights you have needs to be fulfilled you have a break hour or a lunch hour that every employee is entitled to and you can divide your prayers over that lunch hour with the administration's approval you have time to go to the toilet and this takes 10 minutes okay you can pray in these 10 minutes and so on uh camilla camilla says after the comma for juan do we have to make dua that we say after adhan we know that whenever we hear the adhan the sunnah is to repeat it after the so he says salutations upon the prophet saws now this is after the adhan whether jumera or the normal five daily prayers what about if the economy is given well after the qama of jumor or any other of the five daily prayers there is no zikr there is no dua there is nothing to be said you just listen adhere and wait for the imam to say takbir or you yourself if you're praying on your own you say the tequila of the salah there is no such thing as best says what's the ruling on cursing someone it is not permissible to curse an individual as the prophet says the cursing of a believer is like killing him this is totally prohibited we can curse those individuals whom allah cursed so we cursed we can curse satan we can curse abu jahl we can curse abu lahab we can curse pharaoh these are specific people who were cursed and we know that they're doomed in hell fire for eternity and there are people whom have been cursed by allah or by the prophet salam as a description and not as individuals so we say may allah curse anyone who deals with riba interest dowry may allah curse those who imitate women from among the men or may allah curse women who imitate men may allah curse thieves or people who given take bribes etc but we cannot come to an individual by the name of for example sad and we know that sad deals with borrowing and lending and we say oh sad may allah curse you no this is not permissible this is cursing of the individual and this is not permissible in islam zaid zubair says i'm asking about the four imams why did they differ in their ruling this is his first question the four imams are one of the four greatest scholars of islam they were not the greatest scholars of islam they were scholars who were far far more knowledgeable than them such as abdullah mubarak and later and so on however these great scholars did not find students to spread their views and make schools for them so their opinions soon weathered away while the four imams the four schools of thought imam abu halif and norman imam imam muhammad have mercy on their souls they had lots and lots of students who carried their legacy and spread their views all over the world that's why they have a great follower why did they differ islam in tamiya has compiled a beautiful small booklet where he explains this and is called and he mentioned in this beautiful book rafal malam that one of the main reasons of difference of opinion is that the evidence did not reach the imam for example imam abu hanifa may allah have mercy on his soul did not travel as much as imam ahmed for example so a lot of the hadiths that were available in egypt in damascus in mecca medina and in yemen were not available at al-qufa at that time in iraq so he only gave verdicts in accordance what he had known of not of the entire sharia because he wasn't capable of obtaining that evidence because they did not have print houses and books that we have the ability to research and look into one of the reasons that they differed is that the evidence may have reached them but they did not classify it as authentic so they may believe that this hadith was weak and we know that imam malik imam ashafri and imam ahmad were all scholars of hadith and they had the ability to authenticate and to weaken a hadith according to the chain of the laters according to the text according to so many things so yes they've got hold of the evidence but they did not think it was authentic a third reason was that they did get hold of the evidence and it was indeed authentic but they believed that it meant something else as per the quran and this is mentioned in chapter 2 a woman who's divorced should observe her edda for three and scholars differed whether this is referring to purity or to menses and the reason is that in arabic it can be both likewise imam shafir he differed with all other schools of thought when it came to the verse nisa can be interpreted as you touched women and it can be interpreted as you had sexual intercourse with women so the majority of scholars say that touching a woman does not break your wall while it does so the evidence is there and it's authentic but the understanding is different and it could have been to some of them authentic and the understanding is true but it was abrogated and the other side thinks that no it is not abrogated it is still valid so there are so many reasons for their difference of opinion and this is why allah mentioned it in the quran that whenever you dispute or differ in regards to an issue then you have to return it and consult allah and the prophet meaning the quran and the sunnah of the prophet zed's second question it was how one should deal with those who curses them anyone who curses the four imams the force leaders of the schools of thought of the muslims is most likely a hypocrite he's not a real muslim because they have done so many good things for the ummah and the vast majority of the muslims pray for them and make dua for them for their services to islam so if someone comes and curses them then this person is an ignorant imbecile most likely or he could be a full-fledged hypocrite wanting to undermine these great big big beacons of islam nowadays we have parasites that are trying to talk ill about sahih al-bukhari and they claim that it is not authentic they start tarnishing its reputation these are parasites nobody listens to them they're not scholars they're not known among the muslim world to be people of piety and righteousness so such people are to be totally ignored not to be mentioned not to be given the fame and exposure they were looking for rather ignore them until they weather away and die and go to the dumpsters of history like all those before them who had tried to do the same and now nobody remembers them except by cursing them may allah protect protectors sanjida says nowadays for online business women do live and give their pictures so is that is all their income becomes haram or is it no this is too generic if a person does a halal job so he sells online he is a librarian works in a library he works in a supermarket but he shaves his beard or he doesn't wear the hijab would we say that this person is a his earning is haram of course not his earning has nothing to do with another sin such as shaving the birds the beard or missing a salat in congregation etc these are separate so if a woman sells halal products in a halal transactions online but she's sinful for going live and chit-chatting and not wearing the hijab her income is halal due to the products she's selling and buying but she's definitely sinful for giving away her picture or appearing without hijab abu imran says what is the ruling about female circumcision in islam this seems to be a debate in the muslim countries to my knowledge there is a hadith or two recommending female circumcision but it is not mandatory and we don't have any solid proof that the companions the female companions did this we know that there was one woman who was specialized in doing this and the prophet giving her ali instruction how to do it and not to go extreme in taking a big chunk or a big piece of it because that would deprive women from enjoying sex after marriage and not to leave a big chunk of it as this would cause trouble so there are hadiths that are authentic but as i said it is not mandatory as in the case of male circumcision for example which is wajib therefore one should not do it unless there is a reason to it and unless there are experts doing it and as long as it is legal in the country they're doing it calling it um i think fgm female genital mutilation is not true because female genital mutilation is totally prohibited it's haram it's a mutilation circumcision is not a mutilation so it has to be looked into according to a number of factors yes what is being done in africa for example or in some parts of maybe india pakistan bangladesh maybe somewhere in the jungles of of here or there this is unislamic the way it's being done is unislamic the rituals accompanying it are unislamic but we cannot tarnish the reputation of islam claiming that this is something that is being done to women when we know that 99 of women in islam don't do it you come to saudi arabia no one is circumcised you come to indonesia 250 millions no one is circumcised you go to many countries here and there of the muslim world in arabia you will not find people having their girls circumcised only in tribal in some even non-muslim countries even the non-muslims the ethiopians for example they do it some of the uh pagans some of the christians they all do it but not the muslims rarely you will find muslims doing it and those who are doing it the vast majority of them doing it due to tribal cultural customs and those who do it to religious beliefs are less than point zero zero zero zero one percent allah knows best um the last question for today's lesson or lecture or meeting muhammad jude says what about buying online is it permissible the answer is yes if you buy buy halal products online this is permissible selling it online is it depends on whether you own it and possess it or not but buying things you see and you like there's no problem in buying them and allah azza knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of today's short lesson um as i said this is the last of our meetings until we come to a decision whether to um start a new text a new book a book whether or not or something else beneficial or not so until we meet next time i leave it to"
