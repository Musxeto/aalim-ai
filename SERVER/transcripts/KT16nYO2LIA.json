  "title": "Clarification of washing the feet & Wiping over the socks in wudu - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says her daughter has confusion in regards to wiping and washing the feet in wudhu washing the feet is mentioned in the quran in chapter 5. so when we perform wudu we wash the feet thoroughly with water there's no problem in that now allah has given us a concession a permission a reduction of obligation especially you guys in the uk in winter time is so cold i've been there i love the country i love the people when you wash your feet for fajr god this is too much it's cold especially if the heaters are not working on on the spot so allah azza made it easier for a resident who's not a traveler that if he washes his feet with water and then puts on his socks the next time he performs wudu he doesn't have to take his socks off so he performs normal when it comes to washing the feet with wet hands so the hands don't have water in it they're just wet he does this simultaneously on both feet from the toes to the leg that's it not not on the sides not underneath he doesn't have to cover the whole foot just this and that's it and he's allowed to do this for 24 hours after that he has to take his socks off perform moodle regular washing in the feet and then if he wishes to wear the socks again then he has no problem so i hope showing this makes sense to you so"
