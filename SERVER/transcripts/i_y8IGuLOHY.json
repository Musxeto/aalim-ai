  "transcript": "pope from china says what's the ruling on saying merry christmas to the christians or happy new year the pro the answer is it's totally prohibited to congratulate non-muslims over their festivals totally prohibited and this is what all scholars of islam have been saying till recently of course when such so-called scholars of islam were appointed by political powers to say whatever they want so such so-called scholars are negligible they are overlooked they're not considered to be scholars you go to the real scholars of islam islam is these scholars who speak out of knowledge and without any interference in their fatwas that you should listen to and they will tell you that this is totally haram because it is endorsing their false beliefs of jesus being the son of god which is of course nonsense what's the ruling on eating from their food they prepare for such events as long as you're not celebrating with them nor participating in their gatherings if they were to send you food while you were at home and the food is halal there's no problem in accepting it and eating it but without congratulating them"
