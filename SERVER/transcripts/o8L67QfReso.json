  "transcript": "and there is no burden or a lot of trouble on his relatives then it should be executed and they give an example of where it happens in Saudi Arabia people who die in jida a lot of them they originated from mecah or medina so they it's part of the Customs that they say if we die offer Salah prayer uh funeral prayer in MEA of course the amount of people is far far exceeding any other Masjid or various in Medina so Scholars say that if there is no trouble and there is no burden on the relatives of of the deceased they must execute his uh will though burying him where he is is closer to the Sunnah now you know how far it is from Medina from jida to meca it's almost less than an hour and from his house to one of the graveyards is almost less than an hour so the distance is not very far so what would be the ruling the ruling is inah permissible if he instructs his people or his family that he would like in his will to be buried in Mecca this is no problem Medina is a different story because it's about four hours drive and it makes a lot of burden on on people it's not enough that you died Al you wants us to take you all the way to Medina for hours going for hours coming and the trouble and the loved ones and those who care about you they have to go to follow you there therefore I would say that it is not recommended and those who want to be buried in Medina most of them have the misconception they think that being buried in Medina is something useful is it useful what is useful yeah yeah but also regarding Medina it's useful to die in Medina not to be buried the prophet said in authentic Hadith whoever among you is able to die in Medina he should do that meaning this is the place to reside this is the place to retire because we know that Medina and meca theal the Antichrist does not uh enter it so there are a lot of benefits of living in Medina but the greatest benefit is to die in Medina and this was said in Madina not in meca so the virtue of dying in Mecca is the same but in Medina no it's a different thing that the prophet Alam instructed us to do again uh look to your right look to your left if anybody's asleep wake them up okay uh among the rights that you should uh also do to uh those who die you should immediately pay off their debts and the issue of of debts is something outstanding who among you does not have something in installments or in debt one two okay mallah 6% 7% okay this is a big problem the Muslims are in debt everything we have the Muslims they have debts installments uh installments they have borrowed from this and from that and from him or from her those who want to get married they keep on paying their debts for about seven or eight years why so that they could have a wedding party that they would regret a week later so I don't know about you in Saudi the Saudis pay a lot of money for their weddings and they put it in big hotels or big uh Halls expensive food is expensive it's it costs a fortune and they don't invite the poor and the needy they invite only the high class people and when they come and they eat while they're going out ah the food is not good needed some salt the air conditioning is bad why did you get this place so they criticize whatever you do for them and yet people have a lot of debt the prophet saidat when somebody asked him he said the prophet Alam that the sins of a mar are all forgiven and he posed there and then said except for the debt jel just told me I thought that every sin he had made Is Forgiven and cleared out but jel told me no no no the debt this is not forgiven and the first thing or the second thing to do when a person dies there are four most important things in Arabic it is com uh uh combined the initials in a word called T so what is what does this stand for they say this is the four the first four things in order to do when a person dies meaning preparing the funeral so anything that is needed financially for the funeral it has to be taken from the wealth of the dead person washing him shrouding him transporting him paying for the man to wash all of this in Taj in the tea then we have the Dal which refers to d d means the debt so the first thing we the second thing after taking money for his funeral we take money for his debts we have to calculate all the inheritors are waiting we want our money give us our money my father died I need no no no we have to first prepare the the funeral then we have to pay the debts and if the debts consume everything he has so be it but before the debts you have to prepare the body so if if a man dies and he has a thousand real to me I want my thousand back they said first of all let's prepare his body to prepare to wash to get someone to wash it and to carry it to the uh graveyard it needed 500 real no no problem give the 500 real to that the rest I take w wow wow is in it's letter it's not wow w w so so the letter wow stands for which is the will so preparing the body paying the debts and then looking into his will what does he say he says onethird of my money I'd like like it to be spent on mosques I'd like it to dig a well in arria or in in Somalia you have to take this onethird of his money whether it's a million or one dirham have to take this the third one is uh M M is for which is the inheritance now we distribute the rest in accordance to what Allah has prescribed okay so it is extremely serious the issue of debts and those who do not have debt are living a Wonderful Life alhamdulillah and may Allah make me and you among them because the debt is a humilation in the daytime and uh a worrisome and a means of worrying at night time in daytime when you see those who you borrowed from how would you face them you look down you're humilated you C you don't you can't pay them so you're trying to avoid them you try to escape from meeting them and at night time when you go to bed you always think of how can I pay my debts I have so much on my back it's burdening me it's killing me so don't borrow if you can do not borrow and the majority of Muslims do they borrow for essential things yes I had a 40 in plasma I need a 50-in LCD sh what what can the people say I I need this need to see Dr Zak n this big Subhan Allah is this essential yes my car is one year old everybody has new cars I have to have a new car I have to buy new furniture in Saudi we have lots of crazy people they borrow every single year 30 40 50,000 R to go in the summer for one month to a country here or there why so that when they come back back people would not say you did not leave you did not go for vacation this year this is a problem if you do things so that you impress people but you indebt yourself you put yourself in Chains just so that the people would be happy you have a big problem mentally so you should and you must avoid debt by all means because the prophet wasam whenever he was brought up by a that person to pray for the funeral prayer he would ask does he have a debt on him if they say yes said you pray I'm not going to pray upon him so it's a serious thing it's not something to be taken easily and the worst is when you take a debt with interest you can sugarcoat it and say it's Islamic as a lot of people say a lot of the emails I get questions people come saying she I took a loan for 150,000 uh but it was Islamic but now I have doubts after you took you took it you ask if you were sincere you ask before but after you have taken it how long well it's been six years now I've been paying it but I'm have my doubts can I stop or you want to stop not you're asking to stop not you're asking to know is Hal Oram so this is a problem we move on to what's permissible for those who are present and the others so those who are present are there things that to do or not to do they say that it is permissible for those who are present to unveil uncover the face of the deceased so if we have someone who's dead and he's covered we haven't wased him yet and you come close to look at his face and no no no don't do this why it's okay the prophet did itat and he did it with one of his his companions known as one of the first to migrate to Medina and he was one of the righteous Companions of the Prophet Alam he died before bad so he was among the first to die if not if I'm not mistaken he was the first to die in Medina and when he uh when the prophet knew about his death the prophet cried and he went to him and he uncovered his face and he kissed his uh forehead and he [Music] said and you can read his story it's very beautiful one of the companions her name I think if I'm not mistaken when the prophet came to mourn him he was dead he's lying there she said she was the one who's responsible for uh uh taking care of him as he was Ill so she was the nurse and she said may Allah have mercy on you AB because uh what I know that Allah has given you his mercy and jna and the prophet said how do you dare say such a thing by Allah me myself I don't know what Allah is going to do with me how can you guarantee Jenna for him so she said by Allah I will never testify to anyone with Jenna after if if not him I will not testify to anyone because there's no more righteous person than him so the prophet said I wish and hope that Allah has elevated his level in Paradise but me myself I don't know what's going to happen to me which indicates to us that we as Muslims we cannot guarantee Jenna to anyone except those whom Allah said that they are in Jenna or the prophet told us that they are in Jenna so we all know that all the messengers of Allah are in Jenna all the 10 heavenbound of companions are in Jenna is in Jenna we know this he's in Jenna and so on because the prophet told us other than that I cannot say my father is in Jenna I cannot say that my brother who died so and so is in Jenna this person Mah he used to pray 60 years in the Masjid he died he's in Jenna no this is I wish I'm hopeful but this is not uh the case also Abu Bakr may Allah be PE with him when the prophet died he was away he came from his house he uncovered the prophet's face and he kissed him and uh between his eyes and he said uh by Allah Allah would not join two deaths at you the prophet of Allah you died once and this is the only death you are going to face and we know that um yeah you can do this but also you can cry a lot of the Muslims think that crying is is UN Islamic on the contrary crying is Sunnah crying is Sunnah the prophet Alat wasam in theith of Abdullah ja that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam gave the family of Ja three days for them to cry and then he came to them and said do not cry for my brother after today so you're allowed to weep you're allowed to cry but you're not allowed to wail you're not allowed to shout to do things that are un Islamic Abdullah ja who is Ja who's jaff Raise Your Voice the brother of Ali and known also as jaer the pilot or the one who's flying because he was martyred in m and both of his arms were uh amputated by the kufar because he was carrying the flag of the Muslims and he was the cousin of the Prophet Alat wasam the prophet himself as stated in the of cried also he cried when his son died his son ibraim his mother was Maria Al the Coptic and when he died he raised the child he smelled the child he kissed the child it the child was 18 months old and the prophet had no male Sons they all died when they were young so when you are 62 years old and you're about to die even if the child is a girl or a boy you your heart is broken so the prophet you can imagine what went into his mind sallallahu alaihi wasallam when this young child of a year and a half all of a sudden dies and you don't have any of your Offspring The Prophet cried and his eyes were filled of Tears so ABD being who he was said you do this you cry we have this concept we think men don't cry well this has to change men do cry men cry when such calamities take place because this is as the prophet described it it's a mercy from Allah men cry when they pray to Allah men cry when they remember Allah on their own and they remember their sins they feel heartbroken when we in public Mah we're righteous and and and Pious when we are in our rooms only Allah knows what we do that is why abdah may Allah be PR pleased with him one of his companions said oh Abdullah by Allah as long as you are among us the people are in in in in good state they're in good condition and Abdullah was outraged he said and who is Abdullah he is the son of Omar and the brother-in-law of the Prophet his sister is haar was outraged and he said how dare you say such thing about me do you know what your brother your own flesh and blood do you know what your brother does when he closes the door at night do you know do you know what your brother does when he goes into his room and close the door at night what if he's praying or if he's doing something wrong so how dare you say something and compliment about something you don't know me and this is may Allah be pleased with him so we cry when we close the doors and we remember Allah and we remember our sins men do cry and this is a sign of Allah's Mercy in their heart those who do not cry they have a problem their hearts as hard as Stone and this means that Allah does not have mercy on them and that is why the prophet Alam saw alassan or Hussein they were young he held them and he kissed them one of the nomads of the bedwin was there and say huh you do this I have 10 I've never kissed one of them he's bragging about it and the prophet looked at him and said what do I have for you if Allah snatched Mercy from your heart and in another Hadith he said Allah does not have mercy upon those who do not have mercy uh uh to the people so we do cry and if we don't cry there is something wrong in us the prophet who is the strongest the closest to Allah Asel and the most fearing he cried for his son and he said that the eyes uh um let me read the translation here that the eyes are filled with tears and the heart is broken and we don't say anything that upsets Allah and by Allah for departing you ibraim we are heartbroken and we sad so this is a prophet so weeping crying is natural what's not natural is what we are going to uh get into inshah soon what's obligatory on the relatives of the deceased person so what should they do number one they should be patient tolerant and accepting Allah's uh uh decree and Allah says this in the Quran and we will surely test you with something of fear hunger and loss of wealth and lives and fruits so all of this Allah would test Us by hunger fear the loss of finan Finance money of fruits of crops all of these calamities are from Allah as a testing but give good tidings to the patient to those who accept who when disaster strikes them say indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to him we will return so the relatives of the deceased they have to be what patient they have to be patient it was reported in the authentic Hadith that the prophet Alat passed by a woman next to a grave she was crying and weeping so the prophet told heram fear Allah and anticipate for the reward once you are patient the prophet said fear Allah and anticipate for the reward if you are patient the woman while crying did not recognize the prophet Alam so she said to him go away you were not stricken by a Calamity like me go away so the prophet went after he went one of the companions said are you crazy woman this is the prophet of Allah sallallah alhi wasallam the story says that she was struck by something worse than death you know when you say something like this and then they tell you this is the prophet what how how would you feel so she immediately ran to his house she did not find any guard she went in so and said to the prophet oh prophet of Allah I am patient I am patient and the prophet said verily patience is with the first shock so those who scream and shout and bang their heads and and the wall and why me why not him and after a month alhamdulillah I accept Allah's decree this is too late it's already gone and that is why the scholars say a wise person when struck by a Calamity does exactly what a fool does after a month so a Calamity strikes now what would I do if I'm wise be patient it's done this is exactly what the fool would do but only after one month and you have to be realistic if a Calamity takes place would shouting and banging your head against the wall resolve it would complaining resolve it would anything resolve it other than going back to Allah nothing so the the wise person always it's done we have reckless drivers in Saudi Arabia I'm not doing this to intimidate you not to come come to Saudi Arabia it's a good place to come but we have reckless drivers the normal scenario if I'm driving and someone does something wrong he cuts over me in front of me and I was this close not to hit him and I break hard and and and you can hear the wheels what happens nothing I did not hit him and he did not hit me would I say alhamdulillah it could have been worse no I race behind him until I overcome an I cut in front of him and maybe hit him why he deserves it Allah saved you from accident and you running after one this shows you how foolish people can be Allah saved you from an accident now you made even worse accident and you caused it so always be grateful that a Calamity is this it could have been worse and there's a story I don't know if you have time but who cares there's a story it says that there was a king in his kingdom small Kingdom and he had a minister who would always advise him and whenever anything happened the minister would say as condoling his his King it could have been worse and the King you know the kings are yeah he didn't like this it could have been worse could have been worse the king fell sick and he was about to die and the adviser of the minister came to me and said mashallah may Allah make you become better it could have been worse and the guy is really you know in pain he looked at his advisor didn't say anything they told him that half of the treasury money is gone and and we are in debt and he's complaining the king and advisor says it could have been worse and then one day the son of the King dies and and people are coming to give their condolences to the king and the minister comes and said may Allah accept him upon the righteous and it could have been worse and he flipped the king said put him in jail and let us see what worse it can be so they uh uh put him in jail before that Subhan Allah they were on a hunting trip and while throwing a deer with with his Arrow something happened to his finger and the doctors had to amputate it so they imputated the finger and he was sad about it but the advisor said it could have been worse and then the son died so they threw him in in in in in jail few days few months few weeks allaham he sent to the adviser and he they told he told his guards see what he says when we start to hit him with flog him with with whips and lashes I want to torture him so they started you know flogging him and he said alhamdulillah it could have been worse and they told him said this guy's crazy few days few weeks later he went on a a a fishing trip the king with a new adviser and they went deep deep down following a deer until they went into the jungles and deep down in the jungles and they were lost and there was no one behind them they did not know how to go out of the Jungle and a tribe of cannibals took hold of them and wow you're invited to dinner inshallah we have two big white people excellent so they started preparing them for cooking and they started with the adviser and they threw him in this boiling water or boiling oil or Call It Whatever the meal was ready and when it came to the king they wanted to throw him they found out that he had a finger missing so the doctor or or the sorcerer or the magician told them that no no no this is not good for sacrifice throw him away he's missing a finger so they threw him away he went back to his kingdom and he was graceful to Allah asael that he did not die and he brought the adviser and he said now I know why when they chopped my finger you said it could have been worse and the and and and the adviser acknowledged but then the do the king said I have a question now I know that this could have been worse and that's why alhamd it's a blessing from Allah but when they started flogging you why did you say alhamdulillah it could have been worse the advisor said if you did not throw me in jail I would have been cooked and eaten by now so alhamdulillah throwing me in jail was a blessing from Allah this goes on on everything if you live like this W you'll be the happiest person on Earth anything that happens to you if you think of the favors of Allah upon you even if the worst happens you're always satisfied and knowing that whatever happens to me from Allah it is good and Allah does not decree anything upon us as Muslims except for our own Goods as in the Hadith we've narrated okay we move on to um one of the things that we have to do when struck by a Calamity is when we have to be patient when losing a child now theoretically speaking it's very easy now when you lose a child be patient be tolerant make have sa practically it isn't easy at all the prophet said in the Hadith Allah will put any two Muslims who have three children that die before reaching maturity the age of puberty in Paradise along with them due to his Mercy not one not two if you lose three of your own children before they reach the age of puberty some of us say what is most important for you to lose someone who's 3 years old or someone who's 20 years old what is hardest on you a three three month three years old it's close to your heart you you hug the child and you embrace it you love it you can't even go to bed without kissing it K kissing her or him three child is is something out of this world and 20 years old maybe you have 20 years old that say may Allah make it as soon as possible every day they're calling me from the police station"
