  "transcript": "and welcome back say it from India says I've heard that in one of the videos saying that making Dua After Fall prayer is an innovation this is not an accurate statement unfortunately many times people hear things and they understand what they want to understand and what sticks in their minds is what they want to understand I always pray for them alhamdulillah one day after far I was going to buy a car and I remembered after finishing the fort so I raised my hands praised Allah offered salutation upon the prophet salaam and made Dua o Allah make me successful in my endeavor no the Buddha is to maintain regularly making Dua after your fourth prayer or after your Sunnah prayer so every single fart like we see the vast majority of our brothers from the subcontinent and from Egypt and from Syria and from all over the world almost after for prayer some of them do this I don't know maybe it's a fly some of them wipe their face and bodies I don't know why but they do it they saw someone doing it and it looked hip it looked cool so they're doing it did the prophet do this I said no no no no we have never heard anything like that did the companions do it did they do it did they do it they all say no so why are you guys doing it well there's no harm in doing it come on guys you are innovating in the religion doing this after every prayer is an innovation now Saeed I'm asking you you said if I pray alone and I raise my hands and make Dua if you do it once in a blue moon no problem but between you and me nobody's listening inshallah why do you want to do Dua after fourth prayer simple answer straight question simple answer I said I want Allah to respond good answer when does Allah respond most after finishing the prayer when it's all over or during sujud in the prayer itself or before concluding the prayer with salaam alaikum definitely Institute and after salutation before the salaam to conclude the Salah this is what the prophet said again between you and me this is private nobody's listening inshallah do you think that the pride the prophet Islam would advise you of doing something which is less which is not answered by Allah only a heretic or a lunatic would say such a thing definitely the prophet would advise you the best advice so logically if you're a man of intellect if you want Allah to answer your Dua make it in Salah or make it before Salam in Salah now if you insist he said no no no no no no no I'm gonna do it after Salah and I'm gonna raise my hands and it's going to be every fourth prayer why would I care do whatever you want I can lead the horse to water the horse would walk behind me for 10 miles without complaining when we get to the water if I get 10 men to help me and assist me to make and force the horse to drink it won't drink you're not a horse so inshallah Allah will guide your heart"
