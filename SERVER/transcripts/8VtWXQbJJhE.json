  "title": "Is it permissible to work in Revolut Neobank? - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Che my question is that is it permissible to work in a Neo Bank like revolute as new banks are different than traditional Banks because it generates its Revenue through card and interchange fees subscription plans and foreign exchange and we services so will my income be Halal if I work in uh like rute I cannot judge such a bank without looking into their trans transactions the bulk transactions and income of conventional banks are from riba loans from interest based loans so no matter what other subsidiaries they have or small transactions wire transfer or um buying and selling the main job of a conventional bank is interest they give you money and they charge riba on that depending on the duration and the amount of the money and this money is not theirs it's a depositors money that they've kept with the bank and the bank is giving them a small portion of such interest so to them it's a win-win we are giving the depositors interest 1% 2% and we're charging ing those we've lent 5% 7% and the difference is profit this is totally Haram so I can't judge this institution whether it's Halal to work for or not until I look into it and Allah Knows Best"
