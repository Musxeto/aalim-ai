  "transcript": "which should be given to poor and needy should surprise him for whole one year so if I give that poor person more than 200 dollars then that will exceed 2.5 percent calculations so is it permissible to give that poor person only 2.5 the thing you heard in Islam q a was referring to what suffices a poor person for a whole year so if I were to be poor and what suffices me and my family throughout the whole year is a thousand dollars you can give me a thousand dollars or less but if you said oh I'll give the Sheikh ten thousand dollars so that I would help him start to build a house no this is not allowed this is too much you're exceeding the need of the poor and those who say I have a relative my uncle is poor so I'm giving him fifty thousand dollars to build the house wait wait this is not permissible from the zakat this is not permissible this is an Overkill you can give him what is sufficient to maintain his livelihood for a whole year paying his rent giving him food for a whole year not to make him Wealthy by giving him fifty thousand dollars to build a house now he's wealthy so this is not permissible so your understanding is wrong 250 dollars is good Azure zakat you don't have to give him more to suffice for a whole year no this is yours the cat you give it if you want to give some more no problem but if your zakatist twenty thousand dollars and he only needs three thousand dollars a year you can't give him five thousand dollars the the cat is twenty thousand you can't give him five because this is over what he needs for a whole year and I hope this makes sense"
