  "transcript": "second question was he has a shop back in India and he would like to rent or lease this shop to a beauty saloon a beauty parlor so is this permissible and the answer is if this saloon is serving only hijabi women and this in this case yes providing that they do have things in there but most likely in India it will be serving none hijabi women which means that whoever they beautify and they fix and they do their hair or their body care and many many care and whatever they call it once they go out all those looking at them would be sinful the beauty parlor would be sinful and those who rented the location would be sinful as well so the answer would be no aqui you cannot do that"
