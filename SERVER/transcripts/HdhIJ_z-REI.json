  "transcript": "our friend says I know that nothing can caught can succeed without the permission of Allah however am I supposed to continuously or consciously remind myself of this before doing or saying something for example saying a product works well without saying alhamdulillah out loud or reminding myself about Allah but giving the belief that nothing takes place without the permission of Allah the question is a little bit vague if you have the conviction that everything is successful by the will of Allah so then you don't have to say and ham did allow my car works someone says how's your car today and you say my car works fine that's good but what would it hurt you to say alhamdulillah it works fine or I'll fix your car and it should work fine with the grace of Allah there's nothing wrong and always attaching the praise of Allah or the will of Allah with whatever you are doing as long as you have this conviction in your heart saying it is rewarding insha'Allah as well"
