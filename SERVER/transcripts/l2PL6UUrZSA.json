  "transcript": "for ad from bangladesh not meg most of the food contains nutmeg should we refrain from eating it nutmeg is an issue of dispute among scholars they all agree that a large quantity of it intoxicates and some of them said that if you have a very small portion of it then this is permissible to mix with other spices and consume others say no the rule that the prophet said is whatever intoxicates in large quantities then small quantities is prohibited and it is an intoxicant therefore other group of scholars said it's totally prohibited to consume so what's the ruling if you know for certain that these people are using it you must not eat from it this is what i'm inclined to this is the opinion i follow and if you're not sure you're not obliged to ask because they're muslims and the default that muslims don't use haram the default so you don't have to ask but if you were to know then you must refrain"
