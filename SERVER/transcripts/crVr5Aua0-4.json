  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord I'm not bad chapter 97 deals with the supplication upon entering a town or Village Etc this supplication whenever the prophet Allah was about to enter a new city town or Village the prophet used to say this is [Music] foreign foreign lord of the seven heavens and all that they envelop lord of the seven Earths and all that they carry so this is evidence that there are seven Earths lord of the devils and all whom they misguide lord of the Winds and all whom they whisk away I ask you for the goodness of this Village the goodness of its inhabitants and for all the goodness found within it and I take refuge with you from the evil of this Village the evil of its inhabitants and from all the evil found within it how was the heart of the Prophet Salaam connected so strongly with Allah this is the difference between a messenger a prophet someone who knows Allah and between us who are ignorant who are far away from asking Allah for support from far away from expressing our need in every breath we take and every step we make for Allah's guidance and protection for us chapter 98 this is not regarding entering a village or a town but rather entering the marketplace Hadith number 209 this Dua is for us to say before we enter a Marketplace and some Scholars said that the marketplace is different than a mall than a normal shop it is where people bid and auction things and they would fight 500 no no I'll take it for 5.50 no I'll take it for 600 and they start to dispute and raise their voices and some say no it's any any place where selling and buying takes place so what is the Dua Allah none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise he gives life and causes death and he is living and does not die in his hand is all good and he is over all things omnipotent beautiful Dua the reward is unbelievable one million Good Deeds if you say it it raises 1 million cents something that blows your mind away but Allah is capable of it so can you say it before entering a market a lot of the people fail to do this unfortunately because their not always concentrating and they are unfortunately sometimes negligent of remembering Allah chapter 99 supplication for when the mounted animal or means of transportation stumbles so what to say when something bad happens to your right very simple you say Bismillah why would I say that because I need Allah's protection and guidance to fix my car to fix my right to fix my animal that I'm riding instead of cursing it because this happened at the time of the Prophet Isa sermon one of the companions cursed the animal that he was riding and the prophet said Allah Dismount leave that animal such an animal that is cursed cannot accompany us so instead of saying such a word rather use this beautiful phrase Bismillah and this would Rectify your affairs the following chapter supplication of the traveler for the resident so if I'm traveling and I'm bidding my family my friends my relatives farewell what should I say I place you in the trust of Allah whose trust is never misplaced so if I put you in the trust of Allah I know that when I come back I'll find you safe and sound but what should they say to me before I sat on my journey Hadith 212. they say they should say to you Allah I place your religion meaning I entrust your religion your faith or your faithfulness or your being trustworthy a Mana and the ends of your Deeds the conclusion of your Deeds I entrust all of this in the trust of Allah the Almighty so when they say this to me I'm a traveler they say that I hope that you come with your religion intact I hope that you come with your faithfulness intact and I hope that Allah if he were to conclude your life that he would conclude your life with good deeds to end your life by and this would be the perfect dawa for uh any of us what else you can also say to a traveler before he sets on his journey as per the Hadith may Allah endow you with taqwa the weather may Allah make taqwa righteousness be as if you're taking food with you as if you're taking your drink with you which you need on your travel be this with you from Allah azzawajal forgive your sins and facilitate all good for you wherever you be and again this puts confidence and encourages someone who's traveling to trust Allah azzawajal and that everything would be as he hopes for this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave here [Music]"
