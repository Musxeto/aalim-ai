  "title": "Using nail polish during menses",
  "transcript": "says that can a woman who is on her menses paint her nail to adorn herself for her husband also I heard from few sisters that if we die while having nail varnish on our nails it won't come off as the blood stops in our body I have never heard such a claim that your nail polish has anything to do with your bloodstream anyhow it is totally permissible for a woman in her menses to wear nail polish without any problem if this pleases her husband or even if she wants to adorn herself through this fashion because she is not required to perform neither Woodill or to move it unless of course she will have strangers looking at her so nun mahomes she is definitely not allowed to show them her nail polish and whether it has something to do with her death or not no this is not applicable at all and there is nothing wrong in that insha'Allah"
