  "transcript": "to accept it Abdullah has a question he says when giving talaq to the wife does it have to be in Arabic now talaq means divorce and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars is marriage which is an Islamic thing and divorce which is also an Islamic thing do they have to be in Arabic some schools have thought restrict the validity of the marriage to two words so if you say it in any other language this is not acceptable if you say it in Arabic but other than these two words this is not acceptable the most authentic opinion is that marriage and divorce take place in any language a person use it as long as he intended it because as you know divorce is divided into two types direct and indirect so if someone says to his wife I divorce you or you are divorced the divorce takes place and this is direct but if he says life is unbearable with you and I hate living with you this is over go to your family's house now this is over go to your family's house he's in direct we have to ask him about his intention so to make a long story short this is not a topic divorce can take place in any language as long as the husband intended it so if he says it in Urdu in English in French and he intended it this takes place likewise marriage if someone says to the boy who's proposing to his daughter I give you my daughter in marriage I give you he did not say I marry her to you or even Ankara in Arabic he says I give you and the boy says okay or um euron or I accept all of this does the job inshaallah"
