  "title": "Is washing hands before wudu, sunnah? Washing arms from finger tips. Brief description of wudu Assim",
  "transcript": "from qatar says i have a confusion in regards of washing the hands with the arms the reason of your confusion sad is that we know from the description of the wudo of the prophet assalam that he used to wash his hand three times then turn the water and rinse his nose and mouth and wash his face three times then wash his arms to the elbows three times etcetera now the eye and the quran allah started in the quran by saying when you are to pray you have to perform mudu by washing your face then washing your arms to the elbows allah did not mention washing your hands three times this is why scholars said that washing the hands three times in the beginning is a sunnah is not part of wudu so if you skip it if you immediately just go turn on the faucet wash your face and rinse your mouth and nose your ruler is valid now when we come to washing the arms to the elbows the arm begins from the hands saying that i washed my hands earlier does not work here why because one of the pillars of wudu is the sequence i cannot wash my feet then wash my face i have to follow the sequence face arms head feet if i miss the placement of these four pillars my wudu is invalid therefore washing the hands in the beginning is not part of the water it's a sunnah it's for cleanliness washing the face is number one then washing the arms to the elbows which includes your hands fingers and uh the the whole thing from the tip of your fingers to your elbows and i hope this answers your questions"
