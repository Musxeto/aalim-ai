  "title": "Using toilet paper to clean oneself after urinating or defecating - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hasson says if I only use tissues after urinating will it be enough in my office it is a little bit difficult to approach for water so by only using toilet paper can i beautify myself when people answer the call of nature is it is either a number one or number two so you either urinate or you difficut and the means of purity in Islam it is essential and part of a religion in Sahay Halima Muslim the Jews came to said man a Pharisee may Allah be pleased with him and they were mocking Islam and they were saying to him you teach your your prophet had taught you everything even how to take a crap how to defecate Salman was not angered by this this is a Medal of Honor you're putting on my chest he proudly said yes the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam ordered us not to face or give our backs to the Qibla to the Kaaba when we are answering the call of nature and not to hold our privates private parts or to wipe or clean our private parts with our right hand and not to use less than three stones and he was referring to dry wiping because when you defecate or urinate you have two means of purifying yourself and this is a must Muslims have to do this it's not something you do like some other religions once every week they wash themselves or something that is disgusting but the Muslims every single time they go to the toilet they have to purify themselves with one of two ways one is East India and this is the finest and the best and that is to wash your private parts from this impurity until it's clean and the second one is called a stage Mar and this is using dry substances such as stones [Music] toilet paper tissues a piece of cloth etc that can purify the area where this impurity had exited from and this is totally legit so if you are in an area where you have no water no access to water or even if you have access to water but you don't find it convenient to use water so you decide instead to use toilet paper this is totally legit but it has to be a minimum of three wipes and the more you do it it has to be in odd numbers so either three or five or seven or nine until the area is purified and you feel that there is nothing out coming anymore and it is clean so this is totally legit the best of course is to use toilet paper and follow that by washing it and you can always bring a small bottle of water with you to the toilet and there is nothing wrong in that insha'Allah"
