  "title": "How to curb your Sexual Desire if you cannot marry? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says how can I reduce my sexual desire to the lowest level I think of it a lot and it's affecting me I know the prophet sallallaahu Selim recommended fasting but I have ulcer so the doctor advised me not to fast often and I am not married yet what can I do please you don't put me in a corner and ask me to find a way out for you you have to improvise the Prophet told the Celestra to surround all people who the youth whoever has the ability to get married must get married so you're telling me I cannot get married this is problem number one maybe you can get married but you're putting hurdles of your own so you can get married to someone who's fifteen or twenty years older than you they would accept you you can get married to someone who is not as to the level of your standards in beauty or wealth but again this would protect you from falling into Haram so you can think of solutions if you're unable to marry at all then you have to fast simple as that you say I cannot fast all the time they didn't do not recommend you to fast often okay then don't fast often but fast every now and then this reduces your sexual drive and most importantly you have to lower your gaze you wouldn't have any problem if you did not watch movies TV series what's up YouTube social media Instagram snapchat etc but the more addictive you are the more addicted you are to these forms of media the more tempted you are to fall into sin so you have to if you're sincere cut all these means take out the internet from your home take out the TV set all together and lower your gaze whenever you out do not mix with females do not just sit there and enjoy the scene because this is how Shaitaan comes and creeps into your heart this is how he infiltrates your defense system because you've opened all means to be invaded and you're inviting him in so once you do this insha'Allah you would find it easy to counter-attack with the grace of Allah"
