  "transcript": "can a person do tawa yes so is it permissible for people to do tawaf which is an independent voluntary ritual during umrah or hajj where you go and circle the kaaba seven times can we do it on behalf of others the most authentic opinion is that this is not permissible you are entitled to make rumrah which is a combination of and sai on behalf of deceased or those who are totally unable to come and you can do hajj but you cannot divide these rituals or segment them and do a few bits and pieces on behalf of others tawaf you can do it voluntary on behalf of yourself as many times as you wish but not on behalf of others and allah knows best"
