  "title": "How is it fair people living in Makkah Madinah get to pray in Haram & get 100,000 1000 more rewards",
  "transcript": "um sh we know that the the word foraying um are considered better than performing 1,000 prayers and praying in Masjid Haram is 100,000 times better in than in any other mid I'm curious about the way this reward system applies to individuals living near these um sacred places who have the opportunity to pray there regularly compared to those living farther away or in different countries um so I wanted to know how can Muslims living in different countries or further way maximize their reward for prayers well the only way they can do that is to shift to meca and Medina very simple this is a reward set by Allah as an incentive for those who live in such a beautiful city as Mecca or medina and those who live elsewhere are definitely deprived from such a reward this is Allah's favor and blessing upon people I don't have the luxury of saying how can I enjoy the beautiful weather of uh this country or that in Europe during springtime when it's boiling hot where I live this is Allah's favor and blessing upon people he Awards Those whom he Wills with what he wants living in Mecca and Medina is is not easy there's a lot of hardship involved especially for those who may run businesses and they have to travel all the time and they need to be in a sort of a hub to be able to go all over the world for their meetings and and and the likes so they may find it difficult there are no quote unquote international schools like those in jeda or in Riyad or elsewhere there are so many things that these cities May lack other than spirituality so you want to compromise all of this because you want 100,000 prayers per prayer or a thousand prayer per prayer shift and move if you can if you can't then this is Allah's favors and blessing upon the people it's like saying okay millionaires and billionaires who give in charity and zakat how can we reach their level in the money they give in charity which we cannot afford this is Allah's favors and blessing Allah knows rest"
