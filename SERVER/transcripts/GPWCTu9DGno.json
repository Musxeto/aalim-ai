  "transcript": "tribe says how to get rid of us about islam i have been having a lot of counseling sessions alhamdulillah with muslims from all over the world complaining of uswas and the common denominator in all their cases is that it is obvious that satan is messing with their minds and all of them not most of them all of them with the grace of allah say that we cannot utter these things which by itself is a sign of strongly man so how to fight these usuals one of the best ways of fighting it is knowledge you see shaytan does not mess with people who have knowledge because it's difficult for him he can play with people without knowledge like children play with the football so he uses them he manipulates them he does different things and they are trapped they don't know what to say what to do the moment they call someone who's knowledgeable and ask him he cascades to them in steps what to do and how does and how satan works and they immediately are able to see and subhanallah this is this exact meaning of the ayah at the end of chapter 7 is even the righteous even the most pious people they get tempted by shaytan they get whispers of shaytaan but the difference is that they immediately remember after the afterwards they remember allah azzawajal they rely on the knowledge they have to fight this menace so immediately they are able to visualize they're able to see for either mobile they see what's right and what's wrong and they can defeat satan with that so in order for you to get rid of the whispers of shaytan you need first to learn your religion you need to read more quran you need to sit with with scholars ask them not about yourself never ever go to a shaykh and say i had a thought why why islam why no this would be exposing your sin rather say to the sheikh a friend of mine had whispers and he asked me to ask what's the ruling on thinking like so and so and so so the sheikh would address it as if it's someone else as if it's a third party not you asking him and allah knows best"
