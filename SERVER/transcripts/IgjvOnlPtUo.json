  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting felt like a good in lighting this day is all right as the first time I wasted night with family around a nice meal we're making doing a nice film how nice it is to be so near to those I love foreign and welcome to this new episode of Virtues of fasting where we are discussing the chapter of fasting from the book which was compiled by half of them may Allah have mercy on his soul and today we will take Hadith number 14. Hadith number 14 was reported by Abu hurrayal was narrated by Abu hurairam may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever does not give up forged speech and evil actions and does not abandon foolishness Allah is not in need of his living food and drink that is Allah will not accept his fasting and this was reported by al-bukhari and other books this Hadith the Hadith of Allah be pleased with him and we all know that is one of the companions that narrated a lot of hadiths about the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam though he accepted Islam on the seventh year of Hijra meaning that he was only about four years in the company of the Prophet Allah nevertheless he was the most among them to memorize and to narrate hadiths from the prophet uh may Allah be pleased with him in this Hadith the prophet Allah is telling us that whoever does not abandon forged speech or false testimony and acting upon it and doing foolish things in this case Allah has no need for him to leave his food and drink now the Hadith States is the origin of and we always hear this term before Islam it's called era the time of ignorance so jahel means ignorance however the prophet Allah is highlighting three things saying Azure and Zur is anything that's false anything that is forged and not original and that is why when someone forges something we say that he made a teslier and also when you make something beautiful and you would like to present it this is also forging what you're going to present so the prophet is telling us that he who does not abandon false testimony or forged speech what kind of Forge speech are we referring to well any for Forge a speech or false speech or testimony would do so if I go to court and the judge asks me is this man's mother alive and I don't know I've never seen him before and he said yes she is alive sir this is forged testimony false testimony if I go and testify that this person took a hundred thousand from this person and I did not witness anything for that I just took his word for granted or I hate this person so I'm gonna make such a false testimony in court under oath well this is what is meant by false testimony and there are so many illustrations for it and it is one of the major sins in Islam the prophet said Allah to his companions once shall I tell you about the most major sins and they said yes prophet of Allah so the prophet said first of all associating others with Allah this is the most major sin the cardinal sin as they say if you associate others with Allah or you commit an act of blasphemy or you deny the existence of Allah like atheists this is the most horrible sin that is Unforgiven Allah does not forgive it if you die like this unless you repent before your death then he said being disobedient and disrespectful to your parents and we always find in the Quran Allah joining between obeying and and respecting the parents with monotheism with tawheed Allah has ruled that you shall not worship other than him and that you be kind to your parents and the prophet was leaning over an a couch or something like that or a pillow and he said and when he came to the third point he stood up straight and said and the testimony that is based on falsehood and forged speech and he kept repeating it again and again and again to emphasize its danger to highlight that it is one of the major sins in Islam and this shows you the gravity and the seriousness of such a sin because people take your word for granted and you go and testify falsely you can lead to so many things you can lead to the execution of an innocent person so two people come and they falsely accuse another of killing someone and their testimony is accepted at court and the guy would be headed he would be beheaded he was anything he is innocent and Allah will admit him to Paradise because of that but the perpetrators the people the the real criminals are are those who testified falsely of such a thing so the prophet says does not leave who does not abandon who does not give up forged speech and evil actions the Hadith is the speech of falsehood and the actions based on falsehood as well and this includes all types of sin because such actions are rejected by Allah even when you're not fasting so when you're fasting it is even worse so people who fornicate people who indulge in useless talk they curse they abuse they watch Haram things they listen to Haram things they embezzle they take money without any right of taking it they deprive people from their own legitimate rights and they claim that they're fasting all of this is unacceptable by Allah azzawajal and this is part of the false actions a person does and then the prophet says is not the opposite of knowledge rather al-jahil here means foolishness carelessness doing things that are irrational so the prophet is highlighting these three aspects one not to say anything that is a lie not to testify in falsehood two not to act upon anything that is Haram or do anything that is Haram and thirdly which is more highlighted that you do not commit any Act of transgression you do not harm others you do not abuse others and if you look at the these things you would find partly one of the virtues of fasting because unlike other forms of worship fasting you are not ordered to do something like prayer for example your order to pray so you have to actually go and pray giving zakat you have to reach out and take money and give it to the poor performing Hajj you have to wear your uh and go to the holy shrines and do your rituals there in fasting actually you're not in order to do anything the thing that you ordered to do is not to do not to eat not to drink and not to have legitimate in halal sexual relationships that's it so Allah is telling you to refrain to stay away not to do something and usually staying away from something is easier than doing something so if someone tells you stay where you are for half an hour this is far easier than telling you to climb up a mountain for half an hour although the duration is the same yet the effort is definitely not the same and therefore fasting is a form of worship that Allah only rewards for Allah only rewards for because it is a sign of sincerity no one knows if I'm fasting or not because if I close the door I could eat I could drink I could do whatever I want and that is why if you look at some aspects of religion you'll find that when you're told not to do anything it should be the easiest thing around for example men are ordered not to shave one says yeah they're ordered to grow their beads well actually you don't have any doing in growing the beards can can you someone says okay I'm gonna grow my bead half a meter longer no but what you do actually is that you refrain from cutting it short or even shaving it and this is not doing anything yet you will find people still insisting on this sin and they shave every single morning and imagine if it was mentioned in the Quran oh you who believe you have to shave your beards every morning would the people comply no they wouldn't you would find millions of Muslims who are far away from the Quran and Sunnah complaining and saying what is this every single morning I have to get the Shaving foam and the After Shave lotion and the raises the three blades or the six blades or whatever and shave my beard every single morning this is too much takes time A lot of time and and I don't need this I need to be free yet when Allah tells you be free and don't touch it you still find people insisting on shaving it going against the fitra going against the human nature going against the instruction of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam now in the Hadith the prophet tells us that the essence of fasting is to refrain from originally what is permissible so when I fast I actually don't eat and drink halal food Halal water I refrain from doing these things because Allah is testing my obedience and submission and I am refraining from Halal stuff my wife I cannot get close to her why because I'm fasting after fasting is okay so if Allah makes Halal things upon you during the month of Ramadan while fasting Haram to consume then by default the originally Haram things such as false testimony and false actions and things that are considered to be foolish and abusive if these things are Haram elsewhere on Ramadan they are even more Haram and that is why we always have to look at the essence what does Allah want from us so Allah wants us to reach the level of piety attackwa and that is why he instructed us to fast the month of Ramadan like it was prescribed to those before us so that we may reach the level of piety and the level of taqwa but if a person fails to do this then Allah does not want him to starve himself or to be thirsty if he is not already doing what Allah is ordering him to do and to refrain from these major sins but what about if a person does say false things forged speech act upon it and does foolishness is his fasting accepted a group of Scholars said no he has nullified his fasting and the most authentic opinion is that the fasting is intact but there is no reward for him and depending on the gravity and the seriousness of the sins he had done and I will tell you a rule how to know when it nullifies a form of worship and when it doesn't but before that imagine this Ramadan to be a training course imagine Ramadan to be a boot camp where people go condition themselves for 30 days without end Masha Allah refrain from Halal stuff from food from drinking from legitimate sexual relationships with their spouses and of course by default refrain themselves from indulging in Haram in sins in false testimony in foolishness and in transgression if they manage to do this for 30 days how would their lives be after Ramadan is over it would be a huge transformation to the best to the better a positive transformation I remember one of my friends and he was telling me that subhanallah Ramadan is something that is blessed he says that I'm sinful I listen to music whenever I get into my car but since I started to fast Mondays and Thursdays since I started to be practicing in Ramadan I've noticed that after Ramadan is over it takes me like five to six months without me listening to music on in my car why is that he says because during the month of Ramadan every time I get into my car and I try to listen to something that is Haram I remember that I'm fasting so I refrain and after 30 days of not doing this I discovered that I don't need to do this and I'm getting energy and power by fighting my whims and desires and by fighting shaytan so he says that alhamdulillah now I don't listen to music anymore and this is one of the benefits of uh fasting now if someone does something Haram in a form of worship does this Haram thing nullify his worship or not we have to look at the thing that he had committed the Haram thing if it is related to the form of worship and it's considered prohibited because of it then it nullifies it and if not then it doesn't so for example is backbiting prohibited or halal everyone knows that backbiting or riba is Haram no one doubts this so what happens if a person while in the state of fasting he back bites and he Slanders A co-worker or his boss or his neighbor or anyone is his fasting intact or should we say that because he committed this major sin then his fasting is void we look at backbiting itself as a sin as a major sin was it prohibited because of fasting or it is prohibited throughout the whole year the answer is it is prohibited throughout the whole year in this case it doesn't nullify the fasting it reduces a reward this is correct but it does not nullify it likewise if a person is praying and while in his prayer their passes a beautiful woman in front of him a little bit far away of course from his Sutra and he looks at the woman and he stares at the woman enjoying what he sees does this nullify his fasting we ask the same question is lowering the Gaze or actually is sending your gaze prohibited in Salat or also outside of the Salat the answer it's prohibited also outside of the Salat in this case it does not nullify the Salah the prayer is valid and you can go on and on with this so false testimony forged actions and acting upon that this falls under the category which is prohibited throughout the entire time the whole year not when only a person is fasting and therefore it does not affect his fasting from the Hadith we learn that the amount of sin increases in times of ibada so false testimony is Haram if you're not fasting but if you're fasting it is even worse it becomes more Haram and it's like the Blessed times have greater influence and impact whether you do sins or good deeds in them likewise the favored and blessed locations so sinning and and doing and committing a sin in Mecca is not like committing a sin in Judah of course this is the Haram this is the sanctuary so if you do a sin over there it is far greater than doing it elsewhere the foolishness we see from people in Saudi Arabia I don't know elsewhere I know I know that it exists in Egypt and Morocco and people tend to be so agitated so hype so they are waiting for someone to light the fuse to begin a fight and they always blame Ramadan mom because I'm fasting I I forgive me I'm sorry I lost my temper but you don't find this elsewhere you don't find this in the states for example or UK or Europe or in other Muslim countries why is that this is not because of fasting this is something that we pretend that it is related to fasting when it isn't it is due to the lack of order and law when I go to the UK I drive exactly like the people drive there I stand in my cues and wait patiently for hours until I get my turn I never enter a a square or whatever they call it and always give the right of way to those who are inside the square or the roundabout when I come back home it's a totally different ball game I become vicious and angry when I am just about to enter around about I don't care about who's inside I've got the bigger truck I have the bigger car so I go in and everybody is intimidated and Afraid and they give me the right of way I don't care about others I don't care about the way they drive it's me it's my way or the highway why is that because we are not disciplined because there is no law in order to be followed if you're not a wolf you'll be eaten by wolves but when you are outside and law is respected and implemented everybody is equal so they all respect the law now you have no excuse to engage in a fight or to curse others or to be abusive or to do anything that is forged or false whether saying or acting upon it you have no right because the prophet told you that this would almost nullify your fasting so will you go today in the afternoon you want to buy some fool this is Arabic a traditional dish that a lot of the families consume go and watch how people behave and they claim to be fasting see how many fights happen in front of you among Muslims who are supposed to be fasting it is prohibited for them to fight other than Ramadan what about in Ramadan it's even worse so the sins are even greater when you're fasting they are greater when you are in the month of Ramadan because your observance of Allah should be greater as well there are so many benefits of fasting so one does not limit the benefits of fasting to not eating not drinking these are just part of the tests you know that there are three types of patients in Islam patience on doing good deeds patience on staying away from sins and patience on Allah's calamities and testing upon you and all of these three are gathered in fasting so your patience on doing good deeds you're being patient on fasting there's a pillar of Islam patience from doing bad Deeds because you refrain from false testimonies and acting upon it and transgression and foolishness Etc and patience on Allah's calamities is when you feel the urge or the need to eat and drink when you feel the thirst and the hunger this calls for patience and tolerance and Allah would reward you for all of these three so what are the benefits of fasting other than this Scholars say that through fasting you realize and feel the favors and blessings of Allah azzawajal see without Darkness you could never appreciate light without illness you can never appreciate Health without poverty you would never appreciate wealth and some would say without Satan you would not be able to appreciate Iman and the conviction and the belief in Allah therefore when you fast you feel the favors and blessings of Allah upon you also you remember the impoverished and the ones who are in need those who are left alone without anyone to help them or to feed them or to shelter them so when you feel the hunger when you feel The Thirst you remember those who are not lucky as you are to break their fast but their fast may go on for days or weeks or months without finding proper food also fasting helps in narrowing the arteries in the sense that shaytan travels in our bloodstream which means that he has access to us more than anything else but when we fast his powers demilish and they diminish in the sense that they go so small and we have more control over him and that is why when someone is Angry Angry he is requested to make wudu because this extinguishes the fire and Satan is made of fire it makes him cool down a bit and also fasting encourages people to do more Good Deeds forms of worship and to reach the level of piety because this is the essence of fasting fasting also helps those who are unable to get married to be patient so many people are complaining we don't find the financial means to get married and we have this a sex drive we have this urge which is natural so can we do masturbation can we indulge in Haram activities and the answer is no definitely however the prophet gave you the solution when he said that if you are able to get married then you should fast because fasting helps you lower your gauge lower your gaze and it helps you refrain from forbidden relationships and protects your chastity we have a short break and afterwards we will pick up your calls and answer your queries with the grace of Allah so stay tuned first caller from Saudi Arabia formation of my if you say no then also I have I can keep okay my second question is my elder sister she is in India I have my account there I told her to give sadaka daily for my account from my account to the poor people like till uh full Ramadan I want to know this amount will which is already set to sadaka this amount can be given as zaka also okay and third question one more last question sir yesterday you said that that pictures drawing pictures is Haram but what about in the cases when it comes about studies like especially science subject children will be given to draw they will tell them the teachers will be tell them to to draw the pictures and many questions in the exam it will come drawing questions so what is your opinion in this I will answer inshallah okay Sameer from Saudi Samir or semri yes sometimes Trail on the road and on the footpath and on the floor so I think that's just something that's on it so can we pray I mean we don't know what exactly is getting on it and then they dry up and everything so can we pray in those or not and the second question is um I read that you should not like after finishing your unit of prayers it should not directly start another unit should pay something or move from away from that place so between the natural prayers is there something we should say or just the Subhan Allah something like that okay I will answer inshallah right you're welcome suddin from Saudi Allah first I have two to three questions the first question concerns about our brothers in the northern hemisphere I want to know the ruling of uh Brothers Ramadan in the father's not I want to know the reason of Islam concerning it that's the first question then the second question concerns me I've gone for umrah before by playing from um I went I passed through the me court and I prayed in master Elisha but concerning your um ruling yesterday you said somebody that that didn't go to toi but indeed is because in most of the Ikea has to do some respiration by extracting Iran what about me that I have done it before is there any induction concerning that okay then the third one is if if a chance if I'm going for umrah again do I can I take my bus from home I'll have to get to the airport before taking the bath okay hope you understood all my questions inshallah okay thank you so much you're welcome from Saudi um that Allah releases Souls from uh hell in the month of this Ramadan so how the souls are there in the hell when the uh this uh final judgment is not done final hour has not come across okay just which souls are these cells thank you very much says that in fasting the month of the six days after Ramadan Now do women need the permission of their husbands well we have to look at the the evidence the prophet said it is not permissible for a woman to fast in the presence of her husband without his permission the consensus of scholar is that this is only to voluntary fasting but if it's an oath or an expiation or Ramadan making it up in this case it you do not require the husband's permission so the six days of shawar are they voluntary or mandatory the answer is definitely voluntary in this case the uh the permission of the husband must be sought otherwise if he doesn't approve then you do not fast it Amber from Saudi Allah yes The Rook here when do we do it what is Rukia second question is when we are to taravi or uh do we say a prescribed Dua before it and then in every uh raka like to and to uh do we have to say Sana before Surah Fatiha now I didn't understand the first point what do you mean which are you referring to no no no no no the second question uh uh what before before starting the Salah yeah yeah no no there isn't anything there's no door no no no no no you just go ahead and pray okay so do we say Sana before Fatiha in every uh raka for taravi yeah you mean the inauguration Dua okay I will answer this question and the third question is uh what is the best of the four madhub that we have humble in Shafi and all that you recommend I will answer your question we have om Sarat from Saudi and he unfortunately does not earn so much so his amount is growing and growing out of my zakat can I pay his debt is it um am I allowed to do that or is it just from sadika that I do it okay I will answer your question thank you very much you're welcome uh farida we have farida I think from Saudi or from Saudi yes yes farida yes what can I do for you Shake I just want to ask three questions I need your help and advice okay can I take medications to avoid my monthly period so I can continue My fasting that is my number one question and my number two question is I am fasting but then suddenly I have both bleeds at early morning so it will not wipe my fast you you have what nose bleeding nose bleeding okay yes Jake but in my third question Jake is I am engaged but my fiance are addicted to drugs and we have planned to get married on December he is also not a I'm not praying

you're welcome so uh um abdulrahman says that she has an account in India and she tells her sister to give sadaka from that account can she consider this money given as zakat no if you say to her give it to charity this is Charity if you intend it to be the cat and you tell her that give this to only to the poor or the needy and you intend it to be from the zakat before it's given then this is the cat but if it's after it's given you change your uh intention this is not uh accepted from Saudi foreign and to you as well may Allah bless the entire team of food I mean I mean Sheikh I have two questions okay first of all like we all know that for the Jamaica prayer after the Surah father is over Imam gives a pause for the Surah we have to recite Surah Fatiha right now so the first question is like if the pause is very short and if the Imam immediately starts with Surah in that case what should we do we should stop the Surah Fatiha or we should listen to the recitation of the Imam second question second question is like during the therapy and there is hardly no problem same thing so in that case what should we shall we recite the Surah Fatiha or we should just listen to the Imam okay I will answer the question yes I'm married from past few four five years four years and we don't have kids we are going through a very tough times and we have lot of complications I request you please pray for me I will inshallah I will inshallah I mean Kimberly from Jordan hello I have two questions for you my first question I on the first day of Ramadan I am a revert Muslim and so this is my first official Ramadan and the first day I became very um Angry uh had arguments with my husband and then I also was feeling very weak and it also I drank water and broke my fast um I completed my fast from there but I'm not sure what I need to do uh to to fix the the fast because it was the first day of Ramadan okay second question and my second question is uh not related to Ramadan but my mother she is in the United States and she does not accept that I am a Muslim and so she refuses to have any kind of relations with me due to this and she said that she will not have anything to do with me unless I stop being Muslim so I I keep reading in the Quran that it says You must keep your kin very close in relation so I'm not sure what to do with this okay I'll ask you a question inshallah okay from Saudi yes uh I want to ask this question to uh Sheriff that in Memphis in periods can I read Quran uh from the Musa by wearing the gloves or I can read by catching any uh cloth or like that and in Ramadan how much time is there for tarabi like till Fajr the time is or we have to pray after 20 records even that the hajjut prayer also I want to ask these questions okay I will answer your questions inshaallah I think we will take a short pause to answer these questions and then continue to take your questions unless we have something that is long distance then we will take it so that we would not make the brothers or sisters lose money over the phone bill um she says that at school they make our children draw and they have to answer questions and tests maybe exams and well this is not the norm yet they will you will not have a drawing a subject that you have to keep on drawing living things you have to make this clear to the management to the school and your child that you there is no compromise in religion it is totally prohibited you can draw the head of the body from the head down but you cannot have a full sculpture with the head and the body and that is why my best smell of peace with him when someone told him that this is my living this is where I make my uh uh bread and butter so he said this is totally prohibited if you must then remove the head so it would become like a statue without a head like a tree so this is permissible so if your kids are ordered to draw something they should not have the head when they draw so the body is halal for them Samra from Saudi Arabia says that um something about walking on the streets and something that is dried up so preying on it the default is everything you see is pure is unless proven otherwise because if you open the door for doubts and speculations you will go insane and this is why we have so many OCD patients obsessive compulsive disorder they think that everything is not pure so one of them throws his a piece of cloth in the washing machine it has it had some impurities then he starts thinking okay is the basket now impure they put some clothes in and did not wash it so did these clothes become impure I sat on the bed other bed sheets are impure and it goes on until someone gets really insane so whatever you are and you see dried up things and you don't know whether these are feces or not and there is no smell of feces and or anything that is impure then the default is it is pure you can prey on it she says that what's ruling on not connecting between voluntary prayers there's no rulings I finished turakas of tarawi I stand up for the other two rakas the prohibition is when you're praying in congregation and you finish your mandatory congregational prayer and you stand up to pray Sunnah this is not permissible the prophet saws said do not join between such prayers until you move somewhere else from the Masjid in the Masjid or you speak so you greet the one next to you and what's the time everything is fine and then you pray so people and yourself would know that this is not connected to the mandatory prayer but between voluntary prayers the there's no such restriction says he would like to know how would the people in up north uh fast like anybody else as long as they have the day and night in one day even if the night is one hour long and the day is 23 hours long they have to fast the daytime but if they have like few months total darkness no son or total daylight you can see the sun throughout the whole day and the following day and the following week and there's no night time in this case they should look at the closest country to them up south or down south where they have night and day and they should break their fast with them and they should start to fast with them second question is that he previously took Umbra from not taking it from the mirkat you have to give the Expedition so you have to slaughter a sheep whether it's one Umbra or five umbras then five sheep if you performed a Haram other from your mirkat you have to slaughter a sheep for every Umbra in the past his third question is do I have to make my rushul foreign before I reach the airport or after I reach airport the Russian is voluntary highly recommended so if a person is traveling to Jeddah Airport from let's say the mom Riyadh Cairo Jordan whatever and he doesn't take Russell at all and on the plane he changes and where's his Haram and just before flying over the meerkat he says this is okay but it's highly recommended to make your Russell so if someone makes his Russell from the house and he wears the haramba does not make the intention until he reaches the mechat this is Allah says there is a phrase it's part of the Hadith that every night Allah has people being saved from uh and or set free from Hellfire he says but we know that there aren't any people in Hellfire at the moment because the day of judgment is not due this can have a number of interpretations and the most likely is that Allah sets by his Divine decree people out and away from hell so we know that I'm supposed to go to hell may Allah forbid but Allah on tonight's Ramadan on this night of Ramadan sets a number of people free from hell and he chooses that I am one of them and I'm still living so I will live and I will do some righteous deeds and Allah would make me successful in doing what pleases him so when I die I am saved from Hell Fire so this is one of the interpretations Amber says what is a set of invocations of supplications usually verses of the Quran or from the prophetic sayings that we say and sometimes blow over a person who is sick or afflicted by magic or evil eye or has Jinn in him possessed by Jinn so this is form of seeking our means of healing through the Quran and the Sunnah through invoking Allah she says what is the ruling on saying the inauguration supplication in Salah this is Sunnah so if you say Allah and you start with the Fatiha straight away there is no problem in that and she says what is the best of the four schools of thought there isn't such a thing as what is the best they're all good and they're all authentic and reliable and trustworthy but of course they are considered to be uh uh human and man-made so there is a margin of error and most of them have 80 percent authentic and reliable and up to uh in accordance to the Quran Sunnah and twenty percent that is man-made errors human error so they're all good and you should yeah not if some of them are excellent in forms of worship but not so and so in with transactions some of them is excellent in transactions but not so and so in forms of worship authenticity wise or uh yeah any sort of these things umsad says that um her brother I think I forgot her brother has a lot of debts on his credit card and it's all interest based and she says can I give him from the zakat the answer is no this is a major sin and he indulged himself and made your sin and you want to give him from the zakat no give it to someone who is needy or poor because this person has put himself in such a position farida says that what's certainly not taking medication to stop the monthly period so that she could fast and pray and maybe go for Hajj and umrah the answer if it is not harmful for you medically it is okay she says does nose bleeding affect my fasting the answer is no she says that my fiancee is a drug addict and he doesn't pray so what is my advice I ask her is she is she a Muslim if she is a Muslim how would she get engaged to someone who does not pray anyone who does not pray is not a Muslim he's a kafir so even if you get married to him your marriage is void and you're committing an act of fornication so definitely dump this a a person because he's bad news he's he's not even worthy of of being related to you or to your family dump him forget him completely a drug addict and doesn't pray what uses he to you unless he's a drug dealer and he's Rich maybe this is why you may consider him but Haram for you as a Muslim to consider such a person namreen from where she says that usually um the Imam does not leave a pause between Fatiha and the Surah afterwards and I say that this is the Sunnah whoever does this he is a knowledgeable Imam because those who make a pause after and he makes a pause enough for the people to recite the Fatiha he is committing an innovation the prophet never had this pause so we shouldn't have this post so what to do the most authentic opinion that in loud prayers or loud rakas reciting in the Fatiha for the follower is not mandatory it is recommended but it is not mandatory so if you skip it and you uh suffice Yourself by only listening to the imam's recitation this is sufficient and finally she says for four or five years she and her husband were not blessed yet by Offspring so she wants me to make Dua I pray to Allah the almighty in this blessed month of in Ramadan while I'm fasting and all of you are fasting that he grants you a righteous and Pious and healthy uh offspring of your all of your own that would make you satisfied in this life and that would help you in on the day of judgment but never give up you do Dua for yourself because you're closer to Allah than me you're the one who's in distress you're the one who's in need more than me or than anyone else the more you make Dua Allah would respond and answer you and you never know where good lies that is why we trust Allah we make Dua if it happens alhamdulillah responded if it doesn't then Allah knows best for us Kimberly from Jordan she says that she's a a new revert this is her first Ramadan congratulations make it the best Ramadan for you she said that the first day she got interviewed with her husband and she was upset and she lost it and drank water so what would she do you have committed a sin and a major sin by skipping intentionally this day and and voiding the day of Ramadan there's no expiation for it except that you have to make up for the day after Ramadan is over so during the year from today until the following Ramadan you have to make up for that missed day and ask Allah for forgiveness she says that my mom has by cotton boycotted me and she doesn't speak to me until I reject my religion and uh Yani refuse becoming a Muslim so Quran says that we have to obey our parents and respect them what to do Allah says clearly in the Quran that you have to be kind to your parents and obedient even if they strive to get you out of Islam and this is exactly what your mother is trying to do so by default it is your responsibility to keep on communicating with her send her sending her gifts text messages calling her even if she hangs up even she if she uh insults you or curses you or says bad things to you do it not for the sake of your mom do it for the sake of Allah and keep on doing it until she dies and by this you have given her the ultimate portrait and and manifestation of the characteristic of a Muslim who does this for the sake of Allah he is tolerant he's patient and Allah would reward you for that and you never know maybe Allah would open her heart because of your continuous uh pursule and insistence on communicating with her um from Saudi Arabia she says that what's the ruling on reciting the Quran wearing gloves well it is permissible insha Allah as long as you do not touch the Quran directly as long as you are touching it with uh um something that is considered to be a barrier or so this is inshallah permissible however now alhamdulillah with pdas with mobile phones with computers where you can get a digital form of um the Quran copy this without any any difference of opinion is totally permissible for you to read it while you are in your menses whether you are in wudu or not so this is best for you to read it personally I read it from my PDA it's been like ages since I've held a Quran in my hand actual copy of paper and read it because this is more convenient I can take it wherever I want I can put a bookmark and always continue from where I stopped She says last question what is the time for tarawih there isn't a specific time for Halloween extends from after Asia prayer till the break of dawn and whenever peace with him gathered the companions to pray behind to Imam Dari because at the time of the Prophet is when he stopped praying talawih and at the time of Abu Bakr and in the beginning of a time of Omar people in Ramadan used to go to the Masjid and pray individually or twos or threes so there were a number of circles so he gathered them all and appointed to imams and Tami madari and they used to Pray by the hundreds or the 200 verses until it was just about the break of dawn so their taraweeh was not like half an hour like ours it extended like four or five hours because any night prayer you pray during the month of Ramadan in congregation and after Asia this would be considered to be part of your Tel Aviv or part of your tejajid or part of unite prayer is the same thing this is all the time we have until we meet next time while watching the noon sighting it felt like a good in lighting this day is all right as the first time I wasted night with family around a nice meal we're making doing I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can on"
