  "transcript": "omma Mira from the states and I apologize for keeping you waiting Salam to LA questions is our question is I know when we go to groping somebody condolence on their family passed away you're not allowed to sit out and people who would understand like that so in that case one of how you go and they fought to keep it a food even though you know you know it's wrong but you wanted to think food what were you doing that okay that's all okay answering Shalom so um Amira says I know that eating and drinking when we go to places to condole those who were or who have lost a loved one is prohibited but what do we do when they offer us food well this is a misconception on Amira eating and drinking is halal there's nothing wrong in that what is not permissible is to gather on food when there is morning when you are giving your condolences to a family and they invite people for a feast this is what's not permissible the companion of the Prophet Adam used to say we used to consider gathering for condolences and preparation of food for the guests part of wailing Niaga so I hear of a family that is close to me dear friends I know them their relatives whatever they lost their son so I go to them and I give my condolences if the meeting is set to be at 5 to 6 p.m. for three days this this is considered to be joining and meeting for condolence and this is not permissible you can give your condolences when you see them in the message it or will you see them at the market or you see them at work or at school or you see them on the streets whatever you meet them you don't have to go to them but what so many Muslims do is that they dedicate the time between motherland and Asia because it's short and they sit with lights on top of their heads and servants serving coffee and tea and maybe they hire a person to recite the Quran and whenever there are intervals between the Quran and he takes a pause for a couple of minutes people who were sitting they stand up and they give their condolences and they leave these are all Buddha's innovations so this is an innovation and the innovation that you're not supposed to participate in is also when they give you a call and say listen after Asia prayer we are serving food for the guests so you are welcome to stay some people say don't leave before Asia stay with we're serving food this is what is not permissible the food itself is Hal and the rice the meat but Yanni it's all allowed for you to eat or to take but to join in such a congregation orange in such a gathering is what is not permissible and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
