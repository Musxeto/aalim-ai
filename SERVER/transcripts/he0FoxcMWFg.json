  "title": "Can I use insurance claim, Settlement, Accident money given by car insurance company assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says Car and Bike insurance are mandated by law so I have the basic plan if I get into an accident and they made a settlement can I benefit from that money as insurance is Haram as you know insurance is divided into two types commercial and cooperative Cooperative is the type where a group of people chip in an amount of money put in a portfolio whoever goes into an accident we take it and we give it to him until the money is finished then that's it nobody can claim anything it was a gift to cooperate with one another and this is halal while the commercial insurance is a combination of gambling and riba so usually we give a specific amount of money in order to be insured for a huge amount of money in return and we are shifting between the possibility of losing what we have given them which is a thousand or two thousand premium and by gaining three hundred thousand or half a million in compensation this is where the ambiguity is or as known as now when does it become permissible when it's mandated by the authorities or by the government many countries nowadays Islamic and non-muslim countries enforce third-party car insurance I don't want to insure my car but I'm forced I have to or I'll be fined I'd be considered to be breaking the law so I give them the amount they want to take the bare minimum accepted insurance in the sight of the law in this case this is permissible for me because it's mandated upon me and if I were to get into an accident and it's not my fault and the police comes and investigates and says well it's his fault 100 percent his insurance company or my insurance company if they were to compensate me for the damages then this is permissible for me to benefit from such compensation not only that if they give me for example 5 000 reals estimate to fix my car and I can fix it for 500 reels and keep four thousand five hundred in my pocket this is totally Halal and permissible without any problem so I hope this answers your question"
