  "transcript": "uh my question is uh can a new revert uh pra Salah while wearing headphones because he keep on forgetting his uh Al Fat can he wear uh can he pray wearing what wearing your butts or headphones okay I will answer inshallah so a new revert does not know the fa can he put earpods or headphones and plays the fat and says allahar and when the IM or the reciter says in his ears alhamd he says alhamd and the guy says he says this is permissible this is totally permissible and it would have been much better and less distracting if he were to get a written paper or from his iPhone where he can read it that's less distracting than hearing it and sometimes the Imam or the reciter May read two three ayas and you missed one Ayah and how to rewind how to go back that would be a lot of hassle that would make you forget the Salah and not enjoy it rather than prite reading it from a piece of paper that is more convenient and Allah Asel Knows Best"
