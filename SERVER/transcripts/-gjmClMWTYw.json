  "transcript": "question he said that we have two people one who recites only three sewers pull ho Allahu Ahad cooler ominous but he is righteous practicing revert he doesn't listen to music he doesn't speak to non Muharram women he doesn't do anything Haram Masha Allah may Allah so you'll make him steadfast and the other one memorizes half of the Quran but he is sinful he listens to music on and off he chitchat with women etc who leads a prayer definitely the one who memorizes more of the Quran unless he has something that is openly discrediting him in this case yes we may choose the other one but in normal cases the brother that recites the Quran most he is the one who's supposed to lead the Quran and this does not prevent us from giving him advice and reminding him of Allah Azza WA JAL"
