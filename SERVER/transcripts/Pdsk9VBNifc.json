  "transcript": "a brother says what is the expiation for fornication the question is not clear if the brother is asking about fornicating during the daytime of ramadan while fasting the expiation for that sin which is breaking your fast with intercourse is to free a a slave and this is not possible nowadays so you go to option two which is to fast 60 days kinesthetic consecutively so fasting is two months consecutively is an expiation for breaking the fast of the day of ramadan with intercourse if this is not possible due to illness or old age in this case you must feed 60 poor persons and this is only for the breaking of the fast fornication itself there's no expiation for that that is one of the major sins in islam and the prescribed punishment for it in this life if a person fornicates and he was not previously married is to be flogged a hundred lashes and if he or she were previously married or currently married or were widowed then the punishment would be stoning to death execution so it is one of the heinous sins of islam there is no expansion for it there is nothing you can do except to repent express sincere and deep remorse ask allah for forgiveness and do a lot of good deeds hoping that allah would transform these sins into good deeds and allah knows best you"
