  "transcript": "[Music] brother asif says that he's in his 40s and he has white strands of hair on his head and beard probably welcome to the club he says can I die and change the color into brown the answer is yes this is a sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam the prophet said a day in salat wa salam when he saw Abu Hafsah when he saw a Baku hoffa the father of Abu Bakr on the day of the conquest of Mecca he saw that this old man had all white hair and all white beard so the Prophet said Ali salat WA Salam said to them change this whiteness and avoid black so it is part of the Sunnah to change the whiteness of the hair with dyeing it with henna which makes it red or brownish if you add Alcon to it so it makes it a little bit brownish close to black but it's not black so if you I see you in the middle of the day or if I see you in a room I would not say that your hair is black I can say that it is dark brown there's no problem in that and you can even dye it with blond so you become a different person altogether as long as the color is not weird and makes you stand up in a crowd this is permissible as long as you have I'd avoid black so if someone dies his hair is pink or green or violet or whatever purple whatever this is not permissible because this is not normal for a Muslim to do other than that dark brown brown rare red in the sense of henna this is permissible insha'Allah"
