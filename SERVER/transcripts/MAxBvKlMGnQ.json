  "title": "Can a husband force his wife to give him money from her mahr or income? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says can a husband force his wife to give him some of her money dowry or income or from the dowry definitely it's totally prohibited for him to demand anything of it because he gave it in exchange for being intimate with him he cannot go back on that unless she's the one who's asking for separation and color other than that it's totally prohibited for him to ask for it unless she gives it willingly can he force her to give him part of her income well we have to look at the origin of the marriage if when he married her she made the condition that she stays at work and that he does not prevent her from working he has no right in a penny of what she gets but if they got married without any such a condition it's her obligation to stay home and to obey him if she was offered a good job and she requested his permission and he says no i don't allow you she must obey him and stay home if he says yeah sure it's a good job there's no free mixing etc you can go ahead and work but due to the fact that you'll stay nine hours out of the house and this requires cooking cleaning uh house shores that you will miss therefore i think it's only fair that you pay for the maid so the salary of the maid you pay for it and the transportation to your work coming back you pay for it i don't have to do anything with that other than that it's okay so he's bargaining with her is this halad the answer is yes it's halal because it's his god-given right to have a wife waiting for him home taking care of him and it's allah's given right to him that he does not allow her to work because this is what a wife should do if he allows her to work and he demands a portion of her salary as a compensation for such concessions this is permissible insha allah"
