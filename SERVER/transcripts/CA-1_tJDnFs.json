  "title": "Eid prayer mandatory for women? Can they pray at home? No space for women to pray in masjid Assimalh",
  "transcript": "Ultima says is it obligatory to pray there eat prayer even for women in the subcontinent there is no arrangement for ladies so mostly women pray read prayer at home is this permissible Fatima we've stated that it is highly recommended for women to attend eight prayer and this is known from the hadith of uma piya may Allah be pleased with her where she said that the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam used to ordered women to come and go and attend the sermon of Eid and we were instructed to order all women including girls who are in their menses yet they were prevented from attending the prayer with the congregation of women and they were asked to stay behind but they were ordered to attend the congregation in the sense that being present with them so that when the Prophet makes dora and all the muslims make dua they share this dua of goodness so from this hadith some scholar said that if a girl or a woman in her menses is exempted from prayer yet the Prophet orders them to go and attend the eighth prayer this means that it is mandatory but the most authentic opinion is that it is highly recommended for movement and that it is not mandatory now in the subcontinent they don't have any arrangement for ladies in their message this is wrong and this is part of them unfortunately not following the Sunnah so many wrong practices in the subcontinent people there in majority do not follow the Quran and the Sunnah they'd rather follow their peers their scholars their leaders who themselves may not have sufficient knowledge of the Quran decision but they follow what they had learned from their ancestors from their forefathers so their religion their conviction is based on imitation not on conviction and belief and this is very dangerous on the day of judgment Allah Azza WA JAL would not ask you about the al Qaeda or about the belief or what so-and-so scholar or leader or peer used to follow Allah Azza WA JAL would ask you as an individual what was your response to the Prophet al-assad Rosanna y ou may you an ID him fire kurumada algebra to moon Marceline Allah Allah would call them out on the day of judgement and ask them what have you responded and answered the prophets so you cannot say well imam have been humble said so-and-so Imam Shafi said so-and-so abu hanifa said so-and-so if you are presented with the verse from the Quran and you can read that it's in black and white or you presented with an authentic Sunnah of the Prophet a sermon Buhari in Muslim intermittent Asahi yet you reject it and say no no no I follow my mother have a fee if you are a layman and can't differentiate between a verse and a hadith yes you go ahead and follow your mother but if you're an intellectual person and it indicated person you can do your own research and you are assisted to do so by a scholar or a student of knowledge who has no hidden agenda rather than to show you the right path then this is definitely unacceptable so we would urge and call the people and the Muslims all over the world special in the subcontinent where they have strong conviction and belief they love Allah Allah the Muslims in India and Bangladesh and Pakistan I am so astonished with their commitment to Islam with their love for this Deen I see them in my messages here in in the local areas when they come out of the messages they see someone begging never you ever you would find anyone passing by without putting a rial or something similar to that in the hand of this beggar though he is a beggar we know most likely he's a professional beggar but out of their love and compassion they do this how they observe the sunnah prayers that is almost similar to fault and this is one of the wrong misconceptions but it's still we praise them for that for it when people come and say share we pray 17 records for Isha and said wow this is a lot actually is only four records yesterday we sprayed this before in this after and then the Scheffer and the what children and these put a lot of prayers into one but they pray it religiously they are committed to it so there are so many things that are good about them but when you don't have commitment to Quran and Sunnah when you don't have full adherence to the Quran and Sunnah this is when Shaitaan comes and he distorts Islam he manipulates people unfortunately and this is why the vast majority there are warned of a lil hadith of the salafiyyah of a hallucinogen manner they say don't follow these they hate the Prophet SM they hate the met haves in the school of thoughts and the mess lacks all of this is blatant lies none of it is correct but this is pulling the carpet from underneath their feet thus their scholars and their peers and their leaders who are making money out of the masses when they see that the congregation are following the Quran and the Sunnah this means that they are going to get away from their grip and their control and this is something they don't want or like and this is why they warn and they tarnish the reputation of those who follow the Quran and Sunnah and this is wrong so coming back to your question women must have a space in the message all messages for them to pray because the Prophet himself said that is awesome do not prevent women from attend attending the prayers in the Masjid he's addressing men do not prevent women from attending prayers in the Masjid however he added Ali salatu salam praying home is best for them so he gave them the choice you as men do not have the right to prevent them or to say no we want the best for them no you have to allocate a place in the Masjid and if they want to come this is their own right as for Eid prayer praying it at home is an issue of dispute the vast majority of schools of thought permit this so they permit it in the Schaffer II the Maliki and the humbly school of thought they all say that if a person and individual skips or misses it prayer then he can pray it alone at home the Hanafi school of thought say that this is not permissible and Sheikh al-islam bin Tamia also agree with that opinion of the Hanafi school of thought and so does share a banner they mean and this is the most authentic opinion that individuals may not pray 8 prayers alone either you pray it with the congregation with the Muslims or you skip it and do not pray it and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
