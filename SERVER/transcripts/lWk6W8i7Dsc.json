  "title": "Should we give Adhan & Iqamah when praying alone? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so yusuf is asking at times of pandemic when we are all praying home should we make adhan when we want to pray the answer is it is accepted and permissible is it mandatory the answer is no because you live in algiers and it's a muslim country and the messages there called adhan so there athan would suffice for you if you are in a kafir country and there is there are no masjids calling the adhan or if you are in the desert then you should do that but while in a muslim country while in a country where there are masjids that had already called the adam this is not mandatory for you plus and this is a bonus for free a karma is highly recommended whether for men or for women but it is not mandatory so if i just go allahu akbar the prayer is valid but it is highly recommended to call for the iqamah before praying even if you are praying alone"
