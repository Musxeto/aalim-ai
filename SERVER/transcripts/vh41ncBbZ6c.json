  "transcript": "perfect with no flood or other laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life away of nave assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatu all praise belongs to allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are looking at etiquette and its importance in Islam I welcome my dear who were with us contributing to this episode chef Fatima Hakim from Saudi Arabia shockabra he McCarthy from the USA and chef mondo Mohammed also from the USA now we've taken a look at the etiquettes and the character that we have in dealing with others and we dealt with the etiquette of the worshipper and his lords dealing with the prophet of allah so i am looking at the Sahaba and so you can see we're going down and now the next part that I want to introduce insha Allah is the etiquette of the believer with his parents no doubt this is something of great importance because this is stressed in the Quran stressed in the sauna so I'll begin inshallah with a Shiraz him just to remind us why the parents are so important and honoring them within Islam Nachman over him handle a sort of salam ala rasoolillah he was early he was a limited a builder who embody the cause the reason that we exist is to worship allah azza wajal and we are also grateful to our parents because they are the reason what the cause that we exist so allah azzawajal made our parents our passage to existence to this life and therefore allah Sojin obliged upon us to have the gratitude the obedience and the respect to our parents to the extent that if we look in the Quran you'll find a number of places where allah azza associates the obedience or the kindness to the parents with the towhead Rockapella Bucca Tabu do Ilia will be worried alias and illogical has ruled that you should not worship any other with him and that you treat your parents well so a Muslim looks at his parents as something that is so precious that is so important in his life that when talking to them there has to be an etiquette to be followed not like you talking to your brother or to your boss you talk to them in a fashion as we will he shall come to indicate how the self used to treat their parents I'd like to add here something that many stories in the Quran that would reflect exactly the same see the story of ibrahim alaih-is-salaam taking his son to slaughter him according to the dream that he had seen and we know that the dreams of the messengers of allah are nothing but the truth revelation from allah the revelation from allah then we understand from this story that he talked to his son he said that in the arival minami and the earth i have seen in my dream that i am slaughtering me you know that we know that it was very hard on Abraham Hassan it's so difficult situation that perhaps only a messenger of allah subhanaw taala can deal with it then he related the message to his son and the son yes submitted to the will of allah subhana wa ta'ala and showed love and respect for his father by even the language that he used he used the word the abbot o my beloved father you could have said yeah b-but even it shows you that how much it is picked he had although he was about to be slaughtered just few minutes before he's going to be slaughtered his still talking to his father with this respect because he is an embodiment of a Muslim is a Muslim son ismail alaih-is-salaam so this is one of the examples that every Muslim knows and we try to demonstrate this in our Lord Jehovah yes please if you can remind us with the four I we're Abraham peace be upon him was talking to his father when he said oh my father I have been given knowledge from Allah so that you don't have any apathy again he's four times yes he is using that don't follow the Shaitaan and then you will be an ally with the Shaitaan or father I am afraid that allah azza wajal would send his wrath upon you if and then you will become with the Shaitaan and so on so and his father would respond to him in a very tough way then the answer today and in respectful way yes still respecting him Allah I think you know the other body educate with the parents it's really shows when the one of the beauties of Islam and the Muslim it actually increases his faith to show him this is the religion of truth and even the non-muslims gonna hear about this they're amazed because obviously as we know when coming from the West who grew up in the West and perhaps a lot of times we might have mistreated our parents raised our voice to talk back then we've even seen people physically fight now being from Irish background we couldn't do that we wouldn't be here today if we did that you know how if you are different but in general and you have seen that will be wife semen will physically with their mothers with their fathers that will physically fight now in the Quran Allah subhana WA Ta'ala he says not to say that to pull a heart oh and I often the Arabic language is the smallest amount of disrespect it's a sound which just comes off yeah like today you know what people do or like you just did like like this whoof I said it's the same type of thing it's a smaller you can't even say this to your parents and you see the effect it has on the Muslims even children hamdulillah and this is one of the things that wallah he we can be proud of as Muslims very proud of look around the Muslim societies honestly do you see many anyways the old folk home or the you know for the elderly homes you might see one or two here and there because the people who don't have anybody never you will see a Muslim sending his mother and father to this in fact they stay and they take care of him they wait on him hand and foot in order to what enter into the gender because they know that this is the way to the gender I don't think that saw the picture actually I took it from gentleman in here I posted it and I actually posted on my side as well a young man in Turkey after the earthquake and his mother came out the house when he put her in the wheelchair and there on the street and she was very cold feet were very cold so this young man had went down and he was warming his mother's feet with his hand and blowing he was blowing into him because you know that the hot air that comes from mouths to heat up the feet of his elderly mother and you see the beauty of this it shows you the beauty of Islam and how Islam has given the parents their right the beauty of the ayat when they make dua for them when las monta√±as says or and it have Rama with him come on up Benny severe as they were merciful with me when I was young also have mercy with them now when they come to this old age I remember the story that I mentioned in one of the episodes of Christian woman who came bringing her two children one was 9 and the other was 11 and she brought them to an Islamic Center in Philadelphia and more specifically in Villanova and she met with the head of this Islamic Center and she said that I want you to make my kids Muslims she wasn't a Muslim she wasn't a Muslim and he asked her why is that they asked her are you a Muslim and he said she said no why do you want them to be Muslim she said that I want them to deal with me to treat me in a good manner as the Muslim children treat their parents when they grow up and so yes when I grow up and I become all I want them to treat me very well and the story ended with three of them became Muslims hamdullah this again shows the whole world that Muslims have it's interesting taking a look at this because a child isn't yet Ark again he doesn't realize what he's doing so they're only doing what they pick up from around them so you'd see that a child disrespecting their parents means they haven't been raised properly it's not because they've rationally thought I should treat my parents wrong they haven't been taught the right way and you see as you've pointed out you know comparing the Muslim who speaks to the parents in the kind way one thing that amazed me I mean like as you mentioned growing up Irish Italian background I could never call my relatives except by their title it's forbidden for me to call them by their name was always dear uncle or something like this and I remember one of my neighbors he would call his mother by her first name even I couldn't bear this how can you call your mother by her first name it's no surprise that later on he would even strike his mother now you see again if a child if they were left to go astray or just to follow what the people were doing you see many of them might eventually do this but like as you mentioned having that upbringing with Islam we train the children so that for the rest of their life they're going to be like this man in Turkey this didn't come by coincidence it comes by Islam and the famous hadith of the Prophet sallallaahu a very famous hadith almost every Muslim knows it who the one who came to the Prophet SAW said I'll ask him who deserves my company my companionship and then the Prophet salah salem said that your mother and then and who else and then he said your mother then who else is it the new mother and then who else and then your father and by the way this is how do you call it two-in-one it serves as and chose as the beauty of Islam in raising the children to love their parents and it shows also the status of women ominous in Islam 75% 75% yes is given to the mother and 25% is given to the poor father yes because it is the mother who did the wonderful job in raising the child and the child is due yes even Omar may Allah be pleased with her and this hadith was reported in an active Alma fraud for the Bihari compiled by the Bihari member ha and it's different than aside a lot of the people usually make the mistake of saying and Albahari deported and they don't differentiate between Asahi which is Oliphant ik and at the mud which has authentic and weak hadith but this is an authentic hadith in the season of Hajj even Omar may Allah be pleased with him was around the Kaaba and he saw a man from Yemen who have their hearts filled with a man carrying his mother making Tawaf on his shoulders huh and he came all the way from Yemen we didn't have the cars or airplanes this is the way he came okay the distance approximately from I like I think it's about two thousand kilometers plus okay two thousand kilometers okay there's a lot of vengence area so the man was making Tawaf and he's saying in Arabic in Nibiru Hal Moodle early into the Africa who had a mood re that I am her humble ride her humble camel if all the camels are frightened and go away I am not frightened he was carrying his cutting his mother on his back so he so I been amber and saving Omar may Allah be pleased with him do you think I have fulfilled my mother writes to us on the face value a fee you have even Amma said and he knows because he was close to the prophet s M not even one of her extractions while being pregnant or while giving delivery not one single and this brings me back to the issue of this Italian relative of yours who used to call his mother by was my neighbor neighbor your nail Italian wouldn't do that I apologize he said Italian average because we as Irish or that we don't have those things just before you mention is insha'Allah we're going to go to a very short break and we'll come back on this point may Allah reward you all so dear viewers do stay true and insha'Allah we'll be back after a very short moment perfect weird assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome back to you viewers we're here looking at the topic of etiquette and its importance in islam now before the break i share assam you about to introduce all mention appoints yes when you mentioned this neighbor of yours who used to call his mother on first name basis a before allah may allah be pleased with him saw a man with a younger man so he addressed the younger man he said who's this and the younger man said that this is my father look at the advice that abu hurayrah the companion of the Prophet is awesome you'll be pleased with him gave to that man he said if this man is your father never walk in front of him and never sit before him and never call him by his name look at the gratitude and respect you never walk in front of your father because then you don't know it's a sign of disrespect nowadays people don't care about this isn't even you know years ago it was part of the etiquette for the non-muslims when they come to a door they open the door for the elders or for the ladies they say ladies first nowadays with with this no segregation policy and equality this doesn't happen anymore with the parents it never changes never walk in front of him always out of respect he's the one who leads the way and when you enter a house or a room never sit before him wait until he sets and then father or mother do you need anything should I help you and assist you in any way and never call them on first-name basis this is Islamic teaching and that is why as in Ireland or in Italy or in Colombia or in Brazil where they respect where they still have this important between the family and respect to the elders they appreciate this a lot and when it comes to Islam which tells you that this is a common thread among a list which tells you that it is the original nature that Allah subhana Allah created every human with it's so common it's in our blood it's in our DNA that we love and respect our parents and this shows that Islam is the only religion perhaps that kept all these educates since adam alayhis-salam until nowadays so it's not cultural you know you can see it in China you can see it in Japan you can see it in the Philippines and I believe that the Filipinos are the fastest reverting Nationality to Islam because they have this they're so close to Varys ambulance but the astonishing thing that this is not cultural it is not it is part of your religion and I believe that if you look at the hadith that highlight the position of the parents it is mind-blowing when the Prophet tells us are a lot o Salaam that the father is the middle gate to paradise so you keep that gate or you lose it meaning if you are disobedient disrespectful to your parent you may face the punishment of not being deprived from and not only the father even the mother when the companion came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he wanted to go for jihad and he wanted to fight for the cause of allah and he asked him do you have a mother and he said yes and the Prophet told her mother so Salaam in some Ridge alayha yani associate yourself and tried to be next to her feet why because al-jannah to thumb because paradise is there and the hadith of the three who were trapped in a cave and a big drop came and blocked their way out each one started to ask Allah with the best deed he did what one of them was one of this when I was just listening to this story in the morning actually on the way to work shut in Basra Allah have mercy upon him their storm of the issue of the torso she only make dua to allah subhana wa ta'ala and one of the ways you can do it is through your good deeds not so he said they were one of them to what they did they said to make do out through our good deeds so one of them had said that I had something he did every night that his mother and father the after he milked their sheep he would not let anybody drink before his mother and father they would drink first and then he would go give it to the kids and the rest of the family and what happened that night he was busy out doing his wearing a camel late and found his parents leave before he could milk the Sheep for them so he said he stood there waiting quietly even though his kids were crying at his feet from the hunger they wanted and he said I would not let anybody drink before my mother and father out of the respect that he had for them so kind of look now I'm gonna ask a question it happens quite often that someone hears all of these are hadith all of these commands respecting your parents but they're going to think at somebody else's parents and they're always going to say well my parents maybe their non-muslim my parents they're not the same as the parents of Sahaba they you know sometimes abused me they disrespect me they don't look after me is there this you know exemption that it means you know well if your parents don't look after you then okay you don't have to look up Allah made this clear in the Quran super Allah and it any warmer for up nothing key tab min che there's nothing that I lost upon what I left out from the book if you don't and you finally either no color understand of the prophet sallallaahu he both were forms revelation when he said in the Quran if they call you to shirk to the only on it is the only succession what except otherwise you treat them exactly as you treat even if they are wrong listen and you don't tell us about how do you behave with your parents after you became hamdullah even a brain would be able to I mother my mother loves to bring this point like when she found out that I have to obey her and she said this works pretty well for me it's like when your wife Anna that she doesn't have to work you have to they're happy I'm my mother no he actually respects his she knows and I hope she can always continue to rely upon this if she needs something I'll do it and even you know sometimes cuz I feel she feels bad because she might other brothers might not do it so she knows she can put it on me but she doesn't so I think ahead and I realize if there's something and it's my pleasure to look after her and to tell you a story I heard my grandfather talking to one of his old army buddies on the telephone and he was talking about me and the changes he saw me he said I don't know what it is what they have these Muslims you know yeah but he said they have this moss he goes through the Quran you know that they read missed everything but he said you know the changes in this boy are miraculous he said he said never he raised his voice to us now so nobody Muslim like a month now when I heard his darling and he said never he raised his voice he dumb do something he does it immediately and he never back talks never does this he said he comes in on time now because sometimes I would leave it stuck for Allah I was and when I became us I was only 18 so I was on a wrong path I would leave during the afternoon time and come back the next day and then at that time my mother had moves I was living with them so this is really frustrating for them because my grandparents come from the countryside I used to something like this I'm coming from the city so something really strange for them so when they saw this miraculous is chained in just a month's time they were really impressed he was bragging even though he was a non-muslim he was bragging to his friends about the changes that Islam had done to me if I may nowadays I get a lot of emails from brothers and sisters complaining of the rudeness the viciousness the bad attitude of their parents and they say I cannot take it I have to you know stand up and I have to fight and sometimes I raise my voice sometimes I say bad things so what's your ruling on this and I always tell them when your parents are good for you the logical thing is that you're good for them so there's no test anyone who does good for you by default you're gonna be kind to him even if it's another Muslim but the test from Allah as the origin is when they are not so good to you so what you're doing is a fulfillment of Allah's commandment not because they're good to you or bad to you you're doing it as a form of worship and by Allah if we appreciate if we learn and believe me no one appreciates this more than someone who lost his father and hamdullah I have my mother and she's almost 80 years of age but I remember my father and I could not do what I wanted to do and I don't know if Allah Azza WA JAL has tested me to be around him when he was alive would I have done the things that I am thinking of doing so when you look at your mother if you still have your mother or if you still have your parents they are your gateway to paradise okay go out of your way some people don't even visit their parents except once a week and they live in the same city taking a one step further the education that we're talking about it's not just with the Muslim parents it is so wide that includes all human beings the hadith of the Prophet SAW hasslein when they told us don't be in math don't be a person who just followed blindly what people this hadith is is a little bit weak is not an accident naso accident when I saw I saw a cell it's a fitting by one of the companion it is root but Islam extreme but the Islamic root of it if it's granted even if people do something wrong you as a Muslim you should do something good which is the general etiquette of any Muslim you should treat people all of them near the men's room are exceptional others so the benchmark dealing with people in general it has to be in a very good manner what is missing is the application and which that Muslims would increase the amount of their knowledge and so they would learn these things and immediately they applied and it's not remember any one time when I was I was in Kuwait and the quiz I really loved the relationship they had with their parents very strong and loved you 3 used to like to go out and they would you know like to hang out and they'd have to do they wanna hear where they go this one brother he would disappear all the time in Maghreb and I really like the guy so I was like well let's go ahead let's go this place he said I can't he said I have you know for several years he said every single day after I primo have to go kiss my mother on her head and have a fun Jan of caja why small and he had lots of coffee with her and he said if I don't do I don't feel complete and she gets worried so he said I know she did she just like this just every day I go to her and you know sometimes you know with your boys you're having fun and he gets up and he goes to his mother and I love that if we maybe could in episode if you can remind us about the story of the one who didn't become a Sahabi who was in Yemen the poster sent him he will leave this for may Allah reward you all it's been very good being in your company being able to share with you and may Allah reward you also our dear viewers and we hope insha'Allah that you've benefitted from the programs until then I greet you all as salam o alikum warahmatu allahi wa barakaatuh we overlay"
