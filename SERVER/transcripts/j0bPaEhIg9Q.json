assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to lessons in fib we're still studying the chapter that deals with the manners of answering the calls of nature and the following hadith will be read by Sophocles I rated by Aisha may Allah be pleased with her the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam said whoever goes to relieve himself he must conceal himself again this hadith falls in line with the previous hadith we've read and we talked about we discuss the issues related to them and how the Prophet sallallaahu is Elam himself used to conceal himself whenever he answered the call of nature he used to go as far as possible until he disappeared from the sight of his companions and likewise one should do the same thing at least he said he should choose if he can to be isolated concealed from the sight and hearing of others this is not possible when you are in public toilets because it's shared by others so you can only conceal yourself visibly that is visually no one can see you but hearing you then this is not in your hand or command so it's okay it's permissible but if you can go as far as possible then this is also recommended the following hadith whenever the prophet sallallaahu celeb came out from allah meaning place of answering the call of nature he used to say oath Roenick which means oh allah grant me your forgiveness now this hadith again tells us there's another supplication let's see mustafa do you remember what should we say what we should say whenever we enter the bathrooms they should say Allah in Arabic I mean I hope your Sabbath is there any addition bismillah one should say bismillah of course it's not one hadith don't get things mixed up bismillah is a hadith and audible I hope to arrive is another hadith but whenever we go in we should apply both one bismillah to protect our Allah from being seen by jinn and one would say so what would happen if it were to be seen by jinn we don't want to get any bad things that they may cause us or at least by giving us evil eye and even if they could not harm us no one would like others to see his private parts even if he don't if you do not see them you don't want them to see you let me know about it of course this is a supplication you say when you enter now this hadith tells us what you say when you exit after answering the call of nature after revealing yourself what do you say you say both Roenick Allah I seek your forgiveness I ask you for your forgiveness and why is that simply because scholars say because Allah Azza WA JAL has blessed you by getting all these poisonous stuff and rotted materials from your body so your body becomes healthy because if they stay in your body this would cause you to fall ill and die so it's a blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL that he has relieved you from these poisonous materials likewise when you exit the toilet you keep this in your mind by showing your gratitude to Allah our children and you pray to Allah o Allah similarly as you have relieved my body from these poisonous matters and materials that would have killed me so I ask you I pray to you that you forgive me since that may cause for my punishment and torture in Hell fire so it's a similar thing almost that you show your gratitude to Allah in every single thing likewise if you see someone who's ill or who is being tested by Allah Azza WA JAL whether by poverty or in his health Allah Azza WA JAL is testing him so the Prophet tells us a little sound that we should supplicate and say hamdulillah all praise be to Allah I was a a lady - mmm tell AHA be the one Allah Azza WA JAL who has cured me who has saved me from being tested as he's being tested at the moment waffle Bellini Erica theorem Mahalo cut of dinner and made me better than a lot of his creator creatures and this is the fact if you someone if you see someone that has a cold and you are healthy and don't have this cold you say hungry Laila di funny and al-ahzar gel made me better than him because I'm healthier than he is but if you have a cold and someone else is unable to walk he's paralyzed you said hamdulillah di Fanny I can walk although I'm sick but I can walk he can't and if you're paralyzed but you see someone that is completely paralyzed from neck down then you say hamdulillah okay I can't walk but I have my hands to move and so on and if you see someone that is even worse than this if a person is completely paralyzed he is grateful that Allah has granted him Islam he Allah who shall grant him granted him this blessing to say alhamdulillah Subhan Allah Allahu Akbar la ilaha illallah this by itself is a blessing of Allah because you are in this shell you are in this body for a maximum of 60 to 70 years this is the AB the Prophet says Alice Oh Sam our lives the lives of my Ummah my nation my followers the a their ages range is between 60 and 70 and seldomly rarely people pass this age 70 and this is true so this is the average how long are you gonna stay on this earth to be 60 to 70 years and then what it's eternity Heather in heaven whether in heaven or in hell and we are planning and targeting heavens in sha Allah and Allah with His grace will grant us what we work hard and what we wish and hope in achieving therefore you find that all our lives are governed by supplications when we enter the bathrooms when we go out of the bathrooms when we wake up in the morning when we ride our cars or whatever means of transportation when we exit the houses when we enter our houses before we eat after we eat before we enter course and so on and on and on before we enter the mosque after exiting a mosque all of these supplications are made to connect you with allah azzawajal now compare someone that is always singing and chanting in his mind and someone that is always supplicating making vicar of allah azza wajal I I know a lot of people that listen to music 24 hours a day the minute there are in their cars they turn on the CD put on a cassette turn on the FM music and they enjoy their lives so they think but if anything wrong happens to the CD player they can't even Drive they can't go for 10 to 15 minutes without listening to something because they're already brainwashed and the devil Satan has already controlled them so without the music without the beat they cannot live now if anything were to happen to this man but to bits then any person listening to hard rock a heavy metal rap music aren't be whatever the lyrics is listening to they're they're filthy they're not honorable they don't tell you to do good things it tells you to fornicate tells you to kill it tells you to beat it tells you to swear say bad words and that is why the eff the four-letter word is quite popular on people's mouths they always use it whatever they do now if this person though he's a Muslim though he prays but because he's 24 hours under the influence of these lyrics and this type of music if this person were to have an accident you know an 18-wheeler coming towards him and he's driving and it's inevitable it's gonna hit him and he's gonna die what do you expect him to say la la la la yeah how you a um dramatic asteroth would you expect him to supplicate or will you expect him to swear and say what you know and it starts swearing and cursing it and he would die on this case and this in this situation well the other fellow who used to supplicate in every single thing he does when he goes out of the house when he sits in his car when he intercourses with his wife when he enters the bathroom coats comes out of the bathroom and every single thing even when he wears a new address or new clothes when he puts on a shirt or wears trousers there's a supplication to say that when he looks at himself in the mirror there's a supplication that he says that every single thing if this person were to be in the same situation of the brothers who was just hit by 18-wheeler what do you think he would say once it comes to him immediately the only thing that jumps to his mind is the colonel originally the lessee would says Ya Allah which means I seek refuge in you so if he dies he goes straight to heaven why because the prophet salallahu alayhi wa salem gave us the good tiding that if a dying person his final words were la ilaha illa Allah there is no god but allah worthy of being worshipped then he will enter paradise so compare this brother who spent his life watching movies listening to music trying to be a westernized person and ended by being unable to say like a high Lama is it it's a shame isn't it a waste of time all of this these years passed by for nothing because what ever ends whatever situation your life ends in this is the the situation you were faced a lot with so if you sinned for 60 years and the final year you've been a good guy then and you died doing good things Allah will forgive you but the opposite is true if you worship Allah 60 years and the final year you made a suit made sins like hell and and then you die doing them then allah azzawajal will punish you for that and it's the choice is yours whether to be a person that remembers allah and make vicar all the time or to be a person that enjoys himself for a short period of time than being punished for a very very long time we have a short break so please stay tuned and we will be right back inshallah good questions that bother you what about issues of concern to you would you like to share things on your mind with us are you interested in solutions based an Islamic perspective please join me live in meet your advisor every Friday at 9 p.m. Mecca time here Oh Salam alaikum wa rahmatullahi and welcome back we move on from the hadith of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her to the hadith of a blue Masood and of course you all know who even miswrote is so please the brother narrated by evening I sure would may Allah be pleased with him the prophet salaallah alayhi wa sallam went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring three stones i found two stones but did not find the third one so I took a dry piece of dung and brought it to him he took the two stones and throw away the dung and said this is a filthy this is a philippine thing this hadith was reported by Bukhari Hamid and daughter Courtney have the edition bring me something other than dunk okay now what's the first name of even mr. Rohit Abdullah ibn Masud and usually take this as a rule of thumb whatever you find in the sahi half Buhari a chain of men and then at the end it says and Abdullah the prophet said so John so whatever you find the name of the law alone you pinpoint it and say this is a bloody bin miss road because there are so many of the law it been so and so but the Buhari whenever he mentions Abdullah then this is heaven mr. hood who else do we have in from the companions that have the name of Abdullah Mustafa Abdullah abnormal even ml hot Bob fatty there are more than 3/4 of them Abdullah in neuro aha he was the poet of the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam the Prophet had three poets one of them is of the love no ha ha has sadly been favit cab had been Malik ok brother Mohammed excellent abdullah IBN amer Edmund Haas now let's move on to the cousin of the Prophet the very well-known cousin of the prophet sallallaahu Selim brother Zeki cousin his name's Abdullah one of the great narrators of the love novice yes Abdullah every night bass not the Alon homer his father is the uncle of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam and he narrated a lot of hadith of the prophet sallallaahu Selim who else the law Edna Zubair evening a wham he is one of the greatest companions of the Prophet Elias of Salaam he was one of the first newborn to be born in Islam his father was a Subaru hawa one of the great ten that were giving the good tidings of the Prophet a system to be in paradise and his grandmother was the aunt of the Prophet Allah so same as uber Abraham's mother was the aunt of the Prophet Allah so son do you know her name you don't know her name this is a big problem you should study your history no my Mona was the wife of the Prophet ah sir Sofia Sofia was the aunt of the Prophet Elisha Salaam and a beloved bears mother was the sister of law in law of the Prophet she was a SMAP bint ABI bakr that in the tahini so we have a full range of companions that are related and each and every one of them has stories you know to fill books with you can learn from their generosity from the bravery from their honesty integrity and and from their their love to our prophet sallallaahu any other Selim of the law even miss wrote and beloved mr. ode was known to be the servant of the prophet alayhi salatu salam one among among so many and he was known to be the one that usually carries the leather container for the Prophet to perform ablution he used to be called sahib Lulu and this guy was and I mean thin once the Prophet SAW said Allah asked him to give gets him something from a tree so he climbed the tree and the minute he climbed the tree the Companions looked at his legs and they started laughing you know they were really toothpicks you really like you know acoustics it's very thin so they started mocking in laughing look at his legs is just too thin so the Prophet SAW Salim looked at them and said are you wondering of the thinness of his legs by God they are heavier than the amount of hood at the side of Allah so Jana so the Prophet is always correcting us telling us do not be deceived by the looks always look in the inner things don't be impressed by things that everybody else is impressed with look in the inner of the human being look at originally what is the weight at the side of Allah and eventually this proved to be true of course because in the Prophet say that is a lot of talent on the Battle of Bajor where the head of the mushrikeen the head of the non-believers the enemies of Allah was beheaded by this shepherd by this young thin small companion of the Prophet as a son by Abdullah bin Mossad and when they described to us how he beheaded him it tells us that Abdullah came and saw Abu jahil lying on the ground and he climbed his chest you know saying that climb this just gives you the impression that Abu jahil was a mountain and this came up and climbed his chest and then beheaded him nevertheless never mind going back to the hadith they've been Massoud of the Lamas owed me Allah be pleased with him we should study our ancestors we should know them we should know who their friends we're which know who their parents where we should know how they lived how they breathe how they communicated because they are the milestone that we should follow the we benchmarked them by trying to imitate whatever they do because they are the perfect generation of course no one is perfect except the Prophet Allah saw Salaam but still we try to imitate whatever good they had and they had all the good that was in the world so in this hadith it tells us that even with her tells us that the Prophet SAW sunland instructed him to bring him three stones because he wanted to answer the call of nature so he went and found only two stones and a dry piece of dung which was of a donkey so he brought it to the Prophet Ali salatu salam thinking that it's all dry it's all hard stuff since so it should do the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam rejected this dried piece of dung and told him that this is filth it's not pure which means that you may not clean yourself with an impure substance it has to be pure in order for it to purify you which means that if a person uses a toilet paper to wipe himself and then wants to use the same area that he used which is used when it sits it's filthy it's not even any cleaner or acceptable but if somebody says well I have nothing else to use I'm gonna use it we say it does not clean it's not permissible why because it's filthy so whatever is filthy cannot be used to remove filth or the impurities when one one defecates or answers the call of nature the following hadith is to be read by brother Mohammad read by Abu Hurairah may Allah be pleased with him a lot messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam forbid to use a bone or donk forest injure which means screaming the private parts and said these two things do not purify okay now we've gone through this before but maybe to elaborate a bit we may not use dung and we may not use bones and the Prophet justified this alayhi salatu salam by saying that dunk is the crops and the things that the animals of jinn consume and eat and the bones whatever bones that have been the name of Allah has been mentioned on these are the food of our Brethren's the jinn so they may not there may not be used some scholars say there is another reason bones are known to have a very soft surface so if you try to clean with them nothing sticks to them so you do not clean you need me you may need to wipe like 50 or 60 times to get the area cleaned and that is why it's not accepted so if you bring any sir any substance that has a soft surface and you wipe with it and it the filth and the dirt does not go out then this is not possible for you to use you should use something with rough surface such as stones wood clothings piece of cloth toilet papers and so on the following hadith narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him all those messenger sallallaahu are wa sallam said beware of smearing yourself with urine because it is the main cause of punishment in the grave now this hadith was narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him it talks about protecting yourself from the sprinkles of urine protecting yourself from getting the smears of you're in on your clothings and this is very easy to understand once we know that the first thing one is going to be questioned about on the day of judgment is paddy you missed don't miss the first thing that one would be questioned about on the day of judgment is prayer prayer though there's another hadith where the Prophet says I saw some the first thing to be judged between people on the day of judgment is in blood and the meaning of blood is that when people kill each other so they're gonna be judged accordingly so how do we between these two hadith if you recall do we say one was abrogated or throw one no no we can join by saying that individually based an on individual basis the first thing that one will be questioned about his prayer on community basis on one-to-one basis the first thing one is going to be judged over is the blood if he killed someone if he was killed by someone now when we come to this hadith it clearly states that one should be careful about when he is urinating that nothing comes back to him but not nothing rebounds and stings his clothes stains his clothes or falls on his clothes because then if he prays his prey would not be acceptable because it is filthy its nudges and it tells us that there are there are people that are being punished in the grave and the punished punishment in the grave is not strictly for Muslims but it's for every one I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program and until we next time ta Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
