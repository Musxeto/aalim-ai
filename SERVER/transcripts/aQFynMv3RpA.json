  "transcript": "foreign last time we met we discussed the prophets attempt to call the leaders of different regions and empires and kingdoms around arabia to call them to islam now with the truth implemented between him between the muslims and the polytheists of quraysh the prophet sent his ambassadors and his invoice to the different regions of the world and among whom he had sent was abdullah and he sent him with a letter that was sealed by the prophet salaam and he instructed him to take it to kisra the ruler of persia whether abdullah took it himself or he gave it to the king of bahrain to deliver to him this is something that historians do not agree upon nevertheless we are told that when kisrah took a look at the letter he was frustrated and he out of arrogance and pride said how dare one of my servants talk to me in this manner and not realizing the power of the muslims and not realizing the essence of the call of islam he wrote to his ruler in yemen whose name was bethan and he instructed him to bring this man to persia so bad then sent again not evaluating the situation as it's supposed to be he sent two men to the prophet saws in medina and they came in arrogance thinking that they are strong enough and they have the power that people would normally fear they came to the prophet and the minute the prophet salallahu saw them he was astonished by the way they looked because they shaved their beards and grew their mustaches and this was not something that the arabs recognized or knew so the prophet sallam told them who ordered you to do such a thing with yourselves so they said our god ordered us meaning that their leader their ruler they considered him to be a god so the prophet salallahu allah answered them by saying my god my lord allah the almighty ordered me to grow my beard and to cut short my mustache and this is the sunnah and it is not a sunnah in the sense that if you do it it's preferable and you reward it and if you don't follow it then you have nothing to be afraid of on the contrary the majority of the scholars will actually actually let me rephrase this the consensus of scholars is that it is forbidden to shave the beard and all four schools of thought of islam and all scholars agree on this issue so the prophet alaihis salatu salam asked them about what they came for and they told him that they were told and instructed to detain him and bring him back to purgia but when they saw the might and the strength of the muslims you know they just told him we were just messengers and and uh our ruler and our lord tore your letter and he was very angry with you so the prophet salallahu the following day and during the night allah revealed to his messenger something of importance so the following day came and they attended the court of the prophet and he told them that my lord revealed to me last night that your lord has been assassinated so they were more furious they came to detain the prophet salallahu because of the letter he wrote and now you're accusing and you are saying that our lord has been assassinated and killed this is even worse shall we go and tell our master about this these things you you're just fabricating so that he would become angry more angry of you the prophet told him go and tell him so they went back to badan the ruler of yemen with an advice from the prophet he told them advise your master badan that if he were to embrace and accept islam he will be the ruler of his people and this was as mentioned before the habit and the sunnah of the prophet whenever he called someone to islam if the leader accepts islam he kept him as a leader of his people and this is you know uh the best way of handling and governing people if you bring them someone who's fresh and new from out of their customs and region they would probably reject him so the prophet sallam had a very a good sense of governing people so they went the messengers went back to bethlehem and told him that the man you sent us to detain was not very easy not not an easy catch he was surrounded by so many brave people and when we told him so and so he told us that your leader your kisrah the leader of perjya is dead has been assassinated and he's asking you to accept islam and badan was astonished and few weeks later came the news from persia that kisrah was assassinated by his son and his son was name is so he killed his father and they calculated the date when the messengers were in medina and the date when the head of persia died or was assassinated and they found it to be the exact date that the prophet sallam prophesized and told them what allah revealed to him and that was one of the main reasons that badan himself and his people of yemen accepted islam later on of course shirwei was well actually he died soon afterwards and he was succeeded by his daughter and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi when he came to know this he said that no people would pros prosperous if they had a woman ruling and leading them and this is what islam is teaching that women are not to rule not to be the head of state not to be a judge not to mix and mingle with men a woman has her role in her house taking care of her children taking care of her uh husband teaching other women having her own society with other women but to be far and away from men and men are also instructed to be far away from women but what we see nowadays of mixing between men and women in the workplaces and trying to put forward always women to give uh an impression that they are equal to men this is against islam what about countries that have women as uh prime ministers or governments and and they claim that they have been successful with such cases well we believe in what the prophet sallam said and if you look at these countries you would find them all in all not being that successful had it been in that period of time a strong man to take control of the government maybe they would be successful in social aspects because of the tendency of women to be more social and caring for the family than men they would be weakened in wars or would take the wrong decisions or would not be fair there are so many aspects governing this governing this but we go back to the prophet's hadith where he said they would not prosper us in the sense that all in all and there might be an exception but even if you study and analyze this exception as a whole you will find that the prophet sallallahu salaam prophecy is always on its on on the spot hitting the nail on the head having said that we have to know that allah the almighty told us that man is not equal to woman they are not similar they are different she bears children he doesn't she can carry a child for two or three hours without feeling fatigued he cannot so physically they're not the same mentally they're not the same and all in all each have their own role to work for and that is why the prophet salallahu salaam never had a woman leading prayer he never had a military detachment led by a woman he never appointed women to do things unless men cannot do it so men cannot deliver babies so you always had women do this job and there are so many examples but this unfortunately is not the time to talk about it's always useful to hint and point out things that people are taking taking for granted they think that well it's okay for men to work with women no it's not okay and this is for the benefit of women and the benefit of men to be separated each in their own field i believe we have a short break stay tuned we will be back it comes to you the truth and the attribute of the one who created you that he's one and alone running this universe that he doesn't become born he doesn't die he doesn't eat and go to the bathroom this is not god there's no problems here yeah this doesn't make sense who was jesus worshipping because it's recorded in the gospel despite all of the other issues about the gospels we put those aside we just say it's mentioned there that jesus worship god who protects us and the najashi as we know is the name of the ruler of abyssinia so whoever took charge of the country was called najashi and we all remember that when the muslims were oppressed in mecca the prophet salallahu ordered a group of the muslims to go and migrate to abyssinia and this was by itself a challenge because the muslims in mecca never got onto boats and sailed so they had to sail across the red sea headed west and this was an experience second to none and they had to migrate to a country that was not similar to theirs neither the climate nor even the language they were not arabs yet he sent the prophet allah his cousin may allah be pleased with him and the group of muslims moved there and we know what happened between the people of quraish the polytheist when they tried to have the king of abyssinia the send these people back to makkah and they failed in the process so i will uh the prophet sallam sent his companion to abyssinia to ask and invite najashi to islam and najashi accepted islam as we know and he was the only leader of these great empires and kingdoms that accepted islam and when he died some historians say that was on the ninth year of hijrah the prophet salallahu the prayer of of the dead the funeral prayer though he was not present because allah revealed to him that your friend in abyssinia and najashi has died and this is one of the things that scholars usually put as a puzzle and they would say who is the companion of the prophet who never saw him in the nazi why do they say this because the definition of a companion is a person who accepted islam and saw the prophet sallallahu alaihi as for the najashi he could not have the pleasure on an honor of seeing or meeting the prophet yet nevertheless he was considered to be a companion because he accepted islam and the prophet sallallahu alaihi performed the funeral prayer when he was informed that he had passed away on that time or close to it and a number or a group of his companions from yemen heard of the prophet sallallahu salaam so they wanted to go and accept islam they sailed from yemen headed to the western area of arabia so that they could go and would be shorter for them to go to medina but their boat took them to abyssinia on the other side of the coast they were met by jafar nabitalib and once he knew that they were arabs and they wanted to embrace islam he told them about islam alhamdulillah they accepted islam and stayed with jaffar ibm in abyssinia and they all came back on the seventh year of hijrah at the at the time of raswat khaibar the expedition of khaibar and we will get to talk about that inshallah later on and najashi also in that period of time was requested by the prophet to act as an a as his agent so that he would marry one of the companions that was there and she was um habiba bint abi sufyan she was the daughter of abu sufyan even harp the leader of mecca but she herself was a muslim and she migrated to abbassinia with her husband who unfortunately rejected islam there and became a christian because his islam initially was not authentic he reverted to islam for his wife and when they migrated to abyssinia he could not tolerate being away so he rejected islam accepted christianity and died as a disbeliever and because she was the daughter of the leader of quraish and now she was on her own with well not widowed actually because he was not her husband the minute he rejected islam her marriage contract was void so in order to honor such a lady the prophet saw sallam sent to the najashi telling him that he wants to marry um habiba and he sent him the request to act on his behalf in completing the the marriage contract the najashi did so and he gave her a dowry from his own and she became the wife's prophet uh by this marriage contract so najashi was a good ally of islam and of the muslims when he received the message from the prophet salla he honored the messenger and he gave him gifts and he accepted islam with the grace of allah does that mean a marriage can be performed in the absence of a woman yes in the absence of a woman well she was not with the the groom so see there is the marriage contract and this is different than the actual marriage so if someone has a woman in mind and he's in a country and she's in another country he may give the power of authority to someone he trusts so that he would accomplish and complete the marriage contract as a contract but of course this man does not take uh his role in everything he's not the husband he just finishes the contract by this by by this we mean if i give the power of authority to jim or john or abdullah and abdullah goes and proposes to the father of this girl and the father accepts he's proposing on my behalf he's telling them i'm coming on behalf of so and so and they accept this marriage he gives the dowry there are witnesses the woman accepts the marriage has has been completed now she is my wife though i'm overseas i'm in a different country if she comes with her father or her her brother to my country if i go we can talk we can do whatever we want she's my wife so this is acceptable the question that someone may ask can a woman be married without her guardian without her wali and the answer is no because the prophet salallahu there is no marriage that is acceptable or it's invalid when a marriage takes place without the presence of a wali the guardian of the woman and the presence of two witnesses so who was the wali in um habiba's case he was the najashi why the miracle is not the leader he is the leader he is the ruler so najashi was acting on behalf both sides so he's acting on behalf of the prophet salla given the power of authority to conduct the marriage and he was acting on behalf of the woman may allah be pleased with her by completing also this marriage he also requested the uh the najashi to send those who were in abyssinia from the muslims and so did he he brought two big ships and he put in them all the migrants the muslims that wanted to go to medina and they came to the prophet salat on the seventh year of hijrah jaffar and everyone that uh or who were with them another messenger of the prophet was well known because he is one of those who attended badr and allah azzawajal has forgiven the sins of those who attended the battle of badr was sent by the prophet sallallahu alaihi and again this is a title it's not a name of a person it's a title for whoever rules egypt at the time so he sent him to the coptic leader and he gave him the letter he unsealed it he read the letter he did not accept it but he did not reject it at the same time he told hatib that as a christian we know that this is the time for for a prophet to be sent to the world but we did not think that he would become one of the descendants of ishmael we thought that he was one of the descendants of isaac from the jews so what does he call for so hatha was telling him that he calls for this and that that we connect our next of kin that we do not worship except one god and that is allah almighty the only worthy of being worshipped and that we should avoid vice and and and call people to virtue we pray we fast we uh give the poor dude the zakat the charity and the more you do these good deeds the closer you are to allah again looked at it and said i don't see that he forbids something that is needed and he does doesn't ask for something that is not wanted all what he's calling for are good things everything it's natural and affair any objective person any person who is not biased would know that islam is the perfect religion that it is a natural religion so he honored hatha the messenger he honored the message that he got and he put it in a very uh expensive and valuable vessel so that he would honor it and he sent with him two slaves two female maids and a mule to the prophet saw sallam along with some clothes expensive clothes and he told the prophet that these maids are among the best slaves in uh egypt they are yours as a sign of good gesture and the prophet sallallahu accepted the maids he took one of them to himself and gave the other to hasan and the one who to whom he took was what's her name do you remember maria maria and she is the mother of his son ibrahim who died when he was six months or two years all depending on the narrations and his mule was known to be with the name of jul and it's a habit that people call their mules or camels and it's okay if you call your car if you have a car you name it this is also part of the sunnah i believe that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time over um"
