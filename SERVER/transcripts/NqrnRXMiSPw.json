  "transcript": "okay so I I have a to uh which is almost 5 cm above my ankles but when I walk or lean on something my too covers my ankles fully what counts my friend is your standing position if your thob your garment your trousers while standing straight is above your ankles and not covering it you're safe definitely the moment you bend for Ru or sit or lean down it's going to go down because you're shorter in height and this has no impact on you none whatsoever what counts is the length while you are in normal standing position"
