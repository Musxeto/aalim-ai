  "title": "Give dawah or stay home these days? Hadith - during corruption adhere to your homes assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign so I know it's part of our faith to share our dealing with others and let people know about the religion but I also heard a Hadith that said when certain types of corruption are occurring in the world you should adhere to your home and protect your hand and mouth from doing sin so my question is where do we draw the line should we be more obliged to give or should we be more obliged to adhere to our home and not okay I mean the the Hadith you're referring to has nothing to do with dawah the Hadith the prophet is referring to Allah to wasallam is at the end of time when there are two Muslim factions fighting against one another and you're caught in the crossfire so taking sides would mean that you would be taking sides in this case the prophet says confine yourself to your home and avoid such fitna because there is ambiguity there is confusion and Chaos who is right and who's wrong if you know for a for certain that this is this group is right they're backed by the Muslim Amir and they have the legitimacy while these are the oppressors and the rebels who must be fought against in this case you have to take sides but when there's confusion I don't know which one is right which one is wrong in this case you have to refrain as in the case when the battle happened between some of the companions may Allah please with them a lot of the companions withheld from participation and confined themselves to their homes and they would not take sides because they did not know which one is right which one is wrong so they had all the right to stop what you're talking about is that one is nothing wrong and going out even in the commotion and the chaos and the spread of evil there's nothing stopping you from making Davao online social media physically visiting neighbors going to the masjids and and checking on Muslims who have dropped praying in the Masjid trying to revive Islam in their hearts this is something totally different than Allah Knows Best"
