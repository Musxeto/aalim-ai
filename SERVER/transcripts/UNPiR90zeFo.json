  "transcript": "how to know if a woman I want to propose to has good character now you have two ways curry either you opted for dating and this is an Islamic and it would not show you the truly reality of a woman and she cannot see you through nature from a couple of days so this is out of the question for a Muslim as a Muslim you have limited resources and one unlimited resources so the limited resources are to investigate your mom your sister your aunt can ask those who know her at school her friends her family if she is a working woman her colleagues they ask they do their due diligence and they investigate and they come up with almost a perfect portrait of what this woman really is the unlimited source is trusting Allah depending on him and relying on him totally so I did my due diligence I asked around everything is positive I traced the Hara I asked allah azza wajal for permission to marry her and if there is any good in it that he the almighty would facilitate it from that's it but to say that occasion I need like 3-4 months to talk to her to chitchat to impersonate someone she doesn't know our social media and try to communicate with her so I see that if she's a straight girl or she fools around etc of Allah this is not done by Muslims definitely so you have to abide by Islamic sharia and all those I know in the Muslim world and I'm one of them with the grace of Allah I married my wife and we've been married now for almost 37 years 36 years who's counting and I didn't know her I didn't see her my mother and wife told me about her and they described her to me I asked around her family and they asked around about me I spoke to her father he gave me an appointment to visit I went alone to visit him I sat with him for like half an hour then he admitted his daughter in to sit with us she sat for another hour giving me and her the time to chitchat and to talk and to look at one another so that to know if there is chemistry or not hamdulillah after that we've discovered that we have chemistry physics math geology and every single science that we have and it's still kicking like the Energizer Bunny hand allah so this is an example in my family in my relatives and the people I know we do not have what is known as love marriage where you go and date people and you fall in love and you marry afterwards these type of arranged marriages that follow the Islamic rulings because in that initial interview if I did not like the way she looked or the way she talked I would have called it off and so would she but alhamdulillah it will it all went okay and this is the result so I hope this answers your question kuri"
