  "transcript": "um me and my brother might go to Jetta and my brother's passport says he's a Muslim but he isn't and I know that he really wanted to see Mecca or medina H but think as much as I know he's not allowed um to go there so um now my question is what is my responsibility in this matter like do I have to if he goes there and I tell him not to do I have to tell like the authorities or should I cancel the trip and hope that he will also not go there or can I just let him be first of all it is a very dangerous thing to play the game of giving Tak now I could sit with anyone and he could say something that may sound Blasphemous and I jump the gun and say you're a cafir you're an apostate and I spread this all over the place now the prophet saidat whoever says to another Muslim oh you cfir one of them is going to take that label so it is one of the qualities and Treats of Al to give to others having said that I'm not saying that people may not do or say things that would nullify their Islam No they can do this easily however in order for me to identify and label a particular individual like your brother to be a cfir there are a number of conditions that must be checked and fulfilled and a number of obstacles that I must make sure that they do not exist because one of these obstacles can block me from giving Tak to him if you say without any doubt he is a blatant cfir he insulted the Quran he stepped on it he cursed Allah he cursed the prophet Muhammad Alam repeatedly and did heinous things despite the fact we've explained that to him he did things that are Beyond doubt acts of kufur and the conditions are fulfilled and the obstacles are removed in this case if he's only going to enter Mecca because you're going there no you should not go with him and have to cancel that that trip to prevent such a cafir from entering the holy shrines if he's going with you or without you in this case you need someone who's a Maham to accompany you you may go there in benefit of it telling the authorities would not do you any good because this is a case of slandering that has to be proved in a court of law and would cause you and him great hardship and it's not in your ability to prevent him and block him or to prove that against him in a foreign country despite the fact that the the the authorities don't have the authority to block someone who says I'm a Muslim someone says and claims that he's a Muslim do we have to cut his chest and scrutinize his heart and give him a place placement test to prove it no this is not logical Allah Knows Best"
