  "transcript": "as for the second question regarding sending our children to imams who have a problem in their pronunciation so instead of saying say and instead of saying they say Z or instead of saying this or that they make a mistake not because they are willing to do this mistake but because this is their accent well if you know someone who is more capable and who is able to teach your child without such defects then okay go ahead but if he he is the best around he's the only one available then you have to take your child and you yourself in your house try to fix if you know Arabic fix these uh uh wrong letters because when you have uh out of the whole alphabet one or two mispronounced letters it's okay than not having any good or well pronounced letters at all so you have to do best with the means that you have at your disposal as long as they these uh imams and these brothers are trying their best then inshallah we try our best to take them to them and try to uh find few Arab brothers who would correct these wrong uh uh letters being pronounced and if this is not possible again you have the upper hand inshallah alhamdulillah you are teaching your children the quranic uh uh Arabic you're teaching them Taj you're teaching them Quran these pronunciations mistakes would be corrected later on inshallah"
