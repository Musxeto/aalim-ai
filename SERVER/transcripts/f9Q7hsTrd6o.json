  "transcript": "the question is that if I have money and half of it is used for trading and business and the other half is saved in a bank what portion do I pay zakat on zakat is paid on four categories if you identify these categories you can identify whether to pay zakat on your business or not of course the money that was or that is saved with two conditions if it reaches the nisab which is Cashwise the equivalent of 595 G of silver then and the second condition is that a whole year passes a lunar year then it is zable is this okay uh but regarding your business it depends not all businesses are Zak catable as well so if my business involves dealing in stocks selling and buying Umi in a financial institution of course not dealing with RBA mortgage Haram or Etc I'm talking about Halal stuff then this is zable because it's Finance it's money Goods that you sell and buy they are also zable but if I have a a building that is rented if I have a fleet of cars that that work as uh uh taxis if I have um a real estate agent I'm a real estate agent I just connect two together and get my commission there is no zakat in this because the four categories of zakat are gold silver and what fall falls under it monetary uh uh Bank notes Etc the second is the things that come out of the ground of vegetables and and certain types of fruits with certain specifications not all of them the third is the cattle sheep cows or camels no chicken so don't think that the these are the three categories and the fourth is whatever is made for Commerce for selling and buying so the thing that I display for sale this is zable if it's not then there is no zaka a lot of the brothers ask I bought a plot I bought a piece of land I bought a house and I do not want to sell it you know I just keep it for the children the grandchildren do I pay zaka no but he says she if I get a good price I may sell it so we go back to square one do is it displayed for s for sale he says no says there is no zaka but if I get get a good price listen if I go to and tell him I give you £1,000 for your th he'll take it off so he in the cat see and he's he's raising funds so who pays £1,000 okay no need for Rosen raising the hands do okay does he pay zaka for the th now no because it's not uh under display for sale so this is the the the most uh uh inshallah way to determine whether it's is accountable or not then Allah Knows Best"
