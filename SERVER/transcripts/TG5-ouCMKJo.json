  "transcript": "no why do you need Oh Oh God blogging yes sir I'm sorry Mia maybe it's the weather so I think I brought some eat with me this is positive for you it's quite negative for me so to forgive me in fact upon not drying my script I was requested to speak about the characteristics of the people of paradise on earth and I prefer larger that he makes you an eye on those who will enter paradise and researching the subject it was mind-blowing simply because I thought that ok I'm going to talk about few four characteristics and deeds that allow the person to be among the people of paradise and more than 2 negative 3 40 and i stopped counting so unless we are not better I don't think we can cover this however we would like to have a holistic I'm here something that would throw search engine with the trace of a lots of ejecta and i hope we succeed in reminding one another of these characteristics then trying to implementing them in our lives it is now down paradise is each elector one objective this is what we live for and if this is not your objective you're in the wrong place and actually you're living your own life because you're depriving yourself so many things just to become a simple to be ousted yet you're not doing the right things that entitle you to paradise so it is each and every one of us objective 24 for the sake of paradise we've acquitted since we've done things that are not so likeable to ourselves we wake up nearly the warning to am-3 a.m. in winter it's so cold we perform Google we pray we go to the machine we've had to grab ourselves from eating and drinking and new things that are usually done by us we don't listen to music we don't go to nightclubs we don't watch things that and Rama and I don't know what to say we do that well I'm hitting the wrong place you shouldn't be because you push pins so Jenna as described by the Prophet is awesome is surrounded by things that are not recommended not prepared by each and every one of us in order to enter it you have to do this and prefer an unlined face what hell and this is how feels a little bit is the opposite it's surrounded by lust and desire so the minute you to enter it you do get some of these less than desires you enter the apartment now paradise is utter submission and whomever he wishes granted it this means that he has bestowed His mercy upon and if you allow you to enter paradise on the very first that comes to mind I was saying and those who believe and do righteous good deeds they are brothers of paradise namimiss you and I among those feathers of Patrick's now how us generosity is overwhelming Allah did not restrict the things did not limit the acts that entitle you to go to paradise to a particular act so those who can be fast Allah win the whole game and that is one how many meet you Matt nice how many each other in paradise ok 8 you should know this is where you going and now the inside help 700 up you shouldn't know this but there are engaging in paradise one of them is gold out of mind and and the Prophet oh that this is one of the people who pass rate is another gate who the people who can chat etc so if you're able to pass você está make a nether paradise some people say I can't stay away from food and water for so long I'm so tempted but I can't great night prayer for three hours every night this is good listen I got great night prayer I can't ask but I have lots of monies I can give to charity I can get you down I can give to build a mosque etc crap so has I'm very diverse behind the meetings book or for bus engine harness now there are needs there are done through the heart if you believe in there are things that you say red and there are things that you actually do with your button there are deeds that only individual and there are aggressive they have been affect others and there are things that if you don't do them will enter paradise so if you look at these divisions you will be amazed by Allah's mercy as if allah wants you to enter paradise it is doing everything for you to choose that way to enter paradise and this is exactly true Allah Almighty created and ice cream now it's up to you whether to enter it or not the profits of my other seven said that whoever he said the very source of all of my other words when enter harbors except those who disobey the word was all of my own man and if you know that oh my divine 22 times oma that includes the believers and the disbelievers and they are called the omen of that the government of coal so even the christians jews all other denominations are considered to be part of this to me yeah what but the hope of that and there is the particular part which is the moment we missed each other the amount of those who responded to the prophet and followed him so the process all of which includes both parties will enter paradise except those who refuse so they said Oh profitable on who refuses to enter paradise he says whoever obeys me enter spiders and never disobeyed me is refusing he has chosen his destiny so this is one of the greatest needs of indirect partners you have to go through your life you have told me you believe you have to go through the way you live are you following the processor are you obeying him and every single thing is yes then you shop you're among those who invented purpose also the profit Center is auto setup and buy this thing is highlight interest to us that especially we look at hand a lot of the Muslims nowadays I was talking with one of the brothers yesterday and we were mentioning how people flip science there are so many people who used to be students of knowledge callers who is now who used to be under access paths fallen for Anson and strictly nowadays they flip side as they say in his numbers they chose the other side of the force I won't nobody is a family practice and if you look at this you would be shocked these people were considered to be potential scholars what happened to them this shows you that the hearts at the prophets anti-racism are indeed between two figures haha in he flips them as he wishes have the product says whoever says that in a helluva sincerely for the sake of Allah and this concludes his life mean that this is the last thing lead us before dying of Putin in paradise what that meant impediments does very essential me we say say that I don't mind they say kuantan do not speak leave them once they pass away inshallah this is part of the good times and the multi-purpose the Prophet says whoever fasts for the sake of allah and he dies and this is the last thing he did he will enter paradise and whoever gives money in challenging in this was the last thing he has done the Prophet says that he will be admitted to Paradise which means that every dv2 it depends on the conclusion the last hour the last minute and that is why you cannot take in shoes you cannot say okay i've divided my day into prayer fasting charity and there's a portion in my day it's fun I did like every week but ok I'm ok but one day in the week one night I party you know my name I may get wasted I mean take a joint or two I may have brother came to me the other day was saying that much of what is a rebirth and he has his partner he has three kids with her and she's not mad he's not mad at her she's not a Muslim she's not even a history jewel and he's much about practicing brother and she's expecting so he's asked me what to do he's living with this woman not his wife and he's asking you what to do so it shows you that all of our deeds depend on their conclusion how they end a lot of things that entitles you to enter patterns among them listen to the speech ready so cheesy which indicates how generous of our is the profit Center is awesome any one of you who performs whoo and he washes his legs thoroughly and then after concluding his losses in Allah reversal that's it process the whole eight gates of paradise would be open for him inter- issues who says discuss a reputable all of you to shop who's this this while contemplating not because it's a habit well few of us and imagine our shop giving us this beautiful thing or followers of rare if not that the gates are open for you anytime you offer google but love you enough wood for every prayer just anticipating this year work so that whatever you know I'm ready the prophet is awesome was approached by one of his companions apparently have a destiny Melanie's women and he used to serve the Prophet very sort of serving said o prophet of allah when he got in his room the prophet said asked me did I what you want from me if I was in his shoes I was improper I'm in the house in my bare and I'm independently and hold a party that's what we had but the guy did not say look at what they wanted in that one anything more to be said o prophet of allah i ask your companionship in paradise this is what so the practice in booking anything else the Prophet is giving him room to ask and this is the massive that's it to the Prophet said then help me by offering as many prayers as you can the Raptor court is currently because i miss you too frustrated as much as you can you know that you cannot prostrate outside of the prayer unless it's a frustration of forgetfulness perk of being thankful oma other than that you don't have to do just frustrate as so many people do so this is an indication that the more you play the closer you are to paradise and to the Prophet are installed bucilla I suppose who knows it by heart brazen enemies okay haha but still there now expected everyone resumes is an only forty percent did unfortunately I accuracy is the greatest higher in the program there is no comparison to any others and the greatest is glass and fatty chapter number one this is the greatest soon there's a lot more of those attending we get a preview of this shield so I it is so great the Prophet centralism whoever maintains deciding on eatin at the end of this prayer of the 500 in the prayer nothing prevents him from hitting paradise except death being that if you die now we've all been married tangled up and we work excited I devotion if you don't have moving to Paris buy this item is great hammer and yet people some Muslims tend not to memorize my heart not on in Britain also sorry I institution high school Saudis Adams and in 300 students in one year that I bought I'm in a survey who knows higher than my heart and I got only five percent so yours percentages inshallah much I forties is okay five percent only memorize them verse by part which seems to indicate our negligence we know my heart a lot of things the top 40 songs me that the distant the best movies the football team there is a cricketer jason berkley's and so on but when it comes to snap be something's keeping us away from this thing that is taking us away from it is giving us away from paradise the Prophet tells us that is awesome package pilgrimage ask questions what we want you perform your mandatory hatch which is not once year right how it comes you have a year come on guys one month we do as much liquor with every year every 10 years months of a lifetime as those you know who did not perform at when we want to look at what who they say the majority would say after i finished my ears and then my masters and then my PhD and that i get married and then my children are grown up so that we could go as a call happy Chanukah and so many favorite cheese yet the Prophet tells us that a perfect hedge has no reward with the scent of Oman exception now put you on 100 million essa cookies 90 our new year sex he has kept our new more since I know what that tells you there is no importance of General Allen dice so what is this be an incentive for me to say it so that you plan to go whenever you have the means right or always keeping others instructions to us at the end of the list this shows you how strong Muslim you are loving the Prophet SAS officer and his wife and another Muslims even imagine I got a circle well I was featured that's why I'm teaching and the names of the wives of the Prophet is officer and I could strange things though I gotta promise and father Dima she's the wife of asthma pass quickly what about the ten heaven-bound companions the 10 best top competitor processor one said I'm not asking you I never knew my brother but and it goes on on that I always say this this remark and lecture that I go to it's a shame that a coma advances to paradise we don't look anybody there is a compromise two of the prophets daughter was not so we neglected to the lobby and if you say on ok time take a deep at the people help if they take you to help this one isn't it a shame that we have this ignorance but our history our heritage we love the problem yes why I'm willing to do this into that can fight the bottle rocket do anything about his history about his legacy about this year his wife his sons daughters its companion no so what do you have if you even fail to do this in your own mind well I'll give you another example if you love to progress or some animation am certain that you do but this life perhaps you found in need someone to stop you on the face those back just the way you up every now on happiness says that the prophecy is awesome whoever prays 12 practice during the day and night every day and night a model built in a pan Allison Paris not a rented flat and a house except palace perfect the products said it another 32 d 454 before to after lower to after Marie and two after Asian direct get them in your system and jaw to enter progress in a pass so these these are things that would benefit me that metric the individual that would talking to enter paradise however there are genes that are transgressive of the terminologies correct requesting that we do it but in real life things that others am I mentioned that in the Quran and the Prophet mention them in the appendix winner among the things that acquiring knowledge knowledge of the crime Chanel Continentals of filth of aluminum iron cetera so this does not benefit me a lot of benefits the others because I can sit down as I'm doing at the moment and abetting you I hope so i'm doing this and i'm getting the award of everyone who applies what I'm saying so I'm sitting home tonight and someone says okay i'm gonna offer nitrates because Chester disputes to progress and I'm sleeping I'm getting your work so this is one of the greatest deeds that you can get closer to Allah to investment by benefiting others the profit center is awesome whatever takes away whoever walks away seeking knowledge about emigrating passions so how this is force the knowledge of the shaniya of the Quran student center once a person do engineering with this count no of the seat it wouldn't come but if your intention into your engineering or your medicine or your administration if your intention is to benefit the entire poem the Muslims to benefit humanity to do well to be a role model to the people see Obama is a Muslim and he's successful he's truthful his eyes he looks okay then he shall be rewarded but not in the same in other hands the project also tells us about and then who was walking and we saw a genie and obstacle with thorns that have met with hard people in their way so he finished he thought himself ok I'm going to remove this pasta Callista tree so that it would not harm others and it goes of our Ferguson's and admitted in Paris by what by removing harmful things from people's way now compare this to someone who puts lime land mines or this to a suicide bomber or this to someone who intimidates people or harm people or kill people if this one will go to paradise the other one okay because this is not part of Islam neither in the more time normal soon among the needs that are you receive gazillion emails people all over the world complain about their offspring about the children ah the Muslims are disrespectful to their parents their disobedient they do not go out of their way to be kind to them and these are all major sins they're not minor and you could find someone attending classes circles of knowledge attending wish you listening to the poor man may be traveling to a foreign country to learn Arabic and these are opened each but he is not tonight with his parents this is a later scene that won't pay raise everything that would prove to us that the deeds are by their conclusion and this man this person about not Jewish to conclude these things with groupies the Prophet said I stops around them the most major sins in Islam is associating others law and being disrespectful unkind to your parents he associated the two first associate then being disobedient and being glued to your parent jab Oh Jack not be able to beat them one of the Companions into the Prophet some psycho robot I'd like to fight in the Kosovo and I'm seeking your advice the brockton you have a mother and say yes I have brought in stick with her stay with her it was bad guys he's under her feet how come to fight I'd like to die because of the process stay with you mom be kind to her server bring her the things and rejoined her soul make her happy may Allah make enjoy info this is what about the father that stacking is roughly through doesn't pay money it doesn't support me well even your father even it is this evil the prophecies is opposite of merchandise the father is the middle gate of paradise so property sale prices on either preserve this gate or lose meaning that you will not enter paradise from the middle which is that in this way to go in unless you are kind and to be into a fire even if he's a Muslim even if is true even if it is abusive even if he doesn't support you even it is not time to it does not love you you have to obey and respect them as long as he's not instructing you to sin and on the causes that I've mentioned individual to paradise up bringing three girls of your offspring the prophets and I saw that whoever has three girls three daughters and he shelter staff provides for them and has mercy over them and contemplative these three words he showed herself yeah absolutely knew my daughters he provides for that white dick equip me and it has mercy over time a lot of the parents don't have this person they have quickly start em young I'm still in the prime of my life I was blessed with these daughters I can't enjoy myself I can travel I can't do this and that I'm slicker than 45 years old there is that when you're great friend over these girls you have to pebble you have to love them that you have to have them have to eat them ensure the mercy this mercy would entitle you to be admitted to her as a profession where does this then definitely sets from definitely is his one of the combined said want to curse the prophecy even if you have two groups and the other command said I think I'd reckon I said what Rita said what about even this is the case of amazonian in Iranian unfortunately out the Arabs who are not practicing think of girls as a disgrace because you don't know what the future might hold if it was a boy boys and go whenever they come you get mad at us exciting but girls are like gas once broken can be mended well the Prophet is fixing this rises up is telling us how can three girls and he himself had four girls solar system so those who are blessed with girls they are a blessing take care of them up reliving the way that Allah wants and and mice and Allah me choose my freshman them all the things that benefit others Billy mosques or contributing and building ones most whether those are hot or contributing that come out of building a thousand talents how long though this is directed to those who have one so if you have money if you find yourself tiring as a tea house going take a skating or gray night critical promise showing you the way to be admitted into paradise and being kind to others being tolerant financially things a man the Prophet else aside Sam was brought in front of a bomb on the day of judgment so Allah is asking him do you have any goodies so the message nope so Allah tells him you sure you have nothing and the message well come to think of it the only could be that I will dragen would qualify I think of it as much is that I used to trade with people so I used to sell them and not collect the money from the price and those who are wealthy and capable of pain I would leave them until they pay immediately ask you to pay whatever they want and those who are unable to pay because they're poor they're disadvantage the man says how could you I will keep them the money away it's their time I don't want if I don't cohort Allah says well because you should give brothers we are more entitled to forgive you forgiving sins within a purpose imagine this beautiful happy how many people you let money and they're not paying it back I unfortunately this is widely spread almost and if I could make it certainly now believe that everyone would raise his hands even those who bore my bad image a lot of the Muslims are faced with the state of a good gesture give their money to their friend a thousand quid for example and as they say when they come to collect money from you that is your hand but when you go to collect your money from that you kiss their feet because they take like ages before they even back well don't think of it as a bad thing think of it as a positive thing you have secured a place in paradise if you forgive me if you tolerate their injustice the things that they are doing now the great things that would admit you to paradise Justin cool to be a person with good character with excellent moral ethics we could conduct and behavior this allows you to go to the top of paradise the prophets SAS officer the closest of you to be on their judgment in paradise are those who have the excellent character and the moral ethics and the perfect behavior the Prophet is officer tells us for example things that if we try to explain them we take us ages but yeah it's like the tip of the nice perk of the Prophet says guarantee six things for me I'm going to paradise and if the Prophet that he's bad this means that you will definitely maybe go to get what he promised at a system he says one be truthful when you speak to fulfill your promises when you give a promise three give what you are entrusted with to those who entrusted you for preserve your private parts really do not fornicate five lower your gaze and sis up whole from using your hand either physically or this can be interpreted both wings either physically don't extend your hand don't abuse people that don't hit people don't do something wrong in your hand don't shake hands with the opposite sex for example this is or how ethical to can be that hold back your hand from harm and don't take what is not hopefully 16 the probabilities you paradise and the prophets it is also regarded being truthful it's amazing how in this country and other countries you'd find the non-muslims big-toothed being honest generally speaking on the studio type of saying all mashallah number strings are this and Muslims are that this is the way they were brought up to say the truth not to line and it's so shameful and embarrassing when our religion tells us that my is a sin and you find all of those lips lying not only that they give give lying different shades of color isn't ready this is a white line this is purple depending easy the prophet of the size is not a thing to be taken easy he said is officer and as you have to be truthful because truth leads to pimp righteousness and Bill leads to paradise and then it will continue to be truthful until he is registered by the side of Allah to being silly the man who goes out of his way to say the truth and beware of mine because mine leads to have an end it would lead you to have and you will continue july until you are registered as a sign of mama now the major things that will allow you to enter paradise is progressing your anger I have a lot of brothers complaining of the rage mayhap about the anger and most of the brothers who write to me unfortunately are selected they have these range attacks against their mothers against the younger sisters and brothers against someone who is weaker than they are but it may be someone who is 64 from Brussels full of muscles if they will not have these rage attacks they were okay I know where excess why is that this is not to raise this is collectively punish you for that the rage that I'm punishing for is something that goes out of your control a lot of the brothers come to be a share I was so badly with my wife I said sometimes it's like the ak-47 fashionable so I was angry I was so upset I was so so nobody divorces out of happiness you would not find someone sitting down with it so i say i love you for the sigma by your divorce all divorces happen due to anger but the anger that does not count what you divorce but let me present the divorce that does not count when you're handy is when you are what you cannot see so they tell you how to wake up from your great time you broke the window you did this in that in the nicest Allah number this is the only case where divorce does not count because it's like intoxication you don't see chocolate hold accountable for things that are we go go beyond your capability the almighty tells us that you have to march forth to a paradise that its width as of the heaven and earth and it's made for complete our fellows righteous they are the ones who spend and prosperity and adversity they're worth and they pressed a time so the prison no matter his things of entering paradise so many times someone who is below your physical strength or was below your social status someone you can inflict harm to so many times they you believe you and you want to do something you know people you want to eat them by independent but you press this why the authorities know you do this because you're afraid of you want panamax believe you're gonna give you your creditors if it is one of the prophets allah allah says in the quran came to the property said advise me show drops it do not become and the message dokie advice be more not become a me do not become a man do not become angry and one that is it do not become a and a lot of diffusion a lot of you to Paris now I don't think I'm enough time but if you don't expect people to listen literature's are quite calm they don't become angry no no everybody comes time what the product is telling you is not to go against your human nation because if someone attacks your wife ng I'm not this has nothing to do with this one now you have to become 19 but the Prophet is telling us is lab be aware of the consequences of your anger she could be running down the motorway and someone does something wrong to you and you become angry yeah a choice either too young attempt or repress your anger and go away if you do this if you regret your factor koala looking apartments so many times we need to repress our anger especially with the love of our loved ones especially with our lives especially with our children our neighbors our parents our relatives so many people we have to press are others because allah tells us that this is your Divine children now we have like five minutes and I deserve parts of it but of women of the Prophet a son told us that for 10 there are special things in addition to what was mentioned before the Prophet said is awesome for women who are married that if a woman prays are five daily prayers and fastest rom and protects her chastity she does not currently to commit adultery and this is vertical Shiva Bay's her husband a lot with Tucker and your paradise from indicate you wish that's all that's all the men are saying can be human so many things are back we have so much further back after pray we have two in the messages you have to enforce virtue and then thou prevent vines you have to do this you have to provide for our family we have to finally change might have to do this is that well this is for women and the prophets it is Marcel over another I think that and it's not it's not easy by the way in anything that this is easy no it's not maybe the first three are easy praying fasting and protecting your ship chastity but the fourth thing is the most difficult thing on earth it is extremely difficult to go to a woman and telling her obey your husband kisses see he doesn't take care of itself it doesn't do this he doesn't do that his routine never tells me i love you he doesn't say that the food that I cook and spend 3-4 hours a day you foolish puppy is excellent does this and you telling me to go pay for what well this is a lot only to do to enter paradise so it is not easy it's a very difficult thing and those who are tolerant education among the women a lot of the partners we are having all our women to practice and the Prophet Alex also told us that the martyrs are seven except those who died in the cause of Allah one well without going through the book seven verses takes another lecture the last part is a woman who dies in late johanna a woman who dies in labor Allah would consider her as a martyr so women who think okay that's nice I'd like to yes this is what the Prophet tells us among the characteristics women of paradise that they have a lot of children and they are loving and caring for their husbands and World War I were to the description in Arabic we have some of the brothers distorted in my same thing that I do and let the most vicious enemy it's closed in Arabic so to that is obvious they might be so having a lot of children it is your way to paradise of course of having them and neglecting them having them as ready and I'll bring them bringing them in the way that leases are not final after saying all of this and hearing all over this you have to know that he has knitted to paradise it is not by your own doing it is by the new server bots so he can do all of this at the end of the day it's the mercy of Allah that would admit you to categorize the prophets a transition no one would be admitted to paradise by his own deeds meaning in change so you can come under the observance hey listen I did what I had to do so I want to go to paradise you will not go to that that's because you offered higher you're braver these are means of entering paradise but at the end of the day you will not be admitted to paralyze because of your deeds so the company said o prophet of allah in you said even I will not be admitted to paradise with or by or through my date except or unless Allah overwhelms me with his mercy secondly you have to know that these previously mentioned characteristics or repeat the main condition for you to enter paradise is that you do not move we find what Islam any you could find someone who is praying on time the World Records who is kind to people removing things from harm's way who is acquiring knowledge who is benefiting others building monster doing charity listen that but he notified his his health he associate others with Allah he goes to grapes and signal Donna I have problems in 20 years and I have a child so grandma job from here come on Teddy's is going this is the dead person easily disguised does wonders are you I remember one I remember a person he said I went to much every single week for her and I used to something into Allah Allah and their child for 10 or 15 years nothing happened nothing my wife will not be seen then a friend of mine told me go to the grave of insane even I melodies with my name is Hana in type and this is a funny thing shane has three different groups over in Syria Iraq and Egypt so I don't know you do that you know like i said i went there i supplicated i said oh what you're saying I need the child I don't have any children of my own so please give me and drag me around my 99 my wife was delivering a baby boy working with the Saturnus this is how people think about is testing this man for 15 years and the man cry over this because he associated others over so these characteristics these deeds if you do not qualify or aslam if your true Muslim you believe in the mothers of are you have anything that goes against is now you will be with the grace of Allah has a nursing assistant furnace but if you know all of them get your associate others with Allah or you make one of the things that modify Islam you dated in sourcing like a parent for example don't like their daughter involved so they bring the sorcerer and they make some foodstuff and black magic to separate between the two this is blasphemous this is something that makes them an octave apostasy if you walk about this time if you walk about beforehand or the profit values your son or ridicule one of the verses of the variety of the companions are saying anything bad or negative about this new advisory staff so even if you do all this you'll not be admitted to paradise day for you have to observe and protect you and you as many of these needs and then each other with the race of of argument in paradise all of Ireland was all emotional"
