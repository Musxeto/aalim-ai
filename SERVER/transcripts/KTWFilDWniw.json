  "transcript": "he asks a frequently asked question i made two or more mistakes in the same prayer one of them requires that i offer two sujud before salaam the other requires that i offer sujud of forgetfulness after salaam so should i perform both before and after the answer is no no matter how many mistakes you do you only make one set of sujudi sahu and the majority say that you say it before salaam so that it would be included in the prayer itself over your salaam and that would be it"
