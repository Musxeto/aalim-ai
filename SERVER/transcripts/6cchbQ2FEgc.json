  "transcript": "get to play the Quran at the background like how we see in so many shops and malls where the Quran is being played and people are busy with their own shopping and talking is that not like disrespecting it or like even at home shall I only play when when I'm actually listening it and um or can it just keep running when how many questions do you have Fatima just one okay for your question playing the Quran in the background without anyone listening to it is Haram and it is disrespectful but if someone is playing it in the background as in a case of a mall or a shop and the shopkeeper is listening to it or someone else is listening to it there's nothing wrong in that inshallah even the others don't"
