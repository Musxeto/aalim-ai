  "transcript": "here in my country we used to say when the pray the second part for example like and all of the jam is mean my question is this permissible to say and mean to the Dua of the IM this is permissible however it should not be said in a raised voice to avoid the dispute whether we're talking or not so you just say it in a voice that you hear yourself by saying a mean not by how they do it in so many Muslim countries where the whole Masjid is shaken with a mean and people are shouting their lungs off out this is not the right way of doing it but inshallah this does not impact the validity of their prayer"
