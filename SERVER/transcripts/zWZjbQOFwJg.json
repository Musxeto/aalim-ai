  "transcript": "uh what should a person do when they forgot whether they recited the fact here or not and they already reached in Roku is it haram for them to change their intention to turn the prayer into a Sunnah if they don't do it regularly only once they do it once like you know one okay first of all reciting the Fatiha in the Salat is a pillar of the Salat if a person skips it whether intentionally or due to forgetfulness or due to an error and does not make it up in the same Salat the Salat is rendered invalid secondly if a person is in the state of rukur and he gets The Whispers of shaytan whether he recited the Fatiha or not This is highly unlikely to happen and usually people who come to me for counseling and they say sheikha I forgot I made a mistake and al-fatiha I say to them what's your name he says she's done for example and I said how many times are you asked about your name per day he says once or twice so I said then you say your name once or twice a day he said yeah approximately this is the average he said how many times do you recite the Fatiha he said at least 17 times in four prayers and you can add a number of more tens of times if I pray Sunnah prayers and night prayers and that likes so I said subhanallah when I ask you about your name that you only pronounce twice you immediately said it without any mistake and Fatiha that you recite at least 20 to 30 times a day for the past 10 20 30 years of your life and you still make mistakes in it don't you think shaytan is messing up with your head big time likewise for you soda when you go for record and say hmm did I recite the Fatiha or not this is definitely from shaytan first because it did not come to you while you were in the sanding position it came to you when you went for when you actually were almost 99.99 certain that you've finished your Fatiha and your Surah therefore if you get some doubts like this ignore it and move on because such doubts are 99.99 are from shaytan what if they are genuine Sheikh if you are 99.9 percent certain that yes you did Skip Fatiha your mind wasn't with you you were thinking of something else definitely big time I've messed up in this case you don't change it into Sunnah or voluntary because this wouldn't do you any good because the the the prayer itself is invalid what should I do you immediately should rise up consider you have not done your record and recite your Fatiha because you're still in the same raka and finish it and do your record and the rest of the prayer as usual offer your salutation upon the prophet assalam offer your salaam alaikum then offer to the sahu afterwards and then when you said offer to salaams to the right and the left and your prayer is valid and Allah Knows Best brother Yusuf from the Emirates Yusuf"
