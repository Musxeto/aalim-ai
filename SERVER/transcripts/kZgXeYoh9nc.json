  "transcript": "it shaking moving in prayer what is this is a song or a question I've it Shing is permissible when needed meaning I have an itch in my shoulder and I continue for Raqqa without itching it where is my mind it's gone it's not a record in Institute it's not in standing up I don't have any hush or zero why it's itching me so what to do go ahead and it shouldn't that's it what's gone this is a necessity this is needed this is part of praying do it but if you have it Shing of prayer which means that I'm normal the moment I said Allahu Akbar well I I prayed next to so many people youngsters and I'm happy to see them next to me in prayer but while life from takbir till Salam he's doing this and he doesn't have a beard it's just a lock for rock or Jenna Allah and Mohammed Omar but Institute he does this and after Salaam palace and I watched a guy okay at least touch it nothing this guy is totally out of the Masjid he's in Scandinavia he's in Malaysia is in Morocco not in the message it because Shaitaan is messing up with his mind big time he's done aware of it definitely he is not acknowledging this fact that what he's doing is wrong he doesn't know because he's not present he's absent so this kind of itching is haram shaking yeah knee if it's something voluntary and you shake and you move and you in prayer and play with your keys and take your wallet I was once praying with a brother in a masjid and the phone rang he didn't put it in silent like so many people he took the phone out he looked at it and started reading a message I think and then he did this and he put it back again what kind of prayer is this this is playing this is not permissible on the other hand what so many people say that if you move three movement outside of the prayer your prayer is invalid so one h2 fixing up three etches Hamas your prayer is invalid this is not true you can move more than that and your prayer would still be valid as long as there is a legitimate reason for it"
