  "transcript": "sh just in regards to uh answers you gave before um I just want to clarify something um because just want to be sure on a matter um if someone's backbit another person so if a Muslim back bites another person and they're not sure if the victim has found out that they've been backbitten um so the person that backit so the Muslim that back bit them it does not it does not matter whether the one you've slandered or you've backbitten knows about it or not the sin has been already committed at the scale on the day of judgment you're obliged to pay x amount of your good deeds to the person you've back bitten whether he knows about it or not what to do today to avoid such an event taking place on the day of judgment either you go directly to that individual and say to him I've backbitten you and I've said these heinous things about you so for forgive me and this means that there will be two courses of action either he will say may Allah forgive you or he will get more mad and would want to avenge himself or maybe cut ties with you to the end of his life which is catastrophic and way worse than your backbiting if you know that this is going to happen then do not go and approach that individual whether he knows about it or he does not know about it to seek his forgiveness because it's going to lead to more evil if it's the first conclusion which he's a easygoing person he would say may Allah forgive you we've all done wrong things in our lives and he lets go alhamdulillah that's a win-win so if it's the latter no don't go to him just ask Allah for forgiveness and make Dua for him and Allah Knows Best"
