  "transcript": "alhamd so many times when I do my counseling sessions I ask the question to those who are with me just to see where the problem is so I say after listening to their problem what are the five uh what are the six pillars of Iman so immediately say what what kind of question is this Shah Nam and zakat and ha said no this is wrong these are the pillars of Islam and there are five I'm asking about the pillars of Iman so say they didn't an upgrade nobody told me I always know that it was five so we as Muslims have a big problem we don't know our religion and the core of of our problems in this life is due to this negligence and ignorance these six pillars of IM are essential and if you and I always repeat this you probably know of have heard it from me before how many years did the prophet spend in Mecca calling the people to Islam mashallah what is this are we in a Masid or I'm asking a basic question people should know this yeah you want to go to J to meet who Prophet Muhammad and you start crying and weeping what do you know about Muhammad Alam um I have an appointment I have to go this is problem we have to know our of the Prophet if we want to be with him so he spent 13 years in Mecca calling people to Islam then he migrated to Medina and he spent there 10 years we all know this very good masallah mallah now they're waking up good so in the these 13 years what did he do he called people to Islam duh okay what exactly did he call people to Salah no Salah was mandated in the last last one or two years before so 10 11 years there was no Salah [Music] except it was voluntary it was not mandated it was mandated after is okay Ramadan no it was mandated in Medina zakat it was mandated in Medina he did not perform it because they were idols and the Hajj the first Hajj was performed on the nth of the of of Hijra 9 years after he migrated so what is the problem what did he spend time doing okay what did he he very good what in 10 minutes we wrap it up so basically there were a number of things that the prophet called the people to among them is the belief in Allah the existence of Allah of Allah the pillars of IM and the reverence of the Quran and how to love him and to believe in the prophet and to follow follow him these were the essential topics that he spent 13 years cementing in people's hearts and when they migrated when the tough got going the going got tough what did he do where yeah abas call the people Al M call the an call the those who gave the Pledge of Allegiance under the tree so when he called them they all came back to defend him and they won after almost losing the whole battle so this is where we fail miserably I get people coming to me I have problems with my wife for 20 years she's not abiding by the hijab she's not obeying me she's not adhering to Islam yes when we met we were dating and we got married it was a love marriage but then I saw the light and I saw started practicing alhamdulillah I was thinking there was no Hospitality in Kuwait but alhamdulillah they brought us water so I keep on giving her da and she's not complying Sheikh and we're at the brink of divorce I said and and this is yeah a lot in counseling sessions people complaining of their children children complaining of their parents people are unable to to live with their spouses but when you look into their problems it's all revolving around dos and don'ts when you go to your wife and say you have to do this you have to do that but there is no Foundation to build your high Riser risers on how is it's going to be the moment you build two three floors is going to collapse no no Foundation what is the foundation the belief I've been calling my siblings to quit watching pornography free mixing not abiding by the hijab not shaving their beards of course men and women H don't mix the women grow their beards and the men wear hijab and the likes but they were not complying she what should I do I have tried everything in my power yeah you are calling deaf people you have to wh unwax their ears they are not going to listen to you because they don't believe sh they're Muslims in the surface but they don't actually truly believe and this is the six pillars of belief of to believe in Allah the angel the scriptures The Messengers the day of Resurrection the day of judgment the Day of Reckoning and the Divine decree whether good or bad these are the essentials you have problems in da focus on the on these you have problems with your children focus on these you have problem with your spouse focus on these avoid for the moment halal andam dos and don'ts so that you instill Iman in their hearts and this is very important and essential because if I do not have a motive why should I do what you're asking me to do I don't have a motive there's nothing pushing me I'm a heavy chain smoker a lot of the smokers come to me said I I quit for one year mashallah good then I relaps and start started smoking again why he says why not seriously why not this is dangerous for you I know my uncle he's 95 years old and he smokes Three Bs a day he didn't die so people don't have a motive don't have knowledge don't have firsthand experience this is why they keep on smoking they keep on sinning they keep on doing things once they have the motive they start to commit and one of the six pillars of Iman to believe in the day of judgment in the past disbelievers refused to believe that there is life after death till date they don't believe Allah says in the Quran and they say there is not but our worldly life we die and live and nothing destroys us except time this is the only thing that kills us other than time there is nothing it's life and then we die there's nothing afterwards and Allah says and they say there is none but our worldly life and we will not be resurrected everybody today disbelievers think that there's no day of judgment and if you bring it up to them as well if you bring it up to some of the Muslims they get panic and anxiety attacks nobody likes to hear people talking about death we love to be in defiance we don't want to aren't you going to die I I don't want to talk about it change the subject please let's talk and this is going to happen let me change it are you going to sleep yes inshallah at 10:00 tonight I'm going to sleep are you going to die yeah don't bring this topic they are in defiance even Muslims if you go and speak to your wife about it you will not have dinner tonight let alone desserts so what's the problem this is an inevitable true fact people are in defiance they neglect it they try to look the other way because they don't want to know what are the consequences of their actions today what are they going to face what are they going to meet because if you are a righteous practicing good Pious Muslim you have no problem in talking about death actually death is the only thing that is blocking you from entering Jenna so we're waiting we Muslims are waiting for our SMS as we I call it I just the moment I get SMS I die so she are you afraid of death in no I'm not because I will meet those I love to meet and I hope that I've done something that isah accepted by Allah and that would save me on the day of judgment so Believers are not afraid of death it's going to come inevitably and they believe that after after death is much better than what was before it disbelievers think otherwise they know that they're going to face a painful uh um ending they know after death they're going to be held accountable for everything they had done and they don't want to think about it that's why they neglect thinking about death all what we see to day calamities Wars Injustice oppression all what we see where people at the moment are living in a jungle where the strong eat the weak where the more powerful and influential step on those who do not have anyone to protect them this is because they don't believe in the day of Resurrection does bamin Netanyahu believe in the day of Resurrection he's Jewish he's supposed to but he doesn't he does not he lives for today all the evangelists in America and Europe they live for today they live for the buck they live for what power and wealth they can collect and let bygones be bygones when we die Allah Kim but they don't believe that there is is the day of Resurrection they live the moment live today forget about tomorrow what will happen tomorrow live for today Muslims don't think like this they're far in what they see they see the cons they see the Jenna and Allah says in the in the Quran and indeed the home of the Hereafter that is the eternal life if only they knew this is not our home where we live is not our home most of you have shifted from one place to the other furniture from one home to the other depending on the rent and if you own a place maybe you will buy something bigger we keep on shifting this is not our home our home is when we die where we live for eternity how much 1 million year no a billion year no there is no ending for your life after death now as Muslims to be frank we have not seen heaven or hell we have not seen Angels or Messengers or day of judgment we have not seen n of these are all of the Unseen yet our belief in it is unshaken any child of us is certain of it as he's certain of his name that there is Jenna that there is n that The Messengers were there that everything that Allah told us is belief and this is why we work hard relentlessly because we can see our objective at the far end end while the others the disbelievers don't work as hard as we do they work only for today and they rest we don't we are in a constant race to reach the optimum of what we do so the belief of the day of judgment is one of the six pillars of Iman but what entails the belief of the day of judgment what does it contain first of all it contains firmly the belief of everything that Allah or his messenger had told us about beginning from Death so whatever happens after death this is part of the belief in the day of judgment which in includes the major and the minor signs of the day of judgment and I was blessed I think 3 4 years in this blessed country to come and speak about the signs of the day of judgment minor and major we did a lecture I don't know this Masid some other Masjid here in Kuwait it's on YouTube so this is part of believing in the day of judgment and if you make a crash course and put questions on it we will fail miserably to know what are the signs minor and major we don't have knowledge because it's not that of great importance to us also part of believing in the day of judgment is to know what accompanies death how our soul is going to be snatched angels of of Mercy or angels of punishment and what will be the torment and the testing and the trials of the grave and what will be the favors and blessings of the Grave what will be the blowing in the trumpet for resurrection and what will happen on the day of Judgment of trials and tribulations the details of resurrection of accountability of Reckoning the details what Allah has prepared for Humanity the scales that will come and weigh your Deeds that has eyes and a tongue that speaks a scale that does this the straight path a which is sharper than a blade and thinner than a hair and you have to walk and it is a bridge on the top of of Hellfire whoever slips will fall into Hell Fire and Paradise and what Allah has prepared for the people of paradise and the greatest reward that they will get is to look at Allah's beautiful face and hellfire and what Allah has prepared to the Sinners who have done wrong and the worst of punishment and torment they get is to be deprived from looking at Allah's beautiful face and so forth all of this is included in what the belief in the day of judgment now do our children know these things nope do our wives know these things nope do we know these things inshallah so our first mission is to go and enlight and teach and educate our children about it how to do so there are a number of beautiful resources I've benefited from 40 years ago or more or less the books of shh Dr Omar ashar Omar beautiful beneficial authentic to the point and it's not boring you will read it with your family they will learn from it and they will gain knowledge and get closer to Allah such as the minor signs of the day of judgment the major signs of the day of judgment Heaven and Hell uh the prophets and and the messages the Jin and the shtin the Jin and and the Devils the world of the uh righteous um angels and the likes very good easy books and it's all translated alhamdulillah Sal may Allah preserve him gives you his Salam he sent me a few days back on WhatsApp a collection translated on PDF so it's it's found in the internet you just type it and you download it for free and you can share it with your um loved ones now what are the benefits of believing in the day of judgment this is one aspect of the pillars of belief one so what are the benefits there are numerous and a lot of benefits we can reap from believing in the day of judgment among them if the soul knows the reward that the compensation it is it will be prepared to give when you know the reward of what you're doing when you're given an incentive you will be ready to give for example if your boss says if you finish this project on time and according to the standard I want I will give you a whole week off other than your annual vacation how will you work day and night if he says I'm going to give you a race allahar if he says I'm going to give you a free trip to sh um Count Me In I'll I'll help you so there are so many things that will give you an incentive among the very best is to believe in the day of judgment why forms of worship are hard to perform to wake up at 3:25 a.m. to pray F you got to be crazy we just slept 3 hours ago it's difficult sh once you know there is a day of judgment and there is reward and Allah will give you Without End you will wake up at4 to 3 to prepare to pray your wit and night prayer and read one ju of Quran then go to the Masjid and you will be more than happy to do this if you don't believe in the day of judgment you will turn off your alarm clock you will turn off the snooze you will even kick your wife out of the room just let me sleep another couple of hours this is the unfortunate truth and reality so forms of worship are hard but when you know the reward allahar it becomes easy when you know that there is a Day of Reckoning of account ability what do we say when we finish fasting thirst has gone the veins are moist and the reward is assured if Allah Wills this is what we feel we fasted 17 hours thirsty hungry tired the moment you put one date and drink a sip of water where is all this Agony and this trouble you had faced all gone what remains my reward on the day of judgment may Allah be pleased with him this is one of the companions very little knowledge we have about him no hadiths no uh um actions that are beyond recognition except one there was a Hadith on the Battle of bad the prophet wasam said to the few hundred men who are facing a full fully equipped Army of a thousand plus Idol worshippers fully equipped and they only had their swords and knives and speak they didn't have anything so the prophet said to them hasten to a paradise the width of this paradise is Heaven and Earth so said so what he said why are you saying is an Arabic word for Wow explaining his admiration and astonishment so the prophet said why are you saying he said prophet of Allah you're telling us to haste into Paradise the width is the he heavens and the Earth what about the length so I'm saying B hoping to be one of the inhabitants so the prophet said you are one of the inhabitants you are from it so now he got the Glad Tidings that I am registered in Jenna he took few dates from his sack to eat you know when you take dates you get some nutrition some carbs you can work out better so he started to eat some dates but then he said throwing it away by Allah if I am going to wait until I finish these dates it is a long life W it's a long life he threw it away and he marched to fight until he died why is he doing such a thing a it's only couple of minutes enjoy the dates enjoy a sip of water you are already given card blanch you are among the inhabitants of Jenna I can't wait I want to go to my Jenna and this is what's preventing me this is the belief that will make your spouse your children that will make you do what is needed to enter Jenna and to please Allah without it there's no motive abdah may Allah be pleased with a man with his father saw in a vision a dream that was terrifying in the beginning but at the end he was given a release he saw hell and he saw the people being tormented and he was frightened until two men came and dragged him away from it and said you're not from among the people of hell this comforted him so when he woke up he told his sister ha the mother of the Believers may Allah be pleased with her about this Vision she told the prophet Alat wasam who said H Abdullah is one of the best Servants of Allah if he prayed night prayer the only thing missing that he doesn't pray night prayer since then Abdullah Omar never left night prayer why because he can see the day of judgment he believes in the day of judgment and this is the meaning of the verse indeed these disbelievers love the immediate this life and leave behind them a grave heavy day one of the benefits of of believing in the day of judgment once you believe in the day of judgment it is a healing to your heart and chest for the Believers and for those who are oppressed everyone May face the day that people oppress him and he cannot do anything look at our brothers and sisters in Gaza they're being oppressed and nobody is standing beside them except with empty rhetoric we're good in speaking but not in actions we cannot do anything we our hands are tied but those who can they're not doing anything so this is Injustice what is making them patient content accepting Allah's Divine decree with a heart filled with tranquility and peace their belief that there will come a day of reckoning their belief that Allah would avenge a sheep from a horned sheep on the day of judgment even the Sheep Allah will not let go for their aggression Allah will hold them accountable what about the murderers what about the villains what about those who torment and torture people they will have a Day of Reckoning and this is what makes us patient and content with Allah's decree because we know there will come a day of reckoning in the Hadith of jabber may Allah be pleased with him when the people came from abasia from the Hijra the prophet said to them tell me something that was astonishing that you saw and that you've liked so they told him that once there was an old nun carrying a pot of water on her head and while she was walking one of the youngsters the punks came from behind her and pushed her she fell on her knees dropping the jar that broke and the water was spilled so she rose up and stood and addressed that boy and she said tomorrow you punk when when Allah resurrects the previous people and the latter who came after them and when Allah would make their arms and feet speak and testify against them tomorrow you shall know who will judge between me and you and that's it anyone who oppresses you let them laugh let them enjoy tomorrow is near tomorrow the you will get retribution the prophet saidat wasam she had said the truth she had said the truth how does Allah glorify does Allah purify does Allah honor an that does not Avenge the weak from the oppressors Allah asael might keep them 10 years 20 years 50 years but Allah will annihilate them will destroy them for their oppression among the benefits of believing in the day of judgment is that on that day there will be faces that are white and faces that are black on the day some faces will turn white and some faces will turn black because of their actions and what they had done this is why we hold back we refrain from doing whatever we want to do because sometimes we get these thoughts and ideas of avenging avengeance of doing something radical of revolting and all of this is against Islam so as Muslims we believe in the day of judgment and where Allah would make those oppressors and wrongdoers pay for their crimes and this is why we do not exceed the limits of Allah we do not believe in demonstrations and uh uh uh rebellions and the likes because there is a Day of Reckoning may Allah be pleased with her says a man came and sat in front of the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah I have slaves of mine they cheat betray disobey and they lie to me they're my servants they're my slaves I buy them and sell them so when they do this I beat them up and I curse them and I swear at them so what do you think it is what I'm doing right or wrong on the prophet saidat wasam on the day of judgment it will be placed on the balance on the scale what they have done to you and your punishment to them if your punishment to them is equivalent to their betrayal and their cheating and lying then you're saved you don't have anything against you and you don't have anything for you but if your punishment outweighs their sins and betrayal then they have an edge over you and they will collect and if it is the other way around you will take from them what is missing for you the man took aside and started to weep and cry and he said he felt devastated they are lying and cheating and this will happen to the day of judgment the prophet comforted him by saying or reciting a verse from the Quran he said did you not hear what Allah said Allah says and we place the scales of justice for the day of Resurrection so no soul will be treated unjustly at all and if there is even the weight of a mustard seed we will bring it forth and sufficient are we as accountant the man said W oh prophet of Allah I don't see any course of action better for me than to leave them alone I bear I make you my witness they're all free for the sake of Allah the fear of the day of Resurrection makes you free some servants and slaves that may cost a fortune the least you could have done is sold them collect the money buy something no they're afraid of the day of Resurrection among the benefits of the belief in the day of judgment incentive as we said it makes you not not regret seeing the results and the fruits of what you had done in this life so many people are result oriented they do something they want to see the result but this doesn't work that well in Islam because we simply do what we do to fill our Graves and this is a joke I do I don't know if it's inappropriate or not but may Allah forgive me I say many inappropriate things when I speak I was coming from jida and the gentleman on the train in the airport I was asking him where is the gate he said I love your Clips you're very funny you're very funny man welcome to the club so I said he said she as a youngster give me an advice I I said my advice to you is what have you filled Your Grave with he said I don't understand it's not dug yet he said well as a joke My Grave alhamdulillah I managed to install two split units some lights and a mini fridge all what I need is just to plug the electricity I hope Allah Allah forgive me and this is a joke I'm not making fun of the Grave or the rituals but I'm trying to give an example to make people understand what I mean so I said to him what have you filled Your Grave with the guy was almost about to cry he said I did not fill it with anything I have a lot of bad Deeds what to do so I gave him an advice and I went to catch up my plane before it left this is what you should do anticipate that with Allah in your grave not in this world and this is the Hadith of the prophet wasam he said if the day of judgment is called and one of you has a small tree he was about to plant it he should not let it go and should plant it what's the use it's the day of judgment I'm going to die everybody's going to die everybody's going to be destroyed the prophet is telling us where work and anticipate the reward from Allah don't wait until the results are visible maybe you will not see the results and likewise a man the prophet tells usat wasam was walking and saw a huge Branch as an obstacle in people's ways F filled with thorns and and things that harmful so he took it aside from the street from the road so that people would pass Allah thanked him and made him enter Jenna in this Dunya he may not see the fruit but in the day of judgment and this is why the prophet saidat wasam protect yourself from Hell Fire even by half a date not a full date half a date you can feed someone it will protect you from Hell Fire and I think finally one of the benefits of the belief in the day of judgment that the Reckoning and the accountability are done individually you're going to be asked alone most of us indulge in Haram and when you ask them they say everybody's doing it why are you giving bribes to the officials everybody's doing it why are you going to the movies I was in a country and one of the people escorting me saying to me sh we passed by a billboard of a movie so I said hangover that was 15 years 10 years ago and he said oh sh this is a hilarious movie have you seen it I looked at the guy I took the mirror and I looked at the mirror do I look that sinful I it looks like a Sheik says of course not you you shouldn't even talk about it oh no no sorry so people think that as long as everybody's doing it then it's okay and this is not okay because on the day of judgment Allah will hold you accountable alone Allah says on the day when every soul will come disputing for itself and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did and they will not be wronged Allah says every soul for what it has earned will be retained Every Soul so you will be questioned alone and this is why it will not help to be with the majority with the congregation if they do wrong we do wrong some countries without naming where they are or if they are in the subcontinent or in Asia I will not give any hints W you read in the news horrible news a man was accused of blasphemy mob attacked him killed him burned his body and couple hours later they discovered that he was a they discovered that he did not do anything they discovered that he was in inocent do you hear these news so many times they lynched him they attacked a woman they did this they did that it is not an excuse that a huge mob did it om may Allah be pleased with him heard of a man who was killed by a group of people 40 or 50 of them what did he do execute Ed them all because they were all perpetrators so it's not the crime of a single person it's a crime of the whole people but on the day of judgment you will be held questionable alone alone you will stand in front of Allah and you will be asked an ordered to justify what you had done it is not an excuse for you to come and say w I asked and he said it's okay I asked the IM of the Masid and he say okay I asked a Muti and he gave me the wrong fatwa and I followed it because Allah knows that you know it's wrong so many people come to me in in counseling sessions and they have a long list she he did this he did that he did this he did that I judge according to what what what I hear usually I say say I will not buy what you're selling until I listen to the other party he says no no no no I don't want you to give me fatwa but what do you think I said okay as long as this is not a fatwa and I'm not ruling if what you say is true then it is obvious that this is wrong but I doubt it's true this is happening 100% in all cases when someone comes and says things about another party yeah when a woman comes to me and says my husband did this my husband did that and she cries you they always cry in in counseling sessions and alhamdulillah Allah gave me a very thick skin because I don't believe those who cry or become emotional or have seizures well you die in front of me I'm not going to change my opinion I only judge by facts so when I hear what she says I say to her if what you're saying saying is true your husband has to be hanged but let me listen to him so he comes the following day and he tells me about his wife my wife did this and this and this and this I said if what you're saying is true your wife should be in front of a firing squad and when the following day they come and sit in front of the each other 50% of what they said is not repeated because they know it's lies Subhan Allah on the day of judgment nobody is going to come next to you and defend you you cannot say oh but he said to me he ordered me he forced me no Allah knows the truth and you will pay for that and Allah knows best now what you've heard I believe that 90% is lost due to memory defects all of us especially me my hard dis is gone I don't have a hard dis I only rely on my Ram so every day when I woke up wake up it's a new day a moment I go to sleep it's all gone down the drain but I sincerely want you and advise you to take this home number one focus on your priority with your siblings with your children with your parents with your loved ones in your da cement the foundation so you can build as many stories as you want by bringing them to the basics the belief in Allah it's not only versus we take it as if it's an abstract and something that we should shove down their throats no it's beautiful is beautiful if you know the beauty of Allah's beautiful names and you can relate to them and explain it to them in a beautiful way they will love Allah and if they love Allah mission accomplished teach them things about the pillars of belief and the more you do this and you increase their Iman they themselves will run after you asking about knowledge I want to know the meaning of this Ayah I want to know what will I get for this and for that and then you will be inshallah certain that when I leave my children home with the TV or with the laptop or with with uh social media that they will not do something that is Haram because it is from within they have the incentive and Allah Knows Best
