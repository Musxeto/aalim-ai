  "transcript": "salamualikum' ornithological I gotcha so we begin by going through the four schools of thought and how it started and the benefit of this is that we get a clear understanding of the efforts of these schools of thought and how they started and the origin of them so first of all the school of the Hanafi school of thought which was the first or among the first the name of the founder of this school of thought is under mud even thabit well known as Abu Hanifa may Allah have mercy on his soul born in the year 80 and lived until the year of 150 he is the only one acknowledged to be among the tambourine of the four Imams of the schools of thought Imam Malik of Nana's is disputed and the most authentic opinion is that is not so Abu Hanifa is well established that he was among that the tambourine he saw an asymptomatic but he did not hear from him or he did not narrate hadith from him be just simply saw him abu hanifa was well known like all the other imams of his piety of his righteousness it was narrated from two sources that he recited or read the whole Quran in one regard so it was not reported by one person by two different sources that he was well known to have recited the Quran cover to cover in one block I like who like us man I'm gonna find me a lot be pleased with him and one would say that this is not possible it is possible to finish the for an in six to eight hours for those who memorize it well some of us has heavy tongue so when he recites that Fatiha and the Imam is doing the recorder Sri Jordan okay what are you doing is it you shame I have problems the Imam is always doing record before I finish Fanta the problem is in you nothing the Imam how would you know ask the others is anybody finding difficult to result the podcast we finish it and we need the solar afterwards then this is your problem you have to practice more and more it takes literally three seconds maybe a little bit Allah says do it more and finish the fatiha when I enjoyed the amendment he's in Grigore again besides it in three seconds because this is my mother's tongue a lot of you practice reciting the fact has so long that it's very easy of course it's not the best scenario of reciting it well and what depending on the position of the situation abu hanifa may Allah have mercy on his soul was righteous practicing devoting time for prayers for fasting for a man that and this is the lift we have today we either have people of knowledge who do not practice like the old scholars so they speak beautifully they make Hopa they make lectures Wow but will you find them Mondays and Thursdays not fasting strange but then you think okay it's not mandatory but I would have expected a share to make it at least a habit of fasting mondays and fizzes let me prophylaxis am instructed and recommended a ship that does not offer night prayer something wrong then what is the use of your knowledge a share who does not respect the Quran any at least you have to recite one Jesus every month you have to finish the Quran once at least revise your memory or an mem if you maybe you don't never eyes don't Quran as soon as you know baccara are imran into this huge surahs you have to advise them on daily basis otherwise there is problem when you see a share or a student of knowledge is not giving siddhappa share how much do you give some a couple man I don't take this is strange when you see share is not taking Ramallah or making hedge or what use is the knowledge that he has if it's not being practiced and implemented so will you look at the life of these great Imams you will see that they walk the talk it's not just lectures and talk talk talk no and this is one of the examples were awesome and Nabil said that Abu Hanifah has been named or well known to be described as the lodge for the abundance of his brain meaning that Abu Hanifah where he used to pray night prayer he used to be like a lodge for so many hours standing in prayers look at how what we pray the Sun mashallah what are you doing ABB's what's for the apse this bow what is this when you try to think when I pray in my home nobody's watching Sunnah and compared it to what I pray in the masjid difference alone in the masjid and alone in the home similar or difference in the masjid everybody's watching so in the home 0 to 60 in in 2 seconds tesla new model electrical but very fast so there's a problem we have a problem in practicing so a member who had a family used to pray night prayer he used to be described as a lodge because he used to prolong his night prayer a man said to abu hanifa once he's a human being so people abuse him said fear allah if someone comes to you and says to you yeah she'll feel alive what will you say me I fear Allah what why are you so defensive if I tell you feel less his second life now I pray to Allah that among those who fees him and this is what about 80% he said that no one who's narrating this he trembled and his color turned yellow and he looked down in humble way and he said may Allah reward you with good people are in great need for someone to say this to them all the time so Hanuman if someone advises us we are rebellious with arrogant Abu Hanifa the great Imam everybody knows about and Eva yet he acknowledges I said may Allah reward you always remind me I need people to remind me that I should feel Allah Azza WA JAL fight he's practicing he's knowledgeable he feels allah azza wajal imagine once his neighbor he had a neighbor his house was next to his every day in the afternoon abu hanifa used to come out of the house no air conditioning like our center heat so it was hot so he used to go out and sit in the shade of his neighbor's house you get this breeze nice one day his neighbor comes to him and says about Eva I need ten thousand euros alone from you with all means you are my neighbor here you go he gave him the money the following day he came out he did not sit in the shade of the house of his neighborhood and they asked him why don't you sit in your normal place said I'm afraid that this might be RIBA but if I bought him money I lent him money so now if I sit in his shade this might be interested look how we abuse our status our knowledge if I come with my white beard an old man to a rope in a government office and people say come come uncle please thank you my son I abused my powers I use it I utilize it and this means that I'm not sincere when you use your religious power your knowledge and you think that you're above everyone else this means that your knowledge is not true their knowledge made them more humble never you will find that they are arrogant or you know flexing their muscles saying that I am this and that always being humbled by it amojan Eva's knowledge is so and a strong and great that when you come nowadays to some quote unquote Salafi brothers who say that hadith as RT there was Abu Hanifah was not a hadith Abu Hanifa was and they discredit this great Imam on what basis this this is a sign of ignorance Abu Hanifa was one of the intellectual Imams of previous times one of the most knowledgeable Manickam Alice was asked and he is a great Imam he came after him he was and we have a problem of contemporary scholars and nowadays if you ask awesome about share so and so out of envy I might say no no no don't listen to him he's knowledge is not that good is this is that out of envy now I might be right but I might also be wrong it is your responsibility to cross-check what I say not to take whatever verdict I give to my contemporaries because this is well known since the beginning of time always when there is rivalry you will find any human nature so Malik Nana's a contemporary of hanifa he should have discredited discredit him but he's a great scholar so he was asked have you seen abu hanifa he said yes i saw a man who can convince you that he can turn the pillar of the messages into gold yeah he's a good marketing agent he knows how to sell yeah and he is so knowledgeable that he can convince you and this is the power of knowledge I know that this is haha why because it's it's huh yeah but I have to understand you don't understand are you a Catholic until it was huh this is not power of convincing but the power of convincing is to be able to convey my ideas my conviction might believe to you so that you become a student and you buy what I'm selling and this is the difference between a good day and a bad day a good scholar and a bad score a good student of knowledge and a bad student of knowledge so many people we are engaged in conversation and when they speak to me they speak with authority meaning that no this is hammam yeah you will not find me for example I I think a lot of people say otherwise but I I see myself as a little bit tolerant I tell you that this is how ha but yeah yeah MIT might be might not be things that are crystal clear I tell you it is Haram alas I'm able to sit with you from now till fajar to convince you but there are things that can be this or that I never give a straightforward yeah any ruling meaning that I'm right you're wrong no there are people who are like this they will totally close the door in front of you there's no point in discussing with them anything so selling what you have needs knowledge means the ability of convincing needs that you are tolerant but if it is Simon Says you have to believe what I say end of story nobody will accept your Dharma nobody will take it and believe in it maybe they will for the sake of argument say okay but this doesn't mean that they have bought it even Mubarak said abu hanifa is the best juror of all people and Balarama Barak this guy is a story by himself if we would like to give a lecture about one of the role models of Islam and the lion embark would be one of them Abdullah nomadic used to be not as amirul mumineen in hadith one of them hadith and he was a millionaire and he was a Mujahid so he got it all made to the extent that scholars said we compared that belong remark to the Companions of the Prophet a sorcerer and he was no difference he was no different from them except the companionship Abdullah Al Barak when you read his biography you will be shocked he used to sit with his companions after Isha he goes to his home never comes out so they complain he said why don't you come and sit with us he said why would I sit with you I spent my night with the companions of the Prophet as a sir meaning writing their biographies writing their stories and and learning and reading he spends he prefers to spend time learning about them and sitting with the masses wherever it was time for Hajj he used to go to his students he says we're going to hatch the sea who wants to come so they say I'd like to come okay bring the cost of Hajj and put it in money back and tight so they bring you know the Feast of the Hajj and expenses he takes it he puts it in his chest a big box and then they go for Hajj the students say that he would spend the day and night serving us bringing bringing us food he's a share not like me what is the cappuccino of a visit he goes and brings some people I can't afford it but yeah Nia Charlotte if you come to say they'll bring you cappuccino no father so he does this he goes until they reach Mecca they make the Hajj they finish on their way back he says don't you want to buy things for your family for your wife and children take this money and I'll collect it from you when we go back so he gives some money they buy gifts divide things when they go back to their own hometown he opens the chest he gives them back the money that had spent everything was on him Apple on America's something out of this league he's one of the great Imams oh so he said about hanifa that he is the best juror the best scholar of all people so this gives you a glimpse of who Abu Hanifa was if Mubarak says this about him and an Amish a feeling who did not see a baahon even who did not learn from abu hanifa what does he say he says people in the context of jurisprudence are dependent on Abu Hanifah all scholars who came after Abu Hanifa and studied the study they are all dependent on his work on his Buffett was on her his verdict because he's he was a man of Internet what is the carrot characteristic of his school Abu Hanifa is known to be part of Hawaii what is meant by a Hawaii rye and Arabic means opinion so his work was dependent a lot on the Quran on the Sunnah but because he was one of the earliest scholars he did not have the travel ability to go from Kufa to Syria to Egypt to Mecca Medina to Yemen to collect hadith and they did not have laptops iPads internet so not even printed books they dependent depended entirely on what memorization and compiling themselves so the more the scholar traveled the more knowledge he gained why because we had scholars in Medina said in Surbiton Rama we had in Mecca even a bath we had in Kufa a beloved misrule we had in Basra we so each companion yeah you think of the love God ambass had all the knowledge of the Prophet I sir know the hadith he did not he was at 24/7 with the Prophet so he could not have related likewise even miss Ruth likewise even aroma so their knowledge of Islam spread all over the scholar who managed to travel and collect had more knowledge than the others had even because he was among the first he did not travel a lot and if you say he did not travel at all he wouldn't be so far from the truth and that is why I am I'm Cheri says that people dependent on a depended on Abu Hanifa info because he used to use a lot of logic I didn't have enough hadith but logically according to the Quran and to the sooner that I have the verdict of so-and-so should be sown so and in 85 percent was right later on few years later when we discovered that there is a hadith that covers this it is the same thing with roman hop-hop-hop nella rupees women went to a sham Syria and when he was at the border he heard that there is a plane so with him was I would obey the hammer of July and the companions and they disputed should we go or should we not and the companions Rama me did not take an opinion of his own he always consulted shura so some said let's go other sit no we should not go so ok we will not go he does not have any proof from Quran or Cigna how did he come up with this opinion he made HT had his druggy his opinion now omoro veda objected and we know that the prophet sallallaahu eyes and said amino ha the hill oma the most entrusted of this ummah is a poor obeyed our Moon Java when Roma was stabbed and was about to die he said if I will obey there was alive I would have appointed him as Haditha but he died before me so it is a great man so horribly objected said oh ma you want to go back to medina afraid of Alma's destiny say Robert looked at him I said buy a life someone else said this other than you I would have beat it him but you you are evolving there yeah I cannot beat you yeah you're great person away they will running from others destiny to Allah sister why should we throw ourselves in this so he made an analogy and they came to the conclusion after few minutes I'm not even half game and he was away when he heard about the dispute and what Roman came to the conclusion of he said by Allah I heard the Prophet say RA his salat was set up now this is evidence to us but already a number had taken the decision is it I heard the prophets of Allah celebs say if the plague came into a city where you are residing do not leave it and if you hear of the plague being in a city you're going to you will not enter it so the action of Rama what totally correct and valid so he went back so this is the characteristics of the school of thought of who abu hanifa that it was dependent on Quran and Sunnah but the Sunnah was very little so he depended a lot on our knowledge now going to the history of the Hanafi school and his most notable scholars first of all it has to be acknowledged that abu hanifa himself may allah have mercy on him did not write any book in fact he didn't compile any book of him first of all second of all his ship was not rotating around himself meaning that he it was not a one-man show abu hanifa was collecting the views from the students and the scholars he was with and it was like a counseling method when he was in the message it and there comes a problem check what do you say about organ donation of course it didn't happen at the time nowadays it comes to the share the shelf gives you the verdict at the time of of a honey from anything new happening he asks Abu Yussef a hominin hasan shaytani the students she have who were also great scholars and they come up with a conclusion and he gives the fatwa accordingly so the beginning of his era it dependent on abu hanifa himself his prominent two great students were abou Yosef and Muhammad Al Hasan a shebang these are the two great prominent scholars who themselves we're also getting in contact with Malecha bananas teaching and learning and also with Imam Shafi who took some knowledge from them as well there was also the fact in a avail I think and Al Hassan Amon Ziad the books compiled in that era on the imam abu hanifa was something known or well known as al assad this is the book complete compilation in the year 2000 204 up to the eighth century this is called the expansion era meaning that the students have expanded on writing books explaining the rulings and the verdicts and the filter and the methodology how to implement a methodology of abu hanifa in thinking because we know that Quran and Sunnah but then we have each mark consensus but then we have an ology some schools of thought do not accept analogy they say no we have weak hadith like Imam humbly mmm but they say weak hadith is better than analogy why should I go into chaos alright etc they have different types of methodology in studying and prioritizing branches of knowledge how to take these evidences so the expansion error we have a PHA Howie the Imam Abu Jaffa we have a shop kasi we have a Casali allure of the fedora and so on and they have these books on the right and Arabic I did not translate it because even I did not go through them so I think that in this way Jonnie be above our level to study and mention them but this is for your information in case just in case I'm a Hanafi I'd like to know what are the Foundation's books and references of hanafi madhhab these are on the right if you want to expand so there is the settlement error and this settlement error would come down to a banana jam and even have Dean even Abdeen is like 400 years 300 years maybe ago Groening recently not but he compiled Makaha etc these books were references the best well-known reference of the Hanafi is hash yet even have Dean when he explains the birth dates of the Hanafi school of thought and puts the methodology every school of thought had one or two or three opinions and he would classify which opinion and this is important to learn for a students of knowledge because sometimes you see people saying that boy hanifa says that this is not permissible and it's not the case you will find that this is the verdict of his later students who studied his methodology and they said according to the thinking of Abu Hanifah the ruling of soul also should be like this so they included in their late books that are reference of the Hanafi school of thought but not necessarily relating to Abu Hanifah himself and this is why we make the common mistake when we say Alabama Shelley said it's Haram what he didn't say that his students said his harem he himself did not elaborate on it but because we studied the Schaffer dimetapp anything that is in a Shafi matter we related to our Imam Shafi which is wrong it may be not even related to him fight we go to the second school of thought the school of thought of al-maliki okay Abu Hanifa where is it generally practiced his school of thought in India Pakistan China which means Mahara and and the likes and also in Egypt Egypt they practice to Jeffrey and Hanafy Syria mainly practice Hanafi but they have also so it's widely spread now when you go to the school of thought of Allah Malik is prominent in North Africa and Africa in general so what is his name Malik even Ana's bin Malik even evie armor and a cherry pie is he in a relationship to an asymptomatic may Allah be pleased with him the companion though he has it in his father's name his father's name happens to be an asymptomatic but they're not related date of birth 93 died 79 which meant that he was 87 86 years of age when he died and it was reported that his last words were to Allah belongs the command before and after build ahead imbruvica blue when him bad and he died and this is a verse of the Quran so this is Shama was a good ending for this great Imam worship and piety Malik sister when asked what was the main thing occupying his time when he was in his house the answer was or an and the recitation and this shows you that if you want to become a scholar a student of knowledge you have to devote the vast majority of your time for the Quran those who do not they will not gain enough knowledge I know a sister who is a student of knowledge in Saudi who revised this revision she knows one of my heart but her daily practice is to revise 5 juzz of a day device so in 6 days she finishes the Quran and goes on and on and on this is a student of knowledge when you devote yourself to the Quran but when you have no interest in the Quran or people say share when I open the Quran I start to your admin and they feel asleep you have a problem this series do you have a problem you have to fix this problem if it Massoud said you will not get closer to Allah in better than reciting the words that came from him Subhan Allah the Quran is the rope between us and Allah is the watcher the more you recited the more you study it the more Allah will expand your chest and fill it with proper and real knowledge but if you don't I find some Muslims see how much do you memorize the last three chapters in the Quran masha'Allah you have 111 chapters left what is this is difficult I don't have time why don't you memorize I don't have time what do you have time for watching Manchester United Mississippi they use no this is wrong you have a problem you have to rectify your affairs that orad is the main source of knowledge the main thing in your life everything else is cascaded from that so in America his time in the home was no newspapers no CNN know what's up it was for an or an or an and my says if I wanted to fill my study boards with how many times I heard any man Malek say I don't know I could easily do that he says if I want to fill my bookshelves with a lot of books I don't know I don't know I don't know is it that would be easy okay is this part of worship or part of piety this is part of being afraid of saying something without knowledge a man traveled the whole month from up north to Medina a distance of a month on horseback or camel back and he said I came to a man Malik with 40 questions from my people they didn't have facts didn't have what's up no ain't no emails so he had to travel so he asked Imam Malik about 40 topics he answered for and 36 he said I do not know the message I traveled one month to hear you say I thought what should I say to my people when I go back they tell them I'm ematic doesn't know seriously seriously among us who has the courage to say I do not know well why if people asks of us about neurosurgery we will say I think we should do this procedure we will even give fatwa in heart surgery or neurosurgery you find someone with the bullet of his car with the hood of his car open it is what's wrong he said well why the car is not starting I think you should change the spark plugs or without knowledge how do you give that one I remember I used to to to to talk to Sheldon bass one of the great movies every single day I in the beginning like 35 years ago 36 years ago when I started you know trying to seek knowledge I used to have problems I'd eat a lot understand what I'm reading it's an Arabic but who knows so I write notes and in the evening I culture the embarrassment they mean Abubakar a society I used to call them and ask they don't know me every single day I call them and we did not have facts we had telex those who to them do not tell us we did not have any means of communication except redial and fastest read that was the best form because all the world were calling them there are two lines on the bus so I used to call with ELISA ELISA until maybe 2030 times until Andy Biggs and he used to ask him and he is the only one I remember that I asked him a question that was any very simple and he said I don't know you know not only what you're the Grand Mufti if you don't know I'll tell you I know I think it's like this well like I asked my question is it my friend I don't know give me a call tomorrow I'll look into it okay following the airport him Salam aleikum Shaikh I called you yesterday about zones so I and the Quran he said yes I looked into it mmm Kathy says so so hope to be sown so and the most authentic opinion that the meaning is so and so and so to have the courage you say I don't know this means that you are Scott and this is why half of the knowledge scholars say is to say an unknown half of the knowledge the rest half is you give but when any time someone asks you yeah I know and you give answers without knowledge this is problematic and we will come to this later on sha Allah but even Maddie says I have not seen anyone who is more respected more wise nor more pious than mmm manic and in the hadith people will strongly seek knowledge and not find a person more knowledgeable than the Medina scholar this hadith some scholars said that it is referring to him a malik but the hadith was not authenticated by Sheryl Bonnie so the hadith is weak but a great portion of the scholars considered it to be hadith so he referring to Imam Malik okay was he knowledgeable let us see he qualified for a fact what and assumed the fatwa seat in Medina when he was only twenty years of age now imagine coming to the message of Medina and finding this young man sitting and giving fatwa teaching people answering their questions being the person to address their questions to a man Malik said I did not give fatwa until seventy scholars testified that I was qualified for it Subhan Allah nowadays you go to scholars tell them can I see who allowed you to give fatwa nobody allowed me I found myself to be a share what should I do this is why we have the the concept of tests Kia you have to have not must but it is recommended to know who you the shells approving you who give fatwa so you say that okay I know chef zone so he allowed me to give fatwa but the share who allowed you to get hurt when himself doesn't know how to make you do so what is this you have to be a graduate of a prestigious university this professors the shoe who taught you this is a form of approval imam malik says 77 0 of the scholars of contemporary time allowed him to give photo this shows you the amount of knowledge this man had anomalous a free who was one of the students of imam malik himself he said when scholars are mentioned malik is the star among them may allah have mercy on his soul ok what is the history of the Maliki school and who are the most notable scholars first of all and imam malik compiled the book unlike abu hanifa and his book is well known as el mapa one of the books based on thick but has a lot of narrations of the prophets saying at a salatu salam it was so prominent it was so accepted among the people that the khalifa at the time the ruler wanted to generalize it to all the nations and to make it the roadmap for learning mmm malik refused and he said that i cannot limit the people only to my book there are so many other narrations so many other views and this shows you his tolerance and knowledge nowadays you'll find maybe a student of knowledge who would say my way or the highway everybody else is wrong I am the only right person and if I had the power I would even forced each and every one of you not to listen to anyone except me and this shows you how the audacity that ignorant and people with less knowledge have nowadays no mi Matic as great as he was he refused to limit people to studying only his book among his companions and students even opossum Occidental for art and saneun and their verdicts their teachings were compiled and one of the main sources of the malachy schools of thought known as a you don't wanna so all of their verdicts were put and compiled in this when you read it you'll get the essence of the Medici school of thought and the methodology of it in the expansion era which is up to 616 he dropped you have different scholars for example even ideas he'd abdel wahab al khali and even have been bombed and these books which are in pink I think which is a result alkene and Kevin Tapani Martin Maha dad a Muslim Papa all of these books gathered the opinions of the Maliki school refreshed it reframed it and put it in a way that were the basis and the foundation of the Maliki school of thought the settlement era where by these great scholars as you find them in Rajab al-kafi Al Hadid Harrell is one of the most prominent and his book a moccasin is the most and he accepted a kebab their deal dissipate and the books are here too the right fight a shattering ah now you're talking almost the famous we don't want to listen now we want a shabby who by far an imam abu hanifa was known to be what to depend a lot on array we said this now a Lima Malik dependent depended entirely upon the hadith so we had two schools madrasah to Hawaii the school of the people of intellect and and opinion and the school of hadith so imam abu hanifa was a pioneer in madrasah to i'll arrive meant meaning that he depended on quran dependent on Sunnah but if there was not a Sunnah in sight he went to what oh my opinion my own logic what is the logic behind this area places Imam Malik no he was strict to the hadith meaning of the professor is not hadith of Tiberian if not companions if not then turbulent so this stick and entirely to the atom or the proof and hadith of the Sahaba and the turban in Amish a free when he came it was a different methodology altogether but first of all what's his name his name is helmet you know it is a sharpening and his body B meaning that he goes with the profits as some Danish to the third of the fourth grandfather so he's free from perish unlike the others one is from Medina were honey for whether he's a dub or not then we have had much they've been hampered from the tribe of Shaytan but Shaffer II was a pure she from Quraysh he was born in the year 150 in lhasa palestine and he died in the year 2004 in egypt and he traveled so he had the advantage of traveling tipper Malik was in Medina did he have to travel he had all the companions around he did not see the companions but all the knowledge of the company's work cascaded to the terrain in Medina so he had so many scholars around him in Medina and this is why one of the essential methodology of mm Malik's school of thought is the doing of people of Medina so their evidence this is her Quran Quran Sunnah is man yes and then he says the people of Medina were doing it this is one of my evidence that this is Sunnah because the people of Medina was doing it and the people of Medina took it from where from Tiberi Tapani took it from with companions companions of the Prophet lesser so this is yeah it gives a lot of power to even Malik's way of thinking now if you come to Imam Shafi you find that he had the balance between the school of writing of opinion and the school of hadith when we come to talk about his worship and piety we find that a beer-battered a man stated that Jeffrey used to recite the whole Quran how many 60 times in the month of ramadhan how many days in Ramadan 60 days 30 days oh this counter any meaning he used to finish the Quran how many times a day give me a break seriously these guys they didn't have time to do anything they were they were retired like me and they have nothing just read the Quran read the Quran this is the source of knowledge they have devotion to the Quran you re very citing it once in Moraga Imam Shafi twice a day then how was their memorization their knowledge is holistic unlike ours so you come to me as a chef masha'Allah knowledgable what is the tough seed of this ayah I have to research what is the meaning of this hadith hmm I have to go to the reference what is the meaning of this word in Arabic I have to open the dictionary these guys were not like this they are ready he managed a fire used to eat a book once and he returns it to the book shop he said you don't want to buy it's another I memorized it what kind of of intellect I don't even know my wife's mobile number well I don't I always make mistakes so we have a problem when we compare our knowledge to their knowledge in the sense that they're men like us they make mistakes they make Subhan Allah who are you to speak like this so him am suffering used to recite the Quran same Alcala BC he said I stayed the night once in a shop his house and he divided the night into three parts one-third he would recite the Quran and one-third he sleep this is a rebus element also and one-third he would study the knowledge and write the night was divided as a Makura bc says that he used to spend third of the night reciting the quran but spends fifty is long this is not part of the to completing of the quran in one night no this is quality prayer meaning that he prays besides fifty is maximum 100 but he contemplates that it slowly enjoys it and this is something we lack with so many times pre-finish prayer what did they memory cite in the first account no big deal the second record that's why i okay I could have concentrated the guys out of this world it doesn't even know so we have a problem that when we decide the Quran in our prayers are we doing it slowly so that we can understand have a connection with Allah finish the prayer this is the difference now about his knowledge about his smartness about his intelligence it was reported that he memorized the Quran when he was seven years of age memorizing is not a problem we know now his capacity his ability to memorize but still it shows you that his mother invested a lot because he was brought up by his mother and she invested a lot and this is what ended the end result so if you have a good father or a good mother who invests on you who spends time who's taller and who's pushing you to study and to become an e once you become an imam you appreciate this so he memorized the Quran when he was seven he memorized the book of a Mokpo of Imam Ali that wasn't hadith when he was ten and this shows you that these people devoted their time on serious things his share Muslim even heard the Sun she allowed him and approved him to give fatwa when he was 15 years of age 15 years of age grade what grade 10 almost great 10 gives fat one we have children are 40 years of age you don't know how to pray I see brother the city where is your son why doesn't he come to fetch it nothing he said if I shall in the future he would that if I he's young what is this so we have a problem even Reina and Lorena one of the Imams we've mentioned his name earlier he says ash a fairy is the best among the men of his time is the best among of his of all men of his time now a contemporary Imam Ahmed in Hamburg he says everyone who writes knowledge is indebted to else a feeling in Arabic it says no one who ever wrote or used an inkpot to write knowledge at the time this is how they used to write books and verdicts and hadith and and the more you write the more knowledgeable you are and this is a well-known fact if you want to memorize something the field all in old times they used to have a board and a piece of chalk and today's lesson we have this so they write it and they slap it off they write it and they rub it off they write it and they rub it off and then they mm they can recite it without any problem because writing engraves knowledge in your head so an imam shafi'i was one of the great Imams of all times known for his piety known for his knowledge and the advantage of his knowledge was that he was the founder of a solo cup the fundamentals of nobody wrote something that structured O'Sullivan before the traffic and his book well-known book known as le sada is the foundation in this of course he wrote other books on his fill such as the book of an ohm and it's a big volume and well known to the people okay what is the history of Imam Shafi'i school and his most notable scholars okay the beginning chef not album and Waitley wrote the book known as the Mufasa and these were the students Ribeira variety and lose any also wrote a most awesome then you have the era of expansion and you have a lot and a lot and a lot of scholars in this school of thought immense rage of Cavell s very L as Farah Heaney and morality and - a nice Shiraz Irizarry and you go on and on to the scripting era and the second scripting era with the books on the right now what are the characteristics of Imam Shafi mm sharply was a student of Imam Malik he went and traveled to Medina and sat with imam malik and I did to Imam Malik The Book of Allah a man Malik was very happy with having someone like Imam Shafi reading to him and taking knowledge from him and he also studied to the students or with the students of imam abu hanifa him a mattock also took from them so Imam Shafi managed to balance between the school of opinion and between the hadeeth and he merged them together to have this great school of thought of an imam shafi'i which is considered in so many aspects of it to be true and according to the Sunnah and if you come to the description of salat you will find that the description of salat of jeffrey school of thought is closest to the sooner they do to our book other schools don't they point the index finger according to the hadith of the Prophet I some other schools gone we have time work why how many how many it school of thought when it comes to my school by I think we will postpone a tea shall I go today and I'm a little bit late I was supposed to finish this but tomorrow surely we will try to escalate things together Allah Allah where's the ring yes la la la la la move our economy also in the middle a moment"
