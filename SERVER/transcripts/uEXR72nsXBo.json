  "transcript": "uh so I have a question about um uh drugs so if if a doctor in the United States of America prescribes you um a marijuana that is intoxicating uh because like you're having uh let's say mental like problems like stress let's say is that permissible for you to um take an Islam medical marijuana is openly prescribed in the US and parts of Europe and Canada I think and it's being definitely Mis abused and being used unlawfully in so many cases but the scholars have listed a number of conditions for it to be Halal to be used among them is number one that there's no other alternative number two that it is not going to make a person addicted to it so this is more harmful as in the opioid uh um conundrum that took place like five six years ago and it's now developing and they're being sued in the billions of dollars for their um bad work with with the public thirdly that it should be prescribed by a Muslim doctor not any doctor so a Muslim practicing doctor should prescribe it in dosages that would not become addictive and it is really in need fourthly that it is a real need for it not a mild depression or the likes among other uh conditions that I've mentioned on my website and you can find the answer detailed there inshallah"
