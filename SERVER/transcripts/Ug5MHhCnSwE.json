  "transcript": "I have a quick question so um I'm a re Islam alhamdulillah and my family are not Muslim they hate Islam and whilst I'm still living at home with family I wanted to know if there are close weddings that are coming up um because I don't earn a lot and the cost of living is high here what to do and for example if these close weddings are at a church for instance could I attend but stand outside the church and if there's a party when there's lots of Haram stand outside just showing other family members of shown face but not arising suspicion and would this still um would I not be enjoying good and forbidding evil if I did this um if I went there but stood outside it is not permissibility to attend disbeliever weddings especially if it's in a church or a synagogue or a temple this is totally prohibited Believers don't attend or witness such falsehood and likewise it is not permissible for us to attend Gatherings that Haram and evil is being committed such as mixed Gatherings where there is liquor and Haram food such as pork and the likes so you must make a stance and you have to put your foot down and you have to say listen you're my relatives I love you and uh all this baloney but at the end of the day I cherish and adhere to the rulings of Shar and in my religion this is not permissible for me to attend you will find some resistance but it will all weather away inshallah with the grace of Allah"
