  "transcript": "when praying in Gemara with just imam and one worshiper praying behind him we'll actually praying next to him they stand very close to each other with the imam only a few inches ahead when this is wrong of the other worshiper okay when the next person joins the Gemara then what is the right thing to do one stand right next to the worshiper to pull the worshipper back three push the imam to go ahead first of all when i'm praying with someone to my right it is wrong that I am few inches ahead of him we should stay in the same row one next to the other no one is in front of the others this is the Sunnah if one comes he cannot pray next to us the worship or the follower must go back if there is enough space which is the the norm and if there isn't enough space behind us then there's no problem in the imam walking a step or two forward but usually it is the second worshiper who pulls the first worshipper so that they stand behind the imam"
