  "title": "Safiya Bint Hu'yay (Women Around The Prophet ﷺ‎) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "in today's episode we will talk about a different category of women because she was a Jew all of her life and we know the enmity and hatred of Jews to the Muslims so by default she was a woman who hated the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and islam and not only that the prophet alayhi salatu salam in battle killed her ex-husband then killed her current husband and her father and her brother who were all hostile enemies to Islam and specifically to the prophet alayhi al-salam they devoted their entire life for attacking the prophet Elijah Sasaram personally and collaborating against Islam so you can tell by this environment this woman grew up in you can tell the amount of resentment and hate to Islam and to the Muslims she is Sophia bint whoo yay you know October she is from Banu and no leader and she is from the offspring of her great-great-grandfather Harun even in Ron peace be upon him the prophet of Allah the brother of Musa no Imran peace be upon him the prophet of Allah as well and she was married earlier - Salam Amina Mishka known as Abba Rafa the Jew who was ordered to be assassinated by the Prophet a lysosome due to his abuse and harassment and plotting against Islam and the Muslims then she was married to Cain an ignoble heartache who was killed in the Battle of Heiberg the Jews had a strong connection between the one one another between themselves so there were three or four tribes dominating the financial sector in Medina and in Arabia because they as usual it's part of their culture to deal in RIBA it's part of their nature as a minority to dominate and control whatever they can control and this is why they control the media this is why they control the financial sector nowadays so in the beginning when the Prophet came to Medina alehissalaam he stretched his hand to them to co-exist to live in peace not to cross the line against one another and they signed treaties on that bond open up our were the first to break this treaty when they attacked and sexually harassed a Muslim woman who was abiding by the hijab and then killed a Muslim man who tried to defend her in the gold market and this is when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam made them leave their village and where they were sallallahu alayhi wasallam then few years later it was vandenabeele whom when the Prophet was there in the village trying to communicate with the leaders they plotted to assassinate the Prophet as LOM by throwing a big rock from top of the building that he was sitting in the shade of it Allah told him about their plotting so he went back to Medina and then came back and also kicked them out it seemed that it became a habit for the Jews to try and plot if they fail they can leave and if not they've succeeded so the third attempt and that was a third strike when Ben oka Riva collaborated with the tribe of rata fan and Idol worshipers of Quraysh to besiege Medina in the Battle of the trench was were took a SAP and for a whole month they intimidated the Muslims showed their true intention to annihilate Islam and the Muslims while collaborating with the jews of banu Arriva and when allah azza wajal granted the muslims victory and sent the blazing winds and his angels to disperse the enemy forces then the Prophet Allison invaded Beni or Eva and the ruling was to assassinate to kill to execute which is a better word all of their warriors and to enslave their women and children because if their plot were to succeed the opposite would have happened exactly to the Muslims so it is the punishment for what they had intended now been upon okar and Burnaby and some of those who managed to fled from Venezuela all went to high bar which was a town a village a fortress out of the outskirts of Medina and they kept on plotting against Islam and the Muslims led by a number of people among them the father of Sofia even he went oh yeah even our top and her brother and her uncle and her husband so once the Prophet Allah saw some conducted the treaty in hudaibiya between the Muslims and the idol worshippers and the treaty was there so that no one would attack one another the prophet alayhi salatu salam felt that this was the right time to go and get it over with the Jews once and for all and this is not anti-semitic as they say anti-semitism because the Arabs are somatic tribes so these Jews are their cousins so there's no racism none whatsoever then what is it it is simply as stated in the Quran the divine book and it's also stated in the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam that their hatred to us is caused by envy because The Messenger of Allah they were anticipating and waiting for to follow and to fight the Arabs with they were expecting him to be from the sons of Israel a Jew when they discovered that he was an Arab they declared war and they clearly stated that we cannot follow him some of them acknowledged that he was a Messenger of Allah and that he was a prophet of Allah but only for the Arabs and not for the Jews so they declared their enmity against Islam and the Muslims in such an environment Sofia was born and raised when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam attacked hiber besieged it and conquered it without a fight he sallallahu alaihi wa sallam ordered the execution of the enemies of islam who were plotting beyond their ability and they went out of the way to harm this Islam and the Muslims in any way they can so they went and tried but failed and when Islam took hold of them they were executed for their atrocities and for their plotting against Islam and the Muslims Sophia fell in the share of the here al qalbi and that she was allocated to him as a slave girl some of the Companions came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and said to him o prophet of allah Sophia is not befitting of the here she is the daughter of the leader of the Jews so she has attributes that do not allow her to be a normal slave and she cannot be except for a person like you so the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam proposed to her and gave her a choice and he asked her if she's willing to be set free and marry him or that he would set her free and she goes back to living with the jews so he actually gave her have freedom back if she was willing to take it so when she entered upon the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he said to her in the beginning your father was among the strongest in enmity among the jews towards me until allah killed him just so she apologized and said o prophet of allah allah says in the quran and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another my father's burdens are not mine so I'm not to be blamed so the prophet said to her choose for yourself if you wish I will marry you and set you free and if you choose Judaism then I will set you free so you can go and catch up with your people so she replied by saying o prophet of Allah I have fallen in love with Islam and I believed in you before you called me to Islam and I don't have any interest in Judaism I don't have a father in it I don't have a brother I have nothing and now you're giving me a choice between this belief and Islam by Allah Allah the Almighty and his messenger salallahu alaihe wasalam are more beloved to my heart than being set free and going back to my people so the prophet alayhi salatu salam kept her for for himself in the beginning the companions did not know whether the Prophet is keeping her as a slave girl a concubine or a freed woman and marry her so they said to themselves if the Prophet Isis I make makes her wear the hijab then definitely she is the mother of the believers and soon she came out wearing the hijab the Prophet Allah so I'm sitting next to her camel putting his knee so that she could put her foot and climb over on top of that and then go and mount her camel so then you that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam took her as a wife the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam made a lima and his redeemer was very modest he collected dates and made a special plate of dates with ghee in some flour which is known as Heist it's very sweet very nice very filling and he ordered an assembly malik to gather all the companions around so that they can feast on that the prophet alayhi salat wa salam acknowledged that she was among those whom were born and raised to hate Islam and the Muslims and therefore he would not be intimate with her as a wife until she herself accepted him as a husband and therefore in the authentic hadith authenticated by albani in a mere headband Sophia says the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to be the most hatred person to my heart for he killed my husband and I was a newlywed wife and he killed my father and he killed my own brother so the Prophet kept on giving me justifications and he would say your father used to do this and used to do that and used to talk to the tribes of the idol worshippers to come and attack us and try to assassinate me a number of times and he did this and he did that she said he kept on opening my eyes to the truth until all that hatred departed my heart and was replaced by extreme love to the prophet alayhi salatu salam imagine the execution of her father husband and brother in one day the execution or the killing of her ex-husband what she has lost her first home banana deer and then her second home haibach being captive and enslaved all of these circumstances that are capable of not only depressing a person a normal person but rather demolishing a whole mountain all of these negative feelings the prophet alayhi al-salam catered for in allah azza wajal tested her with so many calamities only for her to come at the end as a winner as a mother of the believers as one of the wives of the Prophet as a son in this life and in paradise what more honor could any person want therefore there is always light at the end of the tunnel and never think that calamities can break you down even when you are drowning and falling down eventually once you hit rock bottom all what you can see is the top so always have hope always believe in Allah Azza WA JAL always be confident that Allah Azza WA JAL will not leave you alone after all these calamities and hardship she became the wife of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the mother of all believers and she set the prophet set his knee for her to climb and mount her camel among her attributes may Allah be pleased with her that she was from an honourable lineage at-tirmidhi reported that an assembly Malik may Allah be pleased with him narrated that Sofia once heard Hafsa been to Omar may Allah be pleased with them said that she was the daughter of a Jew and we know that Sofia have saw Ayesha they are not infallible there are human beings and sometimes in times of jealousy at times of anger people say things that they may not intend or they may intend this does not exempt them from being sinful but after all they're humans and whenever they sin they come back quickly to allah azzawajal and repent abu dharr Aleph re one of the first to embrace and accept Islam in Islam so he was among the first to accept Islam was arguing with Bilal the other then of the Prophet as someone's and he said to him you are a son of a black woman of course he's the son of a black woman he's from Abyssinia so what is wrong in that I didn't say anything wrong his mother is black yes but it wasn't said as a fact rather it was said to insult and hurt so the Prophet is awesome when he heard this said abu dharr in a cameroon fika jahiliya abu dharr there is still pre-islamic arrogance in you so this is not something to be ignored it's hurtful and it's intended to insult likewise have son Aiko wife of Sofia made a mistake and she said that Sofia is the daughter of a Jew and Sophia is and was the daughter of a Jew her father was Jewish no one is too claimed that he wasn't and I am sort of astonished when reverts accept Islam and they feel shy to say that my father is a Christian or my mother is a Jew or my ancestors are Hindus it doesn't matter what matters is you if you're a Muslim say as salman al-farisi may allah be pleased with him said when they started some of the Companions started to hint that he was in an Arab and that he was Persian he said I will Islam Allah obviously see whoohoo he boasted with the fact that my father is Islam and I have no other father than it so be proud of your conviction not of your lineage nevertheless it's hurtful when someone says it as an insult so the Prophet SAW Sophia crying and she in he asked her why are you crying she said because Huff's I said I am the son of a Jew I am the daughter of a Jew so the prophet alayhi salatu salam made this statement for history and he said to her sallallahu alaihi wasallam by Allah you are the daughter of a prophet referring to her oon and your uncle is a prophet referring to moosa and you are married to a prophet referring to himself so how dare she speak like this and sees herself over you where correctly you should see yourself over her because of all of these prophets in your family then he looked at Hafsa and said have saw fear Allah this statement should not have come out of you so fear allah azza wa jal the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam knew that his co wives were jealous of her because she was a woman of lineage she was a woman of beauty and status so they were envious they were jealous the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he got sick at the end of his life his women all gathered around him to visit so Sophia said by Allah of prophet of Allah I wish I was the one who was sick and not you now we often say this to our loved ones though it is Haram it is not permissible to wish the illness or the calamity of a person to be on you instead of him because this is not part of believing in the destiny of Allah and making dua against yourself is prohibited in Islam but this was a word or a phrase that came out of her mouth so the wives of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam started chit chatting and gossiping and as you know women talk so they said look look what she's saying is what a liar so the prophet saw them at Islam though he was sick in pain and agony he told them go and swirl water in your mouths meaning you've said something that polluted and tarnished your the purity of your mouth so they said why would we do that or prophet of Allah and he said because of what you were chit-chatting about your friend meaning Sophia and by Allah she's saying the truth and this was a testimony for Sophia may Allah be pleased with her that by Allah what she was saying was the truth and she sincerely wanted the pain of the Prophet Hassan to be on her rather than him feeling this pain and the suffering which meant how sincere and truthful she was she was a wise woman as all the books of Sarah say she was a calm woman and she was a righteous woman she died on the 25th were actually on the 52nd year of hijra at the time of mahalia may allah be pleased with her and please with mahalia she was one of the mothers of the believers and despite her upbringing despite what was done to her own closest relatives she loved the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam from all of her heart and the prophet s salatu salam made that as a fact and he said that she is telling the truth may allah azza wajal be pleased upon mother Sophia bento yay and all the mothers of the believers had Allahu Alem when his little me alayhi assalam muscle allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why the early he or sahbihi ajmain"
