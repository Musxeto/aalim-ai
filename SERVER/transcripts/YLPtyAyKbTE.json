  "transcript": "no stone and perfect with no fls at all the LA of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life way of lifeam all praise belongs to Allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his prophet Muhammad Sall alaihi wasallam I welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are going to be discussing funerals and death joining us in discussing this topic we have our de first of allim from Saudi Arabia Muhammad Shar from Canada and she from the UAE may Allah reward you all for joining us now in the last episode we were looking a little bit about preparing for death when sickness comes when you're on your deathbed now we know that this isn't the end yet the end is when death comes so the trials of Life still remain and Shan who's tried his whole life to try and pull you away from the worship of Allah trying to get you to worship other than Allah only for the purpose that he can take you to the Hellfire with him he's not going to give up in fact this is his last chance so he may be trying as hard as ever to get you to fall into disbelief if not disbelief at least a major sin or a Min something that he can get to you now we know from the stories of the salaf we have the story of iMed where thean while he was on his deathbed he wouldn't give up and I want to ask Sal just to Enlighten us a little bit about the story and the lessons from this as you mentioned thean receives you the moment you enter this life and this world he's there next to the Midwife you enter this world he hits you that's why a child cries that's what our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said accept Isa the son of Mary and his mother Isa and his mother and his mother because the grandmother prayed for also to save the mother so throughout your life he's working around the clock now you are leaving this world he will not leave you this is as you mentioned his last chance Shan doesn't give up we have to understand this doesn't give up as the prophet Salli wasallam said thean at the time of the Prophet Sall alhi wasallam when he saw the multitudes of people entering into Islam he lost hope for a why that that is the prophet sallam is telling us that the feeling he got that the people will not worship me and but then he said to himself okay I should be content with less than that they should not worship me but anything they do I accept it so he said to himself okay I'll be content and satisfied by anything among the Muslims creating hatred disputes quarrels he is doing and the they say how can you differentiate between the naps and thean how to differentiate they say The Whispers from the Naps or the Temptation from The NPS will be always the same thing you insist in it insist in it the same thing you have a problem you can't give up alcohol like AB always the same sin whereas thean no any sin what is more important to him that you sin you start your Salah allahar he comes he comes and he opens the door he reminds you about something and you follow him then you say comes away he doesn't give up he comes again with another how about this sir another offer you close the door and what is more important to him is that you sin and you lose the so he doesn't give up doesn't give up that's why he has his own strategy he has his own plan you have to understand this so he will not leave you so when immed was breathing his last and here this takes us that the prophet wasam said prompt the dying person prompt him dictate to him to say and here the Shan comes ah you're not going to die don't say it no we have to keep and they they said if he says it we keep quiet why we keep quiet the last words that came from this man's mouth or woman's mouth the K keep quiet because if he dies or she dies they go to the Jen if he or she talks about of that we repeat we repeat again say one of the things that sticks out for me with the prophet's death sallallahu alaihi wasallam we were talking about it earlier and his focus sallallahu alaihi wasallam on making sure that you know cuz we've been talking about inheritance sorry the will and Sun death but the prophet Sall emphasis on making sure that people are in the right path after he dies right so you have the examples of him saying you have the examples of him saying for example Sall alhi wasallam that I've left two things that you won't be misguided after me so long as you do it when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was sick he opened the curtain to see the people in the Masid praying and he got very happy and this is the attitude somebody who has has people that Allah placed in Trust even in their last breaths is not just to focus on themselves but making sure that their family members the community people that they deal with that they're on the right track after they die how many stories we've heard of somebody in their last death maybe they're part of some tribe or some culture and then they say something oh don't leave our deviants and then the children like maybe two three generations after they'll say we can't leave because he said this on his deathbed we can't leave you know this and and so one has to be very careful in that is actually a sign of bad ending a sign of bad ending so IM Ahmed his son was asking him to say the and this is IM and he was saying not yet not yet said my father what is it said my son the cursed one is is telling oh Ahmed oh Ahmed you escaped I couldn't do anything to you so I'm telling him not yet I cannot be sure that I am free and that I manage to escape of your evil till I die Subhan Allah so we say we were bringing in this point about mentioning the or the Shah on the death bed this is a good end are there other signs of a good ending well there are a lot of signs of good ending for example in the top of the list is saying I remember that a paramedic I don't know if it's called like this who was a Muslim and he was working on an ambulance and he said so many times I get people who are non-muslim he works in a non-muslim country and I get so many time people in accidents and they are on a dying bed by the time we take them to the hospital they die so I thought that I have no good deeds and the only good deed that I could think of is to teach them to say so on their dying bit I tell them while giving them the necessary treatment and they're you know stable and I just say Islam is a good religion if you say this word ill you'll enter paradise and I explain it to them some of them understand some of them are not in the state to understand and they say it and Subhan Allah how many people entered Islam at the dying bed and it was their salvation from Hellfire and this is why the prophet was trying hard Sall alaihi wasallam that his uncle Abu Talib say it but Allah did not will it and he did not say it so this comes on the top of the list if someone says and it was the last word then this is good but I should remind the viewers that when you are with someone on his dying bed some of the brothers may be more Roman than the Romans in the sense that he keeps on saying say and the dying person say says ill then he says sayah ill three five six times and the guy says after a while the man says listen I don't want to say it anymore I already said yes I've said it like 100 times so the Sunnah is not to keep on reminding him of it because if he said it once and that is it but if he says I need a glass of water give him the glass of water and say say because so that it would be the last thing that comes out of his mouth and Subhan Allah look what happens to to us when the majority of us if you're driving and you see an 18wheeler or 16-wheeler coming to kill you it's an accident what is the first thing that comes into your mouth Muslims practicing Muslims say or at least we say Ya Allah those who watch movies and listen to music they would use probably a four-letter word I don't want to say it but this is what always runs into their heads he Subhan Allah may Allah allow our words for all of us to be may Allah reward you going to go to a very short break inshallah so dear viewers do stay tuned inshallah we'll be back after a very short moment welcome back dear viewers we're here with our dear discussing the topic of funerals and death now just before the break sheim you mentioning one of the signs of a good death which is mentioning the or sh on a death bed now looking at the flip side we have the bad ending and you were mentioning for example some people they might utter an expletive or some bad word I remember suban just a story on this note giving the example of a bad ending and of course the bad or good ending aren't just things that come by chance it's not like you live your whole life in Disobedience and then all of a sudden you can say you know this words the reality is that your sins are going to affect you and I remember there was a sheh back in Australia and he said that when he was you know uh still a little bit Young he saw some young Muslims so he pulled over to speak to them just reminding them about Salat praying in the Masjid all of these good things and then Australia this was in Australia and then another Muslim pulled up but this Muslim wasn't a practicing Muslim very disobedient Muslim so he started to say don't listen to this guy meaning don't listen to the she he's just going to tell you nonsense you know better that you just go and enjoy yourself live your life all of these you know nonsense words and so the she he was amazed he thinking Subhan Allah you know here I am trying to call these people to Allah and he's trying to pull them away So eventually he said I'll let it be I don't want to get into an argument or a fight so he left and those two young boys they respected the Sheikh they you know loved him they knew him quite well and later that evening they actually called the sheh and they said please she come to the hospital very very quickly you remember this boy that was you know arguing with you today he's been in a car crush and he's very close to death and so the she he came of course he still wants to help him even after what he did and so he was on his death bed very very close to death and so the she was saying to him say say and all this person could say being an Arab he kept on saying this place in the Hellfire this is all he could say until Allah subhana wa tala took his soul so we can see this is the opposite this obviously is a bad ending actually I was in a car accident and airbags came out and I don't remember until afterwards but I've been in that experience as they say you can see the lights in the hospital going over and the police officer's talking to me I remember just hearing the voice and he says you're lucky you were wearing your seat belt and I say that he could have easily been the angel of death saying you should have wore your seat belt right and in those moments I'm telling you that you have no control over what you say there's no control whatsoever your brain only returns back to you maybe if you survive maybe like many hours later and then you can control your tongue but at that moment it's just whatever is in your heart it comes up and Subhan Allah this reminds me with a doctor told me practicing brother said and it was in Ramadan a Muslim was drunk brought to the hospital he made an accident and admitt to the ICU so he said I have to treat him as a doctor though in my heart I was boiling you are a Muslim drunk in Ramadan and now he's dying he said the Shan tried to play with my mind should I ask him to say the Cala or not Subhan Allah cuz he was angry judging him then he said I decided to tell him to say theala he said the kalala and he die that's why my dear brothers and sisters the issue of the Hereafter it is his you don't know maybe that particular moment that man turn to Allah that's why the belief of we don't say that this person or certify that this particular person is going to hell or even to Heaven Hell or Heaven hell and Heaven this is Allah's how Allah ends people's life this is his Allah's business not ours among the good signs there are many good signs is that a person will die while sweating the brow the forehead is sweating this is a good sign some people they think it is a bad sign no this is a good sign so when a person is sweating this is a good sign among also the good signs that you die on Friday night or Friday morning this is a good sign so if Allah blessed you and that you die on Friday night or Friday morning this is a a good sign so this how Allah ends people's life and when this of course it's it is a gift from Allah and a blessing from Allah subhana wa ta'ala but if a person is righteous and striving in his life Allah subhah wa ta'ala will inshallah end his life in a way that pleases him Subhan Allah now that you mention this like as you said you're righteous your life and inshallah you'll end upon this it's no coincidence you don't accidentally stumble into a good ending we remember the tsunami that struck Indonesia AR reached all the way to Somalia Subhan Allah look at the power of Allah you know they said this was more powerful than 500 atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and hoshima this is the power of Allah and many people were killed instantly and there was one story she was telling us he went to Arch to help in the cleanup process and as he was there soon as he got out at this city of lamoy he found a book on the ground and it struck his eyes so panel so he picked up this book and he started to flip through it and it was the book of a young girl a young muslima and she had written her name at the front and she used to write aat of Quran that she's learning a Hadith and little notes you know this is like her scrapbook and it was her pride and joy you could see you know all of these things it was also like her diary and the she was going through it saying subh look at this girl she was s years old I think I believe seven or somewhere around this age and already you see you know she's learning about her religion this means she's better than many of the others she's memorizing Quran a Hadith she's doing so many things until he got to the back of the book and what did she say she wrote a Dua to Allah subhana wa tala what was her Dua first of all she said I love Islam and then she said inshallah I want to die as a Shah I want to die as a Marty and the he had to find out who this girl was because he had the name and he found out of course that Allah subhana wa tala allowed her to die as one of the victims of the tsunami and we know again one of the signs of the Shahed is drowning so may Allah accept her Dua as being one of the ones who died as a Shaha so going into this we know that dying as a Shah no doubt is a sign of a good ending shein could you tell us some of the other signs that fulfill this category of course dying as a martyr is a sign of a good ending because it is the top of Good Deeds a true martyr is a person who dies defending the religion of Allah defending his country defending oppression but discriminate killing suicide bombing violating people's rights this is not considered to be Marty them the prophet told usam that those who are marted in the cause of Allah other than those dying at battlefields are many among them people who die drowning and all these that I'm going to mention or I'm going to mention some of so that I could pass the ball she Muhammad those who die have to be in the state of patience and acceptance if a person dies while drowning and complaining yeah why me why and he dies we would not be a martyred because he ended his life with a bad ending but the prophet tells usam those who die in drowning like this girl will actually this girl is not even had not reached the age of puberty so we say inshallah she is in Paradise as all the children are without identifying one or the other generally speaking all those who did not reach the age of puberty whether Muslims or non-muslims we believe that generally they are in Paradise the prophet said the drowning the person who drowned also those who die under a collapsed building so if an earthquake takes place and the building collaps or some heavy object falls upon a person and he's content in the sense that this is Allah's will not he's content that bring it on that he's content in the sense that it's Allah's will I have nothing to do I've tried to escape I couldn't then I accept Allah's will this is also part of martydom mam I guess we just have a few minutes left but things like burning as well true somebody died in fire accident and and you also have the example of when people have like stomach illness and then that's something actually a lot common those type of illnesses that eat away a person in t if they're patient that they have that reward from Allah subhana tala so this is a bless I mean every one of us aspires to martydom you know who of us would pass this opportunity if it came but the reality is even if this doesn't come you still have the chance of becoming a Shahed as long as you're patient you're a Believer and any one of these calamities befalls you so you see that Allah is trying to give us the chance at you know so many opportunities Subhan Allah when we're looking at a good end are there any other signs that a Believer you know can be content inshallah that he's achiev there's a cuz I know we're just about to wrap up but one of the beautiful endings is a brother that he was with his wife and many people might know that he went for omra they went for Hajj sorry and in Hajj time the bus caught on fire and all the people left the bus but himself and his wife were trapped I always say you know and they have I think they have like eight children and this brother used to be a student of knowledge and he translated books subh and the people they tried to help them come out of the bus and when they knew they couldn't come out of the bus anymore himself and his wife they started praying to Allah they went into Sal and they died saying on their way everybody knows the brother and the work that they done may Allah accept from him and in all of us will have a good ending like that I mean one would argue and say this torture this pain this Agony that he goes through well I would think that I'll give you the Glad Tiding of that inshallah he will not feel that pain because the prophet told us that the Martyr in the cause of Allah would not feel the pain of being killed except like the bite of a mosquito for inshallah this is a good ending for the brother and his wife and at the end of the day we're dead see in an Arabic we say whether you die by the sword or you die in a fire or you die by cancer or you die by blood pressure or high cholesterol or stroke or heart attack at the end of the day the result is one which is dying so each and every one of us is supposed to be considered a Walking Dead what differentiat us than the others is how we live and anticipate death subh may Allah reward you all we have come to the end of the episode inshallah we hope to have you joining us in our coming episodes and also you our dear viewers we hope inshallah that you'll join us in now coming episodes until then I greet you all way of way of"
