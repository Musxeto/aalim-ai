  "title": "Ruling on men wearing bracelets - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm sorry he's 17 years of Asia and like all 17 years youngsters he wants you know to be hip and you know wants to to be attractive so he wants to wear a bracelet that is or a band that is yellow and it's written on it inspire so what's the ruling on that first of all wearing chains and waiting such bands and and and bracelets etc it's not for men this is only for women and wearing it yellow know when women usually do this I hope but it is imitating the kaffir so it is not for us as Muslims we have to be singled out in a sense in a crowd so if you see me wearing this attire you would recognize I'm a Muslim if you see me wearing my blue jeans and a t-shirt and walking down the streets of Stockholm you still recognize and tell that I'm a Muslim why is that because there are features in us that can be identified with so when I see someone I immediately recognize that he's a Muslim I say even if I'm in the middle of the jungles of Africa as-salaam alaikum and he was Sarah come Sarah we Muslims we bond but when we imitate the kafir and we look like them and we try to do things that yeni assimilate their things this is not permissible of him"
