  "title": "Must we inspect Butter, Cheese, Milk like we do with meat? Are they halal by default Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so my question is do muslims have to pay attention to industry dairy products they consume like butter and milk as they do with meat i inspect it well its origins and ingredients aren't these products by nature the rule in islam is whenever something becomes so narrow islam makes it white and if something was so open islam restricts it and narrows it dairy products butter milk 99.9 percent is halal cheese so the default is that it is halal unless there is a reason to make us think otherwise so the default it is halal until proven otherwise you don't have to go and check the ingredients of the butter or the milk or the cheese etc as long as you don't have a reason to doubt it and allah knows best you"
