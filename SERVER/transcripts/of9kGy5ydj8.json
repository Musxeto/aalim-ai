  "title": "I don't like children, must I maintain ties of kinship with small children as well? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh amateur law from india's question is that she doesn't in short she doesn't like to mix with children and due to the fact that she doesn't want to sever the tides of kinship she wants to maybe when she meets them to call them to force herself to do this anyhow this is something that as human beings we have to train ourselves to do and we must adopt we have to adapt to different environments so when i get guests coming to my home some of them i'd like i'd love to speak with and spend time some of them are so boring but it is a duty that i must do to give them hospitality to smile in their face to do things with them to make them feel welcomed so if i do not do this i would be sinful because i'm not honoring my guest and i would be taken as an arrogant person this is why i have to adapt i have to condition myself there are folks who love to be surrounded by children and would tolerate anything a child might do such as breaking the vast or hanging in the chandeliers or whatever they love children there are people who are so irritated they become so excited and anxious and nervous around children these people need counseling they need treatment they have to condition themselves because this is life it's not always as we wish like and similar to that is that we are not like others hope us to be yet we wish that they accept us so it goes both ways so for you for example if you're talking about male cousins you're not obliged to connect to them and to honor your kinship in the sense that you mix with them if they're children if they come to your home yes but if they don't come to your home you don't have to call them you're obliged to call your uncle and your aunts etc and you're obliged to call those who are in your age who are grown-ups females but you have to try to come out of your shell because this would cause a lot of problems in the future especially when you get married and i know that a lot of girls are like this but once they get married and they get to their own children things change for the better inshallah"
