  "title": "A person who leaves the prayer out of laziness is a kafir or an apostate? (Takfir) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this is a very very long uh uh topic and a difference of opinion among Scholars I was blessed and and and privileged to go into a discussion with Dr Abu Amina Bilal Phillips in the year 2011 in Birmingham um UK in Green Lane Masjid we had a debate but a scholarly debate he had sat next to me with a visor so that we don't punch one another and yeah masallah he took the opinion that the one who leaves Salat is not a cafir and I supported the opinion that the one who leaves Salat is a cafir and we presented our evidences the most authentic opinion is there is a difference of opinion but the most authentic opinion is whoever abandons Salat per permanently whether out of laziness or deliberately is a cafir providing this is theoretical huh theoretically this is what the prophet said this is what mentioned in the Quran and and the Sunnah Allah says if they were to repent and establish they are they your brethren and Allah says number one what admitted you to Hellfire the Believers ask those dwelling in hell why are you in hell they said we were not among the those who used to pray and the prophet said the pledge between us and Them is whoever abandons it is a he committed kuur and he said inl between man and sh and kufur abandoning Salat and a number of hadiths however this is what huh theoretical meaning this is theoretical now to apply it oh wait wait wait wait because lots of us read this and say okay the brother doesn't pray with us in the office he's a CF I have gazillion of people coming to me in counseling sessions she my father doesn't pray we told him so many times he doesn't pray so can I give him Salam so many people are so eager to give to their own parents W not one or two or 10 or 20 because these youngsters take little of knowledge and they think by implementing it they're doing the right thing unfortunately Satan is utilizing them because they feel they have the power to label people you're a cfir you're a mush you're this you're that and this is where NCIS comes this is where the the comes with little knowledge and a lot of enthusiasm that derails them from the straight path no this is not the right way practical you cannot label anyone with kufur until there are conditions fulfilled and obstacles uh um avoided and this is not for any Tom Dick or Harry this is only for Scholars of Islam who know what they're doing and what they are talking about therefore coming back to your question a person who leaves Salat out of laziness and dies would I say to the people congregation don't praise janaza he's a cafir yes or no no why because he was not labeled as a cafer when he was alive he was not held at gunpoint either you pray or going to blow your head off no he was negligent maybe he prayed at the end of the night maybe he prayed when you went to the Masjid he prayed on his own when you went to the Masjid he prayed in the office we don't know so he was not labeled and this is the Practical aspect of it theoretically yes whoever abandons prayer is a cafir but to implement it we have a whole list of checklists that must be followed and Allah knows rest"
