  "transcript": "foreign we as muslims live on earth which means that we have to deal with the environment so the global warming the the whole nine yards we have to react to that we're not isolated and we can't just say that this is none of our business and we have to live in the hell with everyone else that comes after us islam teaches us to care and to react to whatever is happening around us in the following chapters you will have a glimpse of that during a wind storm so this is a natural thing that we see what to do islam does not leave this unattended there is a vicar as in hadith 166 the prophet allah whenever he saw wind blowing he used to say oh allah i ask you for its goodness that is the wind and i take refuge with you from its evil now it shows you how much the prophet allah is connected to allah azzawajal that he's asking allah even for something that we see and presume it's a natural phenomena nevertheless the prophet alaihis salam knows that this wind was sent from allah so he begs allah to grant us from its goodness and to protect us from its evil it can be a tornado it can be a hurricane it can devastate and destroy property and claims life it can claim lives so the prophet is so connected to allah azzawajal that he is asking allah and teaching us to walk on his footsteps not only that the prophet alaihis salat was also used to say upon seeing such winds a longer version of the dua allah and the good within it because the wind has many benefits pollinating the plants and the flowers and carrying lots of goodness with the wind that we cannot live without for ships to sail etc so i ask you for its goodness the good within it and the good it was sent with and i take refuge with you from its evil the evil within it and from the evil it was sent with because allah may have sent it to destroy lands or to claim lives or for any reason that allah sees fit for according to his wisdom and knowledge so i seek refuge in allah and all of this shows you how a muslim is related to the environment chapter 62 upon hearing thunder so what to say when there is rain lightning and thunder this dua that we have at hand is dua related to abdullah zubair may allah be pleased with the man with his father and some say also even abbas may allah be pleased with him and with his father so they are companions of the prophet sallallahu salaam whenever they heard the thunder they used to say glory be or how perfect he is the one whom the thunder declares his perfection with his praise as do the angels out of fear of him as a wajal so the thunder as reported in an authentic hadith is the voice of the angel ordering the clouds to go from one place to the other for its movement and this is something we don't see but we believe and when the clouds move rain falls so what should we say when rain falls chapter 63 supplication for rain hadith number 116 whenever it trained the prophet used to again supplicate to allah upon us helpful wholesome and healthy rain beneficial not harmful rain now not later this is urging allah azza because the prophet salallahu knows that if allah graces the land with rain plants would grow cattle would feed humans would benefit from this and this is when the rain is helpful and wholesome and healthy when it does not have any destruction in it because it can be the cause of floods it can be the cause of destruction and drowning of crops so we ask allah azzawajal to make it beneficial and whenever the prophet alaihis salatu was praying to allah to send rain for us he would ask allah azzawajal relentlessly to send rain for us hadith 170 the prophet used to say allah allah [Music] and this is asking allah thrice which indicates that when you want to insist on allah because you're begging allah you're expressing your poverty to allah you do that three times in hadith 171 he would elaborate and he would say allah by rainfall to whom provide water for your servants and your cattle these animals they're all your creatures and servants spread out your mercy and resurrect your dead land [Music] the famine the drought that we're suffering no one can relieve us from it except you allah [Music]"
