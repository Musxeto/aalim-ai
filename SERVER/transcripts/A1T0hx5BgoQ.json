  "transcript": "the prophet when he came to the interaction with wives he was the role model and he used to encourage women and men to live in harmony but men had the upper hand so he used to always advise them he used to sayat the best among the men in Iman is the best in character and the best of them is the best to his women so you want to know if you're the best look how you deal with your wife bracket bracket s if you have more than one wife may Allah be with you but if you have one wife you're alhamdulillah you believe in monism inshallah and in but you have to be be careful because it's a very thin line if you sleep you go to hell that is why the prophet said and we will come to talk about this later on generally speaking with strangers we are very good in character we laugh we smile we're kind we we're generous but when it comes to our wives we are a different person and a lot of the women complain my husband is always grumpy my husband is always not communicating he doesn't speak to us few hours ago I had a counseling session with a couple from America and uh couple were together the wife was weeping what's your complaint he never talks to me he never has any quality time with me he never Smiles in my face I only am responsible for the children so I spoke to the boy or to the man and I said is what she's saying true he said yes I said why he said I'm busy I'm doing work I'm collecting for the family blah blah blah I said to him two or three questions number one when was the last time you said to her words of compassion he said such as mashallah you don't know what compassion is I love you I miss you said I don't remember so I said okay when was the last time you encouraged her and said mashallah the food is excellent mashallah you look beautiful nice dress I love your makeup I like you the way you're wearing your hair I he said no never he said okay would you like her to hear it from someone else said of course not said okay there's a void an emptiness in her heart fill it up this is what I do with my wife alhamdulillah after 40 years of marriage when I travel I text her every single day three four times I miss you I love you I want the days to go inshallah quickly so that I can see you again and she says what's wrong what's happening what what what did you do something wrong confess This is how we roll This is how we work even if I don't want to I do it because this ignites the love and this is what you should do unfortunately a lot of the men don't do that don't follow the role of the Prophet wasam The Prophet never ever laid a hand on a woman never beat his wife in his life alhamdulillah he's our role model I don't want to put you on the hot seat but if I said those who did hit their wives raise your hands I think everybody will leave so no need no need the prophet wasam said a lot of the women came to my wives complaining from their men that they beat them up by Allah the prophet swears they are not the best of you you lay your hand on a woman you're not a real man you're a real man come and face someone your sides go and do this with her brother or with her uncle or with her father you won't dare because they'll beat the heck out of you but this wife this poor woman she's afraid of I divorce you she's afraid for the three four children she has she's afraid because she doesn't have qualification to work or to earn that's why she has to zip it up fear Allah on the far extreme we have men who took off their pants this is not rated R don't worry took off their pants and made their wives wear them so the wives are the men of the house the woman goes and travels with without Maham she mixes with men she flirts with men she does Haram things and the man is I'm happy she's a good woman this is Haram you have to do what the prophet didat be kind gentle sweet but at the same time be firm when it is related to Halal and Haram issues also the way of the Prophet was am that he used to give a helping hand to his wives which most of us don't may Allah be pleased with her was was asked what work did the prophet do in his home she said he used to work in assisting his wives until the Salat is called he leaves and goes for Salat so in his house he used to as she said in another Hadith he used to clean his clothes from any uh uh fleas he used to milk his own sheep or goat he used to serve himself saw his own garments uh uh um string his own shoes and fix his own bucket so this this is the prophet work at the house what do we men do in the house sit on our lazy chair have three remote controls in front of us and a big popcorn and give instructions give me water give me Diet Pepsi put some ice I need foot massage I need and this is what we do in the house we are like kings then we expect all of these things without giving in return and the prophet though he had more than one wife he was fair and his fairness is that he divides equally the number of knights he's fair in expenditure of Finance money he doesn't f one over the other and he sees them and this is something a lot of those who have wives multiple wives don't know of he sees them every single day says me Allah be pleased with her every single day the prophet used to pass by all of us nine wives every single house he passes every single day and he comes and approaches without touching you no hky puny but just go how are you how are things are fine and he checks on them until he reaches the last one which he will spend the night and he stays there most of men who have two or more wives on the wife day or night he ignores the second one totally not talking to her not speaking to her not doing anything so the prophet used to do this by the way twice a day after F and after after fuder he um he used to as says after F only Salam alaykum everything is fine and he leaves in F after says is when he sits nine homes he sits for 5 10 minutes of our things any coffee anything he talks normally and goes to the second third fourth fifth 6th 7th eighth and to the ninth house to settle there where is this beautiful when I have women coming to me complaining that their husband did not speak for the with them for the past 3 months W I had letters written and sent to me in my Masjid and I read the letter it's from the daughter she's in her mid 20s she says my father did not speak with my mother for two years may Allah rest his soul in peace he died he was an airline captain and I know personally and she says if you can put some sense in his head 2 years he comes and leaves like a guest she irons she cooks she serves everything but he does not speak with her he lives in a room and she lives in another room what kind of a man is this is this the way of the Prophet I know men would justify this oh sh you don't know what she did she did this she said that this is not a reason do what the prophet did and you will be a real man"
