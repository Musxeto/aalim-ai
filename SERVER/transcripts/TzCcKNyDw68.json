  "transcript": "I want to ask if giving money as sodak and sodak means charity uh to Christian kids cancer hospital is it permissible or not well giving charity generally is permissible whether to Believers or disbelievers there's no problem in that even if you feed or give water to a dog Allah would forgive your sins a dog why because every living creature being kind to that living creature Allah grants you reward and gives you sodak and you can compare Apple to Apple look at the beauty of Islam some people think and say that what does Islam have all what it preaches is hate terrorism killing people don't be delusional be fair once in your life go through the teachings of Islam no religion is like the Islam in its kindness and its Purity and its beauty Islam tells you to do everything that is good and natural and logical and a part part of the things that Islam tells us to do is that we be kind to any living creature even to dogs the prophet tells us a prostitute saw a dog stranded in the desert almost dying of thirst she goes down in another narration another man did this she he goes down to a well and he puts his shoe in his mouth fills it up with water and comes up the well with the shoe with the water in it in his mouth because he cannot climb up and he gives the water to the dog because he appreciates The Thirst of the dog he was in his shoes a while ago and Allah Asel forgave his sins and forgave The Prostitute sins because of that good deed what a religion is this forgiving your sins because you're kind to a dog now compare Apple to Apple if you're kind to someone who is ill with cancer if you help a hospital for Christian children or for Muslim children for any uh denomination as long as they children they're needy and they need help and you have access of money and you give it to them Allah would reward you for that but if you harm others if you terrify others if you kill civilians or those who we have pledge pledges and and and contracts and treaties with if you terrorize innocent people if you Slaughter like sheep people who are not combatant and you claim that this is Islam by Allah this is not Islam call it in other religion it has nothing to relate with to Islam all what you guys do is tarnish the reputation of Islam and those who come to your rescue and assistance have nothing to do with Islam leave all of this and go help dogs and give them water it's better for you at the side of Allah rather than tarnishing the reputation of Islam so yes you can give charity but you cannot give zakat as mentioned in Surah 9ahba verse 60 zakat it can be only be given to the eight categories mentioned in the Quran and the disbelievers cannot take from zakat except one category and this is disputable for those who their hearts are declined to Islam that is sorry their hearts are inclined uh to towards Islam they want to embrace Islam and they have influence over others in this case this is uh uh permissible inshallah"
