  "title": "Spotting just before Umrah and saw the flow of blood afterwards - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ayesha she says I was putting just before going for homra I considered it as misty harbor as previous cycles I spot for a few days then a day or two it breaks then spot again then comes my period I completed the whole Umbra came back home to find that the period has started what is the ruling have I committed a mistake I'm still in the state of am I still in the set of ROM and will I have to finish Amara again Aisha the most authentic opinion is that the spotting a woman gets before her period does not count as a period why a lot of the women who are in the state of their purity get spottings for three days four days and then they get their menses so why not consider these four days part of the regular menses because a lot of women get these and get nothing afterwards to three days of purity so they've stopped for praying for four or three days for nothing menses in Arabic means to flow you say hallelujah D Desalle when you say that the valley the water has flown in it you use the word height or how therefore the scholars say you do not stop from praying or doing whatever you want to do from the worship until you see the flow of the blood by default your pure you did your Umbra your pure you came home and you saw your the flow of the blood this doesn't impact your Umbra and your Umbra is correct inshallah"
