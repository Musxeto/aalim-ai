  "transcript": "this is a question that I had asked some time back but my line wasn't clear so you weren't able to get the question right uh so the question was there are VPN that give free data to access the internet and in my country we Maj have two Network providers the first network provider blocked us from getting this free data and the second network provider it is still working uh now I was thinking uh that uh when we use this free data uh because it is it is it is it is reasonable that when we use uh this free data we don't buy the we don't buy the the data that the network providers provide so I was like is it wrong for us to use this no there is no problem Anna listen to me listen to me any network provider if there is a contract between us and I signed a contract this contract is binding if the network provider is open in the air and they say don't use our Network unless you buy the data from us okay restrict me if I can get access to free data and I open my Wi-Fi and it says um this network provider and this network provider are available and I it anyone I want you don't want me to access it block me but if it's found in the air openly and I'm not cheating and I'm not going against any contract that I've signed there's no problem in using it at all"
