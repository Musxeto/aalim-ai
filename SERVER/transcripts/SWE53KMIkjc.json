  "transcript": "foreign chapter 46 when stricken with a mishap or overtaken by an affair what should one say the prophet alaihis salat was told us to say allah has decreed and what he wills he does for verily if let's in the work of the devil what does that mean when things go south and we don't like the outcome this is what shaytan does to us he puts lots of regret and remorse in our hearts and we express this by saying if i did not do this if i managed to avoid this if i hadn't gone on that day none of this would have happened this big if if is something that satan uses as a tool to throw such regret in our hearts and such regret goes against our belief that allah the almighty had written everything that is going to happen till the day of judgment 50 000 years before creating the whole universe everything has been written and overdone with so when i have an accident and i come and look at my car wrecked or even totaled and i say oh if i didn't go to work that day or if i managed to slow down over if i managed to avoid whatever caused the accident i would not have had that accident this is not the right way of doing of saying things rather we should say allah has decreed and what he wills he does submission because this has been decreed 50 000 years before allah created the whole of the creation the whole of the universe what use is it for you to come and complain now and to be sorry and regretful if i hadn't done this none of that would have had happened no this is from shaytan you should have full trust in allah azzawajal and say kadarullah the following chapter deals with what to say when someone is blessed with a child congratulating one who has had a child and what or how to respond to it so there is a dua the compiler of the book has written which goes as follows [Music] s or the one that was gifted to you may you thank the bestower that is allah may the child reach its prime age and me may you be granted its righteousness meaning that may it grow may the child grow to be dutiful and obedient to you and you respond when someone says this to you by saying may allah bless you for may allah bless for you and may he bless you may allah reward you with goodness bestow upon you the same and reward you handsomely these beautiful words to be exchanged were not from the prophet's words these were taught to us by one of the great tabian [Music] so he's not a companion he's a follower of the companions and he is al-hassan may allah have mercy on his soul so these beautiful words are not from the sunnah nevertheless they are beautiful duas that can be used in exchange and to be exchanged when a person is blessed with a child moving on to the following chapter now a person has been blessed by a child what do we do in order to protect them placing children under allah's protection hadith number 146 the prophet used to say uh i command you to the protection of allah i command you two that is al-hasan and hussein his two grandchildren i commend you to the protection of allah perfect words from every all words of allah are perfect you cannot find any flaws in them and on top of that is the quran mingli shaytan from every devil waham every insect everything that goes and walks the earth to harm people reptiles uh um and the likes and women and from every evil eye so this is a protection for your children of course if you recall long ago we said the dua that we say in the morning and the evening which helps protect your children even if you don't say this dua but this beautiful dua is an extra protection with the grace of allah the almighty this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave foreign"
