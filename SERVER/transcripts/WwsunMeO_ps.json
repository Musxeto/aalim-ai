  "transcript": "so I don't know about UMO K until about three months ago so I'm I'm worried about the validity validity of my previous fast as well as the fast of the Muslims in my community because the norm is to go off of the North America timetable where feder about 30 minutes after UMO but um I'm in a group chat of a mjid that I've attended so is it obligatory for me to tell them to follow umak keeping in mind that it's likely likely that they would repand me as a moderator previously told me to not anything that could confuse people yes I quite agree with that Imam if you're not a person of knowledge qualified and capable of explaining and debating and showing with evidence your point of view might as well just keep a lid on it and don't confuse the masses and the community the issue of timetable is something that was founded and studied and followed in the Arabian Peninsula and it's widely accepted and quite accurate and of course with the exception of Isa uh prayer time because it is totally wrong to have it set to 90 minutes throughout the whole year 11 months a year after sunset this is totally wrong and I don't know why they're keeping doing it but may Allah protect us now for some other countries that may differ in timings and latitude altitude or whatever they long longitude and latitude such as North America uh countries that are far north like Sweden and the likes they claim that the there is a difference in whether it's 15° or 18° to be applied and this is something that I have no knowledge of yet I trust the timetable is it to be applied in these regions this needs to be researched the there is the Islamic Sciences of Karachi timetable there is the isna timetable there is uh um Egypt timetable and they all have differences you as a Layman if you follow the Masjid that is next to you this would exempt you from any sin because as as a Muslim either I have to see it with my own eyes and have knowledge of it or I follow the MU the guy that calls the prayer and it's in his neck it's on his shoulders the prophet said the IM guarantees the validity of your prayer and the MU he's in trusted with the times of prayer he calls a time wrong and you break your fast it's his neck not yours because you don't have the ability to detect the time of prayer you don't have the knowledge you don't see it with your own eyes so you depend on him and that would help you inshallah and relieve you from sin"
