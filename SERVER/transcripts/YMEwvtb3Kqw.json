  "transcript": "from the uk says i have a book where a lot of the atkar are written on it and these that are not the prescribed one that we should say after salat so can i say it of the salat the answer is no you are allowed to say the atkar that were taught to us the prescribed ones by the prophet salaam to us yeah you can say that ayatollah kursi the last three calls etc the whole nine yards no problem now if you have other atkar which is which is not haram by itself but it was not said by the prophet sallam after particular salat then doing that would become an innovation because you're adding something to the doing of the prophet hashem which he did not do you can do that between maghrib and isha you can do that after isha before midnight after midnight when it's a general time not related to yeah i finished my maghrib now i'm doing my athkar and allah azza knows best"
