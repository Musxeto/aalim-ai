  "title": "Who should lead prayer if I miss the congregation, me or one who already prayed fard Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if I'm not mistaken a couple of episodes ago one brother asked you um if he comes late for the congregation um uh if it's okay for him to ask the one who had already prayed to join him in the prayer and you said it's okay so I kind of wanted to follow up on that in that situation um who should lead the prayer um you know can the one who had all the to pray or should the one who is about to pray do it it doesn't matter both ways are fine basically and ideally speaking the one who memorizes the Quran most would be the one who leads the prayer it doesn't matter whether the IM is the one praying the far or praying voluntary prayers and the evidence backing this up is the famous Hadith of mu IB jabal we know that mu jabal may Allah be pleased with him one of was one of the most learned Companions and a scholar among the Companions and in the Hadith the authentic Hadith narrated by bukari and others he used to attend Isa prayer with the prophet and after concluding the prayer he used to go to his tribe and lead them in Isa which is ISA for him uh which is voluntary for him and F for them none of them objected and said hey hey wait we should be leading the prayer because we're praying F and you're praying voluntary because he was the most knowledgeable the most uh among them who memorizes the Quran so it doesn't matter which one leads because the prayer is valid both ways ideally speaking it should be the one with more Quran and Allah Knows Best"
