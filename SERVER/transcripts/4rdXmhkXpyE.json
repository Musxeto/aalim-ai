  "transcript": "he says yeah people praying with chair in rows break the row how should one place his chair if he's praying in rows if there is no place in the Masjid specifically for this that's a valid question and to answer your question as we say that I as an individual what I obliged to do regardless of everyone else I'm supposed to pray in the Masjid when I'm capable and I am a male so I am praying in the mid I have a problem with my knees with my back with any other injury I can't prostrate or at least I cannot sit in prayer normally I have to sit on a chair so what to do initially I'm obliged while standing to stand in line yes or no the answer is yes but no no no no don't but me rather listen listen to the end if I'm originally ordered instructed to pray in the line because when the prophet saw one of his companions a little bit ahead of the line he poked him with a stick in his hand so that he would stand in line so the chest of the worshippers their shoulders are aligned so this is what I'm obliged to do now in order to have this I need my chair to be behind me which would mean that the row behind me there can't be a person capable of praying right behind me because he would not have a place to prostrate him so what is the alternative number one what are the choices on the table number one I don't pray in the Masjid this is not a valid Choice number two that I stand half a meter ahead of the row again this is not permissible because the prophet prohibited me from doing so option number three that I pray normally and the one behind me has the option of either praying behind me and when he wants to prostrate he goes one step backwards and this might not be feasible or they squeeze themselves to prostrate or they leave the Gap open option number four is is to choose a very tiny small chair that could fit right underneath me and it would not take a huge space from the row behind this is a win-win situation option number five which is very convenient and possible but a lot of the people are lazy to do it is that once you want to sit on the chair you simply drag the chair half a meter in front while stepping forward and sit so behind you there is normal space in the row for a person behind you to prostrate once you stand up give it few seconds until you clear that the one behind you has stood up then you get the seat back to where it was and you stand in the row and Allah Asel Knows Best"
