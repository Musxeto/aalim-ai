  "transcript": "what's how should we Muslims treat to family members working colleagues who are strict to us angry well not like merciful or should we treat them according to the Sunnah again I always use this don't be offended when a dog barks at you you never fall on your hands and knees to bark back so when people of ignorance even if they're dear to you and you love them and you respect them and they're related to you or colleagues or friends treat you badly or angrily don't react who cares what counts is what's in your heart we can always go down to people's levels if they curse we can curse if they beat us we can beat them back but this doesn't make us any better the prophet said a strong man is not a person who defeats others in fighting and wrestling rather a strong man is the one who controls himself in anger this is the real man so when they abuse you when they misbehave with you ignore them give them a big smile never defeat never defend yourself never argue with them or talk back ignore it believe me they will with all due respect act like a dog after a while they'll bark bark bark and then they'll get tired because you're not responding they have failed to provoke you to answer back they will let go but the moment you show a reaction or a negative response they will continue to bark till the day of judgment um I mean"
