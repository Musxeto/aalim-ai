  "title": "The most beloved person to Allah - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] are we supposed to do this in Arabic or in English because everybody speaks Arabic they look like as if they speak Arabic anyhow I'll make it as short as possible I shouldn't take more than 3 hours inshallah um the the the title of this talk is the most beloved person to Allah and it could have been said in a different way in the the sense that we could have stated the tasks that entitle a person to be among those beloved to Allah however I remember about 20 years ago or plus I was in a lecture with ABD may Allah have mercy and his soul one of the great imams of Hadith and one of the contemporaries of albani and he read this Hadith in 5 minutes and commented lightly uh uh upon it but I never could forget this Hadith and it was a very beautiful Hadith that highlights the importance of character in Islam something that a lot of the Muslims seem to neglect nowadays they tend to focus on other parts of the Sunnah especially the parts that may gain them some benefit and for the brothers me they focus on marrying more than one wife and when they you ask them mashallah which is is a but providing that you can fulfill the obligations the sisters mallah focus on wearing the gloves for example which is good but at the same time they watch movies and listen into music so what kind of uh uh um wrong attitude towards accepting and taking Islam we have to take Islam as a whole and among the most important topics to be adopted by a Muslim so that he would be qualified to be a practicing Muslim not just a Muslim that you should work on your character on your AK on your ethics on your moral conduct because this is what counts on the day of judgment among others the prophet says the closest among you from me in Paradise or on the day of judgment are those who have excellent character so this helps a lot if we try to work on it and learn the things that make us close to Allah this Hadith was [Music] uh reported byb abun and Omar known asdah may Allah be pleased with him he's the one who narrated thei he said that the prophet sallallah alai wasallam said and I'll read it in English the most beloved of people to Allah is the one and this is what we want to be isn't that true we want to be the most beloved people to Allah is the one who brings most benefit to the people and the most beloved of Deeds to Allah is making a Muslim happy or relieving him from hardship oray or paying off his debt or warding off hunger from him the prophet says for me to go with my Muslim brother to meet his need is dearer to me than observing in this mosque meaning the mosque of Medina not only for one day the prophet says in this MOS for a month and whoever does not act upon his anger Allah will not expose him and whoever suppresses his rage even though he's able to express it Allah will fill up his heart with Hope on the day of judgment judement and whoever goes with his Muslim brother to meet his need until it is accomplished Allah will make him stand firm on the day when all feet will slip and the prophet sayam concluding this great Hadith and bad character or conduct spoils Deeds as vinegar spoils honey now this Hadith by itself requires six or seven devoted lectures at least but unfortunately we don't have the time nor maybe the willpower to be able to do this but the least we could do is remember this Hadith and see do we fit in the description that the prophet is giving to Those whom Allah loves or not first of all the prophet says the most beloved people to Allah and in here we learn that Allah loves subhana wa ta'ala so many times the Christians say your lord throws people in Hell your lord instructs hands to be chopped necks or heads to be uh uh cut Etc and you don't have what we have in Christianity Jesus Christ is the Lord Of Love of Mercy Etc well we believe that this is all nonsense because religion is the religion of balance there is love there is punishment there is reward as well we also believe that Allah the almighty loves and W he I don't have to explain it translate this or it's understood when you have a Lord that loves you you are in good hands the prophet said by Allah Allah would not throw those whom he loves in hell and this is a very important thing if you want to be among those who go to paradise and Escape hell you have to be among those whom Allah loves you does Allah love you how would I know with my bank account or with my gorgeous wife or with my good job or with my healthy body are these signs of Happiness are these signs that Allah love us the answer is no and we can go on and on on this but I don't want to divert from the topic therefore you have to look into yourself does Allah love me and before you ask this question do I love Allah Asel if yes then does Allah love me you have to focus on your Deeds because the Jews and the Christians said that we are the sons of Allah and we are the Beloved ones to Allah and Allah falsified this allegation this is not true if you wish Allah to love you there are a number of things you have to do on top of them the prophet saysat or Allah says in the Quran you have to follow the prophet wasam then you will gain Allah's love following the prophet Alam is not very easy it's not only prolonging your and shortening your thought these are one of the Sun and they are essential and they're important but they're not everything you have to follow him in his character in the way he used to treat his wives in the way he used to treat his neighbors in the way he used to treat the non-muslims you have to follow him in night prayer you have to follow him in voluntary fasting you have to follow him in giving Daw to others you have to following him to follow him in devoting your life your death your prayer your sacrifice to the sake of Allah if you do this inshallah Allah will love you if not you have a problem the prophet says the most beloved of people to Allah I would have expected that the the what would follow would be is the person who prays eight hours every night or is a person who fasts and never breaks his fasting or is a person who gives all of his money in charity for example or does this or does that no the prophet is highlighting a very important issue and that is to benefit others so praying at night is good for you it's not good for me praying uh fasting voluntary days it's good for you it's not good for the community so the prophet is highlighting this important point the most beloved of people to Allah is the one who brings most benefit to the people what kind of benefit well different kinds all that is considered to be benefit it is considered to be benefit you help them physically you help them financially you help them by putting a good word so that they would utilize this in getting a good job a decent place to live you do this you do that all of these are considered to be parts of the benefit that you would benefit Muslims so ask yourself when was it the last time I benefited a Muslim if today mallah you're doing a good job keep up keep it up keep doing good things for others for the Muslims for the community as a whole and the prophet says and the most beloved of Deeds to Allah is making a Muslim happy so you have to make others happy but you have to be careful because my brother Muslim here is happy if I give him a joint so is this kind of Happiness I'd like to spread or giving him a drink or maybe uh uh introducing him to a blind date is this Hal no you have to make him happy within the boundaries of sh which which which pleases Allah if he's happy if I give him the the latest pirated uh copy of a movie this does not make me among those whom Allah love this makes me among whom Allah hates and would punish on the day of judgment because I'm facilitating sh I'm facilitating evil I'm calling him to sin and I'm helping him to do this so the most beloved of Deeds to Allah is making a Muslim happy how would I make a Muslim happy if someone is carrying a big box you give him a helping hand how would he feel gratitude in Arabia we don't have this as much here so many things you guys have more than we do when you come to a narrow road and only one car can pass you wait patiently in Arabia play chicken let's say who is bravest and the people when they come they weigh their hands in gratitude this makes you happy I've done something good and you could you know argue this and say well this is the system no Islam tells you you make your system you make make others happy give a lending hand if someone's kid is unable to study mathematics and you are good in mathematics I'll give you half an hour of my time if someone wants to learn the Quran and is aable to recite the fa he's a Muslim he's a new revert spend with him an hour or two give an introduce joy to him and Allah considers this to be among the best Deeds that you make make a Muslim happy the prophet goes on or relieving him of hardship if a Muslim is in distress and you relieve him from his hardship Subhan Allah if you do this Allah will relieve you from the Calamity and hardship of the day of of judgment when things are really difficult on the day of judgment Allah the prophet tells us all the people will be gathered in an open in an open area naked as Allah has created them men and women uncircumcized barefooted and they will wait there until Allah Wills ITA may Allah be pleased with her said oh prophet of Allah women and men make it together in the same place he said they have something that bothers them something that worries them they don't have even the heart to Blink or to look anywhere else they are so frightened the prophet tells us that the sun draws closer to their heads until each individual sweat and the sweat reaches according to your Deeds so if you have excellent and Good Deeds the sweat would reach your heels and if your Deeds are not that much they would reach your your knees and if I have good deeds and bad Deeds it would reach your waist your own sweat you sweat and that the sweat would reach this area and if you have little Good Deeds you will be or you will be in your sweat up to up till your mouth and you would not be able to breathe or to talk or to do anything it's a horrible day the prophet is telling usat if you relieve your brother from hardship this is among the best Deeds that Allah loves what kind of hardships all different kind kind of hard ship that bring distress that bring uh uh depression to your brother releve him sometimes all what you need is a an ear to listen to his problems and give him your Insight so many times we listen to Brothers complaining about their wives about their children about their bosses and one would say would wouldn't this be yes if it's just for the sake of chitchatting yes it would be but if is for the sake of complaining and you giving a helping hand or giving a good advice a solid advice no this is not so many times we listen to people complain and we give them a proper advice and they say may Allah reward you you've comforted my heart now I know what to do they need a decision they need a help that you can provide but I have this to do I have that to do so many excuses and on the day of judgment not only that in our grave we would have wished that we've spent this time in seeking Allah's pleasure the prophet says or warding off that is sorry uh or paying off his debt now three things H making him happy or relieving him from hardship or paying off his debt one would say I need this we all need this don't we don't we have any Mah charitable person person a donor rich guy would pay all of our debts the the issue of debt is very uh um important on uh the day of judgment lending people money is a source of or it's a fountain of Good Deeds imagine that listen to this Hadith the prophet saids whoever lends silver that is money twice he will get the reward of it once as S as Charity so I give you ,000 and you return it and then I give someone else ,000 and I return it and it's my in my pocket Allah would reward me 1,000 pounds in charity as if I gave it away and it's not coming back to me Subhan Allah W not here in S I know people that have money devoted to lending people and they come to me and say and and they come to my wife she's the one who's doing the finance and and the lending they give her money and she they say this money is not for charity it's only for borrowing so someone had a problem with the floods you heard the floods in jeda they lost their houses so they she gives them 20,000 r on the account that they return it back in 6 months time and they do this so the money keeps on circulating these people are the best investors because the money is still there and they are utilizing it and lending it to people not only that the prophet saysat whoever awaits someone who's unable to pay his debt then every single day Allah would reward him the same amount in s not only that so when the following the second time comes and he's unable to pay it Allah and he waits for it wait for the man Allah would give him every day twice as this is mind-blowing this is authentic Hadith let me explain it to you if I have ,000 I wouldn't be here but this is beside the point if I had ,000 and I give it to my brother for a week and the week is over and he says W I'm broke I can't pay it can you give me another month and I said okay this month every single day Allah registers to me 1,000 charity this means how much £30,000 at the end of the month is Charity now theend the month is over the 30 days are over so I go to the brother brother where is my ,000 he says wall I don't have money I I don't know what to do I'm so embarrassed I'm so and so said okay I'll wait because I am waiting after the first the the month is over the prophet says that every day it's £2,000 charity and I'm sitting home so imagine if I if I knew this keep the money take it I don't want it it's generating regenerating so when I come to the issue of lending money I should think twice because so many times When someone knocks on my door I look through the eye and say what does he want he wants money okay I tell my children take my wallet and put it under the bed so when brother how are you yes I need 50 to do this W I don't have money I don't have my wallet even if I had I would have Subhan Allah we always put obstacles maybe one would say a because you would you were not stabbed in the back as we have no we all have been stabbed in the back but you're doing it for the sake of who when you go in your grave how many B uh bank accounts will you take with you how much money would you take with you how many checkbooks are you allowed or credit cards nothing zero so invest and not do doing that blindly to any Tom Dick or Harry who comes and knocks in the door and you give him all what you have give it to someone who's like me I was joking no alhamdulillah I don't need your money may Allah bless your money but utilize your money and do this for the sake of Allah and then the fourth thing the pro the prophet says or warding off hunger from him then this is one of the great deeds in Islam and that is that you feed the food that you feed those who come to you Allah says in the Quran the people of Jenna are talking to the people of hell what made you enter hell they said number one we weren't among those worshippers who prayed number two we did not used to feed the poor the prophet as in the ABD pleas with him one of the great Scholars of the of Jews he said when I heard of the Prophet coming to Medina I said I have to see this man and he the minute he saw him he said I knew that his face was not the face of a liar and the first thing he said spread peace and feed the food so feeding people is a a blessing it's a it's a gift and especially if your brother is in hunger unfortunately now it's becoming a trend in the Muslim world you bcot a Muslim country the people the Muslims die out of starvation and it's all for the benefit of humanity Subhan Allah how many poor people in your own native countries do you know who are starving now what did you do for them nothing why the money I have I'm saving it Mah for what for no no no no I'm buying a new car or I'm I'm getting a new plasma I want to have 36 it's too small I mean something that's big I need a new audio system I need to do this I need Subhan Allah our children the the the the cavities are eating and consuming their teeth because of the amount of candies they take while our brothers are suffering our brothers in Gaza I heard this from uh people they're saying that a number of households six or seven families gather on one onion and they're happy they're they're content alhamdulillah this is risk from Allah want onion you kidding me they don't have food yet we are complaining ah the benefits were late 2 days ah we did not do this the government is not doing enough we don't have enough money we don't have enough luxuries we don't have this and that we focus always on the wrong things the prophet goes on as I said this we don't have enough time so I'm going to try uh to go through it as as fast as possible so that we would learn this Hadith inshah and maybe benefit one or two points that we would apply in our lives the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says for me for who for the prophet he's talking about himself now the prophet does not say a lie so so you have to know and look at his priorities he says for me to go with my Muslim brother to meet his need is dearer than observing in thisth in this mosque for a month you know h i don't have to explain this to stay one month for the sake of Allah praying five times a day in the Masid of Medina one month this is not equivalent in the eyes of the prophet in going with my Muslim brother so that he would meet his need what kind of need any need I need you to go to with me tomorrow to uh the court to testify on something you saw not on a l again huh on on a fact I'm tired I have to go to the gym um my my son has a party at school I have to attend go with your brother help him inter intered with him do what he wants you to do I need you to drop me in somewhere because I have a very important uh interview for a job and I would want I I can't find anyone except you to to drop me there do this with the intention of helping your brother to meet his need better than for a whole month this is a lot not in any Masid in a Masid that one Salah is equivalent to a thous elsewhere with the exception of and the prophet says moves on now to something that may not affect others uh uh uh directly but it has an impact again but on the negative side in the first Hadith the prophet is telling us to do positive things now I don't have to reiterate the fact that if these Deeds are the best to Allah then the opposite that is the worst Deeds to Allah are the opposite so if the best deed is to bring joy to and happiness to to your brother Muslim so if you sadden him if you depress him if you harm him then definitely this is among the worst Deeds that you can do at the sight of Allah instead of feeding your hungry Muslim you make him starve or you indebt him you make him fall into Debs then all of these are part of the worst Deeds that you can do at the sight of Allah then the prophet goes on to say and whoever does not act upon his anger Allah will not expose him acting upon one's anger what is this the scholars say that if you are you know chill cool if you don't act upon your anger then Allah would conceal your shortcomings if someone angers me and I don't do anything and I say okay I'm going to suppress my anger would anybody know that I curse or I shout or I say bad words or I'm I fight no because I stopped myself I uh uh uh controlled my anger and I did not act accordingly and this is why the prophet Alam when he was uh uh asked by one of his companions to give him and to give him advice and he said what did the prophet say Do not become angry okay okay what else do not become angry do not become angry do not become angry what does this mean this means that it is extremely dangerous in in Islam to become angry she if I don't become angry I'm not a man do you mean to tell me that I'm walking with my wife and someone says bad things to my wife or does something to her and don't become angry what is this no the prophet is telling you not to act upon your anger everyone has to become angry your blood boils in your veins when something wrong happens you're a jealous Muslim you are a true Muslim you have to have this anger in your heart but you have to channel it so if someone tells me I get angry a lot so he says uh they nickname me in my family AK-47 you know AK-47 The Clash the C why he says because whenever ever I'm angry I divorce my [Laughter] wife masallah what see well I'm very angry I always do this with my wife and he is lying he's not angry he's just expressing himself because if he was angry this anger would be even against someone who is 64 and lots of muscles not necessarily from Brussels he should yeah but when it comes to this m okay now I'm going to control my anger for the sake of Allah but when it comes for the bues when it comes for the poor wife when it comes for the children no he does not control himself this anger is not genuine so each one of us must get angry every now and then the prophet is telling you do not act upon your anger so if you're angry with your child don't spank him spanking the child or any grown-up on the face is Haram which means you cannot even box because boxing involves hitting this is not our topic anyhow so do not act upon your anger not only this the prophet says giving you the glad Tidings that whoever suppresses his rage even though he is able to express it Allah will fill his heart with Hope on the day of judgment okay what's the difference now in the first you have to control your anger so that Allah would not expose your shortcoming here you're suppressing or repressing your rage though you are able to do it what is the meant by you're able to express meaning that I can express my agage with my children if I hit my son who you to to to to blame me of course I think in this country it's not allowed H yeah in Arab alhamdulillah we still we can do that you know baseball B no we don't do it this alhamdulillah we don't we don't hit our children with the grace of Allah but still if I do this I can do it if I uh uh uh come out and express my anger or rage on my wife on my coworker if I'm driving on the road and somebody cuts through me and I hit him back I expressed my rage I can do this I can't afford it I'm insured alhamdulillah the prophet says if you can express this rage but you still suppress it what will happen Allah would fill your heart with Hope on the day of judgment so if my heart is filled with hope do you think Allah would throw me in hell he is the one who filled it up with hope this means that I will go straight to paradise not only that in another Hadith the prophet said that whoever suppresses his rage while he's able to express it Allah will call him on the day of judgment while everybody is watching and tells him to choose from the whatever he wishes so this is great reward from Allah to those who suppress their anger unfortunately I know that there are some nationalities some people from some countries who are know to be really uh uh aggressive and high-tempered and they' seem to convince themselves it's something cultural you know if you are uh uh not that hyper if you're not that angry and if you're not shouting you're not a man and this is wrong it is our religion that controls us not our country not our nationality not our upbringing it is our religion and this is what the prophet was sent with to Excel and to complete the good character sahu alai so we have to change it is not a good excuse for you on the day of judgment Allah you created me like this this is a lie Allah did not create you like this Allah the almighty created you in the perfect perfect form and he told you that you should have the best of character the prophet goes on to sayam and whoever goes again helping and meeting the the needs of your brothers and whoever goes with his Muslim brother to meet his need not only that until it's accomplished so many times someone tells me can you do this with me I said yeah okay I drop him off and I leave why not complete your favor said yeah I have things to do no the prophet is emphasizing not only going with him to meet his need but to get it accomplished so the prophet says and whoever goes to his Muslim brother to meet his need until it's accomplished Allah will make him stand firm on the day when all feet will slip you know a the description of it the prophet tells us that it is a bridge connecting the edges of Hell Scholars say that it is sharper than a blade and thinner than a hair and people must walk on that s all people no only the Muslims and they want to be Muslims all other faiths do not walk on theat only the Muslims and the Hypocrites the rest are have been been thrown in in Hell way before and the prophet tells us that among those who walk on theat Allah would give them light so they can see and they would be as fast as a flashlight as fast as Lightning they would not feel a thing others would be as fast as the wind a tornado a hurricane so fast so powerful they would not feel a thing others would be like Riders on strong and fast horses others would be jogging running others would be walking taking their time it's nice thing to see W it's not it's terrifying because you don't know you may slep this is you not not only that you see people in front of you falling in hell and you can hear the noise and you can smell the awful odor and and and and the smoke and you can feel the heat and you know the Deeds that you have preceded ahead of you you know your shortcomings and you know that Allah is subhana mighty strong no one stands in face of his wrath subhana tala and some the prophet tells us walk walk a bit and crawl a bit on four just to be able to reach and unfortunately the prophet also tells us about people who walk and as they put their foot on theat they have the light in their toes the light goes off and they fall on their heads in hell some of them don't fall by themselves some of them are hooked by Hooks coming from hell and dragging them toring their flesh apart and throwing them in heav may Allah make our feet steadfast and firm on that day on that day if you go with your brother until he accomplishes his need Allah will make you among those and finally all what was have all what was mentioned these are all good character Good Deeds nice Deeds but so many times we and in Arabia we have an saying in Arabic do excuse the French it's not French it's in English um we say that when someone makes a pool in his house and fills it with flower water which is very nicely has a very beautiful smell but then he urinates in it so lots of the Muslims nowadays do this they do good deeds and they spoil it so I give you ,000 a I lend you £1,000 and every time I see you in a public place in the Masjid in a gathering with the relatives how is my thousand doing I hope you're utilizing it to the best may Allah bless you every time you do this to me you are insulting me and you are bragging about something that is supposed to be solely for Allah Allah says and the prophet said that three three that Allah would not speak to them nor look at them nor purify their souls and they would be punished severely on the day of judgment one of them is al man who is Al man he's the one who reminds people of the things that he had done to them so every time I keep on reminding you didn't I give you this shame on didn't I give you my car 6 years ago so that you can take your wife to a hospital and now you're doing this to me he keeps on until you are on your dying bed didn't I do this for you Subhan Allah let go so if you say something that's nice you want money from me I say if I had I would have given you but inshallah the minute I get something I'll give it to you and I'm willing to do whatever you want you in need of the money but because I've given you a good word and I've given you a a nice uh way to meet you this is much better than giving you the money and saying listen be careful bring it on time and 5 minutes after you leave I call you on mobile how was the money doing remember the time the clock is is sticking you have one year Min is 5 minutes and every six six or seven days I keep on calling don't give me your money give me a good word beat me with a a a smiling face rather than give me the money and uh uh uh insult me Day and Night by your uh rhetoric the prophet says emphasizing the importance of having good character he says and bad character Ali wasallam and bad character or conduct spoils Deeds I've done so many things for you I was with you to meet your need I did this I fed you when you were hungry I forgave you the debt that I uh lend you I did this and that Prophet says beware because bad character or conduct spoils Deeds as vinegar spoil honey bring honey and put vinegar on it taste it even even the imagining it you know sends the shield down your spine this is exactly what happens to your good deeds and so many times well I've heard this and you've heard this of course so many times you see people not only harming strangers but even their loved ones so many times I've heard complaints of husbands going to their wives and saying I did this for you I did that for you what did you do in return nothing your ungrateful woman and women complain say we cannot say this because Allah would put us in hell this is but what about the man when he's doing this to his wife they keep on putting salt on injuries so that it may harm them more and more you find people talking to their loved ones who had done them favors where I did this to you I did that to you and brag about it everywhere this spoils good deeds and I pray to Allah that we have benefited from this great Hadith of the Prophet Alam and that we become part of Those whom the prophet Alam had uh described for us and that Allah the almighty grants us his Blessing and favor to excel with our character conduct and moral ethics and Allah Knows Best"
