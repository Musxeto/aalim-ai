  "title": "Can I live in Saudi Arabia on a work visa but not work? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is is it permissible to live in Saudi Arabia with a domestic worker or a private driver Fisher without working meaning I will pay all fees and I will not work if it's not permissible then how can we live in Saudi Arabia this is a little bit weird question countries have laws and among the laws is that you cannot live in Saudi Arabia without a work permit if someone has the financial means to come under my sponsorship and he says listen you pay nothing I'll come as a driver I'll pay for my residency fee every year and for my medical expenses you don't pay me any salary I'll have my residency permit stating that I'm a driver working for you but I won't be driving for you and I'll just live in this beautiful country as a Muslim praying in the Masjid and going everywhere I want and I have income from other country for my country so I'm not going to beg people for money I'm not going to be a liability technically speaking this is fine but logically is it the answer is definitely not you want to come and live come and work like normal people and if you're rich come and be an investor alhamdulillah there are laws for investors to come and have the golden residency or silver or platinum or whatever you have to pay a a certain amount of money and you can live without even investing if not then you have to have a business and work so there are many ways for you to come and live but the way you've mentioned it is more closure of someone who's not thinking correctly why would a local Saudi sponsor you for nothing he said oh no no Sheikh I'll be paying the Saudi some amount of money as a salary so that I could do this no this is Haram this is breaking the law and it's not permissible for him to charge you anything for such a a scheme so there are many ways of legitimately coming and living in the uh this country but you have to be able to provide and to earn as a domestic worker or even as an investor or whatever and Allah Knows Best"
