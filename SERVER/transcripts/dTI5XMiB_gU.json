  "title": "Can we pray tahajjud after praying taraweeh & witr with imam? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is is it from the Sun to after praying with the IM till the end meaning we with with him and what about the uh the last nights okay first of all we have to make something clear is the name of night prayer that is offered in congregation during the month of Ramadan so if you pray with your wife or with your friends night prayer in sh in M this is not called the name is given to the congregational prayer offered during the month of Ramadan so it's night prayer why do we pray it after Isa because it's more convenient for us we have things to do we want to go to bed we have work we have to go to the market we have to do shopping so many things so if we're coming to the prayer for Isa then it is convenient for the vast majority of us to pray night prayer in congregation together and offer Witter if a woman is not praying in the Masjid and she says can I pray of course but because you're praying home alone it's best for you to delay it in the last third of the night so it becomes tud and at the same time but it's night prayer therefore if a group of Muslims in a community let let's say they are living uh offshore somewhere um in a compound and there are 10 of them and they all agree that listen during the month of Ramadan we'll pray Isa together and Retreat uh uh and retire sorry to our uh uh quarters and then we will pray at 1 P 1 a.m. the which is that's totally Fin and legitimate and the best scenario ever to be done if you pray with the congregation in the Masjid and they offer Witter with the IM and then you go home and after 5 6 hours an hour or so before fa you want to pray tud there's no problem in that but due to the prohibition of praying two Witter in one night I've already prayed my Witter so you pray two raas two raas two Ras without any Witter and with that you conclude your tud prayer because you've already prayed witer in the beginning so you don't repeat it I hope this answers your question"
