  "transcript": "should we say the shahada before going to sleep this is not from the sunnah the asgard of the sunnah are well known and you're a muslim so saying the shahada on your dying bed yes this is sunnah the prophet said teach those who are dying how to say allah but when going to bed the athcar of going to bed airtel corsi cupping your hands and blowing in it and then reciting the three pulls and wiping your whole body and you do this three times and so on all of these are part of the azkar and part of declaring your islam without even needing to say the shahada because saying it would be an innovation saying it at this particular point of time which is before going to bed is something that the prophet did not do so either we have an authentic hadith saying that yeah the prophet before going to bed he used to recite it then we have to follow that or if we don't have this then it becomes an innovation we have caffeiron one of the things we recite before going to bed which is a declaration of tohid practical to he i don't worship what you worship and you don't worship what i worship and allah knows best"
