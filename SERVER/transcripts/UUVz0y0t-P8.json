  "transcript": "[Music] you worship Allah you don't associate others with Allah you have fulfill your right to Allah [Music] [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam our topic for today inshallah is the most important topic anyone could ever talk about it is the most nothing can be more important than it and this is talking about the lord of the Worlds subhah and the topic itself is so simple that it makes it extremely difficult to cover because when you talk about the one and only the first without a beginning and the last without an ending when you talk about the creat of this universe that everything that exist other than him is created and created only by him there was Allah and there was nothing else but him when you want to address this topic you need workshops it's it's not easy to talk about Allah as we think the we have the conviction in our hearts so who is the lord of the worlds his name is Allah he's identified by this name he is the creator of the heavens and of the Earths he is the sustainer he is the provider for All Creations every creation of his is in need for him and he needs no one to help him to assist him to be by his side he needs no one subhanahu wa taala Ann Malik may Allah be pleased with him tells us that when the prophet used to be at asked questions by the nomads we used to be happy because we were forbidden from bombarding him with questions so out of respect we did not ask him questions until a nomad a bedwin came then we were happy because if his question was intelligent we will learn so a nomad came and he said oh Muhammad your messenger came to my tribe and he claims that you were sent so I'm asking you questions who is it who created the heavens the prophet answered Allah one word who created the Earth he said Allah who erected the mountains and what's in them the prophet said Allah so the bedwin said by the one who created the heavens in the earth and erected the mountains and whatever is in them did Allah send you and the prophet said yes he did if you listen to the answer of the Prophet Alat to these questions he did not make a lecture he simply specified it was Allah so the name Allah is the name that Allah is identified by all names go back to this great name and no one since the beginning of time has ever claimed such a name and that is why Allah says in the qu in the Quran do you identify do you know anyone who is similar to him who has the same name of him no one has ever said I am Allah said I am your Lord but he could not say I am Allah Shan can never come to you and say I am Allah this name Allah so beautiful that when you are in distress and it comes from your heart all your worries disappear this name was known from the time of Adam till date all previous Nations all previous religions all denominations acknowledged the creator of the heavens and the Earth by the name Allah Allah tells us in the Quran that the people of said if Allah had willed it then he would have sent down Angels they addressed him as Allah so they acknowledge the people of hood said have you come to us so that we only worship Allah alone so they acknowledge Him by the name of Allah and even the idol worshippers of quray there were 360 Idols around the Kaa and they used to worship each one per day when the prophet went for and was blocked on the day of H so may Allah be pleased with him at the time was a mush he came as the ambassador to write a treaty with the prophet Alat wasam the prophet was dictating was the one writing he said said right said oh wait we don't know what is Rahman just simply write we begin in oh Allah's name this is what we know so even the idols acknowledge that his name is Allah and if you look at our relationship ship with this beautiful glorious magnificent name you will find that all our AAR all our all our praising of Allah we use the word Allah so we say Subhan Allah alhamdu Allah and everything of import importance We Begin by saying bismah so if I eat and I say bismah what does this mean it means I begin to eat in the name of Allah if I write if I enter my home if I ride my car if I have intimacy with my spouse if I do whatever I do before doing it I begin by the name of Allah seeking of what seeking of Baraka from Allah the almighty and this beautiful name this world will come to an end when there is no one on Earth that says Allah the prophet saidat in an authentic Hadith that the day of judgment will be do it will come when there is no one on earth who says Allah Allah footnote people would say ah this is why some sects and Cults would say Allah Allah Allah Allah and they swirl like fans and they dance and said this is the Hadith no this is not the Hadith never ever the prophet Alat was noted sitting down and saying Allah Allah this is all deviancy this is all fabric ation these are all Innovations the Hadith is referring to a state where Muslims do not use the name of Allah which means their hearts are empty of the mentioning of Allah not that you repeat this as the name Allah is the name that identifies other names of Allah so when someone tells you what is the meaning ofman you don't say it is the name of aliz When someone tells you what is the meaning of Allah you don't say it is the name of Alim no but when you say what is you say the name of Allah what is Alim the name of Allah what is all of these come back to the name that identifies our Lord the Lords of the heavens and and of the earth an atheist might come and say Allah doesn't exist and this is so lame because I can say to that atheist you don't have a soul and he doesn't you don't have a brain because I cannot see your brain unless I have to crack your head open and that is not a bad idea but unfortunately it goes against Islam Islam tells us do not crack anybody's head open this is prohibited it's Haram in Islam so how can we answer this aist it's very simple there are three evidences that prove to us that there is Allah there is this instinctive evidence something that is built in you and and in every human being even if they claim they're aist they will give you a full lecture that Allah does not exist the minute someone comes to them with a 9 mm Glock and puts it in their heads they said y Allah they wouldn't go as far as ill but yeah Allah is good for me if they're in a plane and the plane is about to crash ask them afterwards what what were you doing he said I don't know I was just looking up and looking for help it is natural in all humans that when you are in stress you tend to look up because you it's instinctive it's something built in you that you realize that only Allah can help you but of course when you're saved and you're in at the airport and you're in the comfort of your home you go back to your deviancy and your disbelief which is self chosen therefore there is this inner instinctive evidence Scholars say if a man if a child was born and were to be left alone without any outside interference no family interfering no friends nothing he will grow up to believe that there is one Lord who created and who controls and who does everything he would not be able to pray and fast and give zakat because this has to come from the Quran and Sunnah but his instinctive his inner nature shows him that there is Allah the second type of evidence is the tangible evidences all Physicians all geologist all chemists all people of knowledge acknowledge that this universe cannot be created halfhazard by chance by coinci incidence you ask an aist who created you he says nature what is nature he says mother nature but where's father nature I wasn't at the wedding man I I Subhan Allah what kind of nonsense is this they said we evolved from monkeys you talk about yourself I know where I came from if you think you came from a monkey this is you're right but where where this Evolution ended we see monkeys and we see humans okay the monkeys here have been living for the past 100 million years none of them evolved we don't have like monkey man we have Spider-Man but monkey man would do a good comic book in between for the atheist at least make them happy there isn't anything as such they say no no this happens this happened this did not happened listen Allah says in the Quran gives you two choices and the third is the right one either you created yourselves or you created by nothing so who created you they would say nothing vacuum does not create any vacuum said okay we created ourselves okay can you create couple of twins please so no this is impossible so then who created you it's Allah it's like bringing a pile of metal putting it in a room and locking it atheist asks me why are you doing this I said inshallah I will come within 150 million years and I'll find an M3 BMW preferably gray color leather seats sunroof it's crazy look at this Perfection that we have and without any doubt you will say ill if the Sun would get a mile or so closer to the Earth it will burn everyone on it if it goes a little bit further a mile away it will be freezing if the moon comes a little bit closer or goes a little bit further the tide will make the whole earth drown who's controlling this nature let me meet nature maybe you never know maybe we can hook up what what what is this what is nature there is nothing as nature there is the creation of Allah look at your human body look at the eyes how fine situated they are they're not out like a frog and they're not so in but if you get a punch Allah protected your eye in the cavity in your skull and look at the how beautiful it is when you eat you never pay attention to what's your tongue doing doing while you're eating and how it's Shifting the morsel from right to left and how it is protecting it so that you can swallow it and that you would not breathe it in into your lungs and die and suffocate who's doing this my small computer in my pocket Allah is and if you go through the human body it will take us months to just look at the marvels of Allah and then you said that chance coincidence nature it is Allah the almighty who had created this all and if you look at the evidences from the Islamic Shar you will find that the Quran and the Sunnah directs you to Allah the almighty describes Allah to you you know Allah by his beautiful attributes all of this shows you and identifies to you who Allah is okay now we know Allah alhamdulillah does Allah have rights see the issue of Rights and obligations is also I don't know if mu mink mu mink has said it and and has talked about it but most likely he did there are rights and obligations now Allah has rights and obligations not that it is obliged upon him to do something no one can force Allah it is him himself who obliged himself to do something but he has rights your wife has rights your father has rights your mother has rights your children your neighbors your kinship everyone has rights the greatest right of all is the right of Allah the almighty but what is Allah's right upon us that we have to and must fulfill the prophet Al was once on his ride with mu jabal behind him so he asked mu jabal and mu jabal is a story by himself if we want to dedicate a lecture on mu jabel a companion who died after serving in Islam for about 10 to 12 Years yet he was one of the greatest Scholars of all all times among the companions no one used to give fatwa except a handful a handful of companions at the time of the the prophet Alam when he was alive one of them was mu and this man is something else so the prophet used to devote a portion of his time to teach him so he said mu do you know what is Allah's right over his servants so said I have no knowledge so Allah and his messenger no this is the answer that we all should give when we don't know unfortunately we don't do this someone asks me about uh uh Nuclear Physics I have a theory because I know everything and so do you and this is problematic of his knowledge I do not know so the prophet said Allah's right upon his servants that they worship him without associating others with him very simple end of lecture you worship Allah you don't associate others with Allah you have fulfilled your right to Allah but when you contemplate on this sentence you can actually author and write volumes explaining them the Hadith itself requires explanation but let us look at this phrase or this sentence Allah's right upon his servants that they worship him alone and not associate others with him so when we say worship Him worship what is the definition of worship people when you ask them they will say pray fast give zakat alhamdulillah I did my part I did my prayer why they said because Allah told us through his Prophet Alam that Islam was built on what five pillars now can you live in in a house only with five pillars where are the doors where are the walls where are the windows where is the split units air conditioning bathrooms kitchen Etc no one but people because of their lack of knowledge think that this is Islam I pray fast give zakat maybe perform ha and that's it no this is the essence of Islam but you have to bring the other things to qualify and this is why Worship Is defined by anything that Allah loves or is pleased with from whatever we say or do whether visible or hidden so someone says cracking the head of an atheist is it something that Allah loves what is the answer no no no I see people doing this maybe they're just looking something on the tho no it is not something that Allah loves because imagine if each one of us had his own conviction that this brother is an aist and this sister is an aist and they start killing each other we become in a jungle this can be only taken part by the Muslim ruler after going through judicial uh uh uh investigations Etc and the Muslim judge tells him yes he needs to have his skull broken then we alhamdulillah it's not me it's the ruler who did it so you now you have to analyze your life let us see what is form of worship or not so she if I'm kind to my father is this a form of worship does Allah love it yes green light oh if I'm kind to my brother to my sister masallah if I give charity if I am kind to a dog who is thirsty and about to die are this all of these are all forms of worship so if I'm on my own walking from here to my car and I say Subhan alhamdulillah form of worship if I'm intimate with my spouse form of worship yeah then we have to work overtime do it Allah will grant you reward if you do it but if you do something that Allah doesn't love then it's not a worship it's a sin so either it's visible or hidden whether it's something that you say roric or you do it is part of the worship so Allah's right is to worship him alone and this is the message of all Messengers of Allah Allah says in in four locations they used to say to their people oh my people worship Allah you have no deity other than him also Allah says and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger saying worship Allah and avoid the anything that is falsely worshiped other than Allah is called so this is the essence of The Messengers of Allah their message to worship Allah now everybody's in this beautiful Hall is saying yeah yeah okay next she move on I'm not going to say something new you're Muslims you all know this but we will come to something that will might that can be an eye opener it might be and most of you inshallah know this and all of you have correct and and and and clear in Allah if you ask any Muslim why did Allah create us he will immediately cite and and and and say the AY in I have not created the Jin and the humans except so that they would worship me does Allah need us to worship Him Allah is self-sufficient Allah doesn't need anything so when you tend to wake up for f Salat and the water is cold I don't know if the water is ever cold in Malaysia but yeah sometimes you you might find it cold and you think Ya Allah why am I praying F why does Allah make me pray fa Allah doesn't need you to pray fa go to sleep but you will go to hell no problem it's your choice you want Paradise you have to work you need your paycheck at the end of the month you need to come from 9 to5 you want Jenna you have to pray so Allah doesn't need you Allah created the whole of this universe for you and me to do as best as we can and then go to Jenna inshallah Allah did not create us except to worship Him and Allah does not accept your worship at all unless you have the first pillar of Islam which is the testimony which is the which is the Shah so without without no deity is worthy of being worshiped other than Allah Allah will not accept your worship no matter is it visible or hidden is it saying or action Allah will not accept it the prophet Alat wasam when he sent mu jab as his judge his ruler and his Messenger to Yemen he said to him and the Hadith is in you will come to people of the book Christians and Jews so let the first thing you do when you call them is to call them to the Arabic word to believe in the Oneness of Allah so this is the most important science topic subject that anyone can talk about why because if you don't haveed you don't have Islam and there are three types of everyone knows [Music] them and there this is all from the Quran and the Sunnah nothing from my own pocket what is that this is the of lordship this is knowing Allah Asel through his actions so he is the creator he's The Giver of Life and the taker of life he is the provider he's the sustainer he is the owner of everything so to tomorrow when you take some rings from your pocket and say I will give you my money it's not your money it's Allah's money when you calculate your zakat and you find that you have to pay a 100,000 ring zakat because you're mallah very wealthy don't think that 100,000 it's a lot of money I can buy a car and I can make a car as a taxi Uber and then I can make money and invest it in two years I can build a house and the money is not yours the money is Allah's so you have to do what Allah has ordered you to do Allah says in the Quran and listen to this beautiful verse and see how the of lordship is included in it Allah say say oh Muhammad who provides for you from the sky and from the earth provide or who owns hearing and sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the Deb from the living and who dispose of Affairs who disposes of Affairs they will say Allah the idol worshippers would say none of our Idols do this we we acknowledge only Allah can do this say will you not not then be afraid of Allah's punishment so this kind ofed it is shared by us and by the ult worshippers if you ask a Christian who created the heavens and the Earth he would not say the Holy Ghost he would not say Jesus Christ because Jesus was not there at the time yet he's he became promoted and became a God in their view this is their opinion they will all acknowledge it was Allah the almighty if you ask the Jews they will say Allah the almighty the idol worshippers which one of your Buddha created or which one of your cows created the heavens and the Earth they would say no it is Allah the one who created so this we have no dispute with the disbelievers we have great dispute in the second type of what is that it is known as theed of worship and this is acknowledging Allah by our forms of worship not to worship any other than him with whatever we do so our prayers our fasting our charity our slaughtering our fear our love our hope our trust all kinds of I of worship can only be devoted can be only given to Allah the almighty and this type ofed is where the error has occurred and for it the messengers were sent for it the books were revealed for it Allah created the humans and the Gin for it Allah had set the laws that tells us how that tell us how to worship Him and how not to fall into Innovation for this type ofed the dispute between the prophets and messengers of Allah on one side and their people took place Allah says in the Quran and we did not send any messenger before you oh Muhammad but we inspired him saying there's no God worthy of being woried except me Allah so worship me also Allah says that is because Allah he is the truth and that which they invoke beside him is Al falsehood so whoever acknowledges theed of lordship like so many people in the world they say we believe Allah is the creator Allah is the provider Allah is the facilitator but we worship other than him in this case they are not saved and they will be doomed in Hell forever because they are associating others with Allah the third type ofed is theed of Allah's beautiful names and attributes and this you may think that we have no problem in this we acknowledge Allah no we do have a big problem among the Muslims because Allah has described himself in the Quran and we read the Quran and the prophet has described Allah in the Hadith and we believe in the Hadith so what is happening we see that Allah in this form of asks and orders and commands us to worship ship him through his beautiful names and attributes and not to associate in these names and attributes other than him so we believe that Allah has the best of names and attributes and we believe that Allah cannot be associated with anything that is false or degrading or not be fitting Allah this is why Allah says in the Quran you are denying something there's nothing similar to him and he is whole hearing all seeing and you are approving it so you approve that Allah hears definitely Allah sees definitely Allah loves definitely Allah loves the Believers may Allah make me and you among those whom he loves does Allah hate yes Allah hates as mentioned mentioned in the Quran those who disobey him does Allah have a face of course it's mentioned in the Quran does Allah have hands of course Allah says inah and elsewhere to thean why didn't you prostrate to what I have created with my two hands now some people would say yeah but Allah doesn't have two hands should I believe you or believe the Quran so no no no this is a figure of speech are you crazy Allah is telling you in Arabic and you say no he didn't mean that how do you know that he didn't mean that he said yeah because this and that listen even Shan is better than [Music] you why do you say thisel is telling Shan what prevents you from frustrating to what I have created with my own two hands if Allah did not create Adam with his two hands Shan would have said ah you created me with your two hands as well but Shan understood and he believed that Adam out of all Allah's creation was created by Allah's hands to honor you human beings every else was created by Allah's word to be and it is but this is just to give you a glimpse so without going into further detail because it's very easy to win such an argument because we have the Quran and Sunnah with us this is what Allah told us this is what the prophet told us we believe that Allah is above everything Allah is on top of everything unlike what thinks the masses and the ignorant and those without knowledge say Allah is everywhere Allah says above the throne is subhanahu wa'ta'ala Allah has risen above the The Throne nothing is above Allah nothing can surround Allah nothing that Allah is in need of and you say Allah is everywhere is this logical Allah knows everything Allah hears everything Allah has the ability to control and Destroy Everything while he is subhanahu wa ta'ala above his throne he doesn't need to mix with us when you say Allah is everywhere this is preposterous this is inappropriate to claim with Allah the almighty so we believe in Allah's beautiful names without any Distortion or misinterpretation or denying the reality or even asking how this attribute is because this is something that we could not comprehend but we believe we believe because Allah told us about it now the majority of us Muslims are in great danger we are in great danger because the prophet said Allah right upon his servants that they should worship him alone and not associate others with him we worship Allah alone but a lot of us worship others with Allah no no this is true don't be don't pretend to be shocked this is true and I'll prove it to you but in in in a very short way so that we can accommodate time you believe in the Quran correct anyone who doesn't believe in the Quran raise your hand alhamdulillah watch out people who crack skulls are ready so Allah says in the Quran in Surah Yu and most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with him so the majority of people believe in Allah but at the same time associate others with him to the extent that the issue of shik is a serious issue a serious topic if you spend all your life studying and avoiding shik you will be doing a good investment how is how come listen who is most beloved to Allah hello can you hear me who is most beloved to Allah Asel Muhammad s wasam he is the most beloved of Allah's creation to Allah we have no doubt in that but listen to what Allah says to our Prophet Muhammad Allah says and it was already revealed to you Muhammad and to those before you The Messengers and the prophets that if you should associate anything with Allah your work would surely become worthless and you would surely be among the losers Allah has no relatives has no favors from others to him you you are his beloved messenger but the moment you associate others he will shun you of course the prophet would never ever do such a thing but this is a dire and straight warning to the prophet and to us so it's Direct Direct to the prophet but indirectly to us because the prophet would never engage in such evil evil and heinous acts the prophet told us that Allah said I am so self-sufficient that I am not in no need of having an associate thus he who does an action for someone else's sake as well as my sake I will abandon him and his action Allah only accept what is purely for him what does this mean it means brother and sister of mine that we may pray we may fast we may give charity we may do good deeds for a hundred years if we Associated other with Allah in the process and die upon on it we will be in Hell For Eternity Ya Allah I was worshiping you for 100 years where's my prayer where's my Hajj where's my zakat Allah does not forgive you this sh that you had done but Allah is most forgiving listen Allah says indeed Allah does not forgive association with him but he forgives what is less than that for whom he will so if you drink wine if you steal if you fornicate major sins you may go to hell for some time you may be forgiven it's up to Allah but eventually you will go to Jenna may Allah make me and you among those who go to Jenna if you have some shik then you will never be admitted to jenah and this is for eternity sh by the way is made major and minor so some of the minor shik which is greater than the major sins but lower than the major shik Islam has protected to the extent that even what you say though it's minor shik you are prevented from saying it so I can say had it not been for Allah and you I would have been doomed sh avoided if someone says and this happened to the prophet Alam a man came and he was giving a speech and said whatever Allah chooses and you and the prophet stopped him and said have you made me an associate to Allah stop this and say whatever Allah chooses whatever Allah Wills don't put me with Allah even if it is what we consider trial trivial trivial and minor but the Prophet considered it so bad that he had to tell us not to do it swearing by other than Allah by my mother's head this is Haram to honor your mother's head you can say by my wife's head but still this is Haram a lot of the people in Arabia they swear by their honor by my honori or by the head of my father if I'm lying may he die by the prophet they swear by the prophet they swear by all of this swearing by other than Allah is Islam prohibits it it is prohibited to pray in the graveyard it's time so I I'm in the graveyard allahar pray your prayer is invalid why because this is a graveyard so ah this is means of taking you to today you're praying for Allah tomorrow you pray forani this is what's happening worldwide some Arab countries you will find a shrine and a shrine and six shrines in between you you you you lose count of how many aah and how many righteous people you tell you tell people swear by Allah you did not Rob he said wall I did did not Rob okay swear by Alin so I can't now I have to admit yes I did Rob so they fear their aah their graves their shrines their daras more than they fear Allah this is sh Allah prohibited us from praying voluntary prayer Sunnah for whom for Allah if it was before sunrise or sun set why because this is simulating the musri who prostrate for the Sun so for you not to be imitating them AO okay but I'm praying for Allah even though stop the prophet told you to stop all of this is to prevent us from going into shik major shik so if this is prohibited in Islam then what is the ruling on asking someone other than Allah for protection will you go and say for your Saint or peer or whatever protect me from this or that or give me this or that one of the people said for 10 years I did not have a child I used to go every week to mekah for om and I supplicate to Allah and Allah did not respond to me one friend of mine said go to Cairo there is Masid Hussein and go to the shrine of Hussein to the grave and ask for a righteous child and after 9 months his wife gave birth to a healthy child Subhan Allah what is this he doesn't believe in Allah and he believes in Hussein and the the the funny thing is where was Al Hussein killed where was he marted may Allah be pleas with him in irq so they have a shrine of Hussein in Iraq and they have one in Syria and they have one in Egypt in Cairo so they say that the head is in Cairo the body is in Syria and the and the feet are what is this crazy things W people who claim to be Muslims are so ignorant are so away from Quran and Sunnah this is why they do not worship Allah except by associating associating others with him so many people would neglect that Allah is the provider oh Allah forgive me I have to miss why my boss is with me in a meeting if I go for prayer he may not give me the raise he may not give me the incentive he may not give the increment he may not give me the overtime he may might sack me so forgive me he has he signs the paycheck who signs your paycheck who allows you to inhale inhale air not drugs seriously if you inhale who allows you to Exhale it's Allah's hand and this is why when Allah wills it a person inhales and does not exhale he's dead Allah willed it so everything in your body moves with Allah's permission and you want to leave Salat because your CEO is the one who's going to sign your paycheck and then you say I'm a I have I have Islam nowadays as we have four minutes to go I think though the moderator told me that I can extend it for half an hour more seriously no seriously he did but inshallah nowaday when we talk abouted I can see labels you can see here labels on top of my head I cannot treat them you may can read them because the minute anyone talks abouted they put a stamp and maybe at his back and label him are we talking anything other than Quran and Sunnah you know you have Quran open the Quran more than a thousand times Allah's name is mentioned the whole of the the Quran oneir of the Quran is on are you crazy there are people nowadays who are hypocrites or who are enemies ofed they are W the enemies of Allah they are belittling whenever you speak about all what they know is is there any more important than the science of knowing Allah of worshiping Allah they said no no no this is an issue of dispute this is the of our Prophet his companions and the and the bring me anything that goes against their I will stand with you and defend you but if you attack the and the of our Prophet this is treachery you are betrayed Allah and his messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam the Quran and Islam associating others with Allah corrupts your mind it corrupts your heart it corrupts your moral ethics and your conduct it corrupts your mind because this is exactly what the people of Hell will confess of if you go to the that specific person before we have cracked his skull and asked him are you intelligent or not what would he say definitely I'm intelligent I'm 10 times more intelligent than you and the likes of you who think that there that there is a God that exists do you know what Allah tells us about them in the Quran Allah says and they will say if only we had been listening or read reasoning we would not be among the companions of the blaze they have confessed but it's too late they're already in hell it would not help them so it shik associating others with corrupts your mind it corrupts and spoils your heart and this is why when you only believe in Allah and you haveed filling your heart you're the bravest man on Earth or woman because you trust Allah aedwin was warned by the colonial powers that was like a 100 years ago and they told him listen the Brits and the Europeans are coming to invade your country say let them come we will fight them he said to him they have aeroplanes I said what is what what what what is an aane he said it's a machine that flies like the birds and throws bombs and and and shells he said hm who's higher these aeroplanes or Allah the man said Allah I said Allah will take care of them this is a when you have AA in your heart you fear nothing but when you don't have a in your heart you fear everything everything that happens you're afraid you're scared you're terrified and this is why you find in countries Nations and among the disbelievers a very high rate of depression of anxiety of suicide when you come to the Muslim world you don't find this you go to the poorest Muslim who is unable to pay for anything Salam alaykum alayum how are you alhamdulillah alhamdulillah they are grateful to Allah despite all the calamities they're under while those who claim to be civilized and intellectual they're afraid of everything and shik corrupts your moral conduct your ethics whenever you don't have then you are worse than the animals look at those disbelievers the way they live it's fun it's nice H it's civilized mashallah they have beautiful cars they have beautiful women women say they have handsome men they have money they have health W they are living in Paradise this is what shows to you if you go and live among them like so some of you may have you can see that they don't have a life they don't have ethics they don't have moral conducts they have homosexuality they have cheating they have bribery they can buy you sell you for what you have or for what you you do not have they do not have anything that Rel relates them to good ethics except what can bring them profit see the Muslims because they're far away from Quran and Sunnah they cheat and life then this they are bad businessmen the non-muslims because they know that honesty and saying the truth increases their profits and sales they're okay but whenever they have a possibility to cheat the law to break the law to evade taxation like someone you know who did not declare his taxes till today Allah I don't know how they live but they accepted him they can do this we cannot because our hearts are filled withed now to conclude so that I would not take the half hour promised the prophet told us that the Jews were divided into 71 sects the Christians were divided into 72 sects all in hell and the Muslims will be divided into 73 sects or Cults all of them are in Hell except one so the companion said who is this one o prophet of Allah he said whoever is on my footsteps and the footsteps of my companions Allah will not accept any of your prayer fasting charity Haj unless you have filling your heart unless you a avoid shik and this is unfortunately a choice of yours why do I say unfortunately because a lot of those who grew up to be mush will not go back to they say we cannot leave what we found our forefather practicing this is our culture this is our so and so you have the choice to end up in Paradise or to end up in Hell may Allah fill my heart and yours with pure may Allah make us among those who follow the of the prophet and His companion may Allah make us among those who avoid all types of shik major or minor visible or hidden said or by action [Music] was for [Music]"
