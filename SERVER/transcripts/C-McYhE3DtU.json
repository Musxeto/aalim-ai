  "transcript": "says that he wants to give his children gifts so is he entitled to give them equal amount or must he divide these gifts to shares for the male and one share for the female as when distributing the inheritance it's an issue of dispute among scholars I personally follow the opinion that says while you're alive if you're going to give something your children you have to be equal between the boys and the girls but when it is in the inheritance after you die and they want to distribute your inheritance then to shares for the male and one share for the female while you're alive anything that you distribute as a gift it has to be equal"
