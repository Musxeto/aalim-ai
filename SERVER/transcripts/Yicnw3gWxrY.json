  "transcript": "uh so I know there's this thing with which students don't like homework so I'm a I'm rather busy and a lot of the times I Forget homework or I skip it deliberty because otherwise I'll get like four hours of sleep now the thing is if I skip must I tell the teacher like some cases the the teacher asks did anyone didn't do it in other cases the the teacher doesn't ask at all and in other cases the teacher the the teacher says if you didn't do it just don't tell no so no if I don't tell this will I will get a better grade than I deserve so is this cheating um like if if your teacher does not ask Clinton used to say don't ask don't tell so the policy remains if you're negligent if you're lazy and you did not do your homework you don't have to carry a flag all around the school and say I didn't do my homework I'm lazy I'm this that no if the teacher asks did you do your homework he said no I didn't if they don't ask then you don't have to say alhamdulillah"
