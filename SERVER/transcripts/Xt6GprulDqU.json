  "transcript": "eat sweetness the life of food did another one manhood the pockets of the World War III was sending said well possesses the following three qualities wouldn't have the sweetness of faith the one to whom Allah and messenger becomes yearned and anything else who loves a person and he loves him only for Allah say who hates to reward to atheism as he hates to be thrown into the fire now the previous chapter was about what loving the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so this is part of Eman now it is appropriate to mention that there is a sweetness and benefits of Eman so is there a taste and sweetness of Eman the Prophet said alayhi salat WA Salam there Parimal Imani McGraw geobella he robbing mobile Islam adenine will be muhammaden-rasul allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam the Prophet says he will taste he will find the taste of email whoever is pleased to have Allah as his Lord Islam as his religion and Muhammad is His Messenger Allah Salado scenario you will find the taste so are you pleased with Allah and Islam and the Prophet ISOs Allah then you should find the taste but how can we find the taste and is this taste physical or sentimental now a lot of us may complain that we do salat and we do not have any taste for it we fast but we don't enjoy fasting sometimes you see people and they're so happy energetic and you become depressed once you know that they're fasting Monday or Thursday he's like this and fasting and I'm like this and I'm not fasting what is this sometimes robada elevates you and definitely sends depress you without any compromise once you do since it will put you down maybe it will make you happy for half an hour the moment that you are doing the same in the beginning you sin and you regret feel remorseful cry and repent to Allah this is in the beginning after a week you sin again but you're still remorseful regretful and you cry but less after few times you start to lose the crying bit you're remorseful but you don't cry anymore after a while you lose the remorse so you commit the sin and it's something normal after a while you start to enjoy it you become addicted you can't feel remorse regret and you're not sad about it however you're still concealing it nobody knows about it after a while you start to do it in public no remorse no regret and you're having fun and the last stage is the stage of the hypocrites those who do sin do not regret it do not feel sad do it publicly and call others to follow them this is the stage of hypocrites the callers to sin so may allah azzawajal have on us and then we complain why don't we find the taste of Iman because we're so sinful we are like someone who's sick have you ever tried while being sick to find taste of food you taste honey it's not sweet you eat rice it's not the same taste because you're sick the food is okay likewise when you come to forms of worship why do I not find the taste because you my friend are sick with these sins and everything has a taste hunger has taste though I'm not eating anything but I can find it defeat when someone beats me I feel the taste of defeat and those who will find the content and the pleasure in worshiping allah allah azza wajal will make them find the taste of a bada of iman what is the taste of a man it is being content and happy I can be poor I can be sick I can have calamities but because I am pleased with allah azza wajal with islam with the prophet alayhi salat wa salam I can find that that taste now the taste can be sour can be bitter and can be sweet now the hadith talks about what about sweetness so how could that be I could work in a place that is hot like this auditorium in the morning it was Cola now it's a maybe it's with the monitor I could work in a place that is hot that is tight that is bad ventilation in it here I'm okay I don't know about you guys there however the pay is very good how would I feel the environment I'm fine I'm happy as long as I'm being paid you could work in a palace with nice view with air conditioning and everything is fine but the pay is very bad how would you feel you would feel miserable now the hadith we can devote a full lecture for it and you'll find it on YouTube and my channel in sha allah because i did a lecture on this hadith we cannot do this we don't have the time however these things you will find the sweetness again the sweetness is something that is not physical it's not like honey and sugar you cannot find that the sweetness but it is something that you feel an elevation of iman that even if people want to take it from you you will do jihad the kings and presidents fail to find it they would like to buy it off you and you do not want to sell it is a gift from allah azza wajal however you will not find this sweetness until you have these three characteristics in you what are they one to love allah and the prophet alayhi salat wa salam more than anything else and we have a big deficiency in this field our love is a claim when you come to practice I love playing more than salat I love being clean-shaved more than following the Sunnah for example I love to mix with the opposite gender more than attending a course with sure Hassim I'd like to have fun play enjoy myself watch a movie rather than make half of of one drizzle so if this is our reality how are we going to ever find the sweetness of Iman problematic and there are so many examples where people love Allah and the messenger Allah saw to send more than anything else for example and I will not go to I have so many of them but not enough time be sure or a bad evening mission he was one of the muhajireen mr abney acid was also from the muhajireen there was an army they camped at night the Prophet said la la la - Salam who will guard us so these two came a battable official and a martini acid so Mr said I'll take the first not nap you take the first shift I'll always sleep and when my shift is over wake me up and you go to sleep so ok I've added the bishop looked there is no internet no what's up nothing so what is the best thing to do pray everybody's asleep so he started praying night prayer not knowing that there was a spy from the enemy who the Muslims took his wife as a slave when they raided home so he was angry and he said I will not return until I kill someone so he waited until everybody was asleep and then he saw this man who was a guard standing so he took an arrow and he shot the first arrow how bad was praying he did not move he shot him with a second arrow he did not move he shot him with a third arrow and that continued his prayer quickly because he felt tired after three arrows and he walk and marbly answer I'm are so the blood and the earth subhanAllah why didn't you wake me up earlier he said I was reciting a surah he was so beautiful I did not want to interrupt it this is a mark hearing it from a Badman bishop enjoying salat with three arrows had he not feared that he will die and subsequently the enemy would attack the Muslims he would not have interrupted it he would have died no problem I'm enjoying it I'm have a good time how is our prayer compared to this we have a problem do we enjoy it I told this earlier somewhere I don't know where infidel whether I pray in and near my home the salat is beautiful tranquility air conditioning is good in the Masjid you have to write it down and when the imam is reciting masha'Allah beautiful voice and all of a sudden people starting jumping and hitting the roof because a cat came and started intermingling between their legs and all of a sudden they feel this fur coming and so many times while praying you just imagine what happens when a cockroach people go stand outside stop stop we don't know what's happening until we see it Oh what happens if a dragon comes in this is what how is our prayer we don't feel it bad maybe she'll free arrows and would not move him and we a small insect does this to us so you have to compare your salat what's missing you have to work out if your stamina is bad do aerobics do cardio if your muscles are small start to lift up some weights you have to do something if your Eman is weak what to do this is where we have to look into it number two and to love someone I'm reading from memory for the sake of Allah that's it you don't love anyone except for the sake of Allah those who we know if I open my contact list whom can I say sake of Allah sake of Allah sake of Allah business entertainment Authority I need him for reservations I owe among my contact marshal see it's not what you know it's who you know that can make things different coming again who among our contact list can we say that this is a friend for the sake of Allah many or few we have a problem we need brothers for the sake of Allah sisters need sisters for the sake of Allah but when all those we know are only acquaintances or this man is I know him because he's funny this friend of mine I know him and he's my friend because he knows people he can cut a lot of red tape this person is rich I'd like to be with him because he has a fancy car this friend is so-and-so but rarely you'll find someone saying I love this brother because he pray nights prayer or he fast Mondays and Thursdays or he is obedient to his parents or his generous or he demon reminds me of Allah or we give to feel Quran together then if we don't have such a friend who loves a person and he loves him only for the sake of Allah then we have a problem the majority of people we know we love them not for the sake of Allah how do you know if one of your friends did something wrong or said something wrong about you or did not invite you and you cut him off this is not for the sake of Allah you always make up excuses for your brother when he doesn't come well I may be his mother was sick well maybe he had some excuse he did this he did that when is our friendship is for the sake of Allah is when you need money and I have it I give it to you I don't wait what eat it this one okay you should have told me that before I was shouting I don't know why PI so seriously we have to work on finding a Muslim that we love for the sake of Allah and remember among the seven in the shade of Allah true met for the sake of Allah and separated for the sake of Allah so our relationship should be based on the love of allah azza wajal the closest to me is the closest to Allah and those we have we need salt and pepper to make the food good so I need someone who knows someone I need someone who's rich but he's not as close to me as my real brothers who fear allah azza wajal thirdly who hates to revert to disbelief I don't know why I chose atheism as he hates to be thrown into the fire and this is the last characteristics which is that in order to find the taste of a man that you hate sin in general and disbelief in particular now hating disbelief is every book every Muslim has this you have no problem no one loves disbelief we all hate this belief whether it's associating others with Allah disbelieving in one of Allah rulings or even atheism all kind of disbelief we hate it but also hating sins imagine trenches dug fire-lit and you were given the choice between associating others with Allah or jumping in the fire what would you do there was a lot of one of course definitely I don't have to think twice I have the permission I have the exemption each one of us has an excuse but in surah al-buruj as habit of dude you know the story of the young boy and the king and the sorcerer this is well known to you when the young boy of the law told the King how to kill him he told him take an arrow from my own and put it in the bow and shoot me in my head in my forehead saying bismillah hero bill will I'm in the name of Allah the lord of the boy and the king was saying that he was what he was he was the Lord so when he did this in front of all the people and the boy died what did the people say if the King says bismillah then we worship Allah not worship Him so he dug these trenches and had fire lit into it and whoever does not return to worshipping him they will burn him alive what happened the whole village decided to die for the cause of Allah this shows you that they felt the sweetness of Iman from day one from our one we've been living Islam all of our lives what have we done to Islam this is problematic look at the people of the cave how they fled their families how they fled their wealth and power and decided to go into a cave running with their Eman look at yourself peace be upon him that's awkward use of a handsome young boy young man who has been called to fahisha - zina not to pay money not to do any effort it's in your house close the mistress is calling you he refuses and decides to go to jail what kind of a man is this twenty years ago I used to teach in high school and I was mentioning to my students 17 years 18 years of age about the story of Yusuf and how he resisted the temptation of fornication by this beautiful woman who's rich and capable you know what my students said sure where can we find such a woman in the middle of the lecture I'm giving it to them and the Sudha saying a stuff for a larger brain this is Islam by birth not by conviction Muslims who have belief they believe that I would never love to go back into sin even if they burn me alive of course there are so many things but you will find them in the lecture I shall on YouTube how to increase my Eman to reach the level of sweetness there are steps but among them is you have to learn all those beautiful names and attributes if I give you up an a4 paper and I tell you write the names of Allah that you know how many can you reach ten fifteen now if I tell you in the remaining of the paper give me the meaning of these names if I say Allah who I had Allah who saw matter what is the meaning of a semadar I don't know if you don't know who you worshipping his name's his attributes how will you find the sweetness of a man I'm just praying to whom I don't know they told me face direction not direction tabular now faced a block and do this and I'm doing it then we need to have knowledge the more knowledge the more you will find the sweetness reciting the Quran increases your Eman reading the zero of the Prophet Allah salatu salam increases your Eman doing a lot of good deeds and avoiding sins this makes boosts you're a man to the top insha Allah following her chapter 9 - look the answer is a sign of faith then it did understood the one who the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said nobody even saw is a sign of and right now this hadith deals with a sign of Iman which means our topic is chapter dealing with Eman so these things increase your amen among the things that increase your Eman is your love to the answered and who are the answer they are the inhabitants of Medina so we have those who migrated to them and they're called and mahadji rule and we have the Ansar and then we have those who followed them BX an and those are us insha'Allah mentioned in surat al Hashem Allah mentioned the three categories in surah tell her sure little al-muhajireen and Ladino freedom in the area him here with a uniform in Allah he wore iguana in surah Sula like a home Alma flee home well lady in a trabajo dad I will email him in public Waterman has your alayhim well are you doing a few so durian has it a member - were you through another unforeseen water canopy in her salsa well may you also Hanif see for like a home you have to correct me if I make a mistake by coming off LaHood well the imager remembered in him this is us those who come after him after them yeah corner of banoffee ran away Neal and Lolly December corner bill Emanuel as a theologian a little Edina man whoo Robin in the car over ahi these are the three categories of the believers the mahadji who left everything the wealth the families country and went for the sake of Allah and His Messenger and then there are those recipients those of the host country who opened their homes who shared their wealth and gave them everything they wanted and not only that favored them with things that they need most yet they decided to favor them and the third category are those who came afterwards yet they pray that Allah as usual forgive those who came before them and not to leave any hatred or grudges towards the believers so a sign of your Eman is that you have this great love to the Companions especially to the unsung and the Prophet made it alayhi salat WA Salam a sign of Eman for those who love which means that it's a sign of hypocrisy for those who who hate so anyone who hate the companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam is a hypocrite and Ali may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet said no one would love you except a believer and no one would hate you except a hypocrite and loving them does not mean that they do not do any mistake they're humans they are not infallible and loving them does not mean that they may not fight with one another did they not fight with one another but their fighting was not due to hatred there had been some unfortunate incidents between the companions Wars disputes but never ever accusing one another of hypocrisy or of Cofer or hating one another it's a difference of opinion that was misused by others with ill intent and hidden agenda that caused all of this to happen moving on we took part in the father and was the people and wasn't nothing a person having a group of six persons on allows messages of Allah who said never said why the group of his companions were so I allegiance to me for not to join anything in worship along with Allah not to steal not to commit illegal sexual intercourse not to kill your children not to accuse an innocent person to spend such an accusation among people not to not to be disobedient when order to be to do would be the prophets of Allah WA it WA seldom added whoever among you fulfills his plan will be rewarded by Allah and whoever it does Jesus and any one of them except the ascription or partners to Allah and gets the punishment in this world that punishment would be an explosion for a Datsun and if one indulges in any of them and a bargain seizes sin it is up to him to forgive or punishment in the hereafter or rather than Islamic added so so we swore allegiance or these points to a modest messenger okay you did not see the Haditha repeat again no no so this is a long hadith can you discover or find out why albahari brought this hadith of course he brought the hadith because he had an intention there is wisdom but why after lunch maybe people would feel a little bit sleepy would you like to stand up for a while just you know shake your bones even standing up with this be difficult try try to stand up just to stretch a little bit I didn't have lunch by the way otherwise you would have slept yellow okay hang Billa bismillah fight again question why why did Albahari bring this long hadith does anyone know cut the long story short no we don't know the answer is we're talking about the chapter dealing with Eman some said that Eman is a whole entity whether it's found or void others say a man is a whole entity it is never void it's always there so who said that a man can be cancelled the Huaraz if you do a major sin it will what nullifier islam you're not a Muslim Yura kafir how are you when you see these terrorists like the nicest what is nicest nun Islamic State of Iraq and Syria it is haram to call it Isis Islamic state this is not Islam so they're non Islamic state when you see them taking Muslims and slaughtering them or killing them or a pilot from Jordan they burn him alive what is this just holla he's a kafir how did he become a kafir if you read their info and I don't ever advise you they make everyone kafir everyone except them so the rulers are kafir the judges are kafir because they obey them the army that defends them are kafir the families of the soldiers are a kafir because they're supporting them so every single person is a kafir why because they committed a sin and this sin voids and nullifies Islam this hadith so long do not associate others with Allah do not steal do not commit illegal sexual intercourse do not kill your children not to accuse innocence not to be disobedient when ordered to do something the Prophet says are they his salatu was-salam where are we no no second time and whoever indulges in any of them meaning these major sins and gets the punishment in this world ish the punishment will be an expiation for that sin so he's not a kafir now what about if he was not punished and if one indulges in area of them and Allah conceals his sin it is up to him that is on the day of judgment to forgive or to punish which means that you have aarush what you saying that he is kafir and he's in hell for eternity is baseless it hadith is like Buhari how do you want us to believe you and this is the trademark of the people of innovation what is their trademark is that they come to one single evidence and they say that this is what we are going to build our religion of so if you give them another evidence from the Quran or another evidence from the authentic hadith they say no we follow this one and this is the way of deviancy they went to an ayah for Quran but a man Kasaba say here attend what I have thought to be he happy at all vikas Habanera whom fear halodule this ayah is surah al-baqarah verily those who commit a sin and their sin surrounds them they are forever abiding in hell so this is Allah's crystal clear the ice core any obvious so I come to them and I say ok Allah says in la jolla el Refugio I usually kabhi he whale of yoru manner that he can in may Allah does not forgive that people associate others with him but what he forgives whatever else he wishes so what do we do with this by comparing Apple to Apple it's obvious that the sin that surrounds you and abides you in hell for eternity is what shirk other than that it is up to a Las forgiveness and this is man Hajj illusion that you will Gemara that every sin other than shirk and when we say shirk what falls underneath it f is go for disbelief because a person who is an atheist he says I don't worship Allah I don't believe in the existence of Allah is he mushrik he is said how can he be associating others with Allah when he is not admitting the existence of Allah he admits it but he is worshipping his own desires and whims with Allah so he claims that he doesn't believe but he believes any atheist found put him in an airplane and let there be turbulence in the airplane or about to crash what will he do your Allah Subhan Allah now once he lands there is no God I'm convinced so they know it deep down inside so this hadith clearly explains to us the concept of illusion not even Gemara which is one if you make one of the sins that has prescribed punishment what is the what is the meaning of prescribed punishment in arabic it's who dude what is meant by who dude there are a number there are a number of sins you've committed Allah Azza WA JAL prescribed particular punishment these are major sins for example disobedience of mother what is the prescribed punishment know what is known huh who knows no one there isn't when saying prescribe meaning that there is something to be implemented in this dunya this obeying the parents are being undutiful is one of the major sins but it's so major that Allah did not even put the punishment for it in this dunya it's delayed on the hereafter but fornication what is the prescribed punishment stoning if married or previously married or flogging a hundred lashes consuming intoxicants what is the prescribed punishment lashes flogging forty to eighty depending on the ruler slandering a person mainly women if we slander a woman what is the punishment flogging 80 lashes stealing something chop off the hand and so on one would say okay what is the punishment for killing killing is not a prescribed punishment it is a sauce it is making even and this is why if someone kills someone his family has the right to either demand execution an eye for an eye a life for a life or take blood money a deal or forgive and this is the best and highest of all [Music]"
