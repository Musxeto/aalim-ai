  "transcript": "Muhammad's question relates to the sources whom we can give zakat Allah mentioned eight categories in the Quran in chapter 9ahba verse 60 and this is the only channel that you can give zakat to or these are the eight only channels you can give zakat to give giving the zakat money to the administration or the committee of the Masjid does not fall in any of the eight categories and therefore this is not permissible and you have to choose whether the poor the needy those who are indebted those who are imprisoned those who are working on collecting the zakat in the government so this is only for the government to give those whose hearts are inclined to Islam Etc and in the cause of Allah of course in had these are the legal sources for you to pay zakat and the committee of the Masid is not one of them unless you specify to them that this is zakat and you know for sure that they're going to give it to the poor or to the needy sometimes the committee of the Masjid uses the money to expand the Masjid or to make a circle for Quran for memorizing the Quran or for conducting seminars or Circles of knowledge giving them the zakat is not permissible but when you know that the committee of the Masjid takes care of the poor uh orphans in the neighborhood and they give widows money who are unable to pay for the rent or get medical care in this case this is uh permissible but you have to make sure that you make it clear to them that this is zakat only to be given to these categories and Allah Knows Best"
