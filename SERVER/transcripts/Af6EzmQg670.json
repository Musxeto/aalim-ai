i am a woman with tightly plated hair on my head should i undo it for taking a bath from sexual intercourse another narration has from menstruation he said no it is enough for you to throw three handfuls of water on your head now this hadith again talks about russell um the wife of the prophet islam is inquiring about her religion which all of us often do she is asking the prophet sallallahu about her hair as she says that she tightly she's a woman with a tightly plated hair she puts her hair she wears her hair in a very uh tight manner and with the braids and that she does because it's one form of women showing off their beauty so we do not expect all women to wear their hair in a particular fashion or manner it's okay for them to uh beautify themselves to wear their hair in any manner pleases them providing that they are not imitating the non-muslims so if they're doing or and they're not imitating men so she asked the prophet salallahu what should i do the prophet as you have heard we have two virgins one she's asking about having a total bath out as a result of intercourse and the other one she's asking about if she's clean from her menstruation and the prophet salla sallam in both ways say that you do not have to undo your hair no it's not a must all what you have to do is put three scopes of uh water or handful of water on your head so that you would ensure that the water reaches the roots of the hair now uh if a woman has long hair is it a must that she washes the whole hair the whole thing soak it in water or only the uh the roots of the hair of course the roots of the hair is essential and the outside the exterior of the hair is essential but the inside you don't have she doesn't have to undo it she does not have to undo it to wash it and some scholars said that in the case of menstruation they have to undo their hair because the prophet sallam said that if a woman had menstruation and she's clean she has to undo her hair and she has to calm it and have a total bath but this is preferable and it is not a must so again it is not a must it's preferable it's recommendable that she does uh she undo undoes her hair yet it is not a must as clearly stated by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam i do not permit a menstruating woman or anyone in a state of sexual impurity to enter the mosque now the hadith has a weak chain so it's not authentic nevertheless scholars say that it is forbidden for persuading woman to enter the mosque or to stay in a mosque as it is forbidden for a person with the sexual impurity in the state of sexual impurity to enter a mosque or to stay in a mosque and this is the most authentic verdict of all with the exception for a person with in his uh state of sexual impurity he may cross the masjid the mosque if there is no other way around it so let's assume that this is a street or a way and to in order for you to go to the other side you have to enter a mosque it is okay as mentioned in the quran and there is a hadith that clearly states now this hadith is not authentic but there's a hadith that clearly states that a a woman in her monthly period may not enter the mosque this hadith narrated by ishmael be pleased with her she said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was in ertikaf meaning that he is staying in the masjid not leaving it for 10 days or more and he used to do this often at the ten nights of ramadan the last ten nights of ramadan so at one time the prophet requested sallallahu alayhiru sallam to give him a piece of cloth so uh how far muhammad how far were the houses of the prophet salaam from the mosque very close very close or they were attached to the mosque so it was the prophet had like eight or nine houses and they all had uh uh small doors for him to enter the mosque from so the prophet sallam requested once to give him a piece of cloth and she had her monthly period so she said oh prophet of allah administrating sorry i can't i can't give you the cloth you want so the prophet and this is the catch the prophet says your menstruation is not in your hand which means as long as you're not entering with your whole body in the mosque it's okay to give something with your hand because you're not entering the masjid now what do you understand from this we understand that the prophet sallam approved her not entering because it's not allowed but he saw them also told her that by entering her hand that would not be considered to be entering the mosque with her body her body is still outside of the mosque hadith number 107 i believe that brother noor will read it to us narrated by anisha may allah be pleased with her i and allah's messenger used to take a russo to take a russo due to sexual impurity from the same vessel and our hand alternated in scooping water from it and our hand used to meet this hadith tells us how the prophet sallam used to perform russell uh obligatory bath with one of his wives who is pleased with her and the reason that the compiler of this book ibn hajjar brought this hadith is because some scholars say and it's a an issue of dispute it says that if a woman stays alone with a vessel of water then it's not permissible for anyone else to perform evolution or to perform also from the same vessel of water the same container of water this was at the very beginning but it was obligated and the scholars now agree that this is no more as long as the water is still a water and it has not been changed by an impurity in regards of the smell uh color or the taste then it is still pure whether she was alone with it or she was not in this hadith it tells us also that the water used in washing our limbs and our bodies is tahr so if it falls again in the vessel we can still use this water is that correct it is correct why do we mention this because we have schools of thought that say water is divided into three types or or kinds and they define nudges as being in pure water that cannot be used for removing filth or for lifting the state of hadith and they define as being pure water that is capable of removing the filth and lifting the state of hadith which means you can perform total bath obliterate your bath with it or evolution with it and there remains one in the middle which is which is mustafa now what is fire they say it's something in between it is pure in the sense that we may remove neja sat with but it is not pure enough to enable us to perform evolution or obligatory bath and this division is incorrect the quran says it is the same thing the sunnah came to tell us that water is the same thing najis is a different thing so what is tahir they say any water that has been changed by atar not by an impurity by something that is pure and it's taking another form then this is called power for example this glass of tea is in the sense that we can drink it we can consume it but can we perform evolution with it why zeki because uh it's not it's not able to use to evolution why because it's a very simple answer sting the smell smell and well no this is not the reason fatty according to what you said i think we should you can use it because you'll perform ablution with it if we said there's there's no water that is taught here yeah and that the quran came and the sunnah came and clarified it it's only nejis and the tahur or two are the same so we can as long as it's not changed so if i can perform evolution using this is that true mustafa no why not because it's color changed and it smells changed and it's tasty but it did not change with najasa zaki because the the tea is pure in we can can we can drink it but it's not pure to revolution it is pure but but the only the answer is very simple and it's very uh straightforward we are allowed to perform a pollution using water is this water no this is tea so it's been completely transformed it's pure it has nothing to do with pure or impure it has been transformed so i may not use an evolution except water and this is not water this is t so this is the criteria that we judge things with and uh i'm afraid that we have to pause for uh a while so insha'allah after the break we will continue discussing this hadith please stay tuned back to the prophet join sheikh ahmad in the program back to the prophet wherein he teaches us practical lessons from the prophet's life and how this can help us to overcome our challenges in the present we talk about the life example of the prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him seeking guidance for ourselves in the early days after the revelation of the holy quran the muslims were greatly persecuted so much so that quite a few muslims had to leave arabia and migrate to africa to live among kitab christian people who followed the gospel of christ before the break we talked about uh the types of water and this is relevant to our topic but we've discussed this way back at the very beginning when we talked about uh and the chapter that deals with water purity and so on going back to our hadith pleased with her said that the prophet sallallahu salaam and i now our brother read the hadith by saying said i and the messenger of allah we tend to always english wise you always when you talk about yourself you say john and i or muhammad and i but in arabic it's okay to say i and muhammad it depends on the language itself now with the case of the prophet allah we always tend to respect him so we always precede his name get his name in the at the very beginning and then say myself or rasulam and abu bakr instead of saying al-bakr and the prophet sallam and this is understood when we hear the politeness and respect of al-abbas what is the relation between the prophet sallam al-abbas zaki cousin close mustafa that's what i thought that's what that's what he thought his uncle uncle ibn abbas is the cousin of the prophet sallallahu alaihi al-abbasi is the uncle i thought he said okay uh so it's okay al abbas was once asked they told him who is older you or the prophet salallahu so al-abbas in age actually he's older but out of respect he said the prophet is older than me but i was born before him why is that older in respect and position and status he's the messenger of allah so he's older and greater than me but i was born before him he didn't say i am bigger than him i am older than him and this shows you the respect the companions had to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so she said that allah's messenger and i used to take a bath from sexual impurity from the same vessel and their hands alternated it into it which means that if a person in the state of sexual impurity enters his hand in a vessel of water does this make the water najis impure no the evidence this hadith otherwise the prophet would have told her stop aisha let's renew the water because we've entered our hands into it and in another version she said that and our hands met meaning that the water vessel is a small bucket of water so when they're taking the water from it they would probably touch each other and again this is a clear sign and evidence that touching the opposite sex touching your wife does not nullify your wudu and we talked about this programs ago that it is not one of the the things that nullify your wudu to touch a woman unless something is discharged then your buddha is nullified because of the discharge not of the touching uh thing in this hadith we also learn that it is permissible for a spouse to look at the other spouse aura of course they were bathing and they were not bathing in a fully dressed you know three-piece suit or with with dresses on they were bathing it's a man and his wife so it is okay for them to look at each other and we learn from this that the misconception in the heads of lots of the muslims that thinking that a wife must not look at her husband and the husband must not look at his wife they should all turn off the lights this is not true if you don't enjoy looking at your wife if she doesn't enjoy looking at her husband's body then who will they look at they will seek their pleasure somewhere else if a man goes to his wife and says listen honey i love you i'd like to see some of your flesh and i'll show you some of mine and she said how disrespectful respectful of you you pervert you shouldn't do this well you have to be respectful you have to have this and that and the guy would go out and go and look for it somewhere else it he is his halal allah has given him this wife to enjoy and to have her enjoy him this is marriage this is the beauty of marriage so one must not put restrictions and put barriers between anything that is halal and it's permissible and the prophet salallahu himself did it so if he did it then we should ourselves do it and consider it to be also respectful uh now in this hadith also it's a clear sign that it is sunnah to reduce the amount of water used for russo we mentioned this before i believe mustafa would tell us what is the appropriate amount to perform muscle with and what is the appropriate amount to perform evolution with mod is for evolution and four to five mods is for thank you very much then four to five moods is the appropriate amount for russell and we've stated fatty if you recall what how do we measure uh a mood width by the average uh by the size of the average hand hands of hands of a normal person okay this is a mud so the prophet used to perform muscle with four to five muds and this would probably amount to a liter or less so if they both were performing also of out of two liters let's say three liters it tells us that this is the sunnah and not to waste water on performing russell and being obsessed of this and we we get this from them alternating their hands in the vessel and she says to him leave some for me and he tells her another hadith leave some for me also we learn from this hadith how great and perfect the prophet was with his wives now by no comparison none whatsoever the prophet salallahu was the best person with his wives and he clearly stated that he said that the closest of you to me on the day of judgment in paradise are the best to their wives so the more you're good to your wife the more you're kind and loving to your wife the closer you are to the prophet and from that we learn that islam is not just praying and fasting isla these are the pillars that the building is built on so one comes and says listen i'm going to pray fast perform pilgrimage give money to the poor and that is it i don't want to have anything more is that enough say it is enough as the minimal requirement because it's the foundation the foundation of islam the islam is built on five pillars but you cannot live in a house with only pillars you have to have walls you have to have windows you have to have doors you have to have electrical appliances you have to have this and that and all of this constitutes the building of islam so if you are a person that prays in the mosque and you fast ramadan but you are rough and tough to your wife then you're not a good muslim if you smack or beat your wife you're not a good muslim if you swear and curse your wife you're not a good muslim if you're not fair and just with your wife you're not a good muslim and all of these things the prophet salallahu gave us the best example not with one wife but with two wives with all of his wives he was the best example to be set to us as muslims from this hadith he is joyfully playing with his wife saying leave some water for me though they could have both had their own bath separately but its sign of love the prophet sallam used to love his wives a lot and used to tell us that the prophet sallallahu asallam used to when she ate the meat he would look to the piece that he ate the meat that she ate the meat from and he would put his teeth exactly on the same place and location where she had put her teeth on she he would take the same bite from the same place and if she drinks from a cup he would drink from the exact location of the cup now compare this with our lives compare this with our wives if the wife of the missus is from the plate i'm gonna wash it seven times and one with soil this is look she ate from it i'm gonna get a quarantine at the whole place why she's your wife yeah but after 10 20 years of of life she's not my wife anymore you know we wives the first year after five years with cousins after 10 years we're like sisters and and brother after 20 years she's like a part of me if i kiss my hand because it's the same thing nothing moves this is strong the prophet salallahu sallam did not treat his wives in this manner he treated them respectfully he loved them he came out of his way to try to bring happiness to them though was the messenger of allah though everybody had to respect him and obey him though he knew that they knew if he wanted he would have had the whole wealth of this earth with it within uh uh seconds of his request nevertheless they were with him because he was the messenger of allah azzawajal and they obeyed him and loved him accordingly and again this is a subject that we all have to every time remind ourselves with the way we treat our wives the way we treat our children it's a responsibility we're not here for the gig or we're not here for the fun of it we are here because allah has given us this blessing a wife and children and it's a responsibility that we should take good care of otherwise allah will deprive us of enjoying this responsibility and i say this and i reiterate this because i have been hearing a lot of abuse from men that do not fear allah by hitting their children by hitting their wives abusing them insulting them and this is definitely not a sign of a good muslim and those who do this will be deprived from accompanying the prophet allah and being close to him in paradise may allah grant you and i this pleasure i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi as"
