  "title": "I leave biology class due to evolution theory, am I right? Is it kufr to study it? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sounds a lot I'm studying biology and in lectures sometime I study evolution in which um did a few like some parts of Bible and I don't know what they're refuting is the part of Bible that is not changed and I fear that um if I keep sitting in these lectures I am committing disbelief and so I believe what I'm doing is correct or not no it's not correct actually first of all you're not sure whether this is true or not second of all you have resentment in your heart towards the evolution Theory and whatever is connected to it and you're forced to study this and maybe you'll be examined and questioned on the final exams about these topics and you have to answer it or your flunk the uh the course so as long as you have resentment to it and your conviction is that Allah is the Creator and there's nothing as Evolution as per Darwin or the likes of him you're free to sit and if you can communicate with them and they allow free Democratic dialogue or discussion that should be interesting but if not then you can keep your mouth shut and do your exams and move on uh"
