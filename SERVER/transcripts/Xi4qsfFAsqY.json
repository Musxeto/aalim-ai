  "transcript": "foreign alaihi wasallam said allah the almighty says now this means that this hadith is a could see hadith so what's the difference between hadith and the verses of the quran scholars have many interpretations and explanations but the most authentic opinion is that with the hadith the wordings and the meanings are all from allah so what's the difference between it and the quran number one that it is not as miraculous as the quran so there's a challenge that started when the quran was revealed to all of the jinn and the humans to produce something like it if they can and they will never be able to and the challenge still stands while in the hadith there is no such challenge secondly you cannot recite anything in the salat in your prayer except the quran but you cannot recite al-qudzi hadith in the salat your salat would be invalid so these are the most two most important points to differentiate between the two now allah says in the hadith he was indeed i am as my servant presumes me to be what does that mean we have fear and we have hope and this definitely refers to the side of hope because no one as he assumes or thinks of allah that he will punish him allah is not telling you to do this rather he's telling you to think positively of allah azzawajal so allah says and i am with him when he remembers me with us all muslims and non-muslims and this is general as they call it in arabic but he's with us specifically the believers with his power and strength and victory and guidance which is not with the other with the others generally speaking so allah azzawajal is with him when he remembers me he says so if he remembers me to himself i remember him to myself and if he remembers me amongst a company i remember him among a company greater than it the angels and those in allah's congregation and if he draws near to me the span of a hand what is the span of a hand this from here to here this is a span of a hand we call it an arabic shibbar if he draws to me the span of a hand i draw near to him the span of an arm and if he draws to me or near to me this man of an arm i draw near to him the span of two outreached arms and if he takes a step towards me i hastily step towards him so this hadith shows you that allah azzawajal is reaching out to us and the more we do the more allah azzawajal does for us now one may think that how can we understand this hadith is it as it states that if we draw nearer to allah the span of a hand he draws nearer to us the span of an arm or is it metaphorical and we also try as best as we can to stay away from metaphors because then we will be changing the quran the sunnah and say no no this is not what it means this is not what it sounds like allah does not rise above the arch in al-istiwa allah does not descend to the lower heaven when it's the last third of the night this is all metaphoric no no no we don't say this we say that everything is as it sounds and reads because this is in arabic so how can we understand this hadith well we understand this hadith as we see that it has two parts if the servant of allah draws nearer to allah the span of a hand allah draws nearer to him the span of an arm so the first question would be does the servant of allah draw nearer to allah the span of a hand literally or the span of an arm literally does he walk to allah literally the answer is no nobody understands this so we understand it in the sense that all arabs do that because it's not true that one comes to allah the span of a hand or an arm rather it is an indication that the servant of allah is doing so much to get closer to allah with good deeds allah in return does the same with good reward with mercy with a lot of favors and blessings from his side so this is the beauty and the greatness of remembering allah azzawajal yet there are other others there is another group of scholars who said no no we have to stand understand this literally so there's nothing wrong in attributing to allah azzawajal that he draws nearer a span of a hand or an arm and that allah walks to brisk walking to his servant this can be understood literally either way it is accepted with the grace of allah with alhassanin this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you with allah foreign"
