  "transcript": "I want to ask about the ruling on racing games whether cars or motorbikes keeping in mind that some of them like give you extra points for drifting or doing stupid stunts or destroying the city or even destroying your fore cards like in Mario Kart how you turn into a rocket and kill people so what's what's the ruling on that if it is something that you do on your bike in a game drifting or wheelie or jumping op OB that you may harm yourself or uh your bike there's no problem it's a game but if it's involving killing people or harming others and maybe having an amount of violence no this is not permissible Allah Knows Best"
