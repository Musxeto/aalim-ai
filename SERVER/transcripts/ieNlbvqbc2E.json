  "transcript": "next on piece TV and welcome back to you stock we're still discussing the topic of sports in Islam do we have any comments yes sir okay break you're commenting on three preferred sports are riding riding horses and archery and swimming okay so I was thinking like what why these three in particular you know is there any reason like in your perspective let me answer that by saying first I did not say that these sports are preferred in Islam I said that these sports were recommended by Omar Fatah may Allah be pleased with him by telling us to teach your children these sports but we don't have any specific sports that the Prophet told us to do or indulge in the Companions of the Prophet SAW Salim at this time of the Prophet is thought so I'm used to race you know like in jogging and running and one of the famous joggers or runners was Sarah aqua and his tail his hadith inside Muslim you know it right off the guy on his own ran after a battalion that came in and took the Muslims cattle and camels and at nightfall and and nobody was aware of them he on his feet chopped opal away and caught up with them and he used to climb mountains and throw them with stones and whenever they stopped and some of them tried to fight with him he would come upon and they would go on and he would follow them and they would beat around the bush you know around the bush tried to escape him until he got every single sheep and camel off them so when they caught up with him like after six seven hours the Companions caught up with him and the prophet or Salaam was among them he told he he he appreciated that and said he told the prophet o prophet of Allah if you just give me a chance I will go and get them all what you've done was enough so the guy like literally six or seven hours on his foot racing climbing up mountains and fighting and killing people on his own and that was not it it was almost sunset and they had to go back again to Medina well actually it was in the middle of day before sunset and on their way Medina there was this person saying anybody to race anybody to race and sellable acquires is saying and I was embarrassed of showing off in front of the Prophet but when the guy repeated that challenge they want to race so I told him don't you have any shame and aren't you embarrassed of asking this question among us all don't you think that there are people that are able to race come on I'll race you the guy after seven hours of jogging and he still have the breath to race so he said we started racing to Medina back to Medina no jogging shoes no you know just do it no jogging let the guy you know come ahead of me and before the borders of Medina I put it all off put it all out and I came one you schmuck in in sense but of course in a private and then applied word and he won the race so this is one form of the supports and everybody was was practicing it even the props that I saw some he used to race but he used to race his wife's as form of being nice to them he used to race with Fatima with the Aisha that is and that the beginning of their marital life and she won in the first race three four years after she gains a more way he raced with her again and he won and he said to shake one for that one it's not the preferred sports in Islam to ride horses archery or swim but it is recommended because it teaches you discipline in archery it teaches you Atari Chuey you may need this to defend yourself with definitely you need to defend yourself in your country and you need this means of fighting to be powerful to be able to defend your beliefs and yourself horse riding is the same do you fight on horses but although it trims your body it it makes you feel the environment and the the nature that surrounds us swimming definitely is one of the greatest sports of all times anymore we're like hunting like sports like Game two like well this in Islam is not acceptable hunting animals as a sport is not acceptable like in Britain they have this to lose and with these horns and they go fox hunting you know and they make it make it as an animal event and it's a Resta kratts type of thing this is not acceptable it is forbidden to kill an animal just for the sake of killing you know some people would say like I like shooting cats I remember when I was young my neighbourhood would take these BB guns the small guns and it was funny I was sitting on your balcony and bang and the tail and what they would think that this is nice it's a cat it's a dog no it is not legitimate it's not permissible for you to shoot an animal just for the sake of shooting yes if you want to eat then shoot it if you go for hunting and you go into the wilderness into the jungle into the desert and you find a duck or whatever a rabbit and you shoot it to eat it then this is acceptable it's it's permissible but just to go for the sake of shooting then this is not acceptable in Islam yes sir my questions surrounding bodybuilding and now it's seen in Islam if it's a bad sport or not okay good sport because it gives you a confidence in yourself but what is the motive for you to practice bodybuilding and this is a very important thing to ask yourself what's your intention if your intention is to like make women look at you and attract girls this is a bad intention every single pump you do will be considered as a sin because the intention is bad if your intention is to be able to attend harm and fight with people again this is a bad intention but what if you want to look tough so people wouldn't hit and like why do you want to look tough look nice looking toughest is not an issue does not tell you look tough and let everybody you know go away from your your way to call people to Islam not to scare them off yeah but you get a certain amount of respect if you have respect you're gonna get with your deeds even if you have muscles you know like Arnold and if you don't be a good Muslim and if you don't respect people nobody would respect you so again the intention is very important to work out in a gym and did you do you know benchpress and inclines and pull out pull overs and so on that's good but providing that you don't do this you don't do it and naturally you don't take protein or steroids and and anabolics and whatever the drugs they have nowadays this isn't that's permissible because it endangers your health to do this to be able to communicate with others in a healthy manner to feel good to relieve the stress that's permissible but to do this to compete to show off no this is haram this is forbidden maybe a lot of people wear these you know and they start flexing their muscles in front of males and females and for what I'm not gonna buy a cattle I'm not gonna buy a sheep I'm you sure what what what meat are you showing me this is Haram and a lot of cases you end up with people you know giving you giving this participant an evil eye that would paralyze him or he would you know fall asleep for decades or whatever this is bad no in Islam you do practice your sports you do build your body it's good it's recommended but not to show off and not to use force the Prophet Allah Salim said that a strong person is not known by his ability to pin down another person by wrestling with him no a strong person is the one that controls his anger controls his rage and knows where to stop and to stand and I think that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time fiamma lillah wa salam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato [Music] you"
