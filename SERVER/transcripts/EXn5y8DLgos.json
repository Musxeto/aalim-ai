degeneration people come to a little adoration smelly rahmani raheem and hamdulillah hell banana me o sallahu wa sallim wa barik our alma birth i'm attending an amine nabina muhammad in vienna he was happy ajma'in assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today we will talk about a legend we will talk about one of the greatest companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam we will talk about one of the masters of paradise among the elderly as the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam we will talk about a person who the prophet alayhi salat wa salam said so many good things about he is Omar may Allah be pleased with him the second caliph of Islam the second best man of the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam they've been remark his son may Allah be pleased with him said that at the time of the prophet sallallaahu are you listening the Companions used to talk in favor Abu Bakr among all the other companions and then secondly they would favor Ahmad and thirdly they would favor earth man and they would not favor anyone else after that so Omar may Allah be pleased with him was the second-seeded he was the second ranked among the companions may allah be pleased with him but who was Omar his name was remark in the hubbub even no-fail did not dealer may Allah be pleased with him he goes with the prophet alayhi salat wa salam and joins him in his lineage with cap and he is known as abu hafs and the prophet called him this alayhi salatu salam he did not have Huff's but he named him abu hafs and the huffs is a small lion or the child of a lion and the prophet alayhi salatu salam called him on the battlefield in bedder by the name of al Farouq the decider who divides right from wrong may Allah be pleased with him and remark like most of the muhajireen was brought up in the capital of Arabia he was brought up in Makkah and he was brought up in a house known to be tough and rigid and to him belong diplomacy in the times of jahiliya in the times of pre Islam so whenever the people of Mecca had a dispute with others they would send him as their ambassador and he would talk on behalf of the people of Quraysh he was tough and strong heavily built he was so tall that whenever he walked people thought that he was riding because he was so tall he was strongly built with strong body and he had a loud voice and that is why a shiva bent abdullah may allah be pleased with her and have mercy on her said that omar whenever he spoke people would hear and whenever he would beat people would feel the pain and whenever he walks he would look as if he was running and he was the real monk with all these features he was a real monk a real worshipper of Allah the Almighty and he was among the youth well known in Quraysh to be tough and strong and he was among the youth of his people so he drank wine he drank intoxicants he worshipped the idols as they did and he was a fierce enemy to Islam and to the Muslims he was a learned that person as well he knew how to read and write and this was a luxury among the Arabs at that time only few people had the ability to read and write when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was revealed - he was about 30 years old or 20-plus years old and as I said he was a fierce enemy of Islam now remember this he embraced Islam on the sixth year of the revelation to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam on that sixth year and before him about forty or more embrace Islam so during the first six years only 40 accepted Islam now if you recall during the first four days of accepting Islam by Abu Bakr six great companions accepted Islam by the efforts of Abu Bakr earth man sad even a Buick cars a drag man a banal paul ha i bonobo Allah has obeyed him Allah WA and above ADA Imanol giraffe may Allah be pleased with them all in the first four days now six long years Umar may Allah be pleased with him was a fierce enemy of Islam he was torturing Muslims fighting Muslims going out of his way to do what his people are doing to get these infidels back into idols worshipping but on the 6th year allah azza wajal through the light of belief in his heart the wife of emiram Rabia may allah be pleased with her she tells us that she was preparing her right to travel and to migrate to Abyssinian when Roman hotpot may Allah be pleased with him saw her and he said to her so are you setting off and he said that with some softness in his voice not the usual toughness and she replied yes you people are not allowing us to worship Allah in peace you're not allowing us to call to the religion of Islam you're not leaving us alone so the only thing for us to do is to migrate and leave the whole country for you and Umar replied in softness by saying may Allah be with you and he was not a Muslim at the time so I made a murabbi I came back and he saw his wife talking to Homer as Rama was leaving he came to her and asked her what was that about and she told him and she told him that she sensed some change of direction in his voice and he told her do you believe that Omar will accept Islam by Allah his donkey would accept Islam before Omar accepts Islam it was that extent that people thought that it is out of the question that remark may embrace Islam and that is why the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to supplicate to Allah and say o Allah honor Islam with the embracing of Islam one of the two remark the Prophet is asking Allah to honor Islam by one of these two armored accepting and reverting to Islam and who were they they were Romano hoppip or am I being a sham well known as Abu jahil the greatest enemy of Islam so the Prophet I system was supplicating to Allah to guide one of them to Islam and it was said that a Buddha hell was the maternal uncle of Omar may Allah be pleased with him so the prophet sallallaahu supplicated that homework embraces and reverts to Islam how did he become a Muslim the story goes that he took his sword and he put it in his neck with anger coming out of his eyes headed to assassinate to kill rather than to assassinate the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and did he manage to do this task definitely not and if you tuned after the break we will know insha'Allah what took place so stay tuned I'm out of new hot pop may Allah be pleased with him on the sixth year after the revelation to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam decided to end it all they had enough of this man sallallahoalyhiwasallam who is threading his new religion that is not familiar to them he is calling people to worship only one God and what about these idols what about these things that we used to worship for so long the religion of our fathers and forefathers so he decided that today I'm going to end it he took his sword and he went where the Prophet RA salat WA Salam was gathered with his companions and on his way one of the Muslims hiding his Islam saw him and he told him where to Omar he said I'm going to Muhammad I'm going to kill him so the man wanted to divert him from his direction he told him well before you kill Muhammad go and look in your own family your sister and her husband your brother-in-law I have accepted Islam and this made him furious so he went to his sister's house broke the door and he went in the minute they heard his voice one of the companions hid under the bed the brother-in-law who was sir Aiden's 8 they've been honorably no faith and he himself sir Aiden's 8 was one of the 10 who were giving the glad tidings of the prophet alaihi salatu salam to enter paradise these top 10 people top 10 companions if you ask anyone about the bonds League or about the Spanish football league or about this or that player which team they're playing for or about the Brazilian team they would give you a list of names but if you ask any Muslim nowadays who are the 10 whom the prophet Alice a lot said I'm died while he was pleased with them and he gave them the glad tidings of paradise people would probably know four or five they don't know and this is a big problem saying he didn't is 8 whenever you talk to someone and say say a demon's ad says who's he they don't know that he is one of these 10 people he is the son of the cousin of amber Omaha pop his name is say it bends 8 hey Ben I'm even a new Fang and his father was Z AB enamel one of the people whom the prophet alayhi salaatu sent before Islam he was with him and this man never frustrated to any of the idols he never slaughtered to the idols he used to worship Allah as Abraham peace be upon him used to and he would say to the people where are your minds why don't you think Allah creates the sheep and Allah brings rain from the heavens so that the trees grow where the Sheep feeds over and now you're slaughtering this sheep to someone else so his son was a DMZ and he was married to the sister of Omaha pop the minute Rama broke the door and barged in the house sir a dooms eight stood up but he's standing up in the face of a hurricane a tornado would stand in front of Omar may Allah be pleased with him and I were just you know wedded him away he smacked him on the face and the guy was on the ground couldn't move and he went to his sister and she was reading the Quran she had a leaflet she had some stone with verses of the Quran written on it and he smacked her in the face and she started bleeding and she was furious as well and when he saw the blood he felt sorry and softened a little bit and he told her what are you reading she told him this is the Quran and I am a Muslim and do whatever you want to do so he backed up a little bit and said give it to me let me read it she said no you are a kafir you are a mushrik you are not just you are impure and this book is only held by people who purify themselves go and take a bath and come back so he went and took a bath and came back and he read the beginning of the verse the verses of chapter of Taha Manzella allah quran allah - PHA we have not revealed the quran so that you would become one of the miserable ones and he went on and subhanAllah he changed and this is the effect of the Quran people try to stop others from listening to the Quran because anyone with a clear nature anyone who is natural and not bias anyone who's objective whatever he recites the Quran he knows that this is the word of Allah it does not praise people it does not ask you to give your money to people or to individuals it is not classify people in ranks we have this rank is superior and this rank all people are equal the black and the white those who are from the east and those who are from the west when they pray they pray in one row this is the Quran and that is why there are lots of efforts to divert people from the Quran because it's the word of Allah it's not the word of humans if you recite it you know immediately that no one can match this and this is the challenge 15 centuries ago Allah Azza WA JAL challenged the people to make 10 chapters like it and then to make one chapter like it so the least chapter is composed of three verses bring only three verses try to match it and no one succeeded which indicates that this is the miracle of our prophet alayhi salat wa sallam he did not say it he could not bring something similar to it no human can this is the word of Allah and that is why it immediately transformed remark 180 degrees from being a fierce enemy of Islam to want him to become a Muslim why you have a life that is second to none you are one of the dignitaries of Croatia you are their ambassador you are one of the strongest toughest men if not these strongest and toughest man you drink wine you fornicate you have whatever you wish no one can stand in your face what makes you accept this religion of Islam why do you want to prostrate and bow to the creator of the heavens and the earth why do you want to leave all of this behind and become like any normal person simple because this is the word of Allah and that is why immediately he was transformed it is not because of him we see so many people stray so many people living like animals literally living like animals waking up in the morning working throughout the day going to bed not nothing where their life will lead them to then what when we die it's over well let me make it now let me kill myself now and get it over with this is not a life get a life and this is why Omar got his life may Allah be pleased with him so he asked them where is Mohammed and they told him that he is in Dardanelle outcome so he went there but with a different face without this anger in his eyes sparkling he went to meet Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and this was on the sixth year of his revelation during his salat wa sallam and when the people already heard that he was coming and they looked from the door the Muslims were terrified they saw omar coming and the funny thing was that only three days ago one of the Lions of Allah accepted Islam and that was Hamza Abdul Muttalib the uncle of the Prophet is awesome one of the fierce warriors of Islam only three days accepted Islam so he was with the Prophet Alex awesome and the people came to the Prophet o prophet of Allah it's summer coming what are we going to do so Hamza in a calm voice sitting down and even moving from his chair said let him come in if he wants something good we will help him if he wants something bad we will chop his head with his sword not with ours we will take the sword from him and chop his head look at this bravery and this strength this power in Hamza may Allah be pleased with him that is why the prophet alayhi salatu salam called him I said Allah the Lion of Allah the Almighty who can stand in his face so people being terrified they know the strength of remark the Prophet said allowing him in so the minute remark came in the Prophet Alistair son did not greet him the Prophet al-islam did not stay away from him so that he would not take his short and attack the Prophet Alice awesome the Prophet was unarmed yet he did something that no one would do he approached trummer and he grabbed her from his shirt and he started pulling him and saying Omar isn't it time isn't it time and Omar immediately said ash hadu a la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu and naka Abdullah who are so low I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and I bear witness that you are the servant and the Messenger of Allah and immediately the whole house the whole Muslim were in that place said allahu akbar allah is great and the whole of Makkah trembled with this tech beer and the people in the Masjid the dignitaries of the pagans of Quraysh felt that this is not good now this sound is definitely not good and immediately what did Romer say do you expect remark to embrace Islam within half an hour and then go and sit back and say well listen I have to sit on the internet and gather all the information about Islam and Google it and maybe do this and do that I'd like to make few researchers know immediately he was positive and he said o prophet of Allah give me one good reason why we are hiding in this Dardanelle arkham and worshipping allah in secrecy give me one good reason aren't we on the true path then here's my suggestion Oh prophet of Allah so Allah has and I suggest that we form Torro with Hamza the Lion of Allah Hamza have been vitally leading one and with me leading the others a new prophet of Allah walk in between us and we head from this house to the Masjid of al-haram we go and we pray and we show everyone that we are not afraid anymore and the profit that is salatu salam agreed to that and they went and they entered the message and the pagans of Mecca the elderly the dignitaries they could not do a thing with Hamza with Rome are leading these two rows and the people of Makkah knew that with the Islam of our may Allah be pleased with him it was a new era for Islam and the Muslims this is all the time we have for today's programme until we meet next time ta Manila Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
