  "transcript": "hello oh God alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons we're still studying the chapter that deals with menstruation and we have Hadith number 121. 121. narrated by um we didn't consider we didn't consider Brown meaning muddy colored and yellow discharge after purification from menstruations as anything impure now one simple short note forgive me for saying this but I've noticed nor that every time you read the Hadith you say Bismillah and although calling or or or making thicker the name of mention in the name of Allah is something that is good nevertheless we have to avoid having uh something innovative now when do we recite the Quran we mention Bismillah only in the beginning of every chapter with the exception of Surah to Toba so 113 places we begin the Quran by saying Bismillah but whenever I want to recite a verse of the Quran I do not say Bismillah I say immediately recite the Quran likewise in the Hadith it is not Sunnah to begin reciting the Hadith by saying Bismillah mainly because the prophet didn't do it Allah and also because then you may confuse people and saying by seeing you do this they say that well to read Hadith you have to say Bismillah this is not the case one would argue and say then why do you begin every program by saying Bismillah the answer would be that there is a Hadith saying that anything that is begun without mentioning the name of Allah is cut or not complete it's incomplete so it is the custom of Scholars to begin their session with Bismillah but if they're going to begin every single Hadith by saying Bismillah it says a different story anyhow okay um is talking about yellowish and brownish discharge what is this now bleeding comes the menstruation comes to a woman and when the bleeding is over she's purified which means that she takes a total bath and she prays the question is how does a woman know she has been purified how would she know that she has the tor Scholars say there are two ways one some women simply are purified by the stoppage of bleeding of menstruation it's no more she doesn't see any bleeding and by this she is considered to be fahr other women and this is the majority after the bleeding is over they see a white thread-like discharge and they can they can see it and this white thread-like discharge is a sign of their purity the minute the woman sees it this is pure it's not mixed with any yellowish or reddish or brownish substance says please with her that we did not consider Brown which is Muddy colored and yellow discharges after purification so she tells us that if a woman is purified the bleeding stops the menstruation stops and she knows that it's no more or she sees the white thread-like discharge then the minute she sees this she takes a total bath and she is able to pray some women a day or two they get this yellowish or brownish discharge whenever they go to the toilet so they think that oops we may have purified ourselves earlier than we were supposed to so they used to ask would this be considered to be part of the administration omate tells us no and this is the rule if a woman sees her Purity the if she's purified if the administration ends whether by the stop uh stoppage of bleeding or by seeing the white thread then that is it she may not be bothered by any yellowish or brownish discharge that comes afterwards it's finished she may pray and fast as she wishes and it has nothing to do with uh her monthly period but also one should not be quick to purify herself and that is why may Allah be pleased with her used to tell them that don't rush things because women used to show her uh what they wipe after wiping they show her the color and she would say she would see some yellowish or reddish or brownish color before she they see the purification before they see the white thread and she would tell them do not rush do not rush you're still menstruating until you see Purity until you see the purification which is by the white thread like or by the stoppage of the bleeding the following Hadith Hadith number 122. narrated the Jews used not to eat with a woman during her menstruation period so the prophet saws said do everything else apart from sexual intercourse with your eyes now again if you've noticed our religion is based on so many things that we differ with the other religions even in the clothes we wear even the our appearances you know growing the beard the prophet says grow your beard and cut short your mustaches differ than the Jews Christians and the fire worshipers this time we can see the Jew I mean the Hebrew people they they just like us they just like Muslim I mean not not the way they're wearing the clothes but you can see you know they they have they have a lot of beards yeah well this this is not the general case now if you look at the population you would find that it is not the case only those rabbis and the student of knowledge may do this and the beard itself is the Sunnah of all prophets of Allah it's even it's even mentioned in the Holy Quran when Moses came back me a piece of blessing of Allah be upon him and he got the tablets with him and he came and found that his tribe were worshiping this golden uh uh cow or whatever he as we mentioned in the Quran he started blaming Aaron his brother I think I'm pronouncing him right Aaron and it tells us in the Quran that Aaron said O Brother Moses do not hold me from my head and from my beard and this is the Sunnah and this is the way of all messages of Allah and this is nature human nature men by Nature should grow beard this is natural and it's it's a strange thing that Allah did not tell us to do something so that we would complain and say oh it's too difficult for us to do he told us just leave it now imagine if Allah in the Quran tells us you have to shave your beards every single morning and in the afternoon who would have complied with this a lot of people would complain and say God this is too much twice a day or once a day this is too much man I I feel like leaving it I don't want to do this it's a burden on me Allah on the country is telling you leave it Satan comes and shaytan the Devil comes to say leave it why do some effort move it remove it and do this and do that when the prophet salallahu told us to differ from the Jews and the Christians and to grow our beards because the majority of Jews and Christians don't go to the beat and this is what what you can see only those who are uh rabbis and and students of knowledge and extremists from the Jews grow their beats but the 99 percent do not do this so even if they do this now even if 100 the Jews and Christians grow their beard this doesn't mean that we have to differ to them and and shave it it's not imagine that you get this uh Rabbi uh praying five times a day in the direction of Kaaba would we say what we have to differ with them and okay if they're praying I'm not going to pray no it's not the case the prophet is giving us a short uh justification you have to do this and maybe it would make you feel better to know that you are different to them and but not all the time so and there are so many things in Islam where Allah tells us that you have to be different than the Jews and the Christians for example we uh pray wearing our sandals or without the prophet salallahu tells us that pray in your sandals because the Jews do not train their sandals so you have the option if you want if you're you're praying in you're praying Outdoors pray wearing your sandals or your shoes it's okay as long as it has not no no filth or dirt on it but it doesn't mean again to go into the mosque wearing your sandals or boots and praying in the first row because people will not accept this so we have to be different to the Jews this Hadith tells us that at the time of the Prophet Allah and it says that the Jews used not to eat with women during their menstruation so whenever a woman has her menstruation they'll kick her out go out for a week or two come back later on I don't want to see you they don't eat with her they don't touch her they think that she is a menace I know that some Muslims share this unfortunate uh wrong concept and they think that women are Menace they're not Menace as the case with men not all men are Menace also there are good and bad nevertheless they did not eat with her and they did not sleep in the same bed with her because they thought the minute she has the menstruation she's an evil thing she has to be thrown away in Islam it's a religion of a a medium it's in the middle we don't go to the far extreme to the right or to the fire extreme to the left the Jews are away from their wives when they have the menstruation the Christians don't give don't care if she's menstruating or not they have intercourse as if nothing is wrong with that Islam No fix this thing and made things right on the right path we will take a short break and inshallah after it we will continue our topic oh inshallah on the straight path we would like to discuss the club from an Islamic and social political perspective so sometimes some non-muslims they might not understand the full Islamic pictures anyone can say anything about it yes so when can we who speaks for Islam this is the biggest question who speaks for Islam no they are not sinning they are not sinning but we are talking about now the general rule they are not sinning but they are going against what has been established it is his honest he had at a specific time people would see it as a threat a threat exactly how do we how do we explain to them it's not really a threat it's actually good for the country as well but if we don't participate how would we ever reach to our rights can you clarify with us what should be the level of political participation of the Muslims in the west yeah oh I think we should read Hadith 122 and also we should hear Hadith 123 afterwards and then comment on both Hadith inshallah brother Mustafa narrated the Jews used not to eat with the woman during her menstruation period so the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said do everything else apart from sexual intercourse with your voice okay and the following Hadith Allah's Messengers and then Caress Me One Main Street okay these two hadiths tell us what we're supposed we we are allowed to do and we what we are not allowed to do for example Hadith anas tells us that the Jews used to abandon their wives used to put them in isolation and stay away as far as possible from them when they are in their menstruation we know that the Christians don't have anything regarding Purity and their religion in the sense that they don't have to wash they don't have to clean they don't have to perform Evolution before praying or doing anything so the administration is considered nothing to them so they have no problem in intercoursing while a woman is in her menstruation in Islam it's in the middle between these two Extremes in Islam the only thing that a man is prevented to do with his wife when she is menstruating is intercourse but other than that any form of intimacy any form of playing with his wife and and and and feelings and and rubbing uh is is okay is acceptable and it shows us that the problem see the relationship is not only intercourse and this is very unfortunate a lot of people think that the relation between a man and his wife is only intercourse so if she's menstruating then don't burn do whatever you want you know Outdoors or travel or whatever because she's out of order her expiry date is seven days then afterwards you may refresh the web page and go back again to normal this is wrong the prophet Allah when his wife would get her monthly period nothing would change on the contrary he would come closer and he will would make her feel wanted though he has Alternatives he has eight other wives but the feeling itself is good and this is an advice to all husbands that when your wife is in her menstruation period She feel that she is missing something and by you staying away from her you're you're emphasizing this feeling on the contrary you should do what the prophet saws used to do you should get closer to her you should give her more love and caring in this short period of time because she needs it a lot the Jews used to consider a menstruating woman as filth that should be avoided they should could used to consider her body her clothings as in an impurity in a jazza so they would not sit with her they would not talk with her they would not even eat with her and the Muslims are completely opposite to this they treat their wives their daughters as normal as they usually do the prophet salallahu alaihi sallam as in the Hadith used to kiss her and caress her and and play with her salallahu though she was in her menstruation but he he did everything except for the intercourse and the prophet Allah used to put his head in her lap and he used to recite the Quran and this shows you the amount of love between him and her and his all of his wives because the affection has to be there it's not a physical thing it's not a a something that one detaches from she is your wife she's part of you and you're part of her the prophet saws used to let her calm his hair and I know a lot of rough tough men that will won't allow uh their women to get close to them and this is wrong the prophet is the perfect man and he used to have his wife allow his wife to come his hair and do everything else as normal it's there's no problem in a woman having her menstruation this is a natural thing it's not a curse it's not a disease it is something that is natural and happens to every uh one that is female not male because you have a problem then uh Hadith 124 narrated Allah's Messengers said regarding a husband who has sexual intercourse with his wife during menstruation period he should give out one dinar or half a dinar in charity he should get one dinar or half of them half a DNR as alms or to charity now this Hadith tells us about what a person does if he sins what would he do in order to compensate for his sin because if a person sleeps with his wife into courses with his wife well she has the menstruation this is a sin it's mentioned in the Holy Quran that you should refrain from intercourse with Administration wife this is not allowed in Islam but knows that people could get weak and shaytan could get strong so what would happen if a person Fell in This sin and committed it the prophet here says that he should pay or give out one dinar or half a dinar so which one to choose now what is a dinar a dinar is a currency that a scholar say it is equivalent to four and a half grams of gold four and a half grams of gold so depending on how much a gram is you can calculate what you should uh uh pay uh intercoursing your wife while she's menstruating is a major sin it's it's forbidden and it's Haram because Allah tells us so and because also of the medical implication on both parties on both the woman and on the man and lots of diseases are transmitted through this vulnerable state the woman is in that is why it's forbidden but now let's come to a dinar or half a dinar so which is which does anybody have any idea which which one to choose a dinar or have a dinner I didn't think so probably you're not married yet so you don't even ah Mustafa I could guess that maybe if a person did it on purpose then he pays one dinar okay but if he was tempted then well purpose and tempted is the same thing because if you're tempted and you do it then you will be punished for it see if a person or he didn't know he didn't know well if he didn't know then there's nothing wrong in that because Allah says in the Quran if we have done it by forgetfulness or we did not know then Allah will not hold us responsible for it now temptation is found everywhere and if you're tempted and you answer your call of Temptation you're sinful and you're punished accordingly but Scholars say dinar and half a dinar depending on when this intercourse takes place so let's imagine that a person is sleeping with his wife she's pure he has 20 2 or 23 days of pahara of is okay they're sleeping off and on it's okay then today he's he had intercourse with her tomorrow she has her menstruation if he makes intercourse this day he should pay one full dinar why because he was enjoying himself the past 23 22 days so there's not that big urge and need for intercourse but if he waits for a whole week and then he's tempted and then he falls into sin and commit and has intercourse then he pays only half a dinner why because the need is much far greater than it was a week ago you see the catch it's different depending on the need if it the need was not there then he should be punished more but if the need is there though to sin though it's Haram yet he was tempted and he did it so the conversation would be paying uh uh this half dinar the following Hadith Hadith number 125 narrated by Abu side by the way it means happy so you should be happy when you are reading this Hadith okay Allah messenger said is it not the case that a woman in her menstruation period neither pray nor fast of course this is a part of a very long Hadith but what do we learn from this Hadith simple administrating woman does not fast and does not pray so this is as simple as it gets and I don't think we have to elaborate more on uh this Hadith but what happens if a woman fasts without knowing and this happens with lots of the girls when they're young and they're not adults yet so a girl is about nine ten years 11 years old and all of a sudden boom she gets her Administration so she's shy she doesn't tell her father she doesn't tell her mother and she goes by and she prays with her mother and she fast Ramadan with them and she doesn't tell them that she has her menstruation and 6 7 10 15 years later she realizes that this was wrong so she asks what should I do well the answer is typical and easy the prayers are unacceptable and she don't have to pray them again as they do they are not request required to be prayed again administrating woman does not pray period And when she's clean she does not uh pray them again but the fasting of Ramadan is a different story she has to fast these days again so if she is asking 10 years after the event took place she has to calculate how many ramadans did you skip usually it's two or three ramadans because two or three years and then everybody knows that she's a grown-up woman now so it's a two or three uh months then how many days do you calculate she says well usually it's six days to seven days so let's assume seven days by three you have 21 days to make up for the days that you have fasted when you had your menstruation which you're not supposed to do okay am I am I sinful by doing this yes you are sinful Allah will forgive you if you repent I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time oh foreign foreign"
