  "transcript": "Malik may Allah be pleased with him says the prophet of Allah was a medium height neither tall nor short he was of a handsome physique what does a handsome physique means mean that he was symmetrically balanced so he wasn't Fat and he was not skinny he was not bulky he was not a a little man actually he was the perfect stature and uh uh uh posture of a an individual so he was a of handsome physique and his hair was neither crispy curled nor um smooth uh Brown of color we when he walked he used to stride confidently so we spoke about his hair and we spoke about his physique and we did not speak about his complexion it says Brown of color the previous Hadith you said he was neither white pale white nor dark so now he is brown of color what does this mean the word used in Arabic is Asar and Asmar in the Arabic language the original authentic standard classical Arabic language means someone white with uh redness or a blush in his tone and there is no difference of opinion among all Scholars of Islam and the companions that the prophet was white but was he dark the answer is no what about this uh uh um brownish color or the word used this is related to some tan which the prophet had caught from being exposed to the Sun to traveling going out and to the wind Etc but he was white without any uh dispute in that what about the issue of that he used to walk and and stride confidently the word is yet meaning as if he's falling from or descending from a hill when someone descends from a hill he looks as if he's going downwards like this so the prophet naturally when he walked with his companions he used to stride confidently in a fast pace and this is how he used to walk this is how he how he used to roll not in a very slow motion as if he's dying and not like a wild camel you see people walking in in very wild motions and looking right and left you could tell that that this is out of dignity is not befitting rather he was agile he was fit and whenever he walked this is his natural walk without breaking breath without having any difficulty while everyone among the companions were striving to catch up with the prophet Alam but this is his nature so this is the way he walked which showed us how healthy and fit he was Sall now when we go to the third Hadith the prophet uh as described by Al may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the prophet of allaham was neither curly nor lank hair of medium height broad shouldered with uh um hair that reaches the loops of his ears wearing a red suit of clothes I've never seen anything more beautiful than him now the prophet sallallah Al wasallam was average in height some narrations say that he always looked average in height but when he was accompanying tall people he looked tall and he accompanied short people he even looked tall so he's always wasam in portion now he had broad shoulders and this is a description of a strong man not necessarily bulky or fat no no no but his bones were heavy and big and he had hair that as we will come and explain later in the chapter that describes his hair that was in between his ear Lubes and his shoulder so his hair reach in the midle not all the way to his shoulders and not only to his ear Loops but rather below that and Al says I saw him wearing a red suit is made of two pieces so a jacket and um and a waist wrapper of two pieces now red is a description of the majority of the color not pure red because there are hadiths where the Prophet prohibited the Muslims from wearing pure red so this what I'm weing if someone were to describe it would say it's red but it's not it's white and red evenly balanced but because white is a dominating color that is the weakest of them all because it takes anything so so the dominating color all in all is the red yet we are permitted to wear this because it's half red and half white there's no problem with that if it were totally red no Stripes no other colors associated with it that would be totally prohibited as the most authentic opinion of Scholars this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you muhamed"
