  "transcript": "there's no stomping perfect with no flaws it all other laws of Allah a way of life way of life a way of life for we have knives Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu all praise belongs to allah and may his peace and blessings be upon his prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are going to be discussing magic witchcraft the evil eye envy and all things associated with these subjects with us discussing these topics we have our D issue check assimil Hakim from Saudi Arabia chef Sally Mohammadi from the UAE and chef Mohammed Eddy from Canada may allah reward you all for joining us now in the previous episode we have taken a little bit of a look at what is witchcraft what is magic how the jinn are involved in these matters now another matter which is related to this subject is the eye or the evil eye if you like now this is something which a lot of people you know they might not know about a lot of cultures aren't aware of this whereas others they get to the point they're almost obsessed with this matter so I want to begin as always I'll begin with chef Bassam insha'Allah could you introduce us to the subject of the eye and exactly what it entails in Islam shillerman / Haman Haman little bit an imino sallallahu wasallam overlocker Abadie he what I saw here I mean nabina muhammad why the early hero sorry I'm bad in Islam we have two semi related issues that people usually are confused by and they think that they're the same thing we have what is known as a line and we have al hasit something that is known as the evil eye and the other is known as al hasit which is envy now they all think that it's the same thing but it is not envy is an evil act that is deliberately being done by the individual and in short it is wishing that the favor the blessing the good things a person is enjoying that it is removed away from him hopefully that it would come to me but it has to be removed from him so if I see a brother who has a beautiful car my Envy would be oh he's not deserving of that guy doesn't deserve such a car I should be driving such a car what does he have to get such a car so this is something that first of all it affects the person having it because it burns him from inside and not only that it burns his it consumes his good deeds and we will deal with that Shallah later on but the evil eye which is a name is something that usually is done unintentionally and this has the effect of a person's evil spirit coming and coinciding with what he sees and admires especially and definitely when he does not mention the name of Allah and when he does not wish that individual that Allah blesses that nema so I may see a car in this car by the way might be my own car it's not necessarily that someone's else it can't be my car and I look at it and I admire it so much without knowing that I am affecting that vehicle that house that property that individual with my evil spirit without me intending it and because I did not say Barack Allah tabarak Allah Masha Allah and such then this affects it and defects it as well and there are bases of the sin I believe Shannon mentioned that in the hadith of salomon honey may Allah be pleased with him when he was bathing and one of the Companions would he say bathing he was just cleaning himself so he took his shirt off not of course he wasn't nude he just took his shirt off and he was just cleaning himself and he had beautiful skin so one of the companions said whoa I haven't seen skin like this except on virgins that this is not the skin of a man look how soft and tender it is and immediately the man fell fell sick and the people started visiting him you know as a sick person the Prophet came out his son and I mean we looked at him he said do you accuse anyone and they told him yes this individual this companion said so and so and so the Prophet was angered by that and he reprimanded the man was talking to him harshly why do you kill your brother and then he gave him the Cure which we will come to mention later on Shama I've actually got a question I supposed to get things rolling a little bit you mentioned that when you see something that you're pleased with you should say about a colossal fee may Allah bless it and a lot of people are they debate over this so I'd like to get your advice on it some say you should say masha'Allah others say masha'Allah yeah cool little a be learn other sites have article about a club and some say you should say one and not the other what are we taught to say in the Sunnah when we see something that our brother or sister might have and we want to ask Allah to bless it come to love salatu salam ala rasulillah Elias are human whether the evil eye is true is a fact and maybe some non-muslims are watching also we are living in a world that has many things which are hidden and invisible so there are invisible creatures we don't see them and Allah this is diraja philosophy no to Allah he told us and taught us how to protect ourself against such things so this evil eye it is a riddle it's a mystery what is it if I am able am rahim allah said it seems that some destructive phrase they come from once i remember from childhood this is still green in my memory we had a little kid animal okay that's the meaning of kid actually and it was fact and lovely comes rubs its skin against you and this so our neighbor was a blind man blind so the kid came near to him so he put his hand in the back of the kid and the kid immediately started and fell my mother I'm Hal I immediately there was a man standing he told him slow too the kid before it dies when they skinned the kid guess what the liver inside was just cut like that as if you took a knife I remember my mother carrying the kid telling the people see this is the effect of the eye he just placed his hand you might harm someone you love your own child you come from work tired and the child is hiding itself behind the door daddy daddy I'm giving you a hug before you say Michelle aren't you it's that child with the evil eye so we have to understand this that it is a fact it is a reality so like what to say smella mashallah will do said I don't see why brothers they make fuss of these things this is lack of knowledge okay in the hadith the sheer convention held up a rock Tariq why didn't you say tabarak Allah and we have a problem sometimes a person comes across one narration and he doesn't know the rest of the narration so that's it so what is more important that you remember Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala inshaallah then we'll come across the evidences and the proofs in general like okay so i don't have to specifically mention you know may allah bless this that that and mentioned this it's enough to remember a law's name and if you can't see much a lot about it a lot that is best yes because some scholars did say that the ayah which is mentioned in surah al-kahf was not referring to preventing the evil eye but rather to be grateful to allah who granted you these two gardens and of course the hadith is clear the best is to ask Allah for blessing this you know eradicate any evil thoughts or looks coming from an individual but definitely there are a lot of things that are not related to the Sunnah so if I do something and people are amazed by it is Wow and I say yeah he's ala ala nabi or facilitating to the Prophet al-assad salam and in some countries they say i n masala and maybe if something horrible happens they say our this is an evil eye that did not offer a Shinto the Prophet Assam and we know definitely this is an innovation it does not prevent an evil eye to say Allah humma salli ala muhammad oh it's a very good and precious deed indeed evil eye is mentioned in the sunnah and he as the chefs mentioned that the Prophet said that is awesome that with the evil eye regarding this animal the evil eye entered a camel in the FATA pot what does that mean Janna the evil eye caused the camel to die and before it dies we slaughtered it so that we can utilize the meat and eat it and it entered also a man his grave so people can die by the evil eye like in the hadith of the Sahabi sorry he almost died so an evil eye could be a fatal thing indeed is a qualified we're going to go to a very short break and continue on this very interesting topic so dear viewers do stay tuned inshallah we'll be back after a very short moment assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome back dear viewers we here discussing witchcraft sorcery evil eye envy and all matters related to this now she has him before the break you were mentioning a little bit about the evil eye evil eye is not a sign of deviancy a righteous person like in the case of the companion he gave an evil eye to his brother but envy is an act of oh it's an a major sin and it is an act that only comes from evil and deviant people that's why the Prophet said has some Latta has to do do not envy one another and also chefs Adam indicated that a person can give an evil eye to his son to his daughter to his wife well wife I don't think nobody would give an evil eye to his wife but no but it was reported in the books of history that one of the caliphs of Omega Empire he once looked at his reflection in the mirror and he said Abu Bakr Siddiq was the kindest Omar was the toughest earth man was the most generous Hari was the wisest mahalia was the conness I've been Malik oh no one was so and so and he kept on mentioning all the rulers before him and then he said as for me I am so-and-so and he's impressed by the way he looks it was reported that a month did not pass while this guy died of his own evil I imagined that so but how did they know he died because of that they can tell by the symptoms that fall on people see nowadays people say that I went to shake so-and-so and he said that I have an evil eye or I have black magic and people go to the extreme by saying I called sheer so-and-so and he told me that I have I'm possessed so and I say okay how do you know there's a shake hook you up to a monitor and says oh okay you got to change your spark plugs is this the case they said no there are signs that callers out of experience by reciting ayatul kursi if the guy feels drowsy if the guy faints if the guy changes in color if he sweats they know that this is an indication most likely are symptoms that these symptoms indicate this soap the scholars say with regarding to this halifa the guy was young had he had nothing to do but what he said was a probable cause for an evil eye now while we're on sorcery and things because I know from my own background my Italian father side of the family they also believe in the evil eye malocchio as they call it and they have a tradition and I'm going to tell you this tradition and now you tell me where this would fall him with Islam they would say if you want to find out if someone has an evil eye upon them that you get a pot and you put oil in it and you heat it below with a candle and however many bubbles come up this shows how many times they've been given the evil eye now of course you know even my father when he was raised he said I don't believe in this nonsense in Islam do we have any of these things because you see a lot of people they have these symbols these blue eyes that will protect you or some you know wild ideas about this do these things exist or is this you know mumbo-jumbo you know modern days you have all these superstitions that go around right you have the 13th floor if you go to American apartment buildings you'll see there's no 13th floor right they just take it out I was once in the airport coming through customs in Canada and my daughter took out an umbrella and the lady was checking the bags and then she told my daughter oh wait wait don't open the umbrella because it's bad luck to open the umbrella indoors indoors and then I said open it as much as you want to go and play with it as much as you want but you see that this is very prevalent even in with people that they'll say we're modern and we don't believe in religion or anything like that they still believe in it and I just you know for all the viewers and everybody as Sam came to save us from these things right and to protect us and to liberate us so we don't after entering into some go back to these ways taking rocks taking amulet believing in superstitions and these are very very prevalent through all cultures so when it comes to like because it's so common this blue eye especially amongst Turk and whatnot I mean they would say this will protect us from the evil eye is there any basis for this if there's no basis can it even be sinful or you know what grade of cinders are fall into the believe in it is a breach of DOE heat it's a sign of because you believe that this eye which is blue or this rock prevents evil eye from coming to you and this is complete nothing prevents the evil eye from coming to you except the pools with the grace of Allah so gel with the earth car so cool oh Allah Allah Allah Allah poor robinus ayatul kursi the last two ayahs of surat al-baqara these are the protectors with the grace of Allah so in reciting them not just putting them out now this brings us to another issue which is in some Arabs houses you would find that them hanging a palm on the wall and we ask them they say this prevents the entrance the entrance prevents hasit this has an origin that I know of it stated that before we know that one of the things that repelled the evil eye and has said is to recite cool our adorable fellip min sharri Mahalo I mean surely Raza can either walk up on me share in the faith that if you cut Oh Michel rehearse it in either has it these are how many verses five verses so they used to first of all hang these five verses the surah to prevent hazard but then it took a big portion of the wall so instead they said whenever someone is giving you an evil eye or envying you just say yaki this so in America they say talk to the hand so there instead of reciting the surah they just had this idea they took the palm and they hung it as for the blue eye there might be an origin but does it affect the situation that it is shaped definitely not I just don't think that there might be a misunderstanding just because it has an origin doesn't mean that it's often yes that's what I said yeah I'm just I want you to take you to remind myself and the audience we mention in the beginning what can be considered as a means of cure there are three types number one the what is being proven materially physically it's very mentally such as medicine that is accepted in Islam because it is proven second one spiritual that is sanctioned by Quran and Sunnah third anything else not falling here it is chill so now where do we would this blow I is it material no is it spiritual no it is here so this is the criterion you apply so if we have some of these time to throw them away exactly now we're talking about Quran and this is again a common thing that you'll see a lot of people saying he dines at the house and they might have a told courtesy or some of these verses on the wall and then a lot of them later on they said I've heard from chef so-and-so that I shouldn't hang it on the wall rather I should say it so when it comes to hanging these verses on the wall there may be a difference of opinion so I want to get you know some of your thoughts on this whether it's okay to hang these verses on the wall or whether or not this is perhaps even a disrespect to the Quranic tennis-shoe of dispute among scholars some scholars say that as long as you're reading it and it's reminding you it's permissible others say even if it's reminding you it is not permissible because Quran was not revealed to be a decoration of the house and the majority of the people who hang rest of the Quran on the wall they don't hang it because of the content but rather because it is a form of decoration it beautifies the wall for art it's in sort of an art and that is why it is not permissible to hang it our thesis is very very not recommended to hang it especially if we know that I've noticed a brother who have visited his house and he had this big beautiful ayah hung and a piece of art so he was giving his back to it sitting underneath and I said okay how long you've been living here is it ten years and this is been there all the time without looking what's written on it and the guy he knows most sweating mmm well I have forgot so then if you claim that you'll be leading it and it may reminds you of a lot as well this is not true because once you get accustomed to Kalos it's gone and over with the other thing is that those who want protection and I believe we should you know talk about how to protect ourselves and also how to cure ourselves from such illnesses Envy or black magic those who seek protection usually hang these amulets made of solely of the Quran so is this permissible or not I'll ask a question and answer that question as well scholars say that among the Companions if an Omer was reported that he used to do this with his children and one of the Companions used to do this some say that he was doing this to teach them how to read the Quran because it's a board and he used to write verses of the Quran and rub it off in writings others say no it might have been amulets so is it permissible this the majority of scholars say that it is not permissible especially with the children because they will enter the bathroom where they may humiliate they may do things that are not befitting and it's a door it's one of the means of writing something else and this would expand and become part of the now it's a common thing which I see especially in Egypt I've actually seen is quite common whereby they will either put a Koran like a mini Koran that so small you can't even read the letters or at least they'll have a most half in every car I mean I don't think I've seen a single Korean agent except that there's a must-have and usually hidden away you know either on the windscreen or at the back and it sits there and no nig Modi for a small sometimes it's small but usually it's a big one I mean when I'm in a car sometimes I'll grab it and start to read but the majority of them - like what are you reading it for I mean it's there to protect and you say that the majority of them go unread is this a disrespect to the Quran to have a Koran and then just put it in the car for a protection I believe that this is a manifestation of the wrong application of the Quran Allah sol-gel revealed the Quran to be recited to be act upon and not to be a source of protection this is not in Egypt it's inside the Arabia a lot of the Muslims put a copy of the Quran in their glove compartments and if you take it out you would see the staid and untouched and you ask them anyways in your glove compartment some people put it under their pillows I know a lot of pilots carry it in their flight kits when they fly and when you ask them they tell you it's a protection so that we would not have a plane crash the house would not be robbed the car would not have an accident and this is even if it is through the Book of Allah Allah the Quran it was not intended it was not meant to be a form of protection in this but I thought it might be a little bit too much to say that it should maybe that's going too far cuz it's the Quran especially divided into two types cherkasova and Sheikh Akbar and major and minor the minor is when you in your heart look at something to be means of protection or of bringing benefit other than Allah as ojen so if you believe that the Quran can protect you by just carrying it as a copy of the Quran protecting your car protecting your house from being robbed protecting a plane from crashing and we have no means in the Quran nor in the soon that it proves this we can safely say that it is absolutely our role what you unfortunately we have come to the ends of the program it's been very very good listening to this topic in shallow perhaps we hope to continue a little bit more in the coming episodes on this topic so may Allah reward you for your contribution DSU or and may Allah also reward you dear viewers for joining us in this episode we hope insha'Allah that you've received benefit from this and we hope insha'Allah that you'll join us in our coming episodes where we continue to look at this as well as similar
