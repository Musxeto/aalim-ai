  "transcript": "says is it permissible to give Salam to Shia and is it permissible to respond to a Shia when he gives Salam again this is too extreme a lot of the Muslims blindfolded say that Shia are cfir no excuses no questions ask shoot and then ask afterwards no this is totally wrong anyone that says ill and he prays and he pretends to be a Muslim by default he's a Muslim we do not judge people until we see from that specific person something that qualifies him to nullify Islam after fulfilling the conditions and ensuring that the obstacles are removed for example us may Allah be pleased with him and with his father was in a battle and he there was this uh uh uh disbeliever Idol wor shipper who you was killing the Muslims left right and Center he was so brave so strong so Usama was telling the prophet Alam that he went after him and they had a duel and they exchanged blows and then the man ran away and when Usama caught up with him and he was cornered and he realized that Usama was going to finish him up the man said I believe and I bear witness that there's no God worthy of being being worshiped except Allah Usama said and I stabbed him and got rid of him the prophet was jubilant and happy as Usama was telling him about the progress of the battle but when he told him that he killed the man the prophet face changed and he said you killed him after he said Usama said oh prophet of Allah he just said it to save himself and this is obvious the guy is in the battlefield and he's been killing Muslims and all of a sudden he just decided to become a Muslim he did this to save himself the prophet said did you open his heart and looked at it to find this answer can you guarantee that this is the case what will you do on the day of judgment with ill what would you do on the day of judgment with ill and he kept on repeating it ama said I wished that day I did not accept Islam so that I would have accepted it afterwards so that it would erase what I had done uh uh in the past and this shows you that we do not jump into like all these ignorants do yesterday after praying jum a young chap came to speak with me and we took like half an hour standing telling me about his d doubts of takir of the Muslim countries are all cfir and the armies are cafir and we have to fight and we have to kill and we have to torture and and I was talking to him and explaining things to him alhamdulillah it took a lot of my time it drained my energy but with the guidance of Allah Asel and praise all be to Allah I managed to open his eyes a bit let's pray to Allah that it remains open we need to explain to the people that what you you are doing is not relating to Islam so coming back to the question the Shia we cannot say that they're all cfir so he claims that we we buy this from him if he comes and says something that nullifies Islam we have to make sure that this particular individual has fulfilled the conditions for nullifying Islam maybe he's ignorant maybe he's forced maybe he does not know maybe he did it out of a mistake maybe he was misinterpreting something so we have to make sure that all of these conditions are fulfilled and there are no obstacles then he would become a cfir But to answer your question in nutshel if a Shia comes to me and says Salam alaykum I would say definitely alayum and if I come into an area I would say assalam alaykum I have no hesitation in doing this but if I know that he himself curses Abu Bak om and all the nine yards of the companions may Allah be pleased with them if I know that he says the Quran is the immediately this is a cafir I don't even have to look uh uh uh twice if he says that the Quran has been changed or altered or we have a better new virgin then this is a cafir ib"
