  "transcript": "[Music] I've got only I've got one so you want to double it that's okay no problem now this feels wired um as advertised we're supposed to talk about the legacy of the prophets and The Messengers of Allah sallallah alai but the problem is that each aspect requires and needs a number of dedicated lectures and to squeeze three great Messengers and prophets of Allah in one lecture and to speak about these topics that would not give it its due right however we will try the level best to utilize the time and to benefit as much as possible from uh this lecture inshallah the prophets and messengers of Allah asael are the Elite of his creation they are the cream of human uh uh uh kind and Allah had sent them as His ambassadors to convey his message to his creation and believing in them loving them respecting them and following them is part of the pillars of Iman as all Muslims know we have how many pillars of Iman six I was hiding this so just in case someone did not know there are six pillars of IM and one of them is to believe in Allah's Messengers now believing in them and loving them is part of our Dean unlike other religions it is one of the things that nullify your Islam if you discredit them if you mock them if you ridicule any one of them the slightest this gets you out of the fold of Islam if if you speak negatively about any Prophet or any messenger even if you pray five times a day pray tud go to Haj fast Ramadan do voluntary Deeds go charity you're a cafir on the spot just by saying this one particular joke and it is needless to say that Allah has in instructed us to follow his Messengers Allah says in the Quran indeed there has been an excellent example for you in ibraim and those with him so he's an example and ibim is unlike any other messenger we always offer the salutation to the prophet in prayer and we also offer the salutation to ibraim peace be upon him and upon all the messengers of Allah not only that Allah mentioned inah a number of Messengers and Prophets and at the end after mentioning their names Allah said they are those whom Allah had guided so follow oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam follow their guidance from this hour among the prophets who were mentioned was ibraim uh was Haron who was a prophet and messenger and Allah is telling us to or is telling Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam his Messenger to follow the guidance of all the messengers and Prophets including har may Allah Have Mercy In said that this Ayah is an evidence for growing the beard because in the Quran Haron was talking to Musa when he came back and he said oh my my brother do not take hold of my head and my beard which means that he has had a beard and in this Ayah Allah is telling Muhammad Salam follow their guidance and part of their guidance is growing the bead but this is not our topic let's talk about our topic of today the legacy of the prophets and we have so much to talk about in each and every messenger or prophet's life but we will select the repentance of Adam peace be upon him the da of peace be upon him and the perseverance of ibraim peace be upon them all and I stated before I'm not going to give the topic it's du right because of time limitation however we TR try our level best to learn to ponder and to implement what we hear in our lives because the essence of this lecture and all the lectures we give given here is not to increase our knowledge this knowledge would be a menace it would be something that we would regret on the day of judgment if we do not apply it because Allah will be holding us accountable for each and everything that we learn and do not Implement so it's not an issue of just adding things and Topping things without applying it and uh uh implementing it Adam is the father of all Humanity Allah created four things with his hands does Allah have hands definitely Allah has hands and don't listen to those or uh the Deviant groups who say Allah does not have hands Allah told us in the Quran that he has two hands so we have to believe this as and Allah created only four things with his hands as stated in the Hadith he created the pen that registered everything that would happen till the day of judgment he created the throne he created The Gardens of Eden and he created Adam with his hand hands and that is why when Allah ordered Satan to prostrate to Adam what did Satan do he said I'm better than him you created me from fire and created him from clay from mud Allah said why didn't you prostrate to what I have created with my two hands and the I says two hands Shan Satan would have said so what you created me also with your hands he didn't say that because he was not created by Allah's hands only these four things as mentioned in the Hadith the authentic Hadith so he is the father of all Humanity Allah created him with his hand and Allah Asel got all the angels to prostrate for him or to him and he was the first prophet as the Hadith stated so always remember this when someone asks you who was the first prophet you would say Adam who was the first messenger you would say peace be upon them all we all know the the story he was forbidden to eat from that tree and he sinned and this is crucial to understand and to believe that prophets May sin but they may only sin minor sins and not out of uh insisting to do it it is just a sin that they fell in and they immediately repent and ask Allah for forgiveness major sins they cannot do Allah had made them they will not do any major sins and in the Quran it states clearly So Adam did disobey what would we learn from this story without going into details first of all even those who are honorable big and great they fall into sin who can be greater than a prophet yet he fell into the sin yet the difference between us and them is that they immediately repent and they immediately go back to Allah every single person on this Earth is a sinner and the prophet said every son of Adam is a sinner and the best of Sinners are those who repent so we unfortunately take the first part of the Hadith so why are you doing this well everybody every son of Adam is a sinner so I'm one of them yeah continue and complete the Hadith where is the repentance part he said well I didn't reach that in my study this is where I stopped so we understand that this sin took place from Adam however you have to understand that his sin was not out of arrogance so if you compare Satan's sin and Adam's sin you would find that Satan's sin resulted from his arrogance his pride frustrate no I'm better than him the sin of Adam was out of forgetfulness and that is why Allah says and indeed we made a covenant with Adam before but he forgot so this is what drove him to sin that he forgot the Covenant and he disobeyed Allah now compare our situation with the sin of Satan and with the sin of Adam peace be upon him when we sin is it out of weakness and human nature if yes what follows that is it repentance remorse you're in good hands and you are closer to Allah's forgiveness and to Allah's Paradise but if you commit your sins out of arrogance and pride and when someone's ad someone advises you and tells you this is Haram what you're doing is wrong he said yeah I know I know it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and you continue to be defiant you insist on sinning and sinning without stopping then you are similar to Satan and eventually you will end up with him may Allah have mercy upon us all so you should compare this to that we all sin Adam sinned and his sin was out of forgetfulness not only that he was recently created he doesn't have experience he do he did not uh uh interact with conmen and people who lie and deceive and cheat and that is why Satan banked on that and utilized that and Allah tells us in the Quran and Satan swore by Allah to them both saying verily I am one of the sincere wellwishers for you both and they beli them he swore by Allah and they did not think it was possible that someone swears by Allah and lies this how naive they were how natural and pure they were he SW by Allah we take it for granted and we believe what you say and they ate from The Forbidden tree which caused them to what you know and falling in sin is not a catastrophe by itself refusing to repent and ask for forgiveness is the problem and that is why the first step of repentance is to admit your guilt now go and don't look at the brother next to you don't look at your neighbors look at your own self look in the M try not to have anyone watching you when you talk to the miror because they would think that this something wrong but sit alone and look in the miror and say aome you have these following shortcomings if you have a problem then the miror is going to talk to you back and say no I don't you have it and then you have a problem but seriously analyze yourself look at your own shortcomings on the day of judgment Allah would hold you account accountable on your own he's not going to ask you about your neighbors and about your family he's going to ask you about what you had done what your sins are and what your convictions were so let's look and analyze yourself we have shortcomings we have sins admit it and this is half of the journey once you admit it once you confess then repentance is very close by m peace be upon him when he killed that Coptic what did he say oh Lord I have wronged myself tremendously so forgive me Allah forgave him the minute he admitted it and sought forgiveness Allah forgave him yunus Jonah when he was in the belly of the [Applause] whale there is no God worthy of being woried except you I admit that I was among the wrongdoers and Allah forgave him the prophet himself used to say in his Dua I confess of my sin and I have wronged myself the best of this umah Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet Alam and he said oh prophet of Allah teach me a Dua that I would say in my prayer now remember the first one to enter Jenna from the um of of Muhammad is Abu Bakr and you all know all know the attributes of Abu Bakr he's Second To None however the prophet taught him this Dua say he didn't tell him ask for more wealth ask for money ask for health ask for this or that he told him say oh Allah I have wronged my myself tremendously and there's no one who forgives the sins except you so forgive me and and have mercy on me from your uh uh side because you are most forgiving most merciful that's it Abu Bakr what about us who have done so many sins and you can go you have sins wrong place you are delusional you have sins and I can just on of the tip of my uh uh mind think of how wrong you are with your wife how how abusive your children how bad you are with your neighbors how bad you are with connecting to your NEX ofkin your uncle you haven't spoke to him in weeks and months some of you your brothers live in the same city you've never seen them you don't talk to them you don't give them let alone on lying on the government and abusing the benefit system and saying that your wife is not your wife and she has six children of you but she claims and lies that she's a single mom let alone the lying and cheating and stealing and it the let's going go on and and the brothers now say yeah I have this I have this and some of brother said who you do the she know me yeah this is a problem now we have all this problem how many times have you skipped fer PL this year I I I asked this to one of the brothers here working in dawa he was driving me not brother another one and I I told him how many uh did you miss I was just chitchatting how many F did you miss this uh uh month and he said she I only prayed once or twice this month he say I'm engaged in da I I sleep at 2: a.m. I don't have time to wake up for fa Subhan Allah you leave the essence you leave the essential what Allah has obliged upon you and you focus on things that are so minor and my servant would not get closer to me better than with the things that I've have made obligatory upon him and yet you leave the obligations and you go to the voluntary stuff and this would not help you if you pray the whole night night prayer and you miss fer it doesn't count because f is the essence it is the mandatory thing now we have to analyze ourselves I always tell the brothers that I I I speak with you will not have a mentor 24/7 with you telling you this is right this is wrong you will not have someone knowing what's inside your chest knowing your shortcomings no one is with you when you close your door at night may Allah be pleased with him one man came to him and start to flatter him and say Mall the people are in safe hands as long as you are with them yeah you are the cause of them being guided and and and being inshah away from uh uh FNA and away from tribulation and he got angry and he is the the brother in-law of the Prophet he's one of the best companions he said and these are words of reprimanding a person not intended literally he said do you know what your brother does when he closes his door at night your brother your sibling the one you know best do you know what he does when he closes his door at night and he's alone in his room so how dare you say something about me and you don't know me and this means that you're the only one with the grace of Allah who is capable of an analyzing your own shortcoming and fixing your own own bad things you have to repent you have to look inside yourself and say okay I'm making these minor sins but I'm also making some major sins backbiting lying cheating all of these Envy uh uh holding grudges against Muslims Etc let alone the transactions Financial transactions the mortgages the riba the this and that the issue goes on and on so this is why you have to take the example of Adam and follow it look how beautiful and great Allah is he creates us he provides for us he gives us everything that we ask for and things that we've never anticipated and when we sin he tells us how to repent and he accepts our repentance Subhan Allah if you look at Allah's repentance it is divided into two types we only think that okay I'm going to repent and Allah will forgive my repentance and they we take it for granted and this is wrong Allah Asel repents up Allah first of all guides to repentance me and the brother we're sinful but Subhan Allah we do the same sin we go to the same places and all of a sudden Allah guides him to repent and I'm not guided I want to repent not interested I see him being repenting and walking and and and taking the straight path and I say poor thing he doesn't know what he's missing why because Allah guided him to repent so this is phase one phase two Allah's acceptance of his repentance so he may be guided and he SE seeks Allah's forgiveness and and he repents but this does not mean that Allah has repented yet and this is something we do not know and that is why we have to be in Hope and in fear at the same time it has to go parallel the minute you in Saudi Arabia we have five Gear Drive cars huh in here I think you have sixth and seventh mashallah we have five when you put the fifth gear this means that you're going on a highway to Medina so you relax you drive if you if you sin and you repent and you put the fifth gear thinking that Allah has has repented definitely Allah accepted my repentance what would this have an effect on you you'll tend to be relaxed and this is what I was telling one of the brothers after when when someone makes om and he's going back to jeda he starts to listen to some music and the minute he goes home he watches a movie or two what are you doing he said the erases everything so I have a new record so might as well I've got credit I've got don't laugh this is what's happening we think we deal with Allah as if we have credit you're going to forgive me definitely so I think I can manage to do this and that and this is the greatest problem Allah guided you to repent but he did not accept your repentance yet this is something you do not know there are signs but these signs are not definite and 100% uh false proof they might be correct and they might be means of dragging your feet so that you would go back to the vicious circle of sinning without repenting what are the words that Adam received and we should always say this Allah say they said our Lord we've wronged ourselves if you do not forgive us and bestow upon us your mercy we shall certainly be of the losers you have to say this you have to believe you have to break your ego and pride you have to humilate yourself when you pray to Allah it's not enough to say um I I've sin sorry you have to feel in need in humility in submissiveness to Allah and a sign of your true repentance would be a warm tear falling from your eye when you're alone and if you watch a movie or listen to a song and you cry but you listen to the Quran and you contemplate on your status and your lack of repentance do not cry you have a problem this was the repentance of Adam and the lessons that can be learned of it we move on to is one of the one with the strong will of The Messengers and they're five no ibim M Isa and Muhammad peace be upon them all they are one of the strong will of The Messengers and what stands out in the story of n peace be upon him that he was one of the greatest of all time and this is attributed mainly to a number of things among them is the duration of his da I would the brother da for couple of hours and I would consider myself W I'm one of the best in the world just to give him 2 hours continuously this is an achievement and if someone does this for a whole day with a UNM Muslim or with a Muslim trying to give him da to repent for a whole day mashallah this is Superman if you do it for a a week you're not human if you do it for a year there's a problem no did it for 950 years without giving up without being bored Subhan Allah and this shows us that in his da there are a number of aspects we should look into and try to adapt first of all the situation the one who's giving da if you're giving dawa you must not feel Bor and you must not never give up and you have to have a lot of patience and patience is something we do not possess yet it is the greatest attribute of a practicing Muslim I am a someone comes to me and says yeah she you you don't understand anything you have no knowledge your AA is corrupt your Salah is incorrect you're doomed in hell what would I do being who I am I would probably grab him from the neck and start pounding him with and shoke uh holdes and and maybe some ma that have learned throughout the years and uh surrenders this is not a die if you take an insult person you die if someone insults you it off I'm doing it for Allah what did the prophet do imagine yourself prostrating in the Masjid and someone puts the guts of the camels on your back while while prostrating what would you do the people were praying F in my Masjid in my locality and they man was there and a cat went in and started moving the legs of the people and all what you seees people jumping up and hanging the sh chandeliers and is allahar allahar don't ask which shows you that what we do is nothing our prayer is not accepted the submissiveness is not there our da is not for the sake of Allah subhana T purely we learn from the story of no peace be upon him that he was tolerant that he was patient if you look at the people he gave da to I could talk to the brother for 5 minutes and immediately I could see tears coming from his eyes and I promise Allah I'm not going to do any more sins why because he's demanding he's requesting what I would give him now it would be very difficult if I go to try and preach someone who doesn't want to listen and this is was the case with the people of new Allah tells tells Us in the Quran and verily every time I called on to them that you might forgive them so he's not calling them for money he's not calling them for prop property some of the Deviant sh if if I can call them sh or Scholars I know one of the brothers he told me this particular Sheik in particular subcontinent country they give him £5,000 a month the family I'm in the wrong business what is this the guy is filthy rich and he is a deviant he is calling people to grave worshipping and they give him money no was not like this he's not calling for anything of Dy peace be upon him he said that every time I call onto them that you might might forgive them he's calling them for forgiveness they thrust their fingers into their ears covered themselves up with the garments and persisted and magnified themselves in Pride so how difficult that would be if you plow in a soil is not like plowing in rocks there's a big difference and look at his methodology of Daw I could give a lecture a day two lectures three lectures that's most and then I say listen I have to have my time I have to rest I have to go to the uh uh to work out I have to read I have to I can't more do more than that because my ability is limited and my da is not sincere no da was 24/7 not only from 9 to5 he was 24/7 he Allah says then verily I called to them openly aloud then verily I proclaimed to them in public and I have appealed to them in private so it is day and night in public and in private allow and one to one and this shows us that da is not limited to a particular form the brothers all want to be D I get tons of mails sh I'd like to be a DI like you I'm not a DA first of all I'm just a freelancer giving dawa people inviting me I come I have free food I have free lodging alhamdulillah it's it's a vacation for me I'm not a true true is one who does that for the sake of Allah but why do you want to be a would like to be on TV Subhan Allah okay join American Idol you can be on TV well it is not the essence of being a is to be famous or to be prominent or to have people look at you if it's not implemented in your house at the end of the night when you close your door and no one sees you w this is a manace against you Allah would hold you accountable for that in Muslim the prophet said the first three to be thrown in hell are a a martyr and a man who spent his money in the cause of Allah the is submitted in front of Allah and Allah shows him his favors and blessing and asks him what did you do he said I taught Quran and I learn it for your sake I taught the knowledge and I learned it for your sake Allah says you have lied you did this so that people would say you are learned and they had said that take him to heaven so DA has to be for the sake of Allah 24/7 and this is what no peace be upon him did if it doesn't work this way if it doesn't work through preaching in aure you have to do uh uh uh to visit the individual in his home you have to give him leaflet you have to do him some favors you sometimes have to spend money on him so that you get results verify and CH and change not verify vary your your methods of Daw like n had done and he called them only for the sake of Allah to believe in the Oneness of Allah and to worship him alone among the ways he used was the carrot and the stick we unfortunately are good with the stick carrots we're not that good with why because if I tell you the prophet say and you will enter Jenna said ah is this authentic said yes it's authentic is what are we doing here in the Masid let's go to the pub then I say people because of the so many sins around them and so many F and the weak IM man they need a longer stick because they usually need intimidation and warning more than they need calling them for something that would make them relax and uh uh not be so keen and careful and moose no and all other prophets of Allah used both so he warned them from hell but at the same time he gave them the carrot and he said I said to them ask forgiveness from your lord verily he's off forgiven what will happen if you believe in Allah and ask him for forgiveness he will give you so much he will send rain to you in abundance and give you increase and wealth and children and bestow on you Gardens and bestow on you Rivers W if you keep on asking Allah for forgiveness you will find these results so many people come I have debts I have problems I've been jobless for a couple of years ask Allah for forgiveness seek Allah's forgiveness look at the gazillion number of insects birds fish animals plants who provides for them Allah are they better or B Adam the sons of Adam definitely the sons of Adam so do you think Allah would provide for insects and leave you you have to believe you have to believe in him and he will provide for you without your being capable of achieving that he will provide for you if you have true on Allah and peace be upon Him have never G had never given up on his people they said oh no you've disputed with us and much have you prolonged the dispute with us they complained you did not remind us once or twice 950 years this is too long and this gives us a lesson that when we advise a brother come to Salah when we advise a brother the people you're being with their AA is corrupt and you have to try and and choose better brothers and they tell you you've advise us move on you shouldn't give up you should continue but try in a different way a wife should always try to advise her husband though husbands usually don't listen to their wives so they should try and change the ways if direct advises doesn't work try indirect try to come to him through his stomach maybe you cook something and make him happy this might help try to please him through looking at you looking good at you and the husband does the same with his wife you have to change and Vary your uh uh means of Da and it is not an indication how many follow you as a DI deviant Scholars and Di have millions of followers Sal maybe or Scholars have a 100 or a thousand does this mean this is an indicator of how true and sincere Your da is no yeah as I stated yesterday Justin Bieber has like 25 million followers on Twitter how much how many does ABD have how many very little so it's not the quantity that counts in dawa it is the quality and that is why the prophet said the the nations were displayed in front of me and I've seen the prophet with a great nation and I've seen the prophet with few uh uh men following him and I saw a prophet with a man or two and I saw a prophet with no followers at all now this is a prophet of Allah and he doesn't have a single follower so this is the same thing no did not have a lot of followers not only that those closer to the are usually those who reject his dawa most and that is why no's wife no's son died as cfir regardless of the amount of time he invested in calling them and our prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam he wanted it so eagerly that his uncle AB would accept Islam until he was on his dying bed yet Allah did not open his heart to accept Islam and he died as a cfir so always look at the Quality and don't care about the numbers because the numbers do not count they do not give you a true indication and finally IIM he he was one of he was the true example of perseverance of adhering to Allah's Commandments without any questions asked and this is something we need in our lives now with the internet and with the possibility of reaching Knowledge from here and there you find people justifying their sins you find people collecting what serves their desires and whims without adhering to the Quran and to the Sunnah and this is is a problem you find people using the four schools of thought as a methodology as a bridge to cross the Quran and Sunnah and reach what they want so whenever you tell someone that what's the ruling on this if you sayam they say yes but the says else something else and I follow a h m and he's not 24/7 H when it comes to another issue he becomes Maliki because it serves his uhh uh needs well the perseverance of ibraim peace be upon him was astonishing Allah said about him and remember when ibraim was Tried by Allah and when Allah tries you then this is the ultimate test he was tested by Allah with certain commands which he fulfilled full stop he fulfilled each and every command none of us can say that alhamdulillah I fulfilled each and every command ibraim did that and Allah also said about him and ibraim who fulfilled his commitments all of them and if you look in his and his biography which the prophet told us about Alam it's astonishing in the the Allah ordered him to circumcise when he was 80 years of age Imagine 80 years of age and he circumcised himself with an axe nowadays you get people saying ah can we find a solution can we find this or that what's the different opinion of Scholars yeah do it do it and have on Allah yeah half inch here or there it's could be kiss the baby good night yeah have trust in Allah the guy was 80 years old with an axe what kind of commitment are you talking about and not only that imagine when you are so desperate for a child he was not given Offspring until he was really really old and he gave up from having children and then Allah gave him is and is we all know his story just as an infant Allah tells him take your family to Mecca Mecca if you check the GPS it's a desert it's mountainous there's no plants there's no water he took them without any questioning no questions asked and he put them there and his wife or his concubine depending haer peace be upon him did not ask him all the way where are we going she's a good wife she doesn't nag like some women I know my wives don't speak English so inshallah they speak but they were not going to watch this so they she did she doesn't nag she doesn't ask why this why that she traveled with him for a whole month they' reached Mecca no food no water he turned his back and went away from her who are you leaving us for are you leaving us here for with nothing and for with with no one and he did not even reply to her and she said did Allah order you to do this he said yes then she said with full trust in Allah Allah would not leave us Allah would not leave us go and he left now if you were not 80 years of age with your only child that Allah granted you at this old age if you were 20 years of age would you leave your wife would you leave your children never but ibraim instructed no questions asked Allah knows best not only that Allah tells us that Allah tried him with something that is mindblowing now he went back and forth to Mecca meeting we know the story of him visiting his son daughter-in-law and then ordering her his husb his son to divorce her and then we all of these things we're not going to go into that just as his child was growing up when you were old when you're really old what you look for is a son that stands next to you I know this feeling quite well because I only have daughters I don't have sons so when I do the grocery and I have to take you know half a car full of groceries up to the third floor and I need someone to give me a helping hat I don't have any I said alhamdulillah but when you have a son he's growing and you feel that couple of years inshallah he'll take the burden of my shoulders and all of a sudden Allah tells you Slaughter him don't drown him it's easier you can just ditch him in the river and leave don't do Slaughter him with your own hand and when his son was old enough Asel says in the Quran to walk with him he said oh my son I have seen in a dream that I am slaughtering you so look what you think the young child did not say come on you're bluffy he didn't not say come on this the young son raised on and on following the Revelation and believing in his father's father as a messenger as a prophet what did he say oh my father do that which you are commanded inshallah you will find me among those who are patient Subhan Allah no questions asked ibraim once he was ordered immediately implementing it and he's telling his son to do what he saw not to seek his permission but to prepare him and the wise son tells his father when you put me on the ground don't look into my eyes and make me look the other way so that you won't feel any Mercy when you Slaughter me what kind of test is this this yet he was as he was complimented and uh uh uh uh by Allah to be adhering to what Allah has ordered him he was instructed to make da to his people who were Idol worshippers and who were star worshippers when he was a young boy when they did not listen he immediately broke his their uh uh Idols so as a punishment they made these great buildings and ditches of fire and they threw him in it what did he say he said the same thing that the prophet saidat in the Battle of when he was informed that the pagans and the idol worshippers are coming again to annihilate you what did he say look at the full tul he had in his heart and that is why Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala said about him verely ibraim was an um obedient to Allah and he was not one of those who were is this a mobile or what is this ice cream Subhan Allah so Subhan Allah look at how Allah described him to be obedient to be hanifan away from shik to be grateful and thankful and to be an um what is the meaning of umah um in the Quran is used in four meanings as says one of them here a leader of his people the other is a nation or a group of people the third is a religion we found them on a religion or on a sect the fourth is a period of time with um as inah YF so here ibraim on his own was an umah why because he was the chosen one and he was adhering to Allah's commands on the spot so what we learn from Adam peace be upon him is that we should repent analyze your sins and ask Allah for forgiveness and always be fearful that Allah may not have accepted your forgiv your repentance no his persistence in in giving Daw never give up the best form of Daw is to implement Islam in yourself not by in rhetoric not giving leaflets and this this is these are forms of dawa the best form of dawa to your wife to your daughters to your sis to your uh Sons to your neighbors to your colleagues is to be a proper Muslim never cheat Never Lie never use abuse abusive uh uh or vulgar language always be generous always be courageous always be proud of being a Muslim and finally ibraim peace be upon him his perseverance you should always take whatever comes and implement it on the spot because Allah warned us that he would turn the hearts and the eyesight or the vision of those who receive the truth for the first instance and rejected if you do that then Allah will not make it easy for you to accept that and with this I conclude my talk so Brothers um thank you ever so much for attending this uh beneficial lecture inah if you've liked what you've heard I really encourage you to get involved with the Ala Institute they've got a couple of really fantastic courses coming up um one of most relevance to what we've just heard now is going to be taking place in June the first week I believe which will be on the prophets and in
