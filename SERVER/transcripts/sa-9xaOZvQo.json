  "transcript": "now the profit goes on to say and whoever does not act upon his anger a lot will not expose him acting upon one's anger what is this that the scholars say that if you are you know chill cool if you don't act upon your anger then allah azza wajal would concede your shortcomings if someone angers me and I don't do anything and I said okay I'm gonna suppress my anger would any nobody know that I curse or I shout or I say bad words but I'm I fight no because I stopped myself I control my anger and I did not act accordingly and this is why the Prophet that is awesome when he was asked by one of his companions to give him naseeha and to give him advice and he said oh singing what did the prophet seer do not become angry okay okay what else do not become angry do not become angry do not become angry what does this mean this means that it is extremely dangerous in Islam to become angry sure if I don't become angry I'm not a man you need to tell me that I'm walking with my wife and someone says bad things to my wife or does something to her and don't become angry what is this no the Prophet is telling you at is thought to survive not to act upon your anger everyone has to become angry your blood boils in your veins when something wrong happens you're a jealous Muslim you are a true Muslim you have have this anger in your heart but you have to channel it so if someone tells me well I get angry a lot so he says they nicknamed me in my family a k47 you know ak-47 a plastic cover why he says because when I'm angry I mash a lot about Alcala what I said well I'm very ambitious I always do this with my wife and he is lying he's not angry he's just expressing himself because if he was angry this anger would be even against someone who is 6 4 and lots of muscles not necessarily from Brussels he should yeah but when it comes to this message okay now I'm gonna control my anger for the sake of Allah but when it comes for the buses when it comes for the poor wife when it comes for the children no he does not control himself this anger is not genuine so each one of us must get angry every now and then the Prophet is telling you do not act upon your anger so if you're angry with your child don't spank him spanking the child or any grown-up on the faces hallam which means you cannot even box because boxing involves hitting this is not our topic yeah so do not act upon your anger not only this the prophecies are exhausting I'm giving you the glad tidings that whoever suppresses his rage even though he is able to express it Allah will fill his heart with hope on the day of judgement okay what's the difference now in the first you have to control your anger so that Allah would not expose your shortcoming here you're suppressing or repressing your rage so you are able to do it what is the madman but you're able to express it meaning that I can express my rage with my children if I hit my son who YouTube do to blame of course I think in this country it's not allowed then until they were still you can do that yeah baseball back no we don't do it it's something that we don't we don't hit our children with the grace of Allah but still if I do this I can't do it if I come out and express my anger or rage on my life on my coworker if I'm driving on the road and somebody cuts through me and I hit him back I expressed my rage I can't do this I can't afford it on my shirt handler the Prophet says I some if you can express this rage but you still suppress it what would happen Allah would fill your heart with hope on the day of judgement so if my heart is filled with hope do you think a lot would throw me in hell he's the one who filled it up with hope this means that I was straight to paradise"
