  "title": "What to do when people standing beside me are not in line ( little front or behind me) when praying?",
  "transcript": "so my question is um sometimes when we go pray in the mjid uh we found that while we're praying I found that um the people who is standing right to me maybe he's standing a couple or one inch in front of me and the people left to me he is standing one or two inch behind of me so in this case what should I do in this case try to stand in between them you don't distract yourself by monitoring those on the right on the left and what is your position which makes you heedless or losing concentration of what the Imam is reading so you forget what the Salat is all about and concentrate and focus whether I'm standing in the line I'm a little bit forward I'm a little backwards I have to go to the right I have to go to the left and you forget the and the contemplation in the Salat and this defies the purpose of Salat focus on your Salat and if they're a little bit forward and someone on your left is a little bit backwards it's okay A Difference little difference does not make an issue insh"
