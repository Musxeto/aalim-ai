  "transcript": "how can Muslim youth spend their leisure time are the things they should or should not do nah love assalamu alaikum and welcome to youth talk I have with me in the studio she awesome look man and hockey pleasure Shekhar seem to have you thank you i also have with me three participants we have on my left Sammy who is a close loader ok we have Mohammed who is a translator and on the right I have Mohammed who is a student at the german university in cairo thank you for joining soon p she cast him in today's episode we want to talk about less time or people's youths free time from an islamic point of view should you spend their free time in something specific or what's the principle and out without so now I raheem hamdillah salatu salam one of us will die here or early in your sake on it a little bit up if we agree on the concept that deeds are judged by their intentions so this means that whatever you do it depends on your intention in order for a particular thing to be accepted at the side of Allah it has to have two important criteria in it one that intention is purely for Allah secondly that the action itself is in accordance to the Quran and Sunnah it's not invaded and it's not forbidden if we agree on this concept then we know that Muslims should not have any leisure time that has no intention or purpose because a real Muslim always have the intention to do something he always has the intention to do something with a will or good intention for example your prayer your fasting and all the other forms of worship the intention is for Allah soja now we're not talking about worship we're talking about other actions such as playing sports just such as having a meal these things are permissible to do but if you add to them a good intention they are transformed into a form of worship so in this sense Muslims Muslim youth and any other Muslim a category if they have a good intention in all what they do then all their actions are transformed into worship okay I'd like to hear from the participants what they spend their leisure time in for example I'm Sammy yeah I like some some things that prophet muhammad sallallahu asylum ordered us to do like riding horses and that will be in my village and I'm traveling to my village and I pray Egypt it's something like leading one and making new contacts with new friends and or some sort like that and Muhammad playing purple sometimes raiding and bureaus my friends most of the time so check awesome you are mentioning about the fact of intention in what you do so can some if somebody play's for example sport or something with the intention of being healthy or being having good physique is that then something that's good to spend your leisure time or your free time in shall I say anything that you do you have to cross examine it with Aurra no sooner so if there is nothing that contradicts with the Quran and Sunnah then it is permissible for you to do so playing sports in general soccer in particular if all the players adhere to the dress code in Islam which means that they cover the area between the billibotton and their knees and they do not swear they do not fight they do not harm each other they do not waste time prayer time that is they're prepared to pray I pray on time if and they don't involve any form of gambling then this is something permissible for them to do I know that this is a little bit difficult especially in what we see in our youth the rage the impulsive acts that the amount of swearing and the urge to win at any cost even if it was at the cost of harming someone else then this becomes Haram this becomes forbidden because Islam promotes peace promotes being kind to the to the others and there's no justification for you to harm others to insult others just for the sake of your own pleasure but be four we move on to the other point the Prophet salah salem lots of the brothers think that he told us to encourage our children to ride horses swim and what you call this archery archery yes actually he did not this is the teaching of Omar the second caliph of Islam nevertheless these are these forms of sports are quite helpful they encourage the the Muslims to be healthy they enrich their character by making them look to something that is noble and and fine what about when friends get together just to sit and talk for example or go out somewhere for example not necessarily play a sport again you have to cross examine this with the hora no sooner what type of chatting are they having are they simply spending the time talking about permissible things about cars about sports about school about the economy about things that concern them and they would find it suitable to spend time talking about or are they Spain spending their time slandering people backbiting saying dirty jokes are trying to make plots and plans to date this one or that the other one then this becomes in the form of the forbidden things it all depends on the objectives and on the tools used in these meetings and well I'm asking to be the one who's doing all the talking I'm okay having agreed that our life on Earth is so limited and short and let me know mention a very remarkable sentence i have read for evison the one of the most color of the most famous colors in the peak of the islamic civilization once he said oh god I ask you a wildlife but not a long one should I hear some comment from you who was this everything everything well okay with all the respect he was a scholar in the sense of materialistic sciences but in terms of religious sciences some say that he was not a Muslim because he wrote so many things that doubt the existence of Allah and he went into philosophy in into a very serious and dangerous thing but he's on our topic today the part from his philosophy and what it pertains to go to the the theology and something like that I want to stress upon the importance of this sentence it's a according to these lamb constructions that it has to do it has to do with Islam extractions okay he's well again this is a point that I don't think we need to elaborate a lot on simply because it was not from the Quran and it's not from the sooner we can have so many sayings of intellectual people but that does not mean that we should follow them because as Muslims we have for an in the Sunnah to benchmark and follow what they teach us the prophet salallahu alaihi salam told us that on the day of judgment people will be asked about their lifetime what they have spent it in and they will be asked about their youth how did they utilize the youth and strength they will be asked about their knowledge what did they do and the things that they knew about and they will be asked about their income where did they get it and where did they spend it so this utilizes the whole idea and concept of your time as long as you're going to be asked about each and every second of your life then you should utilize this now what this man said of wishing to have a wide life another a long one I don't know if he wanted a wide or wild life wyd well then it's a wild life meaning that he wanted it to be filled with this achievements and and so on yet our profits of la hora salen tells us that a one of the best among you is that who allah so jill has prolonged his age in doing good deeds so the longer you live with good kids you have a good dude then you have a lot of a benefit so it's not what you do only though it counts but also the length of your life has a lot of value it was reported that the prophet sallallaho a cell and there were two brothers and one of them died before the other all martyrs at the side of Allah so John and they had a third one who stayed after they died for a while and then died afterwards the Prophet told us that he is in a higher position in heavens so the companions were astonished below the Prophet both of them died as martyrs so he told them that this year that he lived afterwards I think so many days of fasting and praying that allah so allah knows best about it so yes we do focus on quality but also quantity discount I won't ask bugs rule of playing cards okay another from most I spend most of the time playing quarters at University at universities well maybe not the purpose was my colleagues okay kind of cars do you playing cards playing cards what type of games do you play animation normal kinds of games it's not not not for money or them and look for money estimation trick strongly on and so on the all of these cards are playing cards if it does not take most of your time if it does not cause conflict between you and your friends if it does not make you miss prayer if it does not come to you in your prayer then spending a time doing this if it's once in a while it's permissible providing that you try your best to change the Queen the King and the jacks moving their faces because this is still considered to be drawing though I I doubt that anyone would do this excuse me some scholars say that playing cards completely is out of the question and others say no it's permissible but with these restrictions that is you should have a special time to do it it should not overwhelm your your your day and night and it should not affect your prayer with removing the drawings that are on the cards okay just okay we've got a report now and will return some more questions from from the left and some questions as well okay first this report fond of travelling around reading somehow meeting some friends you know watching news sometimes some extent that's it basically I will try to find hobbies and stuff of interest that I try to maybe kill time with a decent I'm learning something or gaining some skills of course people has to have to have fun fun like most of the time but also we need to like have hobbies or stuff like that like to increase skills of here Allah subhana Allah will will will ask us about how we spend our times and their concern and how we spent our money so we have to paint it wisely and welcome back Mahmoud do something I asked about the best directions of that one should channel his capacity fool towards yes well this is depends on every individual you know and this is a portrait of the mercy of Allah Sojin that he did not eliminate the channels in one or he did not limit that is the channel into only one every individual has his own capability to do something that may not fit the other so those who have the power to teach and preach may not be able or may not have the power to spend money and those who are wealthy and have the ability to spend money and they have the capacity to a sponsor projects Islamic projects may not have the ability to worship allah azzawajal extra to that he has already ordered them for example they cannot fast voluntary days or cannot pray voluntary prayer and on the other hand those who were deprived from money deprived from ability to teach and preach but deprived from other means of charity work find it easy for them to fast the days other than ramadan and to pray night prayer for for god knows how long so you cannot limit the channels of utilizing your time into one channel there are so many things and the sky is the limit ok sure how see concerning sport again let's talk about or males of course now at the moment are the certain sports that males can play in turn sports they shouldn't clay or as any type of sport permissible why did you exclude females from what I was going to be another question ok well then let us stick with that first question again all there are so many types of sports around and you have to look at the quran and sunnah to be able to determine if it's permissible or not for example shooting is a sport and the quran and sunnah do not say anything against that so it's okay but if you come to kickboxing then the certain that says you may not hit the faith so any sport that involves hitting this face is not permissible any sport that involves harming others is not permissible so for example if you play marsh if you do martial arts and you have full contact contest this is not permissible because the objective of this contest is our competition is to harm the one who is against you your opponent and this is unaesthetic I know that people would say well what about if he is a nut Muslim I'm going to hit him real hard again you're hitting him not because he is not a Muslim because it is a competition so your intention is not pure don't try to justify it go back to the basics is it allowed for me to hit the face no it's not then it is not permissible so what about a sport that I mean if you're going of karate or martial arts something the objective isn't really to harm the water but it's to hit a certain area in the body which will gain you a point for example when your personal intention is not ready to harm your personal attention is to win but I mean so what in that then is harming involved in the process in a sense yes then it's not permissible because you cannot talk only about your intention and not to look at the action it sells on sequences so if I have a good intention of calling people to Islam this is good right but if I go to a discotheque and meter a 5 10 blonde and I want to dance with her invited for a drink in order for me to call her to Islam is this acceptable definitely not so it's not only the attention it has to go hand by hand the intention and the deed itself otherwise you have a problem if you have a good intention and the deed itself is not good this does not fit and if you have a good deed but with a very awful and bad intention again this is not acceptable by Alonzo again boxing is completely forbidden it's completely unacceptable because it involves hitting the face and and this is a sport that Islam forbids it's not me and it's the Prophet SAW solemn who told us not to hit the face to avoid hitting the face so now go ahead and again we come back to the martial arts thing a there are two types there are there is a full contact a competition and there is a company that does not involve old contacts it's only points the one with the point it's okay because you're not harming anyone so with that would the reason I'm asking is because I mean with sports really fills up the majority of the free time that people have what about sports like wrestling for example I mean wrestling is a sport again that's rather aggressive it can be aggressive but it's not necessarily intentionally aggressive what kind of wrestling The Hollywood wrestling no no they're all WWF the Roman recio okay Roman Roman wrestling was at the time of the Prophet at a cilantro Sam actually it was a criteria to determine if this man is allowed to fight in within the Muslim army or with the Muslim army or not so whoever came and he was he looked young the Prophet SAW son would ask him to wrestle with someone else so this is acceptable providing that they're not wearing something that shows the areas in other bodies that should be covered which is from the belly button to these okay Mohammed do something you wanted to I was asking propoxy about the Box in question I spend most of my life boxing I should stay away from them well now i'm seriously i did some martial arts myself but again you have to know whats Alan was Haram if you learn there's no problem in your learning martial arts it's when you come to use it you don't compete and don't when you fight with with a colleague or so avoid the face and you don't have to harm him but it's good as a self-defense it's a good discipline disciplinary sport now in boxing there's no way you can do that in areas ables wedding look harming well you will never win without harming precisely yeah but what's the case if these sports like boxing for innocence and are prepared for strengthening a an Islamic team for example for struggling the cause of Allah most of the kids elaborate a little bit more for example if we if we consider such a such a sport like boxing for preparing an Islamic team for struggling the cause of Allah what's of the case there are so different ways and methods of preparing this team they could jog they could wait lift they could they can lift weights they can swim and they will be prepared at the cause of Allah so jeal but if you mean that you want them to win in the Olympics or in some other form of competition then again we tell you that this is not our objective what about a team sport where there for example assuming that some of Muslims summer non-muslims is there any problem in Muslims and non-muslims playing a sport again there isn't a big problem unless you know Muslims dissolve themselves in the non-muslims in the sense that they start to have their allegiance to the non-muslims they support the non-muslims against the Muslims and as the case we find with so many people with their mixed allegiances if you participate in a game because you want to burn some calories you want to burn some fat and you indulge yourself with a game with a non-muslim player just for the sake of utilizing your time in the sport I see nothing wrong in that but when this partner of yours becomes best friend and you prefer him more than you prefer the Muslim friends and you start thinking that well it's not his religion but he is one of the best and this may lead you to respecting him in the sense more than other Muslims this is something you should think about Sammy okay catching animals something that we were mentioned in the holy quran a million catch Animal Hospital yes yes yes I'll una cama bella como él ella como player to amalgam to Manila very immokalee be aluminum atom kammula it is the thing as a way to spend leisure time or this is serenity and hunting has to be with the intention of feeding but need to hunt for the sake of my holidays it's a way to collect money then this is a legitimate cause yes but I don't think that hunting for the pleasure of prey and victims yes this is this is not acceptable because the prophets allah seldom cursed those who take live objects live animals as a shooting target and and I think if i'm not wrong a block number of my house allah be pleased with him and with his father once passed by a group of youngsters putting an animal and trying to shoot that animal with arrows and whoever misses the owner of the animal get to keep the arrows so the Prophet so this companion of Allah the companion of the prophet Alice of Saddam's Abdullah told them who did this he is cursed by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam which tells you that Islam asks us to be kind even to animals and not to do what for example some countries do in sending hounds and and horse man behind or after a small fox from one region to the other and they make an event out of it now this is torture you want to kill the thing just go ahead and kill a giver but don't keep on doing this as a festival and at the end of the day you are killing an animal without any justification at all okay we've got a break now and we return after the Shah Rukh welcome back shekhar singh so far we've been talking about sports and general and sports concerning men or males what about females leisure time for females should it be inside should it be outside outside of the home for example well it depends on the community or the society there in women are exactly like men if men have the right to play sports then women have all the right to do the same providing that no one watches them because women can watch men play sports but men cannot watch women play sports therefore they have to practice whatever they want to practice with the same restrictions that is not to show things that should be conceived and hidden they may not involve themselves with sports that include hitting the face or harm the others and they have to be in a place that no man can watch them because this is one of the greatest dangers that could happen to a woman that has been protecting herself from others looking at her and then we expose her in Olympics Oran and whatever this is completely forbidden ok Mohammed I'm asking if it is possible for the one who spent her spare time in doing something he enjoyed and at the same time he is rewarded by get yes this is very possible if you have the good intention this is extremely applicable and a possible for example there are different of ways that you can spend your time and let us put something that you like and enjoy if you enjoy let's say a painting and you go to this neighbor of yours who is 70 or 80 years old and who has does not have the financial means to paint his house and you volunteered to do this thing that you love which is painting to this old man next to you now you are doing something you like but at the same time you are being rewarded by Alonzo Gee you are spending your ledger time in something that is useful for your neighbors and in joyful to yourself and hamdillah this is a great real rewarded but that's a bit of an exception I mean the most sports almost letter time things tend to either contradict general also a peaceful atmosphere or they have nothing to do with other people unless they're playing with us kind of thing I mean it can somebody in the sense that you're talking about doing the type of sport or spending some leisure spending your leisure time in something that will be beneficial to you yourself as well as the community would that good muscle would for example Social Work fall under that volunteer work maybe you like doing some helping orphans for example maybe that's something you like to do in your leisure time could that be an example it's a good example and unfortunately we do lack the social work in our communities to the extent that people are happy doing it it's usually as a form of punishment if you cross a red light then you're told to do 10 or 20 hours of social work for the community and unfortunately we should not be like this we should be proactive a Muslim should intend to work for the for the community for the society for the sake of allah azzawajal and that is why the Prophet sallallahu ala where the Salem tells us that it is the best among you are those who learn the Koran and teach it so if you dedicate your time to teach those in the message in the mosque the Koran you are among the very best also those who know no things more than the others what happens if you are a certified teacher in English and you give those in your neighborhood two hours or three hours a week to teach them to to develop their but does that considered leisure time it is because it's unclear what you're doing for a lot so it's ledger no it's not work you're working in the morning at schools but in the afternoon it's your time so whatever you do for the community it's your leisure time and you're utilizing it to get the reward from allah azzawajal instead of wasting four or five hours in front of a TV screen watching things that harm you on the day of judgment watching movies is also also something that you may spend in leisure time but is it permissible or not now how can we evaluate this a person that spends four hours a day watching movies and a person who is spending four hours a day teaching others or on some mathematics geography whatever of course the one who adds value to the community is far greater than the other one sorry what about going to resource with families men and women youth mixing men women strangers as we see no this is not acceptable if you're not taking your family and your brother little brothers if you go with your family to a resort where there is no sin appearing in front of everybody if you go to a beach resort and everybody is in their bikinis and you say subhanAllah al hamdulillah the hot work this is a great a great sin this is not acceptable but if you go to a resort that you are in your cabin with your family you have the wilderness you have a jungle you have forests you have the deserts you have different ways of entertaining yourself without exposed yourself to something that is forbidden and without exposing your family to something that is forbidden this is completely permissible and we all do this we as families we all entertain our families once a year in our vacation we go either to amount of resort or we go to Mecca we go to Medina for prayer and the masjid or we go off-roading and and this is permissible there is nothing wrong in that but it's not an obsession in the sense that you're spending 11 months traveling and moving from one wager to the other no it's something that can entertain your family within the boundaries of Islam providing in Muslim countries or abroad no we talked about this before we said that going to non-muslim countries has its shortcomings and it is not preferable if not forbidden for a Muslim to go to non-muslim countries because there are conditions that we've mentioned before that to go to a non Muslim country you have to have three conditions one you have to have a degree of knowledge that prevents you from accepting any doubts and you have to have a degree of pi c and faith in order for you to deter you from pursuing your lust and desires thirdly you have to have a legitimate reason such as training learning medicine medication that is for you to go there but to go just for the sake of going and hamdillah muslim countries have everything that the West or the non-muslims have except the fornication the booze and and so on what does she have them doing this weekend it was my question oh god I'm under attack now well I do a lot of things in my free time I'm an aggressive a sportsman I play squash table tennis I do weightlifting bodybuilding that is not weightlifting I sometimes play volleyball I have championships in squash and its content in us whenever there's extra time I do some eight ball billiards I try my best to stay most of the time with my kids though I do not do them justice because i have so many other things to do beside my work lectures and sports but i tried to I don't socialize a lot I don't go out I stay the remaining time with my family Oh PlayStation I hate but I hate computer games why what I i don't know i don't like computer games and unlike soccer i think i do children hate computer games now some of them do some of them don't and they play i don't i don't prevent them from playing except of course they play with the volume down and providing that there are no programs that involve women and what about women and things that are not they don't play hmm what about games for example I mean PlayStation something is very very common these days what what about games that like a football game I mean they're images of football players running around playing for but I mean is that something that's not permissible I mean you know this is this is this is ok because they did the wrong not us and it's like watching cartoons so watching cartoons is the same thing we did not pay for that we did not draw it they did it it is ok especially nowadays with the exposure to the media this is the least of your worries to have these images with your children but you have to give them a you have to give them an alternative to look for without going to substitute your end you you don't have anything to give them to substitute what they have so cartoons PlayStation even these images as long as they're not forbidden images in the sense of sex violence and gods for example there are games that involve getting the people from the dead and you have the powers to to redirect people for example but it's just games I think so and this gave them hell well the thing is that this game although it's a game there's a lot approve of it or not does it please Allah or not there are games that involve crosses all the way a games that involve demons that get the people from the graves and resurrected Emily if you approve of this and you although it's a game it's a joke then is it okay to joke about Allah it's a joke is it okay to joke about that is awesome so again you have to draw the line between things that are allowed and things that are not allowed is it my intellect and logic that tells me yes it's possible or no it's not possible or is it the Quran and Sunnah Allah social and the Holy Quran tells us and warns us that it has been revealed to you before that if you see people mocking or ridiculing the verses of Allah so she'll be aware do not sit with them until they talk about something else otherwise you are like them and allah azzawajal will bring the non-muslims the hypocrites all together and throw them in hell you did not approve of that but sitting with people that ridiculed or made fun of Islam made you part of it and if you play with the game the critic use Islam or talks about crosses or demons or or talks about Alonzo Asian then though it's a game you are part of it chef what about equipping with non-muslim knowledge or sciences anything that you do to spend your leisure time if it adds value to you on the day of judgment which means that you are performing the number of worship then this is acceptable if it adds value to you on this life in this world such as a learning how to carpentry learning plumbing learning car mechanic then this is again something acceptable and permissible if you learn something that does not add any value at all such as magic on the contrary it may add it may harm you more than do you well or good then this is not acceptable spending your leisure time in acquiring knowledge about geographical places about the history of Nations this is something useful for you because it adds value to you it adds to your knowledge about other people and cultures spending your time reading about history reading about politics reading an economy studying geography studying geology whatever you do if it adds value to you in this life then this is a mean of utilizing your time your leisure time and something that is useful we can consider them scientific strength for Muslim it depends so it depends because the code you know it adds value but it should not mean that it is adding value to the strength of Muslims because strength of Muslims is recognized by military strength by scientific knowledge by a behavior throughout the community so it's not only the power it's all is also the values and ethics that people share and and treat each other with is there a certain kind of books that one can read in her spare time again anything that adds value to you it's okay for you to spend your time in but unfortunately there are so many bad books that a lot of the muslims may read and i know this is going to be a surprise that again that people read without knowing that it is not a lot for a little bit to go through for example if you read the novels of harry potter it's a novel it's fun it's for kids but involves magic and in islam it's not a trick this is actual magic where you transform an animal to a human being or vice versa and you do wonders and and in islam this is one of the seven major sins which is black magic now i'm not talking about you know swapping the place of a card here or there or tricks that you can do with movements and so on i'm talking about the actual magic that is applied in such novels well the defense davinci code also it's a famous novel I think it's what's made me a film to film it taught us how about it talks about existence of a large ocean and they talk about if Allah exists or no or not and about a cult that is is is trying to prove something or I've read about it preview about it somewhere so it depends on what you read if you read vulgar novels on or novels that involve pornography and and bad things then this is forbidden so then you would say that any fiction novels or not supposed to be no fiction fiction novels are okay if you're reading Star Wars for example things that involves a planet a feud between two planets it's fictional okay you're spending your time in something that is not that useful but it's not forbidden it as long as you're doing what you're supposed to do and you need this half an hour a day just to you know so you read it but you can't watch it not even watching it watching it again if it does not involve forbidden things it's okay and forbidding things are illustrated in having females and having music so if there were to be a movie that does not have a female and music it's okay to watch and not occasionally but once everyone for example a saving pride Private Ryan Ryan road though it's a Jew a director though I did not see the movie itself hamdillah but I was told that it did not have any women in and in the cast and that there of course there has to be a certain amount of music in it if a person lowers the the volume and does not listen to the music and watch and watches the the movie I see no harm in doing that but again this is not the priority of a Muslim to spend his time in Sammy I think there was something you wanted you had mentioned before and asked about the reading and religious scripts like Bible Gospels and other non-muslim scripts okay Islamically this is not allowed because the prophet of allah salah slm once met the second caliph homer who was his companion and he saw a paper in his hand so he asked him or Omar what is this so he told him it's a paper from the scripture so the Prophet was angry with him so long Salem and he took it away from him and told him that if Moses were to be alive he would not do anything but follow me because I came with the final revelation so you have to recite the Quran and this is more than enough for you I know that a lot of the viewers and maybe those who are participating with us today would have second second thoughts regarding this because it would say what prevents us from reading other scriptures as long as we're confident of what we have the answer would be first of all are you confident of what you really have do you have enough knowledge that gives you the power to investigate other religions without casting any doubt to your own the majority which I would presume the answer would be no secondly you are ordered at the side of Allah to study your Koran to study your sirna and this is what you're going to be questioned about on the day of judgment it's not the other scriptures therefore it is forbidden for most Muslim to read other religious books than Islam unless he is a researcher he's a knowledgeable scholar of Islam who is capable to study the other refute fallacies and yeah well I I personally I read the Bible I have three or four copies of the Bible in home I have them on CDs and I sometimes and a lot of times I benefit from them in my lectures but I it's crystal clear for me that these books are not authentic though to those who are not learning to those who are not a strong and their knowledge of Islam this is not permissible it's not acceptable thank you what then should if one were to look for something apart from sport and apart from games and apart from movies and all the things that we've been talking about in a sense what can one do in his leisure time to be for example a better muslim or better youth where to be a better muslim you have to study Islam but to be a better youth disguise is your limit you have so many things that you can utilize your time in and not necessarily to be forms of worship not necessarily to be learning the Quran and the Sunnah though they are the prime of knowledge what still if you don't want to you there are things other things you can collect stamps and a lot of people that collect stamps you can build aircraft models don't fly them though you have a problem then you can write a bike you can socialize with people you can form groups of young youth especially on the internet now which is something that everybody's using you can form a club or a chat rooms to call people to Islam you can make mailing lists to non-muslims sending them invitations then sending or highlighting things about Islam that would benefit them you can engage with your friends and learning mechanics car mechanics plumbing carpentry you can work part time just for the sake of learning trading and economy and so on you can do so many things with the electric time but the most important thing is to stay away from trouble trail stay away from drugs alcohol women stay away from anything that makes alonzo John I'm pleased with you sure cosmic when Hakeem thank you very much for joining us on you've talked you and thank you of course Sammy as well as mocking with and Mohammed thank you all for joining us that's it for this episode of youth talk next time we'll be back again with a new topic and until then slm on it nah love the love Oh Oh"
