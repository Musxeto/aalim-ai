  "transcript": "foreign oh and after the prophet went on to fight the tribe of banyakurida this year is almost to be over the fifth year of al-hijrah and on that particular year the prophet alaihis salatu salam married zainab bint jash his cousin but also who was married to zadim niharitha the so-called adopted son of the prophet and the this event by itself was a reason a good reason for the hypocrites to talk badly about the prophet sallallahu alaihi because in arabia the practice was that if you've adopted a son then he becomes your son hence you cannot marry his daughter because she is your daughter-in-law this was at the very beginning and in islam as we know from surat al-azab allah the almighty tells us that this is not to be practiced anymore and that whoever adopted a son or a daughter now this adoption has been void and nullified and he is a complete stranger for whom he adopted or his family therefore the prophet allah at the very beginning gave zainab bin jash his cousin to his beloved zed who was his son by adoption and she did not want to marry him actually because he was freed slave he was not an original tribesman like she was and her lineage is quite high and she was honorable among her people nevertheless she found no excuse not to obey the prophet sallallahu alaihi and she married him their life together was not that smooth one one reason or the other this is marriage no matter how hard you try and to match make between two people that you think that their marriage would be the best but subhanallah it never works and in some cases a man marries a woman and you say that divorce is inevitable and they go on to live for 50 or 60 years so all of this is the blessing of allah azza if allah subhanahu ta'ala wants it to happen it happens in the case of zainab bin jash and zaid it didn't happen and on and on zaid used to go to the prophet sallallahu salaam complaining from his wife and telling the prophet alison that he wants to divorce her they did not know that allah already informed his messenger that zade will divorce his wife and you muhammad will marry her and the prophet sallam was not easy with this because he was afraid of what the arabs would say yet he knew that this is from allah he tried his best maybe subhan allah something will change in the future maybe allah will would obligate this instruction and make their life smooth and and acceptable so whenever zayd came to him he would come him and say go back to your wife let's hope for the best and allah blamed the prophet sallallahu alaihi in this very surah that you are hiding what allah will be revealing and this means which is that you are hiding that he will divorce zainab and that you will marry her because allah revealed that to you before and you are to be blamed for trying not to get this thing done of course the prophet sallam knew it's going to happen but as part of human nature nothing was revealed to him uh through the quran so he was anticipating and hoping that allah changed this verdict but it it did not change it came and that is why aisha may allah be pleased with her tells us that if the prophet were to hold back anything from the quran he would have held back this verse where allah blames him and tells him why are you concealing and holding back some well why are you concealing and not revealing what allah will make as a revelation so the prophet sallam did not hold it back which tells you that this is not from his own making the quran cannot be from the prophet saw sallam own making because he cannot be blaming himself and the verses of the quran came divorced his wife zainab because he could not live with her any longer and after the edda was over the prophet salatu-salaam married zainab binchash of course the hypocrites started spreading their rumors and chit-chatting here and there by uh on on the topic of the prophet allah marrying this woman zainab bin jash and who happened to be the fifth wife of the prophet so that was another cause of disturbance to them and it's a window of opportunity to spread their gossip around medina they said he married his sister-in-law and his daughter-in-law well this is something else but how could he marry the fifth wife while we are only allowed to marry four and of course this is for the prophet alaihis and this was mentioned in the holy quran as a permission from allah to him and again this is an issue that a lot of the westerners bring up in order to degrade the prophet the prophet did not marry a second wife until he was approximately 53 years of age so this hints to you and she was over 40. and all the wives he married afterwards they all had something in them for their companions or for their families or because they were the wives or the widow that is of his beloved companion so he wanted to sympathize with them and give them a home and shelter and to honor those who died with him in battle also in this year and you know and the some points you know i don't know why they didn't uh like you know mention it or why they didn't speak about it such as the prophet saw when he took orders from allah to marry such uh zainab josh may allah be pleased with here or some of his wives uh most many of them they were orders from allah so basically had to listen to allah and do it this number one and number two as well allah ordered him that he is demanded he is forbidden to marry any more after the allah revealed in quran that the wise which the prophet had he can't take any more he can't even swap any of the prophet any of the wives which he had with anyone even if he would feel interested in in a new one so it's like an order to marry an order as well not to marry anymore so to be fair when we mention you know this and we say oh your prophet did this or did that maybe it's to be fair to say yeah but he got an order not to marry ever and even us as muslims we are we are allowed to marry whenever we want just you know if i have even if i have four wives i could divorce one and i wait till you know the period time ends and then i can get a new one but the prophet he couldn't well this is something that one should contemplate a little bit more on first of all the prophet salallahu it's true that he was instructed to marry but now when you talk to westerners you don't usually tell them that they would not believe that he is a messenger and that he was ordered to marry because if they believe that then end of story we have no problem we're talking to people that do not accept that the prophet sallam is a messenger and that is why in so many cases we try to justify his actions and the actions of his companions logically and if you go to logic you would find that even if he was not a messenger and this is very hypothetical because the evidences are overwhelming to the extent that even the non-muslims themselves the scholars admit that he is a prophet a messenger and one of the greatest men ever but hypothetically speaking we try to justify and to bring his actions to logic with people who do not believe in his message and that is why we tell them if you say that the prophet sallam married nine wives look at the wives he married you would not find one single virgin except may allah be pleased with her and the rest are either widowed once or twice and maybe maybe twice so a person interested in women would not go for other than a virgin and beside that look at the age difference and look at the circumstances and look at the benefits out of each and every marriage at the left yeah i once read a report about the uh just after the september 11th attacks in new york the firemen on this day they actually divorced their women and married the the wives of their colleagues who died and i thought this is a very strange event because this was like um a polygamy polygamous uh motivation but they had to leave a a widow so they had to leave a mad woman for a widow which was unfair yeah they felt sympathetic to the the widows of their colleagues but they could not marry more than one at the same time so they had to and this is awkward in order to sympathize with a colleague that died you divorce your own wife destroy two families this is unimaginable in islam alhamdulillah we have a legitimate way of acquiring more than one wife and this brings us to the second point you've raised and that is if you have four wives you have the right to divorce and marry again and divorce and marry again and this is not the practice of good muslims your divorce women are not adults to play with in the sense that i don't like her anymore i divorce her and then i remarry again and again and again this is not a practice of a real muslim if you marry then it's for a reason and if you divorce definitely it's for a valid and justifiable reason i believe we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we will be back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the hereafter as well each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it also on this year the fifth year of hijrah the verse of hijab was revealed and it became obligatory upon the muslim women and particularly upon the wives of the prophet allah to where the hijab and um be pleased with him the second caliph was never pleased with the way that the prophet's wives used to come out and he would always ask the prophet sallam to put the hijab on them and just for information what is the meaning of hijab abdullah i believe it's a screen it's a screen linguistically it means veil veil is only for the face but actually hijab means something to protect the other party from being seen so it's like a screen or a visor or a partition and the origin of this is found in surat al-azab and this is a great surah for muslims to recite and keep by heart because it has what happened in al khandak in the battle of the trench and it has lots of verses that are related to our lives among these verses where allah azzawajal talks to the prophet sallam and to his companions and allah tells them that if you dine at the prophet sallam's house do not stay and remain without being permitted to once you finish your meal leave because by staying though you like to stay at the prophet's house this harms the prophet allah and irritates him but because he is so kind and merciful he would not tell you this so he would just sit with you and it also tells the companions that whenever you ask the wives of the prophet for anything a plate a fork anything of the household you should do this from behind a screen you should do do this from behind a partition and why is that the allah says almighty that is for the purification of your hearts the companions of the prophet and for theirs the wives of the prophet isabel so the reason for making hijab obligatory is for the purification of the hearts of the men and women now remember that this has been addressed to the best and the elite of all muslims at all times the companions of the prophet sallam so allah is telling us and all the dignitaries of the companions may allah be pleased with them whenever you ask your mothers because the wives of the prophet are considered to be the mothers of the believers no one can marry them after the death of the prophet as mentioned in the holy quran it is completely forbidden so abu bakr and ali whenever you ask your mothers for something do not talk to them face to face there has to be a hijab a partition a screen between you and them and why is that so that your hearts remain pure and clean no doubts here are there and their hearts also remain pure and clean and one would argue and say who is in more need of this purification us or them we need it more than them obviously definitely we need that purification more than them so when you tell when you tell someone do not talk to strange women without protection in the sense of from behind the veil or in the presence of other people and do not have a normal intermingling with jokes and laughter and socializing because this is forbidden one would argue and say why we're civilized we don't have any of these bad thoughts and ideas that you muslims have we would say this is the ruling of allah and allah azza created us and allah almighty knows exactly what is going to happen to us and that is why he is instructing us to purify our hearts through talking to strange women from behind a veil a partition a stream and it has nothing to do to with civilization on the contrary if you go to the west you would find that mixed societies the rate of adultery or even the rate of incest is so high it's beyond imagination i've read once in a uh an article in the newspaper i think it's it was in the independent or the washington post that they say that during the past three years the relationship during work has increased up to 60 percent in the sense that 60 of workers have relationship with their co-workers and this is exactly what islam wants to forbid the only relationship that is permissible is through the marriage contract i believe that these uh relationships obviously people believe that they have control over themselves which they do have at first but sometimes as human beings not every day is good and not every morning is good so from time to time you may find something in someone which you don't find in your spouse which leads like a string to an affection and then once the affection is built then you know the rest of it is all done with i believe this is completely true and satan is quite picky so maybe you would know 100 women at your workplace satan chooses the right moment where you're not on good terms with your spouse and then chooses one when it's the circumstances are are right and ready she makes you laugh yes and well she either makes you laugh or you sympathize with her because of a tragedy or a calamity that took place with her and it goes on and on nevertheless the ruling of allah azza was clear they have to put on the veil and cover themselves completely some scholars say that this is only for the wives of the prophet but if you revise the sunnah of the prophet and if you review the verses of the quran you would find that it is for both the wives of the prophet and also for the believers the women believing women so there is no difference in between them and we are in deep need for such protection for uh women as mentioned in the quran but a lot of women don't seem to realize this because although i'm a man myself a woman sometimes you can take her how you see her nowadays if a woman is a very educated and she has a good position in society but if she was to dress in a minuscule or very low revealing clothes this would be in the sight of a man or the education is gone now she becomes like an object because she's she's uh what you could say advertising herself as not an educated woman but someone who is available because there will be no difference between her and someone who advertises herself on the corner of the street because this label is the same well this is again it comes back to realizing what is the word of allah and what is the the demand of the society society nowadays because they're away from allah they demand nudity and the further you go from the word of allah from islam the more you come to the savage practice that is practiced in the jungles of africa and if you look at those civilized who are far away from allah and to those savages in africa you would find that they have something a common denominator and that is nudity the while islam comes to protect people to have their level of chaste increased by covering them you can only expose these things to your uh first uh great relatives brothers sons and and and and so on and to your spouse and no one else is allowed to enjoy a female's uh a beauty except these people does this mean that the woman is valuable in islam then so it has to be covered and protected from the others this is an allegation that we claim but then someone else would come and say well if woman is valuable isn't man also valuable why not cover the man himself so you always talk to the people in the sense that is logical yes women are valuable but this is not why we uh cover them we also value the men and we would like also to protect the men actually the society as a whole is more invaluable than both and that is why we protect the society if an individual thinks that intoxicants are okay for him and he could care less about what's going on it is not an excuse for us to permit him to consume intoxicants in his house because he is harming the whole society as a whole so we would say that women are are valuable in islam but we also do not cover them because of their value we cover them because of their tremendous effect on men even if they are exposed when they are exposed because men do not have the effect on women that the that women have on men and that is why islam tells us to separate them for their own good and for the purification of their hearts and whenever she has to uh work or or shop or go out of her house she has to be properly dressed also on that particular year going back to the seerah the prophet sallam instructed the killing of a jew by the name of abu rafa salaam and he was with bani quraila and bani nadir aiding the politist army to attack the muslims in the battle of khandak and that what made the prophet salaam instruct his companions to go and assassinate him they went in a company of five by uh led by abdullah ibn take me allah or may allah be pleased with him he himself went into his fortress it was outside of madinah and he managed to sneak in the prophet sallam instructed them not to harm any women or children only this man who was the enemy of islam and alhamdulillah he managed by the grace of allah to assassinate him but while going back he fell down and broke his leg his companions carried him to the prophet sallam who was pleased with what he had done and he robbed his broken leg and subhanallah as a miracle to our prophet it was healed on the spot and he walked as if nothing took place i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time or barakatuhu oh oh hmm"
