  "title": "Does crying for the deceased loved ones cause them any harm? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "who says my question is what is the ruling on crying when someone you know and love passes away is crying aloud and if we cry that what happens to the soul because I heard the soul feels pain for every tear drop crying is permissible the Prophet I Salaam cried when his son died when I was mad even him of their own melodies with him also died so this is a mercy from allah azzawajal what is not permissible is wailing and crying with a sound and shouting or tearing the clothes or pulling the hair also normal crying is permissible but is the deceased affected by it it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that the Prophet our son hadith in what a piranha rates may Allah be prism I believe he said that Annelle may I tell her you are that would be bouquet Ali Alek that the deceased is being tormented by the weeping of his family over him this torment is not a punishment and this is the most authentic opinion as in Tamiya said this torment is similar to the torment that a traveler finds when traveling the Prophet sent us on a safari Tom ended up travelling is part of torment one says yeah but on trial in first-class and I'm having fun yet it's still the jetlag the difficulties the tiredness that one finds is still a part or a form of torment that is associated with travelling though it's not a punishment likewise a deceased would feel the grief when he sees his family weeping but this is not a punishment unless he ordered them before he dies that do this after I die and Allah surgeon knows best this"
