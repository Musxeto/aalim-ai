  "transcript": "his mother died he wanted to bury her in Mecca it was against the law the ambulance driver suggested a bribe or a fee and he would work things over he gave him the money they managed to bury her and Mecca what's the ruling on that first of all it is a great misconception among the Muslims who think that being buried in Mecca or Medina is something that is rewarded by Allah or it's something that is good for the deceased this is wrong only Medina where the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said whoever can die in medina let him die in medina which means that the Prophet is encouraging people to live in Medina not to be carried overseas or from transported from Jeddah or from Riyadh or from the map to Medina to be buried there this nothing in in there in it except making it hard on his loved ones when people die in Jeddah they should be buried in Jeddah when people die in Riyadh they should be buried in Riyadh if they die in Egypt if they die in Bahrain if they died in Morocco the earth is the earth there is nothing so special or sacred about it in the sense that to be buried in it those who are alive yes they're instructed to go to Mecca and Medina to worship Allah because forms of worship are doubled tripled or quadrupled depending on what they do one prayer in Mecca is equivalent to 100,000 that is in the harem in the holy Masjid and one prayer in Medina is equivalent to a thousand that is in the harem in the message of the prophet sallallaahu send them there for you have to clear this misconception being buried in Mecca or Medina has no value at all living in Mecca and Medina is something that is recommended the Prophet told us Allah so Saddam that the Antichrist at the jail is not allowed to enter Mecca Normandy so living in these holy cities is something that is recommended what you have done that is giving the driver or the official money to allow you to break the law is a bribe it's a sin by itself to break the law even if you did not pay anything if you just you know pull the string here or there made a phone call here or there and they managed to break the law without even paying anything this is Haram for disobeying the ruler who Alonzo jelly instructed us to obey Him and things that are not that urgent or necessary for us he's not instructing us to sin we have to obey Him now paying the money was a sin by itself would it affect your mom inshallah I would not would it affect you definitely it would what should I do you should have asked before you have done what you have did what you did calling one of the scholars in Saudi Arabia or any Muslim country is very easy I hope but still you can find a scholar here or there you can find one of the judges who Islamic judges who you can go to their message it pray with them and ask them either whenever there's a will there's a way so don't go and make a mistake and then say what should I do try to ask before you go into that without knowing in sha Allah if you ask Allah for forgiveness if you repent to him if you show him sincere remorse that you're sorry and that you're not going to good to do something else similar to that and with the grace of Allah Allah accept your repentance and he would forgive you brother"
