  "transcript": "it was said that a Layman has to follow a scholar and if it's not possible then you have to follow a method with the sh that he guides him what what if is a Layman lives in a location like in the west where he does not have a she in his area and what should the Layman do well the best ideal situation for such an individual is to to learn Islam directly from the Quran and the Sunnah through the resources that are available to him a lot of the people in the West in Europe in America in places some places don't even have a Masjid let alone a student of knowledge or a scholar so what do such individuals do first of all they have to do their level best because always remember Allah one of his beautiful names is Al Al Al all of these names indicate that he's most forgiving most merciful and that he's kind and that he's subtle so Allah is not eager to throw us in hell as long as we're doing our level best we're trying to find the truth through all means Possible only to please Allah not to please our own desires like so many people do nowadays people are not interested in knowing what the Quran and the Sunnah State they just want to follow their whims and desires they don't have any evidences so if you are not in a position to find a scholar or a student of knowledge to learn from do your level best to do your own learning because you can't do anything else however with the grace of Allah alhamdulillah nowadays these new technologies have made things much easier than before so through the social media YouTube and the likes you can find thousands and thousands of beneficial video clips for abdb for Muhammed for Alani translate it to your language and you can find your answer and learn little by little also there are lots and lots of students of knowledge who are trusted in their religion in their um moral conduct and their uh ethics that you also can follow online and Allah Asel Knows Best"
