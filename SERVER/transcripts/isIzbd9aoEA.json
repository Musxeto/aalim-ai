  "title": "Is it a must to Workout and stay fit? Prophetﷺ‎ encouraged Horse riding, Wrestling - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says is it mandatory for a Muslim to work out and to exercise his body the word exercise itself as we know it today hitting the gym or going for jogging or doing your cardio or any similar activities these were not present at the time of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam nevertheless the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to encourage his companions to race on horses to wrestle and he would test them himself sallallahu alayhi wasallam before going to an expedition or to battle and would allow some to go and would prevent others from going as in the story of Arachne hadith and when he was proposing or wanting to enlist to go to the Battle of a hood and the Prophet prevented him at his house and because of his age his people told the Prophet SM that he was a good Archer so he allowed him in and came another companion who was also rejected because of his age and he said that I have the ability to pin him down or prophet of Allah physically so the Prophet has allowed them as well so exercise per se was not mentioned as we know today but the Prophet had said that is also in an authentic hadith that your body has rights over you your Lord has rights over you your guests have rights over you and your wife has rights over you so give each its due right so one has to take care of his body because your body has rights over you and without any doubt about a person that exercises and maintain a good diet would be able to worship Allah better in quality and longer in duration as well but not to go to the extreme as people do nowadays when they take these steroids and hormones or they spend excessive time just to look good in the gym without any purpose without any intention this is not something one should be indulged in"
