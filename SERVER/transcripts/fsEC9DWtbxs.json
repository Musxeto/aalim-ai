  "transcript": "say it Faruk says that in the money deposited in a wallet it's called Payton wallet and they deposited it in an escrow account and according to the RBI guidelines with a partner bank they have to give them see the issue is if there is a wallet you invest your money in if the transaction of this wallet is holid they invest in halal shares do you know that they have a Sharia board governing their transactions but according to the law of India or whatever country that is regulated there they have to put it in a bank account a third party that generates interest just for safekeeping and to ensure that your money is not lost this is how its regulated the interest money given to them they have to dispose it in halal means giving it to the poor or needy Muslims not to consume it themselves not to pay taxes with it not to give a gift to someone who is getting married from their relatives they have to dispose of it as forms of cleansing their wealth but the most important thing is that the wallet itself is governed by a Sharia board that they do their work in a halal way rather than just putting your money to whomever takes it to invest it providing that they give us a fixed interest and that the capital is maintained this is RIBA and it's Haram and this is not permissible and Allah knows best"
