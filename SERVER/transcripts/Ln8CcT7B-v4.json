  "transcript": "lady you what come on for so I what Oh you smell of Minerva him hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen Oh salatu salam ala nabina muhammad in walla and he was happy as my dear brothers sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we're still discussing surat n-never and the beautiful lessons we can learn from it the beautiful tough seal of this great surah and I'll not recap because this would take the full episode once again however last couple of episodes we talked about what allah azzawajal has prepared for the evil ones the sinners the disbelievers what Allah has prepared for them in Hellfire and we discussed how severe this punishment is because what was required from them was so little yet they fail to do so and it is part of the system of the Quran whenever alonso jimenez the people of hell he mentions the people of paradise so that people would not despair would not give up hope there's always hope if you believe in allah azzawajal so allah tells us in the quran in elmet opina m'frozza burley for the muttaqeen there will be a success that is paradise so at aqua is to fear allah azzawajal by refraining from doing sins and by fulfilling your obligations to allah by doing what he commanded you to do this is stuck wha so when someone is known as one of the muttaqeen this means that this is a practicing person a practicing individual he does what Allah tells him to do and he does refrain from what Allah forbids him from doing so Allah says that verily for these people for the muttaqeen there will be fazza mahfuzur comes from hose from winning from success so there will be a time for them to win and that is on the day of judgment and there will be a location there will be a reward for them and that is paradise and the people who are described as al-muttaqun they were called as such because they left a shield between them and Alice torment and that is what the prophet alayhi salatu salam said it tahun are well over Jeffrey Tambor that keep a shield of protection for yourself between hell fire in you even if you give away half a date in charity so it taku taku ah would te it's the same route you have to fear allah azzawajal and keep a protection from Hellfire from Allah's wrath and torment by doing what he ordered you to do and refraining from what he told you not to do so they will be successful in time and in location what will their reward be Allah says in a lil muta Keenum aphasia what is this ha ha arunava Chawla tells us that part of the paradise that they are rewarded with would be gardens so gardens what do we have in gardens all kind of fruit what kind of fruit any kind your heart desires and not only that you have the choice so this is a bit sour this is a bit sweet and they look the same and it keeps on changing and the taste keeps on becoming more delicious every time you take a bite and in our standards this is not possible because there is a limit in paradise there isn't anything as such it keeps on going and going and going for eternity and this blows your mind away because the Prophet says arisato Sam in paradise there are things that had never crossed a person's heart or mine nor and I had seen Nora near had heard of so in this life everything has an ending not end here after in paradise there's no end it keeps on getting better and better to the extent that the Prophet told us at a solid was Sarah that every Friday though there is no day and night in paradise there are no days but there is a particular time which people acknowledge this friday as we used to do here in this life on Earth men go to the masjid there is no masjid in paradise so there you go to the souk to have fun and when they go back to their families and wives allah sends the northern when that increases in their beauty and charm so when they reach their houses their palaces the mansions they look at their wives and say by Allah you are more beautiful than we had left you and the wives look at the men and say by Allah you are more handsome than when you had left and this happens every single week till eternity there's no stopping them and it keeps on going because things and paradise are not like the things we know of on this earth so there are Gardens filled with every fruit you can think of and those you cannot think of as well and specifically there are great yards though there are fruits but grapes are more beloved to people than any other fruit so there are gardens and specific klee graveyards and allah azzawajal says in the following verse ayah 33 what kuwari be' a trava towards and young full-breasted mature maidens of equal age a trava no one is older or younger than the other and that is why in the authentic hadith the Prophet told us how they sought them that the age of the people of paradise would be fixed at 33 years of age so no one is younger so that no one would feel betrayed or unfortunate they will all be in the same age now allah azzawajal is describing to us the women of paradise and unfortunately due to a number of factors we would have complaints we would have women objecting why does a man have two wives in paradise why does a man have so many who elaine when a woman has only one man well you have to look at it holistic first of all we always address our sisters by telling them do you think that allah azzawajal would let you down in paradise do you think that allah is unfair or unjust do you think that you will be a bit depressed or sad in paradise the answer is definitely no to all these questions allah the almighty is the most fair and just a large the would yell if he admits you my sister or my daughter to paradise I assure you that you'll be the happiest person on earth well actually will not be on earth he will be in paradise Allah will take all grudges old jealousy old hatred old enmity from your heart Allah will cleanse it and it would make you the most satisfied person in paradise dressed for now having said that not only that having believed in it first of all we have to know that the number of females are far greater than the number of males and this is a known fact look around you you'll find always women are more than men men die quicker men died because of hypertension illnesses accidents wars among other reasons so women are more than men and that is why in paradise men will get more women and not only that it has to be noted that man is the one who is in quest while a woman is not how is that this is what we will try to elaborate on a bit more after this break so stay tuned ya Salam aleikum and welcome back now just before the break I gave a statement and people challenged me for it you said that the man is the one whose inquest he's the one who is pursuing he's the one chasing while a woman is the one who's sought after now having said that not only that having believed in it first of all we have to know that the number of females are far greater than the number of males and this is a known fact look around you you'll find always women are more than men men die quicker men died because of hypertension illnesses accidents wars among other reasons so women are more than men and that is why in paradise men will get more women and not only that it has to he noted that man is the one who is in quest while a woman is not and this is true see if I have a son and I have a daughter how would I encourage my son to pursue his education and to perfect his work and to become a better person I would say to him listen son if you do well in school I'll put you in the best of universities and if you pass your BS or ba and you graduate I'll look for the best jobs and then I will look for the most beautiful charming woman and I would encourage my son for this I would never go to my daughter and tell her listen I'm gonna look for the most huskier and strongest and fittest and most handsome man for you as a husband no one does this why because women they are bashful they are shy we don't talk to women like this and they don't allow people to talk to them like this unlike men unlike boys this is what they live for and that is why the prophet alayhi salatu salam when engaging when proposing the father goes to his daughter and says daughter a man proposed to you by the name of so-and-so he looks like so and so his job his family so what do you think the Prophet told us how they thought of sarum that the father should display the matter to his daughter who is a virgin and her approval is by not saying anything why scholars say because she is bashful when I go to my daughter and say I've got lies proposing to marry you what do you say my daughter and she laughs and she looks at the ground or smiles she doesn't say a thing I wouldn't go back to him and say she refused she didn't say anything no the Prophet told us when she does not comment this is an indication of our approval so it shows you that the difference of character between a male and a female this is in normal conditions this is in normal societies unlike the societies of today where a woman is liberated from her feminism and she is actually another man nowadays Western women other men though the gender is f but actually what you see and feel is different I remember once I was talking to a brother and he told me if you want to marry another man marry a female from so-and-so country he said because women there are not women they look like women but they are actually men and this is unfortunate so allah azzawajal is telling us listen in paradise these are the features of the Holy Elaine or of the women among the humans in paradise he describes them to us because this is what men look for women Allah still does not describe men to them because this is against their bashfulness and China's I'm not talking about normal women and it doesn't make a lot of difference to women usually see men can love more than a woman by nature a man can love for can marry for this is how Allah created us while a woman as they say a woman needs only one man she loves only one man this is how Allah has created her and as they say torn between two lovers feeling like a fool yes because this is not normal for a woman to love two men she can only by nature love one man this is how Allah created her and as I said this is nature which is manipulated and changed by the media and that is why we have a problem with the genders Allah says among the things that would be in paradise Waka sandy haha and this translates to and a full cup of wine it's full your cup is always full no matter how many times you drink of it it's always full and why do we say that it is of wine because usually people who were practicing were righteous were pious they deprived of drinking wine and intoxicants in this life and that is why Allah would reward them and he would give them all what they want from the wine that they deprived themselves from in this life they would have it unlimited and for eternity always full and this doesn't mean that they don't drink anything else because we know that there are four rivers great rivers in paradise a river of wine a river of milk a river of honey and a river of water with characteristics that are beyond your imagination however this full cup is most likely of wine and that is why Allah says afterwards in ayia 35 lies marijuana feeha learn 11 a keith abba they would not listen to love oh lord shall they hear therein lying so two things that they were not here level and lying what is level level is anything that is beside the truth so dirty false evil talk all of this would be considered part of louisville slandering swearing shouting saying bad words this is level and kill Abba lying saying lies and take a step back and look at the effect of wine in this life when you get drunk what do you do you do everything you don't want to do when you're sober so you lie you swear your curse you say bad things you say dirty things some of the atoms used to drink wine and one time he urinated and he drank his urine and washed himself with it and when he was so buddy said by Allah would never do this again I would never drink if it's going to do this with me and another one a Muslim was intoxicated urinated and performed woodle from his urine and he said Aloha Miranda minute Toa be no join a minimal tapa hearing this is what we say after performing would make me among those who repent and make me among those who purify themselves when you're intoxicated you do things you could not imagine and this is the greatest and biggest gift or among the biggest gifts of a logical to you your sanity your intellect your consciousness if you buy will consume something that takes us all away from you you're not worthy of being human in paradise nothing of this exists alonzo gel tells us that when you drink this wine of paradise it is so sweet it has no hangovers you will not wake up the following morning having headaches and wanting to throw up it is so sweet it is so perfect you don't have to ask which year it was you just drink it enjoy it and no consequences afterwards no lying no swearing no cursing in paradise you will not have any of these negative feelings all what you have is total perfection and feeling the brotherhood between you and those sharing paradise with you so all of these beautiful things the gardens them Aidan's the wine everything you see all of this jeza um Rebecca Appa and he saba a reward from your Lord an ample sufficient gift and this is a reward from allah azzawajal now if you have a neighbor who is middle-aged doesn't have a lot of money and he comes and gives you a gift would it be the same when a multi millionaire or a billionaire comes and gives you a gift would it be the same when the head of state gives you a mansion or a piece of land or a farm or something that is so expensive and worthy of his level and status so what is given is dependent on the giver not on the recipient and that is why it was reported that one of the salaf once was asked for charity by a beggar so he wrote to his accountant give that beggar a hundred dinar now we have dirhams and have denars which is a lot in today's calculation maybe it's like 10,000 euros so the accountant thought that there was a mistake in writing so he went to his master and said maybe you meant a 10 dirhams not 100 dinars said no no I meant what you read he said master this beggar if you give him one dirham he would be happy why give him 100 dinner and master was angered by that and said we give them in accordance to our stylist not in accordance to their status so the givers reward depends on his status so if allah azzawajal gives you a reward from him an ample and sufficient gift how great that reward would be this is all the time we have until we meet next time via manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh don't anybody been afraid No for a solo meema"
