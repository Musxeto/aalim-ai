  "transcript": "Uh would you say it's better to study Quran to memorize the Quran or study? This is not something that you do and ignore everything else. It's like saying soh. Do you think that we should only eat protein or uh only carbs? You don't. Nobody does this. You have to have a mixture of everything to live a happy life. You can't focus only on memorizing the Quran 24 hours, 7 days a week. By default, human nature. You won't be able to do this. You want to refresh. You want to read something else. And Shan would focus to distract you and make you feel bored. Who can be bored from the Quran if you do it for six, seven hours? Human nature. This is what happens. So the balance is the key word and the magical word and people would come and send me emails you used magical words and this is haram magic is kufur you've apostate sumi you can say that it is the magical word which is a metaphorical expression for a happy life. So study and memorize the Quran an hour, an hour and a half. Then do the tap to know the meaning of what you've memorized. Then do some to refresh and to live with the prophetam and to learn how he suffered and how he gave us this legacy that he left behind. Then you go for and try to learn a issue or issues that relate to your then you go to then you go to this you go and then you may just go and hang out and chill with your friends for half an hour to refresh and go back again. This is the right way of doing it. But to be narrow-minded like a horse in a racetrack has visors behi beside his uh eyes he can only see one direction but he cannot see the whole world. This is what you should do and Allah knows best."
