  "transcript": "I have a question Institute after subhanallah can we make Duos in our own language the answer is if you do not know how to do a particular Dua in Arabic because the vast majority of Scholars say that you have to only use Arabic in Salat however the most authentic opinion is if I want to ask Allah azzawajal to pay off my debt I don't know how to say that in Arabic so I can use my native language to ask Allah to pay off my debt if I want to ask Allah to forgive my sins I know how to say so I cannot say that in my native language I must say it in Arabic I hope this answers your question"
