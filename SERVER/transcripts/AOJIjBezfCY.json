  "transcript": "um Beyond beyond what happened and blessings foreign yesterday we began to discuss some of the wisdoms found in the Hadith of IBN Abbas may Allah be pleased with him where he says I was behind the messenger of Allah one day and he said oh boy I shall teach you some words Safeguard or observe Allah and he will protect you observe Allah and you will find him in front of you if you ask then ask of Allah and if you seek help then seek help from Allah know that if the nation were to gather together to benefit you in some way they would not benefit you except in something that Allah has decreed for you and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way they would not harm you except in something that Allah has decreed for you the Pens have been lifted and the pages have dried the prophet says safeguard or observe Allah and he shall protect you so how do we observe Allah azzawajal because we know that the highest level of belief is where you worship Allah as if you can see him the prophet says so if you cannot see him then acknowledge the fact that he sees you so how do we observe Allah how do we Safeguard Allah and the almighty by implementing what he ordered us to do by executing his instructions by refraining and keeping away from the things that he had prohibited whether these things are done in public or they are done in privacy and this is why Allah azzawajal tells us in chapter 50 Surat off one of the great surahs of the Quran one of the surahs that the prophet salallahu so often recited it in the Friday sermon meaning that he used to recite it as a sermon for Friday because it contained so many beneficial points that it's sufficed for a Friday sermon in chapter 50 Allah azzawajal says and Paradise will be brought near to the righteous not far who are these righteous people Allah says it will be said this is what you were promised for every returner to Allah a person who keeps on repenting and returning to Allah and keeper of his Covenant and this is hafee you remember the beginning of the Hadith in Arabic Safeguard Allah and he shall protect you so hafeef is one of Allah's names but it's also shared by humans so if a person is righteous and he protects and he safeguards and he keeps Allah's Covenant in this case he is also hafee and part of safeguarding Allah part of observing Allah azzawajal is to protect the two important organs in the human body which are usually the most used in sinning the prophet says in the authentic Hadith whoever protects in the same word as youth the same word is used whoever protects what is between his Jaws and his legs Allah azzawajal would make him admitted to Paradise Allah would admit him to Paradise so if You observe and Safeguard your tongue and your private part by not indulging in lying cheating backbiting by protecting your tongue from sinning and by protecting your private part from indulging in illegitimate illegal sexual acts if you succeed in doing this then you have protected these organs and Allah would admit you to Jannah therefore the issue of observing Allah safeguarding Allah's instructions and orders is not an easy thing yet the reward is huge and safeguarding Allah's orders instructions is for a very limited time maximum 60 70 years a hundred years but the reward is overwhelming for eternity it is forever and the punishment of course for defying Allah's orders for going against Allah's orders is hell for eternity may Allah protect us so Paradise forever in return for being patient for only few years now if I observe Allah if I Safeguard Allah's instructions how would Allah protect me there are two types of protections as the scholars say the first type is what we all are after what we are all seeking and that is the protection in our health in our wealths in our Offspring in our families in our security so it's worldly protection that is commonly sought after and this is normal Muslims and non-muslims alike they always pursue this kind of protection however we believe that the provider of the protection is Allah while they believe that it's their own intellect their own education their own power their own efforts that they invest and there's a huge difference we will talk about that later on inshaallah so this kind of protection the prophet used to ask Allah for in a long Hadith which each and everyone should memorize it to recite it in the morning and in the evening with this Hadith Allah protects all of us it protects he protects you and azogel and your Offspring your family your wealth and your religion and the Hadith is long Allah foreign so this encompasses four things your religion your world your family and your wealth in the evening and in the morning Allah would protect his children so you don't have to go and recite on them Ayatul Kursi or specific duas before they go out to school or before they go out anywhere this does the job and then Allah says in it so he's asking Allah to protect and conceal his shortcomings and to give him Safeguard from whatever intimidates him or frightens him and then he says oh Allah Safeguard me oh Allah protect me from in front of me and from what comes from behind me from my right and from my left and from whatever is from top and I seek refuge in your greatness that I would not be assassinated from below me so the protection is all over 360 degrees and the prophet is asking this kind of protection which is the first type of protection that Allah gives to us protection in our health in our wealths in our offsprings families Etc foreign it was reported in his biography that he exceeded a hundred years of age it was reported that he was once with his disciples with his students on a boat and when they approach the shore he jumped a very far leap for a man his age his students said may Allah have mercy on you this is not very healthy you are old and you might have injured yourself so he said to them these are limbs that we observed Allah with we safeguarded for the sake of Allah and Allah would Safeguard them Allah would protect them at the end of our lives so he has this full trust in Allah that because we did not use these limbs to sin Allah the almighty would keep and protect these limbs when we are at a bigger age would also protect your offspring if you are righteous and practicing Muslim as in Surah in the last third story when Musa peace be upon them came to a wall that was about to fall and he fixed it and he erected it then explained himself to Musa peace be upon Him by saying that it belonged to two orphans and their father was a righteous man in the tafsir it says that their seventh grandfather was the righteous person so imagine Allah protected all these Seven Generations because of the righteousness of the first grandfather meaning that if You observe Allah Allah shall protect you and shall protect all those next to you one of the Great tabirin used to pray and increase his prayers and he wouldn't pray and I pray for like 15 minutes like we do he would prolong his night prayer for three hours four hours and he would talk to his young child his young boy and he says to him I will increase in my prayer so that Allah azzawajal would protect you because of that so the more you give the more Allah would give you in return may Allah have mercy on him says that Allah the almighty protects by a righteous person his sons and his grandsons and the houses next to his house and Allah would keep them in Safeguard and will keep them in his protection so this is the first part of Allah's protection to us providing that we Safeguard the law and we observe Allah the second type of protection which is more honorable and far greater which is Allah's protection to your religion to your faith and to your heart so Allah protects your heart from dubious Matters from doubts and Whispers of shaytan from penetrating your heart and controlling it so when you die you die on the religion of Islam and you're able to say Allah this is one of the greatest if not the greatest form of Allah's protection and this is why the prophet used to ask Allah for this when he puts his side to sleep on bed every night he says o Allah in you or by your name I put my side and by your name I I get up out of the bed or I wake up oh Allah if you take my soul have mercy on it meaning that if I sleep and I die have mercy on my soul but if you set a tree meaning that you return it to my body and now I wake up for a new day in this case protect it protect my soul as you protect your righteous servants so this is the best type of protection and also it is well known when someone is traveling you usually say the Sunnah Dua which some of us may not know the prophet whenever a friend of his traveled he used to say to him as they were departing I Safeguard Allah azzawajal your religion and your trustworthiness and the conclusion or the ending of your good deeds I keep that as something I entrust Allah with and then the prophet used to say Assam whenever Allah is entrusted with with something Allah would protect whatever you entrust Allah with Allah the almighty would protect that for you now whomever Allah guides and directs to do good deeds then he's a successful person because it is only Allah azzawajal that eradicates calamities it is only Allah that would take the clouds of your cloudy day and restore the sunshine to your life Allah is most merciful he is more merciful to us than a mother to her baby and this is why when we ask we ask only of Allah and this is what the prophet said in the Hadith to Abdullah Abbas if you ask then ask of Allah and if you seek help then seek help from Allah which means that Allah the almighty is the one who that answers are called and he's the one who provide us with help and guidance and this is why we say every single Salat in the Fatiha which is the greatest chapter in the whole of the Quran chapter one what you're going to staying you only we worship and you only we seek assistance and help from and this is the real way of seeking help from Allah by showing your poverty your weakness and by total humility and submissiveness to Allah azzawajal and thinking that no one else can do anything for you except Allah which brings us to the last portion of the Hadith which is extremely important and a lot of the Muslims have their uncertainty in it the prophet says no acknowledge no that if the nation the whole um were to gather together to benefit you in some way they would not benefit you except in something that Allah has decreed for you and if they were to gather together to harm you in some way they would not harm you except in something that Allah has decreed for you the Pens have been lifted and the pages have dried this whole statement is referring to the belief in predestining in the Divine decree in what is known as and this is something crucial for you to be a Muslim without believing it you're not a Muslim because we know that the six pillars of Iman the last one is to believe in predestiny whether good or evil so the prophet is telling us something if we were to believe in if we were to have full conviction in we would not have any problem in our lives we would not have any stress we would not have any fear of the future why because he's telling us believe acknowledge know that if the whole nation if the whole world where to collaborate to bring you to benefit you with something they would not be able to benefit you and he did not stop here I Susan no he said they would not be able to benefit you except with something that Allah had decreed for you and likewise in harming you if they collaborated the whole of the universe to harm you with something nothing can reach you unless Allah had decreed it for you so if this is the case then whatever happens to me I'm the happiest man on Earth because I believe that this is what Allah has chosen for me and Allah does not choose anything except that is good for me now one would argue and say what is this you're talking about Allah only chooses what is good for you why do we have volcanoes tornadoes hurricanes earthquakes why do I lose my child in a car accident why do I lose my spouse through divorce why do this happen and that where is the good in it ah subhanallah this goes back to your belief your Iman to your conviction and the majority of Muslims do not have this the majority of people even if you Muhammad sallam try your level best they will not believe and another verse Allah says and the majority of them would not believe in Allah except while associating others with him we believe in the euro in the dollar in the real but our belief in Allah is doubtful stop for Allah may Allah forgive us all this is the sad truth now everything that Allah decrees has good in it for you but you may not know this similarly if your child has an illness that requires an operation and if you do not operate on him he will die you willingly take him to the surgeon and the surgeon puts him on the operating phase and he cuts him open and your child looks at you why are you allowing him to do this you don't love me you don't want what's good for me and with tears running from your eyes you do not reply but you know that what you're doing is the best for your child Allah has the highest example nothing is similar to him so whatever Allah chooses for you you may not see the wisdom behind it but your conviction and belief your firm Iman makes you acknowledge and say alhamdulillah Allah does not decree anything unless it is good for us now one would argue and they're telling me we have three minutes I don't know if I'm going to finish it in that or not because the issue of predestiny is very important so many times people say if Allah knows everything and he knows whether I am going to be a Muslim or a non-muslim am I going to be a righteous person or a sinful person why doesn't Allah stop me now this is a long story that we have to make short first of all you have to acknowledge a number of facts that are real facts and cannot be an issue of dispute among any Muslim first of all you acknowledge that Allah is knowledgeable so knowledgeable that he knows the past and he knows the present and he knows what will happen in the future and he knows what did not happen in the future how it would have been had it happened so his knowledge is unlike our knowledge totally you have to acknowledge a second thing which is that Allah azzawajal is wise and that he never commits any form of transgression Allah is never unfair or unjust he himself told us about himself by saying O my servants I have made transgression I have made wrongdoing prohibited upon myself and I make it prohibited upon you so do not wrong one another so Allah does not make any type of zulm you have to acknowledge this and thirdly and finally you have to acknowledge the fact that all what you see around you and all what you do not see is the possession of Allah the Almighty Allah owns everything so you have no say whatever Allah Wills will happen you do not have the right to object because he is your creator if I take a one dollar bill and I burn it no one can say what are you doing this is wrong it's none of your business it's my money so whatever I do in what I own generally speaking of course in Islamic terms there are boundaries but this is because we are creatures we are humans among ourselves we do not actually own what we have this is all Allah's property but generally speaking whatever a person does in his possession no one can argue with him and Allah has the highest example Allah owns everything so even if he created us and then he threw us all in hell without accountability no one can say anything this is he's right now we know that he's wise we know that he's Fair we know that he's knowledgeable and we know that he does not treat anyone unfairly this conviction makes you feel that you are a servant of Allah and that you're fulfilling what Allah wants of you there are four levels of predestiny in the belief of it I don't know if he will have time but I'll try my level best after the break to go through them quick as quickly as possible and then take your calls so stay tuned and welcome back I believe the lines are open now for you to call but before we take any caller there are four levels that must be within each and every one of us we have to believe in them in order to have full conviction in the sixth filler of Iman the first one is knowledge so we have to acknowledge the fact that Allah's knowledge is unlike ours Allah's knowledge of every single thing that is happening in this universe and this is found in so many ayas in the Quran the second level of belief in predestining is writing so we believe that everything that we are doing and that we will do in the future had been already written and gone uh over with gotten over with the prophet said the first thing that Allah had created or when Allah first created the pen he ordered the pen to write so the pen said what shall I write Allah said write everything from now till the day of judgment the prophet says this incident was 50 000 years before Allah created the creation so everything is written in the preserved tablet and it's fixed it's unchangeable and Allah knows this the third pillar is the Divine will so whatever happens happens with Allah's will not against his will and this is a long topic when we talk about the Divine Universal will and when we talk about the technical uh Islamic or religious will but in short that whatever you do this has been willed by Allah so one would say okay in this case I become a drug addict I become a drunkard I fornicate and this was with the will of Allah so Allah will not punish me how do you know that this was the will of Allah Allah gave you a free choice if you believe that you have free choice then you should not blame Allah's Divine will and if you believe in Allah's Divine will as if you know it then go to the highest building in town and throw yourself from the ceiling from the roof and say if Allah's Divine will stated that I will fall on my feet safe and harmed this will happen Nobody Does this because it is your choice but whatever you choose this was related to Allah's Divine will and Allah azzawajal allowed you to do it Allah willed it for you and finally the creation whatever we do whatever is on Earth or in this vast universe it is the creation of Allah it is Allah who created you and whatever you do so our actions our choices everything is created by Allah the Almighty we have I mean from Bahrain hello yes I mean I have two questions one is that when we pray when we recite the Quran and there is a sahaja some people say that you should not do the sasda between Asar and because it is a prohibited time my second question is that in India mostly the masjids and the imams and the Believers they follow this Shrine thing going to the durgas and all for such Masjid can we give donation and will whether it will be acceptable by Allah our donation to such mosque Masjid okay jabber from Afghanistan law can I ask yes Jabber I think we lost brother Jabra I hope he calls again I mean from Bahrain said the prostration of the Quran someone told him that if you're reciting in the Quran and you come to an eye at the end of Surah Festival you should not prostrate between us and Maghrib because this is a time where prayer is prohibited virtually they are right but initially they're not so you go back to these brothers and tell them when I performed the recitation prostration is it a prayer if they say yes tell them you're wrong because a prayer is specific words and actions inaugurated by takbeer and concluded by salaam and what I'm doing I did not offer takbeer in the beginning and salaam at the end and therefore it is not a prayer and you can do it 24 7 without any problem with that Muhammad from Saudi Arabia foreign I would like to know if shaving or facial hair invalidates the fat shaving the facial hair yeah for men okay any more questions that's it thank you you're quite welcome and we have uh anibia from Somalia I I sometimes when I pray or when I try to go back to Allah I feel depressed and I feel like my prayers won't be answered because of sins that I've committed in the past how can I get past that inshallah okay any more questions no doctor I will answer you insha Allah okay I mean second question that there are so many messages in India and elsewhere where the imams and the people of the Masjid they go to dargas they go to shrines and they believe in others other than Allah and he says can we give donations to these messages the answer is if you give donations to this Masjid would they go back to being on the way of the Prophet or they will continue in their Shirk and their uh bad things if the answer is that they will continue to go to their Sheikh and they will most likely call others to it in this case no definitely it is not permissible for you to give them a single dime you should invest your money by helping the Muslim cause and by supporting is from Afghanistan again sorry I got cut off last time no problem what can I do for you okay what's our duty is Muslims in this you know situation that we have lots of Muslims are getting killed by other Muslims like Saudi Arabia who's invading Yemen and killing innocent people massacring and genociding there or Sheikh Nemar that's imprisoned in Saudia okay okay masha'allah very enthusiastic a job it is from Afghanistan and I will get back to his question or actually his bombardment um Muhammad from Saudi Arabia says does shaving affect fasting once you learn the Islamic rulings and conditions of each form of worship you are in in in safety inshallah so if someone tells you what are the things that nullifies your Urdu you say whatever comes from your private part sleeping eating camel's beat Etc so once you know these one two three four items anything that comes out you can easily ignore and say no because it's not part of the four it's not part of the five then it doesn't affect your uh Woodle likewise with fasting so shaving the facial hair for men is Haram is a sin by the consensus of four schools of thought they all agree that shaving is totally prohibited for men the facial hair but does it affect this fast thing the answer is no this is something that is different than this we have Muhammad from Mali I'm afraid that we lost Muhammad najiba from Bahrain najiba uh one question yes my question is that the day we are fasting making wudu and we're putting out in our mouth and our nose what I said okay I will answer inshallah you're quite welcome okay then we have anibia uh from Afghan from Somalia says that every time I try to pray to Allah and return to him uh okay we have Islam from UAE Islam yes I wanted to ask you regarding the Dua you mentioned that protects the family yes um and also add another question I read the Quran on the iPad and as you know with the Quran you can't leave anywhere but with iPads and phones you know you leave them anywhere how should you protect this in the iPad okay you know okay I got your question any more questions so um anivia from Somalia says that every time uh we have Ahmed from Nigeria yes if we are Muslim about other Muslims and now the Arabic to the uh are killing men a lot of Muslims this is an ongoing problem that you guys I don't know where you're talking about I'm gonna address this uh friend of ours from Afghanistan and your question inshallah bear with me don't worry I'm not gonna Dodge this question naziha from Kuwait foreign I have a question about praying in the dark is it okay to pray with the the lights dimmed okay so jaber's question and well anivia's question from Somalia she says that every time I want to get back to Allah I feel bad and my heart is hardened by it and I'm unable to do this because of my previous sins what to do my daughter this is from shaytan definitely whenever you try to come back to Allah there's something always blocking you who is blocking you it's not your sins What's blocking you is shaytan because if you manage and penetrate the curtain set by him you will see Allah's Heavenly rewards and blessings for you in this earth and that that awaits you in Paradise inshallah after your death so you are at the fork of the road the more you try to repent the more you try to return to Allah and focus on your prayer the heart that the harder he makes life for you and the harder wish was and Whispers he throws in your heart if you keep on fighting he will increase and if you fight he will increase until you reach a level where he says it's not feasible anymore leave her for few months six months seven months and then come back to her and try to do that over and over again so my advice is to you is keep on the good work keep on trusting Allah keep on supplicating invoking Allah and Allah the almighty would save you and protect you from uh Satan Mrs uh awesome from Pakistan foreign yes for ritual or they just can do it at home okay and the second question is that here in Pakistan at sari time and even at iftar time we recite two dwas like one of which is and the other one if you know it so are these two really recommended or do we have to make a Nia just in our heart that we're going to open the fast and we're going to you know okay so and Sheikh thirdly I would like to request you to come to Pakistan and share your knowledge with us foreign sitting down and secondly as I'll be traveling to Sri Lanka uh can we shorten our prayers while we're there maybe 10 days uh my mom will be there for two months are you going back to home or just visiting just visiting just for a short time but it is eventually your home which we will go back after your contract is over correct uh inshallah yes okay and thirdly is uh because there are some pilgrims who came from Sri Lanka and they used to say me uh that uh three things that seeing the Kaaba and just looking at your mom and just looking at the Quran will give you good deeds up to 80 good days I want to know if this is correct or not because I want to answer back answer to them okay and thirdly when you're performing Umbra uh my friend wanted to know they they cut hair from three places so is it legit or should we shave or trim which one is the okay anything to do okay and I want to request uh please make do I have applied for madin University so that I get accepted inshallah I will ask your questions and make Duran inshallah for you okay let me take once and for all jabber's question and Ahmed from Nigeria it so appears that people are delusional or people have been blinded by the propaganda of Isis Al-Qaeda Boko Haram al-shabab all these terrorist organizations now you always see the same rhetoric whenever they want to introduce something the Muslims are being killed everywhere and we see this and that in children and women are bombarded by the Muslims and the Muslims are subhanallah okay stage two those who are doing these fighting they are transgressing stage three they are kafir because they're killing Muslims so they claim stage four it is permissible for us to attack them and kill them wherever they are and attack their masjids as we have done in the past and kill their children subhanallah this is the ideology of Hawaii now if you go to any person with logic they will tell you as I'm a Saudi and yemenis are our neighbor and the people working with me in the studio half of them are from Yemen and they are excellent people they are righteous people and they are loving people we have no enmity we have no beef between us it was the yemeni legitimate government who called the Saudis and the Coalition as a whole the whole Gulf area and other countries collaborating with them to protect them and to save save them from the houthis from from the Iranian agents who have done what they have done in Iraq they had done what they had done in Syria and Lebanon and now they are attacking Yemen so we came upon the request and if you don't believe this check the media check the yeah many people now they say that they're killing innocent civilians you have a shroud of belief in your heart fear Allah if the bombardments were to be on the civilians you would have heard deaths and fatalities in the tens of thousands not a five or a ten or a hundred and second of all most of the killings are done by the houthis themselves they are the one who are bombarding Adam and they are bombarding and shabbu and all the other cities of Yemen the Saudi Air Raids are only focusing on Missile sites and on Radars on uh weapon Depots Etc so these people and subhanallah he's calling from Afghanistan and he's calling from Nigeria Ahmad is from Nigeria what is Boko Haram doing in Nigeria does anyone with a shroud of intellect in his mind say that what Boko Haram is doing is illegitimate these are barbarians they have nothing to do with Islam kidnapping school girls this is the best you could do don't you have men to to face and to fight with this is what they're doing look at Afghanistan bombarding like cowards suicide bombing and whoever commits suicide whoever detonates a bomb he is going to hell straight away with the grace of Allah because he killed himself it wasn't me with an M16 fighting the enemy Army and they shot me between the eyes and I died as a martyr no it is was I who detonated the bomb and I killed myself sometimes I may kill others sometimes I just blow myself up no one to die with me and doing it in a cafe a cafe or doing it in a school or do we get a Masjid like these infidels do are they worshipers are they believers so actually don't come Cry Wolf to me saying that the Saudis are killing no no they're not killing her don't keep on whining and and wailing be a man and know what is happening the Saudis have been always the most peaceful Nation uh uh around and they only intervened because upon the request of the yemeni people the minute who wants to waste money and you think that Saudis would like to gain forces and to gain lands and invade he said invading Yemen invading Yemen are you in your mind so to make a long story short we have seven minutes I could go on for on on not because I'm a savior it doesn't make a difference to me I'm saying this as a Muslim and I would say this on and on over any similar topic it's not Saudi Arabia that I'm defending they're not paying me one single Halal and if I even Dodge this question they would not throw me in jail like people say well we have freedom to say whatever we want with the grace of Allah and nobody pays us unfortunately for that so be realistic be logical and look at the facts as they are don't be fooled by the rhetoric that the Isis people say the daesh or the uh the Boko Haram or the shabab these are hawarish they give take fear to everyone and try to look for one single reputable respected scholar that backs them up you will not find and still you go after them because you're bloodthirsty because you have no Islam in your heart because you don't know nothing about Islam this is why you're captivated by what they say and what they do may Allah save the Muslims najiba from Bahrain says uh what's the ruling on making uh turning the water in your mouth and inhaling not inhaling pulling the water up your nostrils in wudu what is known as this is part of the Sunnah the prophet in the Hadith said do it while the fasting but do not exaggerate so that you do not fall into suspicion whether I swallowed or I inhaled some water to my stomach or not this is part of the wooden you must do that Islam from the UAE says that the Dua for protection if you send me an email to my website I will send you the Arabic version of it with the grace of Allah anyhow it is then he says about the Quran in the iPad how can we protect it simply by turning it off when it's on this is Quran you cannot enter the lavatories with it when it's off it's only plus and minus it's only zeros and ones so there's no problem while it is turned off uh well I I can't read my own handwriting anyhow the sister from Kuwait says what's the ruling on praying when the light are dimmed in darkness well we have to look for the reason if someone says I find a Tranquility when I turn off the lights and I pray in darkness we would say that this is not part of the Sunnah and it's an innovation and it's not safe while you're praying maybe a cockroach could pass in front of you and make sujud on it maybe a snake or a lizard would come and you are not seeing that so it's best to pray at the night uh with the lights on but if the lights are dimmed because there's someone sleeping in the room for your spouse for example or your child they don't want to wake him up then this is permissible insha Allah Mrs awesome from Pakistan says what's the ruling on erotica seclusion for women it cannot be done neither for women nor for men except in a Masjid in a full-fledged Masjid so prayer Halls does not prayer holds do not do the job it has to be in a full-fledged Masjid you cannot make Attica in your home and she says that we know that there are two duas at the time of iftar and she is mixing up between Dua and intention first of all these duas are not authentic Allah this is not authentic it's a weak Hadith so what is the Dua to be said you have two options the short option take the date and say Bismillah and eat it that's it you broke you fast the second option which is best that the prophet told us Allah that there is an answered supplication for every person who's fasting so just before the adhan goes off the dates are in front of me the food the drink I raise my hands face and start to praise Allah offer salutation to the prophet salaam and ask Allah whatever I need protect the Muslims oh Allah grant them Victory or Allah forgive my sins oh Allah pay off my debts so Allah guide my my children Etc whatever you want ask Allah and he will answer you so there is nothing specific to say at the time of breaking your thought her third uh question was a request to come to Pakistan I tried to do this a couple of times but so many things that prevented me from doing the brothers are uh kindly and generously inviting me over but I'm too scared to tell you the truth it is not that safe and some say that it is safe so inshallah I'll wait until the weather is a little bit better and inshallah try my level best to come and meet the brothers and sisters in Pakistan fayose from Saudi Arabia says what's the ruling for my mom when she's traveling on an airplane to offer to hajjud any person can offer prepared when he goes back to Sri Lanka and I ask him specifically so that I would know is Sri Lanka is his home country or is he or has he migrated to Canada or to Europe and he's just going to Sri Lanka to see his grandparents but he's not intending to live there any longer and he said no this is our home country and after we're expats once our contract contracts are done and over with we will go back to our country in this case you cannot shorten or combine except between Saudi and Sri Lanka uh is he oh yeah he's from Saudi so in between while you're traveling yes you may combine and shorten but once you reach Saudi which you're residing in or once you reach Sri Lanka which is your home town your home country you have to complete his third question was about some pilgrims who come from Sri Lanka and they tell him that looking at your mother looking at the Kaaba looking in the must-have or at the must-have this is a good deed you'll be rewarded for that the cab and your mother this is baseless the Quran if you read in it of course this is a good deed but if you just simply look at the cover and sit there for half an hour looking at the cover this is nonsense it has nothing to do with a good deed at all thirdly or fourthly he says that what's the ruling on some pilgrims when they finish their Roman or Hajj they cut few hairs from three sides of the head this is wrong and this does not do the job you have an option either to shave your head if you're a male or to cut short from all sides that is trimming it this is the Sunnah but to cut few hairs here and a few hairs here and a few years from hairs from the back this is not to true and finally he says that I'm accepted in the Islamic University and I pray to Allah that he chooses the best for you and if there is good for you to study in the Islamic University or in umkura University in Makkah or in jamaatil Imam in Riyadh or NASA or whatever may Allah facilitate that and make it happen to you and to all the students of knowledge who seek Allah's face by what they are doing with this we come to the conclusion of this Hadith may Allah be pleased with them and with this episode tomorrow with the grace of Allah we'll move on to something new and hopefully I'll try my little best to prepare something on the battle of the trench and the lessons that we can learn from that and until we or until that time I leave Beyond for us"
