  "title": "Could AI produce a Surah similar to the Quran?!? #quran #islam #islamic #allah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "She yesterday you made it very clear that the Quran's challenge to produce a single chapter like it is applicable until the day of judgment. Father, I need to understand one more detail. She there are claims on the internet suggesting that since AI can analyze patterns and generate text, it might produce something similar to a Quranic chapter in Arabic. So she could you please clarify regarding this? Yeah, Fahim. Fahim, tell me tell me please. Do you believe in Allah's words or in AI? I believe in Allah's words. That's why I never tried. So why are you asking? It's very weird when you believe unconditionally, unequivocally that Quran is the word of Allah. The challenge of Allah stands till the day of judgment. And you believe that no one can violate or stand up to such a challenge. And then you ask me, but what if AI produces something? We know they have the patterns and they have this. And are you doubting? If yes, then you're not a Muslim. If you doubt that someone can produce a verse or a chapter similar to the Quran in its majestic and miraculous form, you're not a Muslim. It's a no-brainer. And the funny thing is people are offended when people come whether they're reverts or non-reverts and they whisper they they air their doubts and whispers and you ask them do you doubt the Quran or the authenticity of the hadith or you know that this is from Allah and from the prophet you still have doubt in it you're challenging it you don't accept it this is kufur they're offended by the hell with them. So be careful. Why are you bringing these topics? Either you believe then you should say you should say or you don't believe then you should have a counseling session onetoone not on public TV where you tell everybody that I don't know because this is unfortunately kufur"
