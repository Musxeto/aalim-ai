  "title": "Giving 1 Udhiya(Qurbani) for the Prophet, 1 for Ummah, 1 for Mother, 1 for Father etc- Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Navid says in the subcontinent it is very common that we do one over here for the whole Ummah plus one for the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu wasallam and one for our deceased mother and one for the deceased father grandparents etc is this permissible or an innovation that's a good question so is it an innovation or not how do we know how can we determine whether this act is an innovation or not in salat some people put their hands under their belly some just about over the belly some on the chest if I come tomorrow and say well I hate to do this in salat is much better because it's much closer to allah azza wajal one says is this an innovation or not how do I know whether it's an innovation or not is it Simon Says no it is by going back to the books of Sunna the description of the prophets prayer is a lot of Salaam and watch learn and investigate did the Prophet ever do such a thing a little awesome dancers know he used to put the right on the left on the chest this is what were 1,100 may Allah be pleased with him told us then anything else any form that was not mentioned in the sooner it will become an innovation so let us go back to the old here what was the Sunnah of the Prophet what was the way of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam in performing Odinga well we know that he sacrificed two healthy fat big Rams and he said one is on behalf of me and my family and the other one is on behalf of my Ummah so we know that he did one for his self for himself and his family question number one did he perform a third one on behalf of his beloved wife Khadija who passed away in Mecca answer's no on behalf of his beloved uncle Hamza no on behalf of any of the deceased not that we know of okay let's go to Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali had they ever slaughtered or sacrificed anything on behalf of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam whom they loved the most after he passed away the answer is there's not a single authentic hadith on this topic no they did not do this and they did not offer anything for the deceased hmm did any of them may Allah be pleased with them all offer a sacrifice for the whole Ummah like the Prophet did with the second Ram there is no that's strange if the Prophet had done it why didn't they do it well because the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did it on behalf of his ummah being the messenger of allah azza wajal we nowadays cannot do this we cannot slaughter one sheep and say oh Allah this is for on behalf of the whole Ummah so the whole the whole Ummah is exempted from sacrificing this is not valid but this was something that the Prophet was privileged without his salat wa salam so that this sacrifice would suffice for those who were poor of his ummah who those who were unable to slaughter from his ummah so in short it is an innovation to slaughter a sheep on behalf of the ummah it is an innovation to slaughter a sheep on behalf of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam now slaughtering a sheep or offering a sacrifice on B half of the deceased this is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion that it is permissible but it is not part of the Sunna meaning that when I offered my sacrifice which is one sheep I include in my intention when I'm doing this that my late father my grandfather my aunt my uncle are included in it there's no problem no matter how many there are because this is the sunnah to include whomever lives under your roof and eats from your kitchen among the living in your one sacrifice and to include those who had died from your loved ones and allah social knows best"
