  "title": "Labelling people as kafir & how to give Dawah 2 people who dont pray or practice Islam-Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "so Asif is asking about the people they know when they do not pray and they get married what is the appropriate way to give them an hour first of all my friend you have to be careful by not labeling others to be disbelievers just simply because you have not seen them pray and this is an issue that a lot of the Muslims fall in the traps of Shaytan because of it he doesn't pray and the Prophet said that is awesome who does not pray is a kafir the limit between us and them is or the difference between us and them is prayer who does not pray is a kafir so they said okay one plus one equals two so this person is a kafir wrong there is a theoretical way of dealing with none well with people who do not pray and there is a practical way of dealing with them meaning in theory yes anyone who does not pray is a kafir full stop you don't have to elaborate a lot because this is mentioned in the Quran in clear ayahs and it's mentioned in the Sunnah and clear hadith so definitely a person who does not praise is a kafir however on the practical end you cannot simply fit this label to anyone unless the conditions are fulfilled and there are no obstacles and this it goes with everything that we need to give takfeer accordingly we have to ensure that the conditions are fulfilled yeah sure I did I never seen him pray maybe he prays when you are away when you are in the message he prays home maybe he prays when you are in the toilet you never know so the conditions among them is that he testifies against himself that he doesn't pray not a single rat ha and he knows that it is something that nullifies Islam he doesn't want to create obstacles he's not forced not to pray he's not ignorant of the ruling of not praying he is not forgetful meaning that he remembers but he doesn't want to pray etc so the practical part of it is difficult to implement and this is why we don't see people saying hey don't pray upon my deceased father funeral prayer because he did not pray no one says this and even if one says this we said how do you know that he did not pray you were not with him 24/7 maybe he prayed when you were not aware and there are so many consequences that follow because if you don't pray then you do not inherit him and you have no share in his wealth because he's a kafir and you're Muslim and he's not to be buried in a Muslim cemetery etc so this is very tricky ah he now how to give dower begin by the basics assume that they're Muslims and approach them by encouraging them focusing on the priorities so if I go to my relatives house to call him to Islam or rather to ask him to come and pray with me in the Masjid but I see a small statue of Buddha or Krishna or RAM or whatever they call them I would not ask him to come and pray because his toe heat is not valid anymore I have to call him to Islam and show him that this is shirk and that there is no God worthy of being worshipped but Allah although he's putting it as a decoration this decoration means he's acknowledging that this is a false god and he's praising that God by putting it in the living room or in the guest room then I move on see I have to set my priorities I do not go to someone who does not pray a single prayer and I tell him how he you must clip your nails because this is against the fitrah against the sundown I don't go to someone who is drinking and the bottle of scotch scotch is in front of him and his eyes are red and it's totally wasted and playing with his six-shooter with his revolver and he's wasted and I come to him and I say you have to pray and fear Allah Azza WA JAL he will shoot me so you have to prioritize your Dawa you have to use wisdom diplomacy and always think of the consequences if I if I say this would it work would it have a good impact or a negative impact and you have to act accordingly of course you are the doctor and they are the patient so you always have to tolerate that ignorant do not be provoked if they reject what you say to them or if they make fun of you or ridicule it be patient be tolerant hope for the best look for the consequences as usual if you're the kind of person who is impulsive and goes into rage the minute someone answers him back then he you're in the wrong business stay away from people and let them stay away from your harm but if you are doing it for the sake of Allah you're willing to tolerate whatever harm comes to you from it for the sake of Allah then insha Allah you are doing a good job"
