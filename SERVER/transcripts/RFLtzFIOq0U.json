  "transcript": "so I have a question about um I signed up for a phone contract uh for a survey and they said that if I break a contract within 12 months they're going to charge me a certain amount of money so when I broke the contract I gave them the money and after a while they called me and returned the money there I don't hold them anything the employee called me so I said are you sure I called them several times and they responded the money then after few months they started calling me that I hold their money and I said but I paid the money and you told me that I didn't you refunded the money to me so I decided not to pay am I sinful if I don't pay that amount of money for no you're not sinful because this is the mistake of the employee who refunded you the money and he's the one who's obliged to pay for his mistake"
