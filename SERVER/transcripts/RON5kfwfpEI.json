  "title": "Is saying 'I will never do that sin again' considered to be a Vow? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "pity Matt says when I depend from a sin I say something like I will never do it again because I read one must resolve to never do the sin again is that a promise or an oath I intentionally don't say I promise or something similar because I'm not sure if I can keep the promise if I do the sin again do I break my promise and that I had made to Allah as I said answer is no this is not a promise this is not an oath this is not a vow because it was neither verbally stated and you did not have the intention in your heart to do it so if you go to back to that sin you are sinful for that sin but there is no explanation for that and allah azzawajal knows best this"
