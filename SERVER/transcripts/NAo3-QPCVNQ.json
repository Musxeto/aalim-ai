  "title": "Going from one city or country to another, what time do I break my fast? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Myesha says if at the time of suhoor i'm in one city and for a job if at the time of iftar i stay in another city then for breaking fast which city time should I follow as in Bangladesh time schedule varies from one city to the other again this is answered by knowledge as an individual my name is Assam as an individual when do I a frame from eating and when do I break my fast regardless of the country I'm in Allah tells me in the Quran that when I can distinguish between the white thread the break of dawn from the black thread which is the whole night then I have to refrain this is for time so whether I am in Bangladesh or in Stockholm or in Djibouti whether I'm on the ground or in the plane the moment I can see the fire breaking this is when I refrain regardless of my location regardless of my place of destination or my departure also when the Sun sets this is the time I break my fast whether I'm in Dhaka or in Kerala or in Egypt Cairo it has no difference me and the Sun is all what counts the Sun sets wherever I am and at sea or in air this is when I break my fast so I have to see it visually or at least estimate because sometimes I cannot see the break of dawn when I'm traveling to the west and the East is at my back in the airplane so I have to try my level best to distinguish once it is distinguished I have to stop I hope this answers your question"
