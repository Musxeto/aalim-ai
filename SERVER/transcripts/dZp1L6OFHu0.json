  "transcript": "sir I have a question I said there are many couples who walk summer in Seaside not to have children ever in their life they say that they are happy without that and doesn't need children the unit's permanent or tantor in the track as well for no sure I reason they say that having children is not fun at all so it's up to us we want or don't want so my question is will they be sinful for having this intention what will have children ever and then they use precautions for that as well then they'll be sinful and accountable for that and will those also be sinful who give advice to such couples get actual life so I live as we want if you don't want it's okay so I would like your guidance about this matter any chance ok any more questions ok I'll answer in Charlotte Kyle Tom says that what is the ruling on a couple who get married and they agree among themselves though they have no obstacles nothing to prevent them from having children and reproducing and they agree not to have any children they have justifications that it's difficult we don't want to whatever so what's the ruling on that and what's the ruling on people who advise them of such things first of all to agree not to have children goes against the reason of getting married getting married is not only for sexual pleasure but rather to also reproduce and this is why Allah made marriage for humans so that they can reproduce and have children and life would go on the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam said marry the woman who is kind who is productive or fertile because I will boast with my followers and Ummah on the day of judgment among the other prophets and messengers that I have the biggest followers so the Prophet is telling us to marry a woman that can give birth to children and she's fertile want to say how would I know she take her for a test drive ha ha ha no this is not what has meant the scholars say that you know if a woman is most likely to be fertile by her sisters by her family so if she has like five six sisters and they all have children the most likelihood is that she is also like them but if she has three or four barren sisters or Allah did not bless them with children so you might be hesitant look somewhere else but also the Prophet as-salaam was approached by one of his companions and his companions said to him all prophet of Allah I want to marry a woman but she does not give she cannot conceive most likely she got married once twice before and she failed to conceive and this is not within her reach it is not something wrong with her this is how Allah created her so she's not she's not to be blamed to that for that so the Prophet said Allison do not marry her and the man repeated it and he said do not marry her and the man repeated for the third time the woman is a bombshell probably or from a good lineage or rich there is something drawing him to marry her so the Prophet Allah Susan stated that you have to marry a woman who is fertile and can give birth to children this is the essence of marriage and hence scholars say that agreeing to such a condition is invalid in marriage and a man or a woman must not abide by it because it is sinful it goes against Allah's religion so you're choosing something out of your own mind and whims and it is against what Allah has prescribed for us those who advise them not to have children forever as they are as simple as they are now there is a difference between not having children forever or someone saying to me listen sure I'm gonna get married but the next three years we don't have want to have children because I'm doing my PhD because she is trying to finish her medical school what there is a reason a legitimate reason but to come and say I don't want to have children at all and this happens to a lot of the men who wants to marry a second wife so they make it a condition I have from my first wife children but for the second wife I said listen I'll marry you on the condition that you don't bear children this is how long in this condition is void and hence that is sinful may allah azzawajal guide muslims back to Islam"
