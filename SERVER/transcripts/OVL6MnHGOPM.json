  "transcript": "do Muslims and Christians worship the same God of course but their understanding of Allah is distorted because we believe in Allah we believe in Allah subhanahu waala who does not beget and is not begotten they believe that has a son has a wife subh and they attribute to him so many negative things but they believe he is the creator the provider the sustainer and any Christian Unfortunately they don't think they're blind followers they say Jesus Christ is the Son of God so okay when did he come to existence 2,000 BC how what are we 20 24 okay 20 24 years ago okay 20 25 years where was he huh where was Jesus 20 25 years ago um he wasn't oh so he came to existence 20 2, 24 years ago before that he was not existing it cannot be a God that EX exists after not being existed so when someone says to you can God create another God yes or no no no this is a stupid question it's not to be answered why because if I say no they would say ah God cannot create and if I said yes he said okay then God can be created so damn if you do damn if you don't you do not entertain such impossible question one of the criteria of being a God is that you are there you do not all of a sudden exist this is why Allah is the first without a beginning and the last without an end nothing was before Allah he was always there subhah wa tala and nothing with him so when you say that Jesus came to existence 224 years ago he cannot be a god number one number two when they say that Jesus is God they said okay what did he create nothing no one on earth says there is a Creator other than Allah not even could not say I create Nam could not say I create nud said I give life and death how he brought two prisoners from the prison sentenced to death the first one he shot him between the eyes did see I killed him the second one he said I set you free see I gave him life this is this is the most he could do he said but okay anyone on Earth since Allah created this universe did anyone claim to be able to create not a single being only Allah but they don't see this they don't open their eyes to know that only God can create and if Jesus was God he could create he could not do anything sallai so yes we do worship the same God and this is why we follow the scriptures and they're called we can marry their women whether Jews or Christians we can eat whatever meat they slaughter and we can consider this to be Halal for us this is differentiating them from others and Allah Knows Best"
