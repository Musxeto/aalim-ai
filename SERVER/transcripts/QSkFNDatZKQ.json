  "transcript": "it was the prophet who identified what is when he said is to mention your brother with something he hates so when one of the companions objected and said what what about if my brother is as I have mentioned him so I said he's short and fat and he is short and fat I said he is stingy and he's very stingy the prophet said this is this is backbiting when you say what is accurately describing him which he hates people to delegate among themselves in his absence but if you you accused him of something that is not in him this is slandering you have slandered him which is a combination of and lying which is even worse so it doesn't matter islamically whether he's a government official or not it's the same sin worldly it matters because he's going to throw throw you in jail he's going to take your money he's going to ex trite you out of the com the country he would do evil things he's an official what you crazy so what is the benefit of it there is no benefit except that it cools your heart a little bit when you vent when he oh this ruler did this did that me Allah curse him me Allah break him me Allah then what is is there anything going to change nothing only thing that will change is the amount of hatred of you created in people's hearts towards him which is not beneficial believing in the day of judgment this man will suffer so this is not permissible now becomes permissible in Necessities someone who is going to a scholar quote unquote who's not a scholar who's deviant who's a man of innovation who has corrupt AA and the brother is naive he doesn't know so I have to go up and and tell him a this guy is a deviant uh uh innovator he has corrupt AA don't go to him the brother said don't back bite so no this is not backbiting this is to clarify and to warn similarly someone comes to me and says uh brother so and so has proposed to my sister do you think we should give him in marriage and I know the brother is a womanizer till date or he does drugs or he is having something that would not make people want to give him in marriage till date now I have the option to say a if you trust me don't give him in marriage but I will not expose him because he does things in secrecy I cannot expose him and tell you he's a junkie or he does drugs or he does this and that I can't but if you trust me if he insists and there is no other way around to warn him except to expose him I have to because he's coming to ask in Sunnah one of the female companions came to the prophet and said to him two men propose to me mu sufan and Abu J which one should I choose what did the prophet say said as for mua he's Stone broke he doesn't have money as for Abu jaham he's a person who does not leave the stick from his shoulder which means in Arabic either he beats women or he's a frequent traveler with the stick he puts his clothes in his bags and he like a backpack and he travels a lot so he wouldn't be a very good husband when he travels a lot but I suggest that you marry us and she married him and she was very happy with him so the prophet exposed someone comes to ask you I'm going into partnership there's a joy venture between me and brother Abdullah and he say w brother Abdullah deals in riba brother Abdullah already cheated Six Brothers before you he took their money and fled and I said I will not backbite him oh the brother will be the seventh no you have to expose you have to say so these things you have to be careful of sometimes it is not backbiting if it's a form of identification so do you know sheim uh which one the one with the big nose oh yeah I know he's he's funny man okay I have to do something about this is a form of identification do you know Ahmed yeah the short man no no I'm talking about the tall guy okay I know him you know abdah that the fat one this is not to back by this is to identify and this is found all the books ofi and so on they describe people in the Hadith of the Salah when the man said oh prophet of Allah is the prayer shortened into two or you forgot and his name was nicknamed as the man with the two long arms because he had two long arms so this Propet said what did say he described him of having to the the man did not say she you hurt me you insulted me by calling me this name no this is a form of identification and it's pretty uh uh normal inshallah and I hope this answers your question"
