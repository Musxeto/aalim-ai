  "title": "Allahumma innaka afuwan ... will Allah completely erase our sins if we say this dua? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "gotcha if we ask Allah to Pardon Us by saying uh will our sins be like like completely erased like it was never there because I heard because I know that if we actually for forgiveness that he will forgive us but uh on the day judgment we'll still see our sins but I also heard that if we ask all to Pardon Us by saying that Dua that like our sin will be like it never existed like it will even be there is this true is that called um forgives the sins for whomever asks for forgiveness but major sins require repentance so the Dua itself is not sufficient it has to be accompanied by repentance remorse uh quitting the sins pledging not to do them again asking Allah for forgiveness it's a whole package deal but minor sins yes the Dua would be sufficient inshallah whether you will be shown your sins on the day of judgment or not despite the fact that you were forgiven this is the norm each and every one of us even if he repented and sought Allah's forgiveness must be shown his sins and must acknowledge them so that he would see Allah's favors upon him on the day of judgment you had done something wrong and there are consequences yes you sought Allah's forgiveness Allah forgave you but still Allah has to show you these sins so that you would appreciate Allah's forgiveness upon you that only difference is that Allah conceals you from everyone else so no one knows that Allah is showing you your sins and that you had committed these sins in the past so it's between you and him and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
