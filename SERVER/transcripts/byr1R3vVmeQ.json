  "title": "Can we watch New Year's Fireworks without celebrating or participating #islam #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she my uh question is that uh are we sinful for watching New Year's Eve fireworks without any intention of celebrating it because like my family goes out and watches the fireworks but we do not celebrate such events or engage in such parties or anything like that it's an issue of dispute some would say there is no sin I'm just enjoying the colorful display of fireworks and I'm enjoying the weather and it looks nice and that's it others say well actually these fireworks are the result of a Haram celebration Muslims do not celebrate the new year and they don't imitate the disbelievers as the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam had warned us 15 centuries ago when he said you will follow the footsteps of those before you even if it's a handspan even if they enter a lezard's hole you will follow them and enter it so the people ask who are those before us oh Prophet Alam are they the Jews and the Christians and the proph Prophet astonishingly said to them who then who else then meaning that they are the Jews and the Christians and nowadays we see so-called quote unquote Muslims trying to be moderate trying to be civil and they imitate the disbelievers in every thing they do to the extent that you may find someone's name is Abdallah or Muhammad or ABD Rahman Muslim having a Christmas tree in his house duh you may find Muslims Gathering their family on New Year's Eve and celebrating you might find couples or families doing the countdown 5 4 3 2 one for midnight what else is left hang across maybe I don't know so definitely I would my own personal view is a Muslim should prevent his family himself from admiring such rituals that would soften his heart and probably introduce elements of hypocrisy without him knowing it creeping into his heart little by little until he starts to question Islamic values until he starts to wonder why don't we have similar ilar things like they do look at our sheh when he comes on the Friday sermon he has a long beard and he's wearing his um isamic dress and he shouts on the pulpit the the the day of judgment and you will all go to hell this is what they say but when we go to a church and we see the preacher wearing a two or three piece suit with a tie and clean shaven he looks nice and all the colored uh uh windows and know these clean places and the man playing the organ and they chant and dance this is cool man unlike what our our s our Muslim imams are doing Subhan Allah look at the hypocrisy this is what we are inserting in our children's Hearts without us knowing it and this is what a Muslim must be really careful of we have to build our Islamic identity she give me a break my Islamic identity is going to be affected by watching the fireworks it might be better safe than sorry but as I said it's an issue of dispute some would say it's okay me personally I would never ever go or be seen in a place where people just go by the lake and look let alone pay 400 or 500 uh um Euros or or Dirham or or dollars to get a table and drink coffee and watch it me Allah protect us all"
