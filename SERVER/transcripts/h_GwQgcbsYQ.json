  "transcript": "foreign chapter 90 supplication said to one who has offered you some of his wealth somebody offers you something and you want to decline when people offer you something they expect you to accept declining and refusing may hurt their feelings so in the sunnah abdul rahmani bin auf may allah be pleased with him when he migrated to medina offered him half of his wealth and offered him to divorce one of his wives so that he could marry her why would he do such a thing because when sad when abdulrahman came to medina the prophet al-islam made him a brother of sad ibn so sad wanted to share with him as a real brother whatever he has anticipating the reward from allah azzawajal and we know abraham is one of the 10 heaven bound so he's one of the top 10 ranked in islam he offered this to his brother abdulrahman what did abdulrahman do if it was one of us sure things anything freebie would be accepted no abdul rahman said to him for you your family and wealth rather direct me to the market i'm gonna do some transactions and make money and in no time he became one of the millionaires of the companions because allah made him rich due to the richness of his soul so this is what you say when someone offers you something and you decline barack anything that would put comfort and in his heart chapter 91 supplication said to the debtor when his debt is settled if somebody lends me money and after a month i go and pay him back should i just send him a check should i send him a deposit in his bank account no the sunnah is to do what the prophet did when one of the companions lent him money and then the prophet al-islam paid him back what did he say to him the prophet said to him may allah bless for you your family and wealth surely commendation and payment are the reward for alone commendation expressing your gratitude and paying back on time is what has to be done after borrowing money from a person it was have to after uh um paying a person back as a reward to show your gratitude and also to pay on time chapter 92 supplication for fear of shirk what is to be said when we are afraid of shirk first of all shirk is divided into two types major gran shirk that nullifies islam and takes a person out of the fold of islam and if he dies in that state he will be in hell fire for eternity and minor and minor shirk is below major shirk but above major sins so it's a very critical sin if a person falls in minor what should he say can you give us example of minor shirk showing off swearing by other than allah using some words that associate others with allah like what allah wills and you this is minor shirk so when someone falls into it what should one say the prophet taught this allah to abu bakr and he said say when you're fearful of this shirk o allah i take refuge in you lest i should commit shirk with you knowingly and i seek your forgiveness for what i do unknowingly beautiful words stating that i seek refuge from falling into shirk while knowing it but sometimes i may do things that i'm not aware of so i ask you to forgive such things and remember this was taught to abu bakr may allah be pleased with him ranked number one in the ummah of the muslims because the prophet used to fear allah because it was unnoticeable so he feared it most for his ummah that they may fall in it without them knowing it and that's why he emphasized so many times the dangers of it in addition to teaching us what we should say to avoid it is muhammad [Music] foreign"
