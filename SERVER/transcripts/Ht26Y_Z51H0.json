  "transcript": "m alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters and Islam through the previous programs we talked about the suffering that the Muslims faced in the early stages of Islam unfortunately this suffering reached to a limit that there had to be a way out because the pagans could not have it their way with the Muslims and the Muslims would not be able to practice the religion in peace so something had to take place at that stage our Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam instructed his companions to migrate to another country in another continent simply to worship Allah alone and to be free to do that and it's not a very difficult thing to do Muslims believe that freedom of religion freedom of belief should be secured for all and this is exactly what was manifested by the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he went to Medina he allowed the Jews the Christians to worship as they pleased this is their faith this is their religion and they had all the all the right to do so Muslims at the time of the pagans wanted the same thing but yet they were deprived from having it and that that was why the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam told them to migrate to ABIA which was to the coast of Arabia west of Arabia and they had to sail there and at the beginning only a small group of Muslims went there there were 12 men with four women of course these four women had their husbands among the 12 men so they had their M no one was traveling without a m I have two question okay why uh to this to this country specifically okay you want to give me the second question or should I answer this first and the second question uh why in this time not before or after okay firstly the prophet Sall Ali wasallam knew exactly what was going on around him which also indicates and teaches us that a Muslim should be aware of what's happening around him yeah it is not enough for a Muslim to sit idly not knowing about the events that are taking place around him a Muslim it's not a must but it is it a lot of value prer yes it adds a lot of value when I talk to non-muslims and tell them that I know what is happening in the in in their countries I know about what FEMA did with with the the hurricane and what uh this country did with that I have knowledge about it it adds value to know and it is appealing to them that I know things about them the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam has great knowledge of what's going on around him though he was illiterate he told them go to ABIA and he justified this by saying there is a ruler that people are not treated unjustly in his presence so if you go there no one can harm you or stop you from worshiping Allah because the king is fair and just they they took a boat and they went there as for your second question why this timing it is something that is from Allah did Allah order well we don't of course the prophet does not do anything without the orders of Allah and we believe that the Muslims tolerated enough to the extent that they've reached their Peak so they had to depressurize what was happening to them okay the prophet am was tortured and was persecuted like them why didn't he migrated with them why didn't he migrate like them as we said earlier the prophet s wasallam was not punished and tortured like they were were tortured the prophet s wasallam had his tribe had Abu Talib to protect him the worst that they done to him was for example once he was prostrating praying in the in the Masid in the Kaaba yes he was prostrate prostrating so a group of pagans said okay who among you would go to the house of so and so who slaughtered a camel this morning and come to the intestines of the camel to the guts and the filth and bring it and put it on top of his back while he's frustrating and the worst of them all went and brought this and while the prophet was pring he put it on his back the prophet did not move s he was praying for Allah now imagine this filth and dirt on your back and for what what was your crime nothing nothing you just praying for Allah is this a crime that you should punish me for and is this what our brothers facing from the superpowers because they say ill what did the people in Muslim countries that have been oppressed attacked what's their crime their only crime is that they are Muslims the prophet did not move until someone and that was abdah m in some narrations went and the Muslims did not move because anyone would have that would have moved would have been killed instantly you cannot play with they're not the mafia they're even worse you know they are tyrants they are strong people that have no compromise no heart no feelings Abdullah Mas went to Fatima who was a child of six or seven years old and told her about what's happening she came immediately very young little child cleaned the back of her father so that to allow him to raise his head and then looked at them and started swearing at them one by one this little child this Brave little child and the minute the prophet wasallam concluded his prayer he stood up and he raised his hands and he started praying to Allah in a loud voice and the pagans though were though they were pagans they hated anyone praying to Allah because they knew if it was was in Haram and he is praying to Allah that Allah will answer he he was praying against them I'll tell you what he said yeah he raised his hands and said oh Allah you are my protector I I want you I pray to you that you take care of and he started naming people by name and Abdullah Mas who was present at the time said by Allah I've seen each and everyone that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prayed against to what I say I saw everyone that he prayed against killed on the Battle of bad and they are the people that the prophet sallallah Al wasallam asked his companions to throw their bodies in a well and bury them and he spoke to them after being killed in battle he told them we have found and uh uh seen what Allah has promised us have you seen what Allah promised you and Omar came to him and said prophet of Allah they're dead how you you're talking to dead people he said I know they're dead but Allah made them hear what I see what what I say as form of punishment this was one form of punishment that the prophet or tortured faced the other one was when some of the mus it was said and and some say Abu jahal came and grabbed the Prophet wasam by the neck and was put in him and telling him stop whatever you're doing this don't do this don't call people to Islam and the only one who came to defend him was Abu Bakr saying that come on people do you want to kill a man simply just because he says and they let him go the prophet s wasallam was they triy to make life difficult for him in the sense that they would put obstacles in his way he would would go out of his house and find trash in front of his house and he would say come on people of qur is this a way of living what are you doing is this a way to treat your neighbor and he would remove it and the following day he would find it he was not physically abused in the sense that nobody hit him although they wanted to but they couldn't there were so many incidents that Abu jahel went to beat him with his sword with his bow and whenever he wanted to do this something would come up and prevent him in so many cases they told him uh you wanted to be the prophet s wasam why didn't you do that he said by God I couldn't there was this big camel opening his mouth if I just got Clos he would have got my head off yeah and no nothing was there and the prophet told him that this was an angel ready to attack him the minute he moves and one incident he also wanted to attack the prophet and then Allah sent fire to him and he had to stay away and the comp his companions looked at him and laugh said what are you doing what are you running off said there is huge fire and this was made by Allah to protect his messenger sah alai wasam so she also I think that Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam like the rest of the prophet and Messengers may peace and blessings be upon them all uh can never migrate without Allah's permission or leave yes this is true but again don't be like no no no this is uh true that he cannot do anything without the permission of Allah but also the companions did not do anything without the permission of the Prophet sallam so he allowed them to go which means that if allowed him to go he would have went to leave yes but imagine what would happen if the prophet left and all the Muslims are stranded behind him that wouldn't be fair and that is why the prophet wasallam was among the very last to migr to Medina after all his companions has had gone and uh uh uh formulated a Muslim uh uh Nation I think we have a short break so stay tuned inshallah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day our

email for you to write to talk at hud. TV so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you assalam alaykum and welcome back the first migration took place on the fifth year of the beginning of Islam and it was 12 men plus four women who migrated they went to the coast of the Red Sea and got a boat for half a dinar that took them to the other coast and they lived for a very short period of time in abisinia in Africa yeah and no one ever talked to them or asked them to do something they didn't want to do to their astonishment they heard that the the pagans were in a truce with the Muslims and they've allowed the Muslims to worship Allah freely and so they believed what they had heard and they went back to Mecca to find out that all what they have heard was a bunch of lies and this teaches us that gossips are forbidden in Islam because they have more harm than good good yes it also teaches us that our responsibilities as Muslims are not to spread whatever we hear and not to be a relay station collecting all the data and sending it back again without filtering it Allah tells us about the pagans who said that the angels are the daughters of Allah so they made the Angels daughters females of Allah Allah says in the Holy Quran had they witnessed their creation oh you pagans did you see me create them Angels so that you can claim that they are uh uh females by Allah your witness or your testimony will be written down and on the day of judgment each one of you will be asked this is a very strong message from the Holy Quran that teaches us never ever relay whatever you hear without authenticating it it's not enough to say it's hearsay I heard someone say blah blah blah and I'm just conveying what I heard this is unacceptable in Islam you are part of the process if it's a lie you are a liar and you will be punished on the day of judgment if it's true then there's no harm done but the majority majority speaking in the ma in the majority of cases people just relay whatever they hear and this by itself is a burden by the way one one doesn't carry the message as it is definitely adds some little words this is true but bit by bit bit by bit Everyone by transforming it or or or or saying it to someone he adds few spices to it and him and this other one giving it to a third one they put some salt to it the third one gives it to the fourth puts some uh uh sauce to it and then it's a whole new recipe yeah the Muslims who were in ABIA went back to find out that it was not as they heard yeah okay I have a question about immigration if if uh if I'm a Muslim in a non-muslim country I um I feel oppression and depression and I can establish My Religion the should the way it should be is it a must on me to migrate to another country to a Muslim country and relocate there stay the rest of my life there or what should they do the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said after after conquering Mecca there is no migration after conquering Mecca this was said to stop people from leaving Mecca to Medina or to leave their cities to Medina after migration as the whole Arabia was under the rule of Islam so migration is over but in particular cases if a person is unable to practice his religion if he is being oppressed if he prays or if he's being prosecuted for fasting or for reading the Quran as was the case in the Soviet blocks uh 20 or or more years ago then the answer would be yes it is obligatory for him to migrate to a country where he can practice his Rel religion freely it it may not be a Muslim country as unfortunately the Muslims themselves are getting far away from their religion instead of getting closer because we have these political uh games going on and one cannot live in a Muslim country freely at sometimes it it is easier to go to a non-muslim country and get a c citizenship there that rather than in a Muslim country so if this is the case yes you may travel you may immigrate migrate from that country where you're being oppressed because of your religion to another country where you can practice Islam freely but nowadays I don't see any country where Muslims are under oppression under oppression I I believe that alhamdulillah Islam is spread worldwide even in Palestine I ask Allah and pray to him that it is liberated so that we can all go and pray in B even Palestine people still are able to pray to fast to practice the religion with some limitations and with the oppression of the Jews but mainly speaking alhamdulillah the whole universe you can practice your religion without being oppressed okay what what about traveling to a non-muslim country just for trading for another purpose for another purpose other than spreading daa or Islam there is no problem in traveling to other countries especially to non-muslim countries providing that there is a legit legitimate reason behind that such as trading seeking knowledge studying medication uh providing there's a legitimate reason second condition that you have a degree of piy and virtue in you that prevents you from answering the Temptations there yeah because if you don't have this amount of piy and and and virtue you are susceptible to fall into sin and the third condition would be that you would have a sufficient amount of knowledge that constitutes a barrier between the bad doubts and thoughts of other religions so you are immune from being affected from these uh doubts and ideas with these three conditions fulfilled Scholars say you may travel to work uh to live or to uh uh uh do whatever you want to any non-muslim country yes going back to the Hijra once the Muslims came back this meant that they had to go again but the first group were like the scouts for the Muslims so they came back they found out that the gossip they heard was a complete lie yeah so they told the prophet Sall wasallam that the country they went to was a safe environment for them to practice ISL again the prophet Salli wasallam encouraged his followers to get ready to migrate to ABIA this time the number grew and about 100 plus Muslim men and women with the children got ready to travel to abisinia and so they did they went there led by aan and Jab Abu Talib and they stayed in ABIA practicing their religion talk uh teaching each other and reading the Quran worshiping Allah without anybody interrupting or interfering with what they were doing it was a new life yet it was not that easy because they were in a strange country they didn't look like the locals they didn't speak the language of the locals and they didn't practice the religion of the locals so they were completely out of place but still it was far better than worshiping Allah Asel in Mecca under oppression it's another kind of testing definitely it is a different kind of testing and a difficult one as as well but they did not have any other solution they tried their best they tried to call their people with the good word they tried to tolerate they tried to ignore the ignorance they tried to conceal whatever they had without showing it to them yet the pagans insisted on finding what they were preaching and why so they did not leave them any space or room to maneuver the only choice they had was to flee the country and at the time the most suitable place was ABIA ABIA was ruled by this is his name but the position was called anashi yeah it's like Caesar or the Zar or the hercus and so on so anashi was at first deprived of his throne because his father who was the king of Absa was assassinated by his brother so he his and and uh his uncle took a Nashi and sold him as a slave and who worked as a shepherd and he assumed his position as the king of abenia yeah and he came on ruling until he was close to die and he looked at his sons and all of them were you know none of them was wory of fit enough to rule so he didn't know what to do and then he died so the people started choosing his kids but none of them was fit to rule so they looked for who was a shepherd and they brought him and they put him on the throne and put the crown back on his head and he ruled ABIA to be a safe haven for the Muslims what did the Muslims do inshallah this will be our topic next time we meet and until then m"
