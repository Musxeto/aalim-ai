  "transcript": "about washing the feet in order to wear the socks now the scenario she gave is that her husband from the morning he was he made his Woodill normal wash his feet and wore his socks we know that he has 48 hours to wipe over his socks without any problem so when he came back home let's assume before Asia he wanted to make woudl but he forgot and he made his Woodill he took off his socks and he forgot to wash his feet and he went out of the bathroom wore the socks again and went to the Machine and remember that the gates of the message that he did not wash his feet so she says can he goes to the bathroom of the Masjid and wash his feet or can he wipe over the socks the answer is if when he went to the bathroom in his home he nullified his Woodill in this case by taking off the socks he must make a new Woodill with washing the feet but if he went into the bathroom just to renew the water while his wood was intact the original woudl which we made a couple of hours ago and he wiped over his socks he did not break it until he went to the Masjid then in this case taking off the socks and wearing new ones does not affect your would do because the previous will do the original would do which he wiped over his socks was still intact but if he broke his Woodill and took off his socks then in this case it is a must for him to wash his feet and I hope this answers the question we have Rama from Nigeria"
