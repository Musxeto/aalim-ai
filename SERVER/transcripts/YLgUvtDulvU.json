  "transcript": "Tanveer says what's the ruling on making dua in front of the Kaaba or by touching the kiswa of the Kaaba kiswa is the curtains and the cloth that covers the Kaaba is there more possibility of DA getting answered there first of all the place is sacred and for me here in the in the studio to make dua is definitely not like when I am in the harem in the vicinity of the Kaaba in the most sacred spot on earth and I make dua there the sanctuary and the holiness of the place is definitely more gives me more chances to get my door answered and here in the studio or in anywhere else however touching the cloth of the Kaaba or thinking that touching the Kaaba itself would make my dois a more answerable this is an innovation a lot of the Muslims coming from all over the world and when they go to Mecca they make a lot of innovations a lot of them touch the maqam of ibraheem the the glass golden structure there where Ibrahim stood peace be upon him and they seek Baraka they go and they rub the cloth of the Kaaba and they seek Baraka this is totally prohibited and wrong even Abbas the cousin of the Prophet is one of the great scholars of Islam and the great companion was with mahalia even ABI Sufyan may Allah be pleased with him and with his father the Caliph of the Umayyad Halawa and while mahalia was going round the kaaba in power he used to touch all the four corners of the Kaabah so even Abbas told him do not do this he's instructing now we are not to do this the Maya is older him and he's the Caliph he is the ruler Somalia spoke with his logic because he did not know anything else to repel his logic so he said even our best there is nothing of the sacred house that is abandoned all these four corners must not be abandoned he said yes I agree with you but I saw the prophet alayhi salatu salam only wiping on the Yemeni corner and kissing and wiping over the black stone these on these are the only two corners and the rest he did not touch and Allah al totalus told us that we have in our prophet Aslam a good example to follow and to resemble now he immediately refrained because he got the evidence so he did not touch any of the other two corners after that from this we learned that touching and seeking the blessing and the Baraka from anything else it has to be through and channeled through the Sunnah of the Prophet a son otherwise you will be committing a sin and innovation so I hope this answers your question"
