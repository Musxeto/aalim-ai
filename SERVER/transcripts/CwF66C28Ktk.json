  "transcript": "um living in a non-muslim country do I have to read and check the ingredients to see if it's Halal when I go to Food Shops to buy food that are non meat usually no you don't have to because as long as it's not meat that you're buying the chances and the possibility of it including something that is Haram is quite negligible any rare but this is something you have to be the judge of and you have to weigh the pros and cons if you know that 99% of the ingredients of such uh cans or or containers or food U does not have anything Haram in it why bother reading it but if you know that yes there is a huge possibility of it including pork or uh the the the likes of it then you have to go through it"
