  "title": "Can we combine multiple intentions in a form of worship (fasting or prayers....)? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so sheikh well i know that uh combining um multiple intentions for one act where you know a few of the intentions are worldly intentions and the others are intentions to gain reward from allah azzawajal this is not allowed for example in the case of fasting if you are you know trying to have an intention where you want to lose weight and gain reward this is not allowed but not true all of you not true so okay uh okay maybe it's my misconception but but my question actually is can we combine multiple intentions where um all of our intentions uh are aimed to gain reward for allah from allah azzawajal and it's only for one act okay first of all your first assumption is wrong because allah says this was addressed to the pilgrims the companions who went with the prophet sam during hajj and refrained from selling and buying and when people said why don't you sell and buy you're coming from medina to makkah get some goods some merchandise and sell it make profit they said no we are in hajj so allah told them that there is no conflict of interest you can perform hajj and still sell and buy likewise if someone is fasting what's your intention for fasting he says to lose weight okay this is not fasting for allah again what's your intention for fasting he says to please allah azzawajal this is why i'm fasting mondays and thursdays and i discovered that it also helps me to reduce my weight so it's two birds with one stone but my initial intention is for allah this is valid no problem in that thirdly if you want to combine multiple intentions in a form of worship that's permissible to do such as praying two raka's with the intention of surnatal wudu and masjid and the sunnah before fajr prayer all of this is valid in these two raka's and allah knows best"
