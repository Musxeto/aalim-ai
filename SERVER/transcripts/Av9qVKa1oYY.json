  "transcript": "it says can we take a shower in the afternoon or evening while we are fasting uh someone said when we take bath in the afternoon our fast will break this is a baseless false blatant lie the companions may Allah be pleased with them during the daytime of Ramadan when they traveled or when they it was hot they used to take a bath or we used to swim and having no problem or impact on their fasting and as Muslims we know that the things that breaker fasting are numbered so anything else out of these nullifiers of fasting are to be ignored so you can take a shower you can swim you can play sports you haven't consumed anything you haven't done anything that breaks your fasting so don't listen to such baseless allegations"
