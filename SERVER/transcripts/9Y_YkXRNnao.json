  "title": "5 years of good deeds transferred to the one you have backbitten? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question was that he heard a scholar quantifying the number of good deeds which will be transferred to the one you had backbitten so he says five years or seven years if you backed by someone he'll take your good deeds of five years and this is baseless no one can say he will take the good deeds of one day let alone five years or etc this is in Allah's knowledge Allah is the only one who can say how much of your deeds who he would be entitled to take away from you in return for what you had done none of this major sin therefore what this so-called scholar said was baseless and not true"
