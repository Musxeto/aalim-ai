  "transcript": "uh sh my question is that nowadays we see thousands of cases sh where all over the world where Muslim women who does not want to seek according to Sharia rules and they run to the non-muslim governing courts which are governed by liberal manmade laws and there she fights against her husband to seek alimony from him to herself her family and also sometimes for her pets too so what's the hookum on these women in the eyes of Allah subhana what Unice is referring to is unfortunately prevailing in non-muslim countries where women when seeking divorce from their husbands they do not follow Shar though they have the option in the Islamic Court rather they go to the civil court or the man-made Law Court where they would file for divorce knowing that these disbelievers would give her way more than her rights so they would say half of the wealth of the husband goes to you he has to give you x amount of alimony for the rest of your life he has to do this he has to do that and all of this is unlam such women if they do this believing that such laws are superior to Sharia law to the law of Allah or equivalent to it they are cfir disbelievers and they leave the fold of Islam according to the verses of the Quran inah 5 verse 4445 47 and if she believes that no no no no these courts have no superiority have no legitimacy and I am just simply stealing this man's wealth I hate him so much that I want to deprive him of his god-given rights and I'm taking his money unlawfully and I know what I'm doing is sinful and a major sin then she is a Muslim but her seat in Hellfire awaits her because of this major sin all what she consumes is Haram money it will be burning her intestines in Hellfire on the day of judgment and in her grave in unfortunately I've done counseling sessions with hundreds of such women who claim to be Muslims from America from Canada from Europe and they insist I've spent 15 20 years with him and look at him now divorcing me or I don't want to live with him and he wants to enjoy his wealth and trade and companies no I'm going to sue his backside and this is Haram money it's unlawful I don't care so unfortunately this is happening and this is why we say to those who are getting married in America or in Canada or in Europe to to sign a prenup so that in the future may Allah forbid if divorce were to take place your wife would not have the right to sue you and by the way this is the same with men I also had counseling sessions with so-called men who go to Islamic University in Medina and study and now they want to divorce their wives they want their wives to pay for their uh uh uni uh fees and to pay for their apartment and for their new car they're divorced and they bought it and their parents have money but still as long as the system allows it and I speak to some of them and I say Fe Allah no no no I didn't want this my lawyer said this I'm I'm going to correct it and Allah Allah knows if if he did correct it or not but his punishment if he's lying awaits for him in this life don't ever feel safe when you do a form of aggression that Allah Asel will let you be Allah May postpone you for some time but when he strikes he strikes with with vengeance and Wrath"
