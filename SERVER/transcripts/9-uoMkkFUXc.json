  "transcript": "but question was about one who is known to be an enemy of Islam and the Muslims he posts garbage on social media about Islam and the Muslims so he's an enemy of Islam and Muslims without any doubt but the question is that this enemy of Islam has a beautiful car and he wants to sell it for a very very nice and low price can i buy it halal Haram of course you can buy it the Prophet Isis am the Companions used to buy from idol worshipers other mushriks and they used to buy from the Jews and they used to buy from the fire worshippers and trade with them there's not no problem in that none whatsoever but Yandy you have to weigh the pros and cons so imagine if I were to buy a car from someone that is a real enemy of Islam and everybody knows about it and they see me shaking hands with them and signing contract and taking my car did I do Haram no not at all totally halide then what's wrong with that what's wrong is is it appropriate for me as a well-known there as a celebrity to be a role model for others to buy things from not any Tom Dick or Harry not any non-muslim a an enemy of Islam this is inappropriate but again halal and Haram definitely legit definitely kosher there's no problem in buying it but it is best not to it is inappropriate for you to deal with someone who you know that is an enemy yet you still benefit him and Allah so gel knows best"
