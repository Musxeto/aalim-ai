  "transcript": "bismillah r-rahman r-rahim al-hamdu lillah wa salatu was-salam ala rasoolillah Maya Ali he Osama him o allah assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have with us hadeeth number 83 from this blessed book of room that will come and we want someone to volunteer and recite it or read it for us hi madam a rated solemn even Abdullah my father said Allah is messenger sallallahu wasallam used to raise both his hands up to the level of his shoulders when opening the prayer and on saying the takbir for bowing and on raising his head from bowing he used to do the same and then say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah rabbana wa lakal hamd and he did not do that that is raising his hands in prostrations in this hadith and beloved Muhammad may Allah be pleased with him and with his father is describing to us how the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to raise his hands in three positions and we have another hadith which is also authentic adding a fourth position which makes them two that are only done once in prayer and two that are done in every rakah of every prayer so the first one that is done only once in there is takbir at allah from the first takbir in the Salah that initiates it that begins it so when you say Allahu Akbar he used to raise his hands till the level or to the level of his shoulders and there are hadith that his fingers would be to the level of his ears so how to combine scholars say that both hadees are authentic so in order to combine you have to have an understanding and the understanding is that he used to raise the palm of his hands to his shoulders while the fingers reaching the level of his ears now I've seen people tormenting themselves before prayer by holding their ears and doing Allah Akbar why are you doing this are you reprimanding yourself say no this is how we learned how to pray that book very good now you have to change your method of learning what did we agree on we learn how to pray from the sunnah and nowhere in the hadith the Prophet used to touch his ears let alone pulling them and by the end of the day we'll never know maybe you'll be like an elephant with big ears this is not advisable okay whatever you do refer it to the Quran and Sunnah revise all of your religion so many things that my father taught me were wrong so many things that my community used to do are wrong so many things that we may learn in schools not so many but there are things in schools that we learn that are not correct so as a student of knowledge like you guys you have to always refer it to the Quran and Sunnah don't take my word I might be one of the sources of wrong information as well that you add to the archive you have so as a student of knowledge go back to the Quran to the Sunnah refer cross examine cross reference so that you can know whether this was done by the Prophet or Islam or not never ever he used to touch his ears but the hadith says that to the level of the ears now there are people that are so lazy when they offer tech we oh okay well what are you doing trying to fly you think you're a duck no this is not the right way of doing it in prayer you have to show enthusiasm you have to show power and strength and agility in the way that a lion is pleased with because if your boss tells you to do something how would you do it you know like this or you will show him that you are all up to it if he says do some things yes sir yes sir meaning that you are in compliance you're showing masha'Allah this means that you're a good employee with Allah Allah has the highest example we have to stand in prayer in a manner and fashion that is perfect in the only perfect way is to do what the Prophet as some used to do so should I do this or what the scholars say you have to point it to the Qibla because the whole prayer is based on facing the Qibla so I do this Allah who acquire this is my hands shoulder and ears level now I don't tell you bring a ruler and try to measure exactly no a little bit okay now it's good but you know what I mean Islam is a religion of simplicity so even Omar may Allah be pleased with him telling us he used to do this integral on once because it doesn't come more than once in a prayer the second place which is only once in the prayer is when the Imam or the individual or the follower is standing from a tisha hood which is the second raka to the third so the minute you stand to the third raka you raise your hands and say Allahu Akbar of course this only comes in three raka prayer and for raka prayer can I do this in Fechter no because there isn't any third raka the third and fourth location is found in every single prayer in every single Drecker and that is when I bow I say Allahu Akbar and when I raise my head from bowing position I say Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah and I do not do this when I prostrate so I don't do this in prostration while she dude Allah Akbar Allah what Allah what Allah what I don't do this while in the prostration position now scholars say that it's the consensus of all scholars that the first act birra you raise your hands what's the ruling on raising the hands is it pillar is it mandatory is it Sunnah Jaqueline otech berated a harem it's a pillar but end of following the cards it's a Sunnah okay he says that in the beginning takbir it is a pillar but in the remaining takbir --is of the Salah it is a Sunnah who agrees with this opinion one two okay seven eight nine and who disagrees with this opinion one two okay let us take the brother over there why do you disagree God the prophet sallallaahu Selim never missed it fasting yes so he's saying that it's a pillar no no no he I said he said that the first stack birra raising the hand is a pillar so your D do you agree he agrees this is all wrong you've mixed up things completely there is a difference between the takbir and raising the hands raising the hands is a Sunnah so if I initiate my prayer by saying Allah a kebab smell of mother him humbly not not my prayer is 100% accepted but if I do this and I initiate my prayer my prayer is invalid because the takbir is the pillar not raising the hands so the consensus of all scholars that raising the hands with the takbir is something that is recommended there is no dispute indifference between them they differed in what in raising the hands elsewhere so the majority of scholars say it is recommended such as an imam shafi'i Ali Mahmoud Ahmed Mohammed say that raising the hands other than that the queer the Haram in the three positions of mentioned they say that it is highly recommended is part of the Sunnah not only that even al-qayyim may Allah have mercy on his Sol said that 30 companions of the prophet Isaiah reported it not only that the ten heaven-bound Sahaba including the four righteous and rightly guided caliphs they reported it an imam al Haqq him above the law hack him the one who compiled almoost Adric Allah saw hey hey he said I do not know of a Sunnah that the four caliphs of Islam agreed upon among the ten heaven bound all of them agreed upon other than raising the hands in prayer so it is not a something that is a difference of opinion no this is something that all the Companions did it and the Sunnah of the Prophet as I'm on doing it and that is what we know that if there is a school of thought that says otherwise that this opinion we respect but at the same time we'd rather follow the companions may allah be pleased with them and this is the opinion of an imam abu hanifa the school of abu hanifa may allah have mercy on his soul say that you do not raise your hands except in the beginning and as you have heard and as i've read to you this is wrong and it goes against the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam however if I don't raise my hands is my prayer void no the prayer is complete but you will lose the reward of following the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam moving on to hadeeth number 84 and the brother their rigid evening bus the prophet salallahu alaihe salam said i have been ordered to prostrate on seven bones that is on the forehead along with the tip of the nose and the prophet pointed towards his nose both hands both knees and the toes of both feet and not together full roll of the clothes or the head regarding the addition at the end where the prophet alayhi salatu salam say and not gather or fold or roll up the clothes or the hair this is not mentioned in the text of Rome the telecom but it is authentic and because the brother had read it we means Allah come to explain it just after this short break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is describing to us how to prostrate and he's saying that i've been commanded who has the ability to command the Prophet Isis am only allah azzawajal so this is how we should prostrate he was commanded to prostrate on seven bones the head he said and pointed to the tip of his nose which means that the nose and the forehead are alike and that is why if someone only prostrates on the tip of his nose is this permissible no and if someone like a lot of the children do only they don't prostrate on the forehead they prostrate on their heads so that they can look what's happening behind them so they'll do this and they look left and right and check on the people and play around this is acceptable no it has to be the forehead and the nose and then the Prophet said the hands the knees and the feet and among the mistakes that a lot of the Muslims do is not erecting the feet properly you've seen this a lot lazy people lazy worshippers when they prostrate you see their feet dangling in the air while they are prostrating their feet are darling maybe they rub each other together so why you're prostrating here in front of you someone is rubbing his feet together this is awkward some of them put or place their feet like this pointing the fingers to the direction of the table and erecting their feet they let their fingers point to the other side or to the opposite side of the Qibla and this is not a correct frustration the frustration is not valid understood some of the people and I've seen this don't frustrate on the palms of their hands instead they prostrate on their fingertips and as if they're doing push-ups or some sort of you know heiped way of exercise and this is not permissible the Sunnah and the right way of doing it is you place your the palms of your hands on the ground and pointing it to the Qibla some people do this some people do that and the Sunnah is to do this in the direction pointing to the Qibla because this is the soul of your prayer and scholars differed where to put the feet when you prostrate keep them apart or make them close there isn't anything specific telling us where to put them except for the hadith of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her when she said that I woke up once in the middle of the night and it was dark we did not have any candle light and I did not know what the Prophet was he wasn't next to me in the bed so I started touching in the room and I my hands fell on the prophets feet erected and he was praying and she told us the supplication he was saying along inaudible documents our attic will be my affair to come in alphabetic it to the end of the door so she said this which indicates that both of his feet were close together because she touched them with one stroke this is the only evidence other than that there is no evidence saying that we should keep them apart or make them or join them together so the most authentic opinion and this is a choice of share Anatomy may Allah have mercy on your soul that you put them together so this is regarding frustrating on the 7 bones now prostration is by far one of the greatest deeds in Islam and that is why inside any Muslim the Prophet tells us when the son of Adam prostrates the devil takes a corner and starts to cry so you have the ability to make the devil cry the devil cries and says I have been ordered to prostrate and I refuse and I was doomed into hell forever for eternity and he was ordered to prostrate and he prostrated and Allah will give him Jenna so the devil knows this we don't or we know but we neglect and the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam that any servant of allah who prostrates allah azza wajal would give him for that prostration a good deed a husana and would erase away from him a bad deed asiye so prostration is something not to be taken lightly one should know that the closest he is to his Lord is when prostrating prophets Allah Islam the closest a servant of Allah is to his Lord is when he is frustrating so choose whatever you wish of duaa while you are in prostration Allah would answer your dua and before you ask me share is it permissible to make dua in our native language I would say it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is if you know how to make this particular door in Arabic you must but if you don't have the knowledge in Arabic for example I'd like to say oh Allah forgive not forgive my sins this is easy if I want to say oh Allah helped me in paying off my debts and getting my daughter married for example and I don't know how to say this in Arabic so the scholars say you are allowed to say this in your own native language but if you have the ability to say it in Arabic you cannot prostrate and supplicate in Salah except in the Arabic language if it's not in the Salah if I'm going round the car if I'm doing power si bein between the Safa and Marwah if I am sitting home and just wanting to supplicate it's okay to do it in your own native language I believe that this is all what we need to know about this hadith we have a few minutes left so I'd like to entertain your questions yes brother as regards prostration when we go down to prostrate what is what is the correct sequence whether we should be touching our knees first and then hands because there's some conflicting statements there is a difference between scholars regarding how to prostrate that is falling to the prostration position what should touch the ground first should it be hands first or knees first it's an issue of dispute and the funny thing is those who dispute it use the same hadith those who differed among them use the same hadith and the difference is in defining the knees mentioned in the hadith because the Prophet to say do not prostrate like a camel and when someone of you prostrate he should put his knees they said that the knees of the camel are allocated in his elbows the Arabs this is what they are of safe and he the Prophet is awesome is telling us not to do this posture and to fall on your knees so they say okay if this is true then this means that we should not put hands first and we should put our actual knees first and those who said no the hadith is clear do not put your knees first the Prophet says you should put your hands first so it's an issue of dispute check members when I say mean and a number of great scholars say you should put your knees first and shake al albani differed with them and said no you should put your hands first what do I do I personally due to age restrictions and demands I go on my hands first because this is the best way for a person who's old who has sports injuries and for a person who's praying on marble or on stones or on a rocky terrain if you go on your knees you're gonna injure yourself and you feel that so to minimize the fall going on your hands takes a lot of the pressure but look to the wisdom of Sheikh bin baz may Allah have mercy on us Allah said if you do this or you do that both is acceptable when Han billah if we have this wisdom we would not have not have any problem but the problem is that a lot of the brothers they differ and fight oh you should do go on your knees no you should go on your hands yeah it is it your problem I'm praying to allah azza wajal and this is the way I'd like to pray and this is the way I understand the the hadith why should it be an issue is the difference of opinion among scholars and we should not make it an issue yes brother I have a question that in the sujood you said we can resided wa but there are some tools in the Quran and we're not allowed to recite the Quran in prostration this is good we're not allowed to recite the Quran while in bowing or in prostration but they do as you're referring to are not considered to be Quran because you're not reciting the whole ayah or you're not reciting a portion of the Torah you are simply saying lebanner attend a free junior husana over here at a husana were pina either but not robinov alumna and Fusina well EMTALA Lena etc so actually you're not reciting the Quran you're reciting portion of it not as a Quran but as a dora and that is what scholars say that this is permissible I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
