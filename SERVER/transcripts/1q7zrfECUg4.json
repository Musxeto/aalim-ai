  "title": "Most of our relatives are Sufis, Mother asks me to burn incense on Mondays & Thursdays, can I? Assim",
  "transcript": "so fatima from somalia says that lots of the relatives are sufis and they celebrate the maulid the birthday of the prophet allah and her mother specifically always asks her to burn um incense and the bahor that you burn and it gives nice smell but she does this on a monday on a thursday and before maghrib well if she's doing this thinking that this is a ritual or thinking that this is because the prophet was born on a monday so she would like to perfume the house or that this is for the angels or to kick and ward off jinn etc then this is not permissible if she does not disclose the intention she just says that i'd like to smell a good smell in the house there's nothing wrong in that you can do it any day of the week not necessarily mondays and thursdays but sometimes people fast on mondays and thursdays according to the sunna so before they break their fast they would like to have a good smell especially if they cook and fry their sambusa and other um food that they eat for their breakfast when they break their fast usually it would have a cooking smell in the house so they would like to ward it off with such uh perfume the house there's no problem in that it all depends on the intention allah azza knows best you"
