  "transcript": "so I heard that Allah is as servant thinks of him and I'm confused you heard you heard what that Allah is as his servant thinks of him and I'm confused on what this means this means that when a person thinks positively of Allah Allah the almighty is more generous than the servant or the whole entire universe so Allah subhana wa tala will give that person more than he dreamt of while if you think negatively of Allah Allah will torment you and punish you with worse than what you thought of Allah for example some people have an illness or some people have an interview for a job tomorrow so we say to them good luck make Dua to Allah that you succeed in your interview and you get the job with a better salary said no no no no no why he said oh I've done this so many times every time I ask Allah for something Allah doesn't make it happen so I'm not going to make Dua so that it would happen this can mount to kufur may Allah protect us he is so negatively thinking of Allah as if Allah is playing a game with him and if you went this low in thinking of Allah you deserve what you get from calamities and and and torment and Punishment you're a servant you're nothing you're just a slave among trillions of other creatures and slaves of Allah who are you so that you think that Allah would deal with you in such a fashion no Allah doesn't need you so if you show your submissiveness to Allah your humility you express your poverty to Allah Allah is more generous than than the whole of this universe and he will give you more than what you ever had dreamed of otherwise you're going to be in real trouble"
