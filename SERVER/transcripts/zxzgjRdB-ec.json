  "transcript": "foreign [Music] so whenever I see like someone let's say I see a very beautiful car on the streets but and I don't say I don't want to say mashallah because that person like he doesn't he doesn't have a beard you know he's doing maybe he's putting music out loud he's blasting it so I don't know if I should say martial law on the car because maybe it might be insulting to Allah I don't know you know okay so what hamis is asking if there is something that I like should I say Allah though that person might be indulging in different types of sins the answer is of course you're not saying Allah Mubarak to him blasting the music or shaving the beard or being with a gorgeous uh a non hijabi woman or being this or that you're saying Allah Mubarak to akar so this is by itself to protect and block your evil eye from affecting it his sins are his own business it's none of my business and the concept of trying to filter people and to label them and to classify them with other righteous no they're bad they're sinful they're Hypocrites they're non-muslims they're Muslims before doing such things is not a the right way of living and dealing with others and Allah Knows Best"
