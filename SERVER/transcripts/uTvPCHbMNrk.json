  "transcript": "Mars says at night I intend to fast my missed fast but didn't wake for sure and did not fast will I be sinful if you made the intention too fast a missed day or an obligation or a vow before you went to bed so the intention is made if you woke up before fetcher a then and found out that there is little time to eat or no time at all and changed your mind and decided not to fast then there's no sin on you because you can delay that but if you woke up after the Adhan of fetcher and realize that you did not eat this is binding you must continue the day you cannot break the fasting of that day just yet even if you're hungry because you made the intention and you are already in that day fasting it"
