  "transcript": "foreign Ty is much better than quality so when we come to Wars and fighting the bigger the Army is the better and this is not the case in Islam when we have quality quality Beats the amount of Army and soldiers and ammunition they have because Iman always prevails Allah says in the Quran how many a small company has overcome a large Company by permission of Allah and Allah is with the patient in the beginning the Muslim Army was ordered to fight even if the enemy Army is 10 times as big and they never run away and Allah made them Prevail then this instruction was lowered so when the army of Muslims is faced by twice the size of the enemy they are ordered to stand firm and to fight to the death sometimes quantity is a reason for defeat the Muslims in the Battle of her name they were almost 10 to 12 000 men much more than the enemy Army but because they were not firm in obeying the prophet Islam they almost got defeated until Allah gave them Victory once again told us about an era at the end of time when the Muslims are a lot but they are worthless how many Muslims do we have 1.7 2 billion Muslims on Earth what power do they possess or constitute it's zero they can't do anything why there's so many but they're divided and this is why we have to know that quality is not attained by Logic quality is only attained by the Quran and the Sunnah this is what defines how we look at things so that we act according to what pleases Allah azzawajal if we were to look at things with the glasses of sharia that filters everything then we would understand that one rupee of halal is better than Millions from Haram ask the people on the street would you like one mil one rupee Halal or shall I give you a million rupees of Haram what would they ask answer the vast majority was saying give me Haram give it to me and I'll give something to sadaqah and Allah will forgive because they don't have the understanding of sharia if you ask people hijabi Muslim believe in practicing Woman as a wife or Miss Universe they would say Miss Universe that's the job one woman equals thousands of Nan hijabi women one man or boy who memorizes the Quran is better than a thousand of those who don't know where the Qibla is who all what they care about is their movies their music their Instagram their Tick Tock but they don't know nothing about Islam it's a shame when you ask youngsters about the pillars of Islam about the pillars of Iman is it huh they don't know but if you ask them about the members of the Brazilian football team and they list their names and their clubs and everything about them a father must look with the glasses of Islam to filter whatever his wife asks him to do whatever his children ask him to do so whatever pleases Allah he does it whatever goes against Sharia he blocks it likewise the sun has to look in what pleases his parents but with a condition that it pleases Allah so if your parents older you to do a sin you block it and refuse it this is how we should evaluate things in our work in our Ledger in our Sports in our families in our studies look at everything through the spectrum of sharia because this is what a real Muslim does Allah says in the Quran say indeed my prayer my rights of sacrifice my living and my dying are for Allah lord of the worlds no partner has he and this is I have been commanded and I am the first among you of the Muslims"
