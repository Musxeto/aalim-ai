  "transcript": "uh so I know that we shouldn't six or stay with people that are working Islam and but my question is as I live in a kafa country and I go to a school sometimes when I am in class people are starting to make a joke about Islam but I can't go away from the class so uh I would like to know if uh it is an act of C to not say anything when they are making joke and so I cannot leave as mentioned inah chapter 4 Ayah number 140 140 that whenever they mock Islam or the religion or the rituals then you have to leave them otherwise you will be classified like them so number one the best thing to do is to defend Islam by stopping them from mocking Islam and telling them that this is disrespectful and if you can answer their doubts and mockery with facts and this requires that you research your own religion research their religions and show them that this is also applicable and open their eyes with diplomacy and respect that is fine if you're unable to do this you have to leave leave them until the class starts where the teacher starts to talk and they would shut up"
