  "transcript": "Karima says is the verbal contract between the two parties to the trade marriage or any of this will uh uh or will of the deceased between brackets word of honor it would this be considered as strong as a written contract is there a punishment or penalty for breaking it as for the marriage whether written or not there has to be two male Muslim Witnesses for it to be valid so whether written or not it's the same thing it's a marriage and no one can break it without divorce if it is trade then you don't need Witnesses it's sufficient for me to say I sell you my mobile for a hundred you say I accept done deal finished if we separate physically I cannot retract that or pull out of out of it you can't do that either it's a fixed done deal as for the will of a deceased it's not sufficient for me to come and say so and so on his dying bed gave third of his money to uh the messaging there has to be two male Witnesses testifying or one male and two females other than that is not valid and Allah Knows Best"
