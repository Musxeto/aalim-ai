  "transcript": "[Music] alhamd welcome dear brothers and sisters to this beautiful night of worship where Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has chosen us to be amongst the people that the angels surround and praise as we get together to seek beneficial knowledge striving to get better for the sake of Allah subhah waala tonight we have been graced once again by our beloved Sheik Alim our beloved sheh will be discussing the topic of Ramadan a month of transformation so without further Ado please welcome to the micd dear brothers and sisters in Islam in the Hadith that both bukari and Muslim agreed upon may Allah have mercy on their souls they said thata narrated may Allah be pleased with her she said that the first form of Revelation the prophet started to getat before becoming a messenger was a truthful Vision he used to see a dream and it would come as broad daylight exactly as he had seen it then it was made beloved to his heart to be in seclusion so he used to go to the cave of H A far away place from Mecca overlooking the Kaaba and Mecca as well and he used to stay there nights after night before going back to his wife and family to get provision and come back again now if we look at this Hadith we find that the prophet Alat loved to stay or to be alone why he was not an introvert sallallahu alaih wasallam yet he found a beauty and a sweetness when you're alone with Allah your heart tends to become soft and your tongue becomes at ease remembering Allah when you hold yourself accountable before the day of judgment and you remember standing at Allah's between Allah's hands and then you recall that there will come a time where you where you will be held accountable and you will see what Deeds you have presented before you you take a quick a quick look at yourself and at your daily routine and at what you are in at the moment does it please Allah most of us if not all would say no I have lots and lots of shortcomings and wrong things that need to be fixed we still have time we still have a chance now one of the best ways and means to change and to transform ourselves into better people is that Allah asael would help us and guide us to prepare our hearts to be ready in this month so that who knows maybe a single drop of tears that slides on our faces would grant us security and safety for eternity in Paradise when the prophet mentioned that there are seven under the shade of Allah on the day of judgment when there are no there is no shade other than his shade he mentioned one of them to be a man remembering Allah alone and he starts to weep and tears go down his eyes when we say to be in seclusion what does that mean to be in seclusion is to be alone with Allah and it is what we call quality time it transforms your life it cleanses your heart and it's not hours without end rather it's a few moments an hour at most where you sit and contemplate and reflect on what you've done in the past and what you will do in the future and what awaits for you on the day of judgment this is very important to have this quality time with Allah because it has a huge positive impact on your life unfortunately look at the quality of this quality time it's one of the worst because it cannot be full seclusion when our hearts are heedless when we have our smartphones scrolling every 3 four minutes for what I do not know we're not word leaders that have to follow what's happening minute by minute to launch an attack or send nuclear warheads or destroy this country or save that country we're normal human beings all what we care about then you feed on Instagram of an artist an Entertainer an actress or this or that what is written on Twitter or Facebook or this platform or that why our minds have been dominated by social media we've been occupied by enemy forces but we don't seem to think of it this way if you look at the prophet Alat wasam he could have had his quality time in his own home or went a little bit further to the Masjid to the Haram near to the Kaa but he did not do that he decided to go all the way to that cave away from everything that may distract him from Allah do we have this ability in us now when we read the Quran do we actually read it with an open mind do we contemplate and Ponder upon these beautiful verses or do we only focus on on quantity versus quality all what you see Muslims doing nowadays H how many kma have you done oh mallah today is the 16th of Ramadan I did five katas oh mallah I did only four I'll compete with you so all what they care about is quantity what about the quality what about the meaning of the words that you're reciting when it was revealed why it was revealed what's the rulings we can learn from it what is Allah telling us nobody cares and this is very sad Ramadan is a chance to transform our lives and this is obvious our whole schedule is rescheduled according to Ramadan it's totally different than the rest of the Year this month is totally different than the rest of the 11 months an individual like you and me would refrain from Halal pure Halal things for hours and hours 16 hours in average we would not drink water we would not eat any type of food nothing would come into our stomachs totally Al things nope you can't do that and you cannot be intimate with your Halal spouse if you're married for hours you refrain you hold yourself back from Halal things such transformation means that if you're doing this with Halal what do you expect the individual to do when it comes to Haram definitely he would way refrain from Haram how do we know the prophet said thisat whenever Ramadan is due the gates of paradise are open opened and the gates of hell are closed and the Masters of the Jin the devils are chained so that they won't be able to execute what they used to execute before Ramadan they're chained but they're still active however their activity is far less than it was before Ramadan therefore a lot of the times if not all the times Muslims do less sins than what they used to do in the previous 11th months why because their souls are ready their souls are waiting and they're susceptible to be good and to offer good forms of worship they are ready to come to Allah and get closer and you can see this cascaded throughout the month of Ramadan fasting every single day offering prayers in the Masjid when a lot of us was not so punctual on it offering Twi and Witter night prayer devoting more time to reading the Quran doing three fouras giving generously in the cause of Allah giving charity feeding the orphans and the poor paying utility bill bills for those who can't afford it contributing in uh uh giving those who need dialysis or can't pay the rent or don't have money to buy medicine all of this we find Muslims are giving unconditionally and above all you would find that the Muslims are refraining from Haram they're refraining from obscene and vulgar words they don't fight they try their level best to refrain from anything that would cause them to be angry and when someone angers them they say I'm fasting and I fear Allah the whole Community is helping you to transform to a better person everyone in the society is holding your hand and trying to support you of course excluding the full-fledged Hypocrites who try their level best to get us out of this quality time time into sins in different shades and color a Muslim recognizes that Allah did not create us to play Allah did not create us to eat and drink and mate Allah created us for the sole purpose of worshiping him as Allah says and I did not create the Jin and Mankind except to worship me and part of worshiping Allah is to fast in the month of Ramadan a doesn't matter if you can't understand some people come and say she I don't understand why does Allah put us into phases of hunger and thirst why does Allah need us to do this Subhan Allah do you think Allah enjoys you suffering and being in pain Allah is not like that Allah is the most knowledgeable the most wise and part of his wisdom and knowledge is for betrayed and fasting Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous so the purpose of fasting is to reach this level of righteousness and how to do this to transform Our Lives to become better people to excel through fasting through reading the Quran and different forms of worship imagine that fasting and reading the Quran will intercede for you on the day of judgment when you need someone to come and intercede listen to this Hadith the prophet Alat wasam says fasting and the Quran intercede for a man fasting says oh my Lord I've kept him away from his food and his passion by day so accept my intercession for him the Quran says oh my Lord I've kept him away from sleep by night so accept my intercession for him the prophet says Alam then their intercession is accepted Ramadan is when you pick the Habit take away bad habits so even if you're addicted to eating and drinking which is halal you train and condition yourself to refrain and to abstain from it for average of 16 hours a day some countries in the Scandinavians 21 22 hours a day and some other countries like Malaysia and Indonesia 11 hours or 12 hours depending on the region so if you manage to stay off things for this long period of time you will be also able throughout the whole year to maintain staying away from Haram and if you succeed in staying away from Haram the prophet saysat stay away from Haram and you will be the most Pious of worshippers you will be the most highest and righteous of all worshippers how by offering night prayer no no no just stay away from Haram whether minor or major most people nowadays keep on classifying things is smoking Haram yes is it minor or major what difference does it make well if it's major then I may consider quitting but if it's minor Allah is most forgiving most merciful Subhan Allah don't look at the size of the sin rather look at the size who you're sinning against subhah and this is why Muslims must start to transform themselves this is the time for those who want guidance Allah will guide you and I guarantee this for you but the problem is with those who are not interested in guidance the problem is with those who are enjoying sinning and don't want to quit don't want to not be addicted to Haram they enjoy it they enjoy watching Haram they enjoy Tik Tok they enjoy watching pornography or listening to music or watching movies even if when they know that Allah is watching and Allah is listening to what they're watching and listening to but they're so he L that their hearts have a stain on it and a covering and unfortunately that would lead them to a sealed heart and if you've noticed since the beginning of Ramadan every day from 1 to two with the grace of Allah on zad TV I have a program about the hadiths that talk about the hearts and you'll find it on my YouTube channel as well inshallah it is a extremely important to pay tribute to this small organ in our bodies because this is the king and the whole body is its subjects when the king is righteous and practicing and God-fearing the whole body would be like that but when the heart the the king is corrupt the body would be corrupt you will find women not wearing the hijab you will find men clean shaven and not praying in the Masjid dealing with RBA seating and lying stealing not caring about free mixing or cering their kinship or do eating and consuming Haram all is well such people have a sealed heart you want to change that this month of Ramadan is your chance it's your chance to transform to the better and this is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that in Ramadan Allah did not limit us to one thing alone there is fasting of Ramadan which is a pillar you have to do that then there is night prayer whoever prays and offers night prayer out of belief and anticipating the reward of Ramadan Allah will forgive his sense whoa the whole nights of Ramadan that's a lot then the prophet says wasam whoever offers night prayer in the night of decree One Night in the month but you succeed in doing it Allah will forgive all your previous sins if you do that out of belief and anticipating the reward when is it's in the last 10 nights of Ramadan so instead of the whole month maybe you've missed the first 15 nights now the 10 nights are coming you've got your chance to pray each and every night she it's too difficult to pray from till F it's like about nine hours or so it's a lot of time the prophet gave you a concession he says he who prays with the Imam until he concludes his prayer Allah will grant him the reward as if he prayed the whole night yeah Subhan Allah most if not all masjids pray Isa then 11 ra afterwards in less than an hour you manage to do this you get the reward of the full night and as a consequence all of your sins are erased unfortunately how many of us look for that reward and work hard for it 10% and the rest they are in their malls they're behind their TV screens they're behind their mobile screens just killing time and I don't know what's the crime time committed so that they would do such a thing they keep on doing it may Allah protect us and fall in sin after sin while those who know what they will face on the day of judgment are in their masjids supplicating praying reading Quran devoting their time hoping that Allah would accept from them if you can't pray but Allah gave you wealth you can give money in charity the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to give money in the month of Ramadan unlike any other month IB Abbas says the prophet Alam was as generous as the wind and the most generous he would be is during the month of Ramadan when jiel revises the Quran with him peace be upon him so this is the time when the whole Community is putting their hands in yours encouraging you supporting you Allah is calling you everywhere around you they're striving to be the best it's your chance to be with them but if you fail then let it be known that Allah Asel does not want you because if Allah wanted you he would have given you the will and he would have encouraged you and he would have supported you as mentioned in verse 46 inah about the Hypocrites if they had the intention Allah would have helped them to go out and March out with the prophet but they lacked behind so Allah told them to stay behind so be careful and let this month be your chance of transformation and if you were successful in transforming let it Cascade to the rest of the year so that you would become a righteous practicing individual when death comes to you you will be the happiest person on Earth to die and go to paradise for eternity if not then you are in great danger the scholars of the Sala used to say woe to the people who only know Allah in Ramadan don't let Ramadan be the last of the goodness we see of you don't let the masjids miss you after Ramadan don't let righteousness and piety look for you after Ramadan rather be the one that you were in Ramadan as you are in the rest of the year and Allah Asel knows best and I pray to Allah subhana wa tala that he grants us to be steadfast on Islam and to learn our religion more more and more and to get higher and higher in through reading the Quran through giving charity and through offering voluntary prayers until Allah is pleased with us thank you for the wonderful speech and uh inshallah as we discussed there will be a small window for questions and we will try and keep the questions as close to the topic as possible please use the Q&A tab on your Zoom to ask your questions in order for us to moderate the talk in a systematic manner so inshallah we will begin with our first question umum I pay my zakat every Ramadan I know I'm not obligated to pay off my husband's debt but I choose to do so because I don't like the idea of him being in debt with interest he earns a very good income but due to recent circumstances the cost has the cost has been too much we haven't started a repayment plan yet whenever we try a new urgent expense arises do do I pay zakat every year on the amount I lend or only when I receive repayment also when I do receive payment will I need to pay zakat for all the past years first of all it is not permissible to give zakat to someone who borrowed with RBA because that would be endorsing his major sin and encouraging him to pay off his riba debt loan through my zakat and this is to be done only to those who are poor and needy in a legitimate pause and this is not legitimate secondly if you lend him money not pay his zakat to to him no what do you mean she by not pay zakat to him if a rich woman is married to someone who is poor and in the middle of the month the guy raises the White Flag saying I can't pay for groceries or utility bills or the rent because my salary is not sufficient this man is poor and the woman can't pay him her zakat and he does with the money of the zakat what he needs to pay off debts and and the likes that are Halal but in your husband's case no you cannot give him zakat to pay off his interest based loan but if he wants a loan from you whether he's going to buy a car or pay off his loans but it's a loan it's not zakat yes you can give him a loan to him and you are obliged to give zakat on it every Ramadan but before you give zat You Go and ask him give me back my loan if he says well I don't have money in this case there is no zakat on you that year the following year give me back my loan he says well I don't have money so four or five years go by and every year he says he doesn't have money to pay you back there is no zakat on you the moment he starts to give you something let's say 10% of your loan the moment you receive this 10% give 2.5% for the whole years that had passed only once not 2.5 2.5 2.5 no one 2.5 because he was unable to pay you off for five or 10 years so you just give it once and then the money is in your possession it goes back to normal every Ramadan the second question we have is how can I develop true in my prayer and build sincere lasting in my daily life so that my connection with Allah is not just a habit but something deeply felt and lived well this is not a very easy question to answer because theoretically speaking this is dependent on your knowledge of Allah is to be able to stand in prayer without thinking except about who you're talking to who you're praying to who you're standing in front of and if you don't know Allah that would be almost impossible see the vast majority of people when they say allahar they think about where did I park my car oh my slippers are they in the box or outside would somebody steal them they're very expensive ones oh what did I do did I put my mobile in the car is in my pocket so while in prayer they reach for their pocket where is the I don't know came and just told me that the mobile is not in my pocket other than okay so I have to go to the grocery shop I have to go to the vegetable shop and and get some okay my wife told me this what in I don't know let me follow the one next to me whatever he does I'm GNA do so the Salat finishes and the dude doesn't know what's happening so you ask him why are you doing this said don't know I'm trying to get for 20 years but I'm unable okay how many names of Allah do you know well I've heard that he has 99 Names okay how many of them do you memorize um maybe 10 20 mashallah good of these 20 how many do you know the meaning of um maybe three or four so how do you expect to face Allah when you only know three or four of his names you have to learn Allah's beautiful names you have to know what is Al you have to know what is Al you have to know what is Al everybody knows the word what does it mean 19 9% of the people who are watching say uh okay good thank you this his problem when you read one of the shortest Surah that everybody knows what does mean pass what does a mean what do you mean a is one of Allah's names is it well this is the first time I know gosh I don't know so what you expect how can you reach the level of tawa if you don't even know who Allah is so you have to go to the basics what we are doing is looking for in public relations we call it the wow factor when you have a presentation you just look at the bullet points that when people hear they said wow so when I'm making a presentation well we've managed to be in 60 countries wow and we've managed to open x amount of masjids wow and we've done this with minimal amount of money these are the key points instead of talking for half an hour so nowadays all what we care about is the wow factor how many you've done five in Ramadan wow how many oh I go for every three weeks wow how much money do you have how many cars do you have an SUV do you have a boat that we could go skiing do you have this do you have that but where is the beef where is the quality where is the essence zero inside it's Hollow it's empty yes you may like my physique you may like my body my muscles my uh uh the way I look this woman is gorgeous she's a bombshell she's beautifully crazy what's inside nothing and that is why when they stand in prayer they don't know who's they're talking to that's why they're depressed they have panic and anxiety attack that's why they're always lost that's why they're Moody that's why some of them consider themselves to be bipolar with with ups and downs and all of this because they don't know Allah so I can't answer your question about the Salat and the it's a full system that you need to transform your whole life in order to reach there that was quite an answer um do you have time for a few more questions yeah yeah have nothing to do we'll take a few more and then we'll call it at night I want to ask you when we finish the Quran in Ramadan could we dedicate that to a person who deceased in the family this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and the most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of the greatest Scholars of Islam is that you yourself don't know if Allah accepted this kma from you or not so how would you grant the reward to it the things that we can give to the deceased are limited number one making Dua so any type of Dua Allah uh expand his grave fill it with light and fragrances of Jenna oh Allah forgive him oh Allah ease his stay this is accepted number two charity you see someone in need you give them a thousand dirham and say this is on behalf of my deceased father or uncle or cousin or whomever this is accepted number three so I've done gazillion in my time I go and make this time for my mom I said and I make the and I shave my head and that's it number four Haj and I do the same if I performed Haj on myself or I give money to someone who've done Hajj before would like to go this year I give him money to make ha and I tell him make it on behalf of my grandfather this is all accepted and legitimate for that um then we have uham I'm a student in the 12th grade uh please advise on which of the following path leads to Greater reward and brings one closer to Allah dedicating oneself to Islamic Studies and engaging in or pursuing a career in medicine while also acquiring Islamic knowledge and actively engaging in da which of these holds more virtue According to Islamic teachings it is not one size that fits all sometimes people are not qualified for Islamic Studies and daa they don't have it in them and I've seen people so enthusiastic wanting to learn dawa and they want to go to Islamic University in Medina or J IM in RI or in or in here and there and they go the first year second year then they're homesick what are you doing I can't stay it's too much I miss my mom's Biryani I just want to go and you're here for da you're dedicated for Islam so no no okay if you need someone to change your Pampers go go back so he wasted two three years and he goes back home and he doesn't have a plan B to fall back on and everybody who was with him in high school they already in third or fourth uh year medicine or engineering or business this guy doesn't know what's he's capable of so I said no you're not qualified if he's qualified he said listen I'm 100% dedicated for da I love Islam I've memorized Quran when I was 12 years of age And I memorized the books of Hadith when I was 4 oh wow this is a highly decorated and a scholar to be no no no no no go and pursue knowledge and he says I know if I get a ba in Islamic Studies and maybe Masters and may PhD I'm going to be paid 10% of what a doctor gets or an engineer I don't care I want I want Allah's pleasure I want to help people I want to teach people I want to be someone that's qualified so you're the man you're my boy so I'd like you to continue someone else he says I struggle in in memorizing Al Fat how long have you been Muslim said 20 years but I you know when I say the faat I make mistakes but I want to study Islam so no no please don't study Islam you're gonna make a problem for us how are you in biology said she I'm A+ I'm good no go and study medicine and while study medicine improve your Islamic Studies and learn but you excel in medicine so what what would I do if I have a thousand Scholars teaching Quran andah and Hadith while not a single medical doctor and what would I do when I have a thousand medical doctors and without one IM giving fatwas and leading the prayer and and and and helping the community it's an issue of balance so it's not one size fits all what's in you what are you capable of and this is why I say to the people from outside my advice to you if you're not this top niche of a highly decorated students of knowledge if you're an an average Joe I would say get your degree in engineering medicine physics whatever then apply for Islamic uh uh University degree because then you would have a plan B to fall back to if you need to fall back to something the last question of the night um if you would like to go on this final question it's a little okay a lung disease and I cannot pray inside the Masjid due to rain mold smell and I am praying in the on the Masjid porch as soon as the Adan finishes I make my and pray before the actual Jam am I acting correctly and can I in this condition follow the jam from the porch instead of praying alone no this is not permissible for you to do either you pray with the jam where a face mask wear take your precautions or pray home but when when you pray alone on the porch like this people would think that you are following a deviant cult and sect that you're not Sunni you're someone who's wo what are you doing the people are inside they will not know what Creed or what a or what justifications you have therefore no either pray with the JAMA if you're unable pray home and Allah will forgive you for that inshallah insh uh I just got a message that this is something a little important um there's one question that a person desperately needs an answer for so inshallah we'll try and help them out over here sh they say it is an emergency someone has died four years ago we were committed for one year and one month but before his death we broke up what can I do for him now V I visit his grave every day will he face any hardships he used to be he used to take alcohol and maybe did some Haram stuff but he was he crashed by a truck will he go to Jenna how can I pray for him how can I pray for our sins to be forgiven first of all she was not married to him so she was involved in a Haram relationship with him therefore instead of visiting his grave which is not permissible at all women are not allowed to go to visit Graves and this is the most authentic opinion of Scholars instead of visiting his grave she should stay home ask Allah to forgive her sins and to Pardon her over what she had done and to express femors secondly him being indulged in intoxicant and Haram I don't know if he prayed or not if he did not pray at all he's not a Muslim but if he prayed on and off he's a Muslim but he's definitely was a bad Muslim for the sins he committed which are major sins these are not easygoing sins like you know uh smoking or uh playing cards or no this guy was involved in Haram major Haram uh sins is he forgiven will Allah forgive him this is in Allah's hands nobody could say that he's in Hell nor nobody can say he's in Paradise we ask Allah to forgive him and to forgive our sins and to forgive the sins of everybody who's watching this but at the end of the day his faith is in Allah's hands should we be worried should we be care and caring for no there are billions of people like him he has met his fate now for us we should focus on ourselves showing remorse asking Allah for forgiveness and trying to excel to be people that Allah loves and forgives Allah knows best thank you for such an insightful lecture and alhamd alhamdulillah personally I benefited a lot from it on where to pick myself up and build myself back up when it comes to making Ramadan uh a month of transformation dear beloved brothers and sisters for joining us on this beautiful night may Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala bless every one of you for taking time out of your night and joining us in gaining knowledge may Allah subhanahu wa tala grant us the ability to make Ramadan a month that we change ourselves and make it a lasting impression for joining us and enlighting us on the importance of Ramadan may Allah subh bless you for your time and with that subh for"
