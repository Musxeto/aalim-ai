  "title": "Praying behind an Imam who does Shirk, gives Taweez etc? Ruling on Judging people - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the u.s what's the ruling on praying behind someone who commits acts of shirk now this brings us to muhammad farhan's question from the philippines judging people if i see something that an individual is doing i cannot jump the gun i cannot label him as a kafir or an innovator or this or that until it is beyond doubt so an imam of a masjid who sells amulets and he says that this amulet is for bringing children and this one is for protecting you from evil eye and this one is from this and we know that this is all bogus and not true he's committing acts of shirk he's an imam he should know this we don't pray behind him but to give him the benefit of the doubt we go and talk to him and tell him this is haram an imam who says in the khutbah ya rasulullah save us and he's calling the prophet this is an act of shirk because he's calling someone who is unable to benefit us we cannot call the dead we cannot call except allah azzawajal who can help us if someone is going to dargas in sacrificing for the peer or for the deceased awliya and maybe prostrating or doing acts of shirk we cannot pray behind such people but if someone is innovating he's doing the maulit for example and this is an innovation there's no shirk in it it's sinful but there is no i can pray behind such a person if a person believes something to be correct but it is wrong we have to speak with them before judging them but basically yes if it is crystal clear that this is shirk or he says things that are shirk if he says that the prophet aslam is not created of clay like all humans rather he is created from allah's light this is kufur definitely so we don't pray behind such people and allah knows best"
