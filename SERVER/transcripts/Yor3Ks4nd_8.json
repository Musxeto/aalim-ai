  "transcript": "the bed of car the vast majority of them you can say them and still engage in communicating and talking with your husband or your children or using the phone as long as you're you're on your bed so it doesn't matter what you do after that it does not nullify them except with the Hadith that is highly recommended to be the last thing you say Allah This is highly recommended and there is another Hadith which I may recall later down the line that also is recommended that you say at the last but mainly speaking the Hadith should be the last thing you say before going to sleep if you speak once again then repeat it once uh again so that it will be the last thing you say and Allah Knows Best"
