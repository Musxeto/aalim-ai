  "title": "Is it permissible to be a Blogger or a Vlogger? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is being a blogger as a hobby permissible just right personal sharing not for income just using this platform to write something and share sometimes about life self-reflection recipes hobbies etc no picture with person's face just picture of hand shoes and mostly using illustration pictures now when you ask a question there's a straightforward answer and there is a detailed answer so technically speaking is blogging permissible the answer would be yes providing that there is nothing haram now this is a straightforward answer showing a female's hand is not permissible showing any part of her body is not permissible because this defies the purpose of hijab but showing the picture of a shoe or a dish that you had cooked sharing with people recipes hobbies etc generally speaking this is permissible there's nothing wrong in that now if you want to go into a bit deeper answer I would advise you not to show others anything personal about you because as humans we have the tendency to show off as humans we enjoy being under the spotlight being famous people talking about us in a positive way usually and sometimes even if in a negative way this is human nature so many times youngsters come and ask me share how can I be like you and I say what what do you mean by this and they say we would like to become famous and I say don't if you want to please a large there were gel then go ahead and learn knowledge practice it and preach it for the sake of allah azzawajal not for the sake of being famous Imam Shafi may Allah have mercy on his soul used to say I wish that all the people on earth benefitted from my books and none of these books were attributed to me meaning he would have loved to be anonymous but benefitting the whole world he doesn't want Fame he doesn't want to be known this in contrast to one of the scholars long back who asked about another scholars book where he had mentioned the famous and the deviant scholars of his times so it's like see our alum and new Bela it's a book where this scholar came and listed all the scholars at his ERA who whom were good and also those whom were deviant and bad so the other scholar asked people who read the book where did he put my name did he put my name with the good scholars or with the bad scholars and they said no he did not mention you at all in that book so he regretted that and he was sad for that and he said I wish that he had men in my name even with the deviant scholars subhanAllah it doesn't matter whether people think good or bad about you all what matters is that you are famous it was reported also that a man once came in the season of hajj with a bag of human waste or animal manure and his intention was to smear and tarnish the curtains of the Kaaba people got hold of him before he did his heinous act and beated him and took him to the Muslim judge to sentence him so the judge said subhanAllah are you a Muslim suspecting that a Muslim would do such a thing to the Kaaba and the men said yes I am so they just said to him why did you attempt to do such a thing and the man said I wanted to be remembered even if people remembered me through cursing me and this is our biggest problem nowadays we have celebrities we have even students of knowledge or dyes who go and look for weird things in the books of Sunna or in the heritage of scholars and they take these weird things and they present them to the public causing outrage among the scholars among the students of knowledge and looking up what is this what's this nonsense just to be famous one of them that is I remember who used to say lots of these weird things wanting publicity used to say all what I want in this world is for the CNN to interview me a star for Allah a day does this in a nutshell wanting Fame and recognition breaks a person's back it's a burden that you will carry on your shoulders not only in this life but also on the day of judgement where Allah will hold you accountable for every single thing that you have said or done and this is what scares me most when people starts to blog or vlog with the V when you see people on Instagram or snapchat and they're exposing themselves just to get more subscribers more viewership and more comments this is what fuels them and in the process you end up by indulging in so many haram things exposing sins backbiting people making yourself a target for evil i yes if you are a chaff or a cook and you simply spread your recipes there's nothing wrong in that if you share with people reflections about life about beneficial things there's no problem in that once you get personal once you start to talk about your family your loved ones your personal experiences and you get recognition and you look forward for more and more this is when it is problematic and Allah knows best"
