  "transcript": "what does it mean that only allah can guide us like don't we say the best is the best guidance is the guidance of the prophet salallahu again this is a misunderstanding due to the fact that people do not acquire proper knowledge from the quran from the sunnah so they come to one particular issue and they start to overthink and cascade it over other things without looking at the other evidences that would give them a better understanding so do we say that the best of guidance is the guidance of of the prophet that's true how is it possible that only allah guides the guidance of the prophet islam is part of allah's guidance what's the problem the concept of guidance the people do not understand it properly and this is why people have to go back to the fundamentals to the quran to the sunnah to understand them with the understanding of the self of the righteous predecessors what do the righteous predecessors say if you look at the quran you will find that there is a verse where allah says do not guide whomever you wish whomever you love rather it's allah who guides whomever he wishes so here allah says you do not guide to his messenger in another verse allah says you guide to a straight path that come on what is this see if you don't have knowledge with the right understanding of the pre righteous predecessors you'll go astray and the vast majority of people nowadays are going astray because they just simply jump the wagon they see an ayah they act upon it and they say no no i have understanding i only apply the quran and they are ignorant imbeciles they don't know arabic they don't know the quran they don't memorize the quran they don't even know what's in the quran they just come to one single ayah and that's it okay what about the hadith i don't believe in the hadith what do you want from such imbeciles nothing so again how can we combine it's very easy the guidance is divided into two types guidance of direction and guidance of compliance so i have the power to guide you okay if you go right you'll go to mecca if you go to the left you'll go to london now i've guided you in the sense that i've given you the direction where to go is not within my grasp or authority this is up to you wherever allah guides you if you want to go for umrah allah will open and expand your heart you'll go for umrah if you want to go to nightclubs and and and bars and pubs you'll go elsewhere so this is not within my reach likewise the prophet assalam came to humanity he told them this is heaven and this is hell this is what leads to heaven and this is what leads to hell his own uncle abu talib lived for so many years with the prophet salam and he know he knew that he was saying the truth and that he was a messenger of allah the prophet tried his level best alison to guide him to accept islam but he would not accept it and he died as a kafir and this is why when the prophet felt sad for him allah revealed this first ayah you do not guide whom you love rather allah guides whomever he wishes and wills so this is the guidance of the prophet and when the prophet says the best of guidance is the guidance of muhammad islam which means islam which also translates to the best of etiquette the best of lifestyle the best of sunnah and way is the way of the prophet so guidance here could be guidance to islam it can be the way of living the best way of living is the way of the prophet as hassan in all aspects and i hope this answers your question"
