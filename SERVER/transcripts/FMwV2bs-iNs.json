  "transcript": "fausan from indonesia he says his mother disagrees with the concept of harar and this is an issue we spoke about laundry to have a contract with a laundry service where they charge you a hundred dollars a month regardless of how many you bring them of clothes so you can bring them one piece and you can bring them the whole neighborhood they'll do it happily this is and this is ambiguity that islam prohibits you have to be specific if i tell you and this is one of the transactions that the prophet mentioned by name that if you enter your hand in my pocket whatever is in it is for one euro you may find a piece of diamond and you may find nothing this is rather it's like gambling so his mother logics it and says no this is not uh clear because when we hire a maid she works for eight hours usually some maids in some other countries where they don't have such labor laws they take a monthly salary to work a full 30 days in the house cleaning cooking ironing and the amount of work goes up and down so isn't this hard there is no it's not hara she knows that she's going to clean a particular house the rather is when i give her a thousand dollars and i ask her to clean this house in that house and that house and that house and that house which is something that humans can't do and i say i'm giving you a thousand dollars a month this is not permissible this is not halal while working eight hours and in these specific eight hours she's supposed to do a particular number of tasks that is known to people there's nothing wrong and there's no similarity between the two cases i'm saying"
