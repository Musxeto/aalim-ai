  "transcript": "brother fad from Bangladesh says is it not recommended to speak or to talk after Isa prayer there was a Hadith where the Prophet used to hate sleeping before Isa and speaking after it now the prophet Alam hated it either because it is something that he didn't like not necessarily that it is un Islamic but he preferred to not sleep between M and not that it is Haram rather because those who sleep between M and would definitely either miss or they would pray on time but they would won't be able to sleep until 1 or 2 a.m. which may jeopardize their fer prayer so the norm is you sleep after likewise talking after this is permissible there are so many hadiths where the Prophet Alam spoke after Isa where the companions used to come after Isa and host their guests like in the Hadith of Abu Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him and his guests who he had sent to his house and the brawl took place between him and his son for not feeding them until he came Etc all of these Hadith and there's so many indicate that it is not prohibited it is not something that is disliked unless it leads to something that might be disliked or Haram so if people and this is the norm everywhere almost speak after Isa they dine after Isha they chitchat maybe until 10 11 maybe 12:00 uh midnight and then they retire and they are capable of waking an a good hour before fer praying tud and reading the Quran and then praying fjer on time there's no problem in that none whatsoever"
