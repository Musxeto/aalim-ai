  "title": "Who should pay zakat on gold that a husband bought for his wife? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he buys gold for his wife and salah here he's not obliged to do that but he is kind and he's loving and he's caring and he can afford that so his wife should take good care of him he Shama and he's asking who has to pay the zakat because his wife doesn't work first of all it's an issue of dispute whether the gold that is worn and people put it on does it require zakat or not in the most authentic opinion as we've mentioned this before is that any gold that you keep whether you wear it or not there is a cat in it and this is the most authentic opinion of scholars now when you buy something for your wife it is her duty because that the gold is hers so it's a gift from you whether she sells it all she keeps it this is up to her she has the right to do whatever she wants it she's the one who's obliged to pay the zakat but if she cannot afford it and she authorizes you and you do this from your own money as a gift alhamdulillah may Allah reward you this is acceptable if you don't want to she's obliged to sell some of it so that she could pay for the 2.5% of the zakat"
