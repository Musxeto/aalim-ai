  "transcript": "ald [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] m for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it was reported inl [Music] byd may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the prophet sallallah alai wasam said he is successful he is successful who has accepted Islam who has been provided with sufficient provision for his want and life and been made contented by Allah with what he has given him in this great Hadith which was reported in one of the most authentic books on Earth after the Quran Muslim the prophet is directing us to the meaning of success because nowadays we tend to feel and believe that success can be only attained by The Villa you live in or the car you drive or your six or seven digits bank account other than that you are a loser the prophet was sent to redirect us to put us on the straight path and to remove the vagueness and the cloudiness in front of our sights so he tells us he is successful who oh prophet of Allah the first thing is in Arabic he has become successful who Embraces Islam so this is the first characteristic of a successful person to be a Muslim which means that any non-muslim by all types of means and measures is not successful even if he's the most richest on Earth the healthiest the strongest the most knowledgeable awarded by Noble or any other prizes in the eyes of Allah in the sight of Islam he is not successful so without Islam you are not successful and Islam means that you submit inside and out your will to Allah so you are like a feather in the wind whatever Allah tells you you comply no questions asked you submit your will your life your family your wealth your health everything in accordance to what Allah wants not in accordance to what you desire Allah says Be straight beautiful as you were instructed not as you desired this is true practice of Islam and everyone who's not a Muslim he is a cafir you don't have something in between you either a Muslim or a CAF and the majority of Muslims are in great danger so don't feel relaxed just because your ID card says you're a Muslim this doesn't mean anything because you have to look into your practices Allah says in the Quran and most of them believe not in Allah without associating other partners with him and this is the reality of Muslims of grave worshippers of Saint worshippers of companion worshippers of worshippers of the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam who depend on him who go to the graves to darkas to whatever who believe and deal with black magic with so many things that corrupts your faith or nullifies it totally then the prophet says who has been provided with sufficient Provisions for his want for his desires for his needs for his life so this is the second characteristic and if you look carefully at what the prophet said he says who is provided with sufficient what is this word directing us to when we work we work hard to become the richest to become the most influential to become the highest in our jobs and positions and this is not wrong by itself but if this prerogative of yours if this objective of yours diverts you from the straight path then you are in great danger and the majority of Muslims have been diverted from the from their final destination when you ask an individual where is your final destination he says the great this is wrong your final destination is either J or hell where do you want to be all of us want to be in Paradise in Jenna with the prophet are we working hard to do this no we have been diverted from our objective not only that we have even been diverted with this duny from taking care of our health from taking care of our children from taking care of our families from everything that is good for for us because we have been Blinded By the Light and the glitter of this dun and the prophets the best of Allah's creation what was his Dua he used to say oh Allah make the provisions of Muhammad's family sufficient just to sustain life he would not ask for valleys of gold and if he did Allah would have granted him he did not ask for a lot of wealth and if he did Allah would surely give it to him but he wanted what was sufficient to sustain life and that is why he used to take only food and grain of one year which he would spend in less than couple of weeks and then stay the whole year spend of course in the cause of Allah and spend the rest of the year not having enough food to eat to the extent that mother AA says that a month and another month would pass by the household of the Prophet Without fire being lit in it we have breakfast lunch dinner and three meals in between and it's all with fries and and and and and baked and real food and their food was water and dates for two months the prophet food so now if this is what he's asking for and we know where he is now so what are we asking for today and where will we be tomorrow the prophet tells us in an authentic Hadith every single day when the sun goes up two angels by its side say now when the Angels supplicate Allah answers so what is the supplication of these two angels every time the sun goes up every morning they say oh people come to your lord for what is little for what is little and sufficient is far better than what is a lot but would distract you and this is the reality this is what they're calling you for come to Allah to what GRS you closer because sufficient is enough it's better than a lot that would distract you how many THS do I have in my wardrobe 10 how many can I wear at a time one how much food do I have in my my fridge a lot maybe 10 chickens how can I eat at a time maybe half how many cars do I possess 100 how many time how many can I ride at a time only one so little sufficient enough much better than a lot that would distract you but the prophet says and when the Sun goes down they say these two angels say oh Allah give him more who spends for your sake and bring destruction to one who withholds spending so they make this da when was the last time you gave for Allah's sake and when was the last time you withheld the happiest person on earth is a Muslim but not every Muslim is Happy the happiest of Muslims are those who have enough provision in their houses that sustains the night and we have enough that sustains maybe the next five or six years in the house not in the bank account and who has a house to live in and we all have houses nobody lives in the street or in a tent and who has a wife that is righteous and pleasing to him and this is debatable and we all know that the happiest among all are are those who are debt free unfortunately a lot of Muslims live on debts so the house is on mortgage my car is in installments my furniture I have to pay an or they will take it and confiscate it my children's schol I pay every month we living off debts and this means a lot of worries and depression but the happiest is a Muslim who is free of all of that un unfortunately we live in this life not knowing of our objective not knowing of our destiny we live as if we will never die the prophet Give an example to this dun with our food and gave our food an example to this Dunya this is aith authentic Hadith he says Allah gave an example to this life with the food of humans no matter how they decorate it they put salt and spices on it at the end product it looks very delicious this is dun eat it and look what it becomes after a couple hours when you go to the toilet this is the reality of dun that we are so impressed of you buy the latest model of 2015 and you ride it 6 months later somebody buys a newer model and you feel like you are riding trash and you're sad you depressed whatever you see you see is better than what you have why because you are in this dun dun is not condemned dun is not looked down upon because it's D it's looked down upon if it holds you back from progressing to Jenna if you if it makes you do sins if it makes you do Haram if you do not fulfill your duties and obligations to Allah Asel in this case we look down at dun other than that this dun is our step that we put our foot on to rise to Paradise I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness for you and me so ask Allah for forgiveness the third characteristic first one is to become a Muslim second one is to have sufficient provision the third one the prophet says Alam who has been made contented by what Allah has given him contempt or with whatever Allah decrees to you is definitely one of the means of attaining happiness because even if you have enough even if you have whatever you need or more and you're a Muslim if you're not content W you will never be happy even if you were a multi-billionaire even if you have your own own jet you will find people who have better Jets or more Jets than you if you're not content you'll never happy you will never be happy if you're the poorest person on Earth with content you are the happiest person on Earth with the grace of Allah by Nature human beings are ungrateful they are ignorant Allah as Allah describes them at the end ofah they are wrongdoers and they are ungrateful they do not show their gratitude to Allah subhanahu wa tala however Islam came to fix this to make to make us grateful to whatever Allah gives us and that's why a Muslim is always content no matter where he is no matter what calamities fall upon his head he's always is happy and he knows Allah chooses only the best for us and that is why when it comes to Provisions when it comes to worldly matters a real Muslim never looks up he looks always below so if he has a car if he's not content he would say even if my car is the latest model I know people who have two cars my car is a sports car I know someone who has a sports a for 4x4 car or he has a a big truck or he has a plane oh but if you're content with your car even if it's 1951 model you will be happy because others don't have a car they have motorcycles and if you ride on a motorcycle others have bicycles and if you have a bicycle people have no means of transportation except their feet so I'm better than them and those who walk they are grateful to Allah because there are people on wheelchair and those who are on wheelchair they are grateful because somebody is totally paralyzed and cannot move and even those who are totally paralyzed they are grateful and thankful to Allah that he has given them the blessing of Islam and they call him and pray to him day and night be content of whatever you find and have and you will live a good life this is how may Allah be pleased with him interprets a good life what is a good life Allah says in the Quran whoever Works righteousness whether male or female while he or she is a True Believer of Islamic monism verily to him we will give a good life what is a good life IM Ali says it is content once you are happy with whatever Allah brings you you are the happiest and Su most successful F of all and that is why the prophet says richness does not mean having a lot wealth is not having a lot of cash rather richness is content when you're happy when you fulfilled when you're satisfied with whatever little you have you are the richest person on Earth unfortunately those who are not content their worries would be a lot they are always depressed of things that they miss of things that they cannot achieve and they always gloomy and grumpy and you find this in their houses it affects negatively all those who live around them as for the Affairs of a Muslim when it comes to the the the matters of of paradise they never never look down in in matters of D we look down to appreciate Allah's favor upon us but when it comes to matters of of we always look up so that you strive and try your level best to elevate more and more to get closer to Allah we have the opposite in D we look up I want to become a CEO if you become a CEO I would like to become the owner I'd like to become this and that you never content of this D when it comes to why don't you pray in the Masid I'm better than a lot of the people I know this man who does not pray at all and if you go to the man who does not pray why don't you pray he said I'm better than a lot of people my neighbor drinks alcohol and if you go to the brother don't drink alcohol he said I know a friend who does drugs and if you go to the man who does drug this is har he said at least I say I know Christians and Jews and it goes down and down and down until you reach the level ofan that is why always in the Affairs of look up and you will strive to do this and when you die you will have the highest levels of Jen may Allah grant me and you the highest level of jenah and make us with the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam in jenah I'm going to do my supplications in Arabic because I don't know how to do it in English so it's all safe and and and good in just say I mean and trust [Music] me for [Music]"
