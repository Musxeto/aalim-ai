  "transcript": "brother Daanish says is outsourcing halal this is a generic question if the job itself is halal then we can look into it so if some way is outsourcing an interest based loan this is Haram if someone is outsourcing construction of a church a synagogue or a bar for example this for us Muslims is Haram because this is collaborating on something that is evil so if the work itself is halal constructing a school is outsourcing the contract that I was awarded permissible for me I go to the government they gave me a contract of let's say 20 million dollars to build a big complex of schools I take it can i outsource it there are a number of things that govern this first of all does the government allow outsourcing some companies some entities or government institutions would clearly state in the contract that you may not outsource the work to another company this is done with as long as I signed the contract I have to honor it if they don't stipulate such a condition in this case I can outsource providing and this is a big condition providing that the company that is being outsourced or being used has fulfill the exact conditions and quality of work that were mentioned in the contract the original contract and this is very important we have a problem in the Muslim world where the government gives a contract let's say of a hundred year million euros to a company I outsource it for 80 million which means 2 million at 20 million is in my pocket the other company gives it to a third world company for 50 million and this third world company distributes it to other smaller companies and gets five millions out of it and the rest it gives it to these little fish companies at the end of the day a hundred million euros project is being executed for forty five million fifty five millions are distributed among the outsourcers and forty five is the actual cost what kind of quality do you expect trash this is logical you pay peanuts you get monkeys so this is what's happening in the Muslim world where there is no check and balance when you have corruption that is spreading everywhere everything is done under the table and there is not a single honest man who can stand up and say that this is haram what are you guys doing these guys are not qualified to run the show and they're becoming richer and richer by the day but this is what's happening so again outsourcing with these conditions is totally legit and permissible if you are a plumber and you were asked to do work or a project in a house and you bring someone you know who would charge a little bit less but would do exact work with excellent quality if not better and you make some money out of it there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
