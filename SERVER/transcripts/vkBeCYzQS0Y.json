  "title": "Congregational dua for dead after fard prayer & people say Ameen, is it permissible? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sh I wanted to make a little correction I realize I made a mistake my question of last week I said that the Imam wanted to repeat the prayer what I meant to say that he said he wanted to make a congregational Dua and that he instructed us to say a mean that's what I wanted to ask is this permissible or not after the congregational prayer yes after the after the H prayer here he wanted us to make a congregational Dua for the dead person yeah no this is not permissible this is an innovation again and this is not permissible to make congregational Dua after Salat and ask people to say aan as I uh uh stated before if we want to make Dua we make Dua in our own prayers when in suud or after salutation upon the prophet and before concluding the Salat with Salam these are the two places where the Prophet himself recommended us to make Dua so to come and say no we would like to make Dua after the Salat and make it in congregation and say a mean that would be an innovation and Allah Knows Best"
