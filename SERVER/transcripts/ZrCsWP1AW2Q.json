  "transcript": "yes I have a question lecture local about about and I have some confusion the was talking about about Jihad CC was talking about goak the issues of I do not speak about them without research this is Quran this is not something to be taken lightly and to speak about it without going back and making sure that what you say is correct because you're speaking on behalf of Allah so you cannot shoot from the hip first of all second of all issues of jihad at the moment this is not the time to speak about them on such a public platform because the pros are far less than the cons when you want to speak about great import important issues like this if it's not going to hamper your work your Daw your teaching to people so be it other than that this is not logical and uh uh unpractical and Allah Knows Best"
