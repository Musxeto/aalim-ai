  "transcript": "from the emirates he says if i were praying the sunnah and the adhan is called so how i would think of it either he was praying the sunnah of lohur the two sunnahs after the and while he was praying the adam of asir is called so is his sunna valid or not if he accomplished and finished one rakah then it is valid if he is still in the first rakah and the adan is called it is not considered to be of likewise if i am praying witter and it is just before fajr adan if i am praying two raka's then one rakaat while i'm in my two rakah prayers that is called can i pray my witter the answer is no was my night prayer concluded with wither the answer is no and this is why the prophet said al islam an authentic hadith the prayer of night time is two by two by two but if you fear fajr over one rakah as witter so it has to be done before the adhan of fajr and allah knows best"
