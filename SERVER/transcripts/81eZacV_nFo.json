  "transcript": "isha says i accidentally dropped the quran what is the hidayah or the hadiya i have to give now so isha most likely is asking about the expiation for a person who had dropped the mushaf the quran so a person is holding the quran reading it then he drops it is there any expiration for that the answer is no it's a mistake and so many people have seen them they hold the quran they kiss it and some people go to an extra mile when they offer sujud and they call it the minus so they kiss it and they prostrate on it what is this said no this is a sign of respect no this is a clear innovation no one had ever said that prostrating on the quran is a sign of respect so if you drop the quran there's nothing for you to do except to be more careful"
