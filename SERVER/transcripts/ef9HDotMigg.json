  "transcript": "a sister asks and she says my husband is addicted to porn he does not give me my rights I caught him red-handed he apologized but still he never gives it up and also cheats on me with other women what should I do there are two ways of dealing with this scenario and unfortunately the rate is growing among men who are becoming addicted to watching pornography and this is attributed to a number of factors the greatest among them all is the lack of fear of Allah see knowledge is associated with fear of Allah real knowledge I could be possessing a PhD in Sharia law or interfere I could be one of the greatest days around yet this does not mean that I am knowledgeable of Allah because I have to walk the talk in the sense that if my knowledge does not result in me fearing Allah truly when I'm at public and when I'm on my own then my knowledge is not genuine and it's not authentic the majority of people don't have and possess this knowledge of Allah that results in them feeling Allah Azza WA JAL when they are alone and this is why we find a lot of men and also women who do not have anything to repel them and to stop them from falling into sin if they don't have the fear of Allah so JAL then the sky's the limit and this is why your husband is falling in such a sin so in order to create a solution we need to solve the core of the problem which is being far away from Allah so if you look into scrutinizing your husband thoroughly you'd find that probably he doesn't pray in the masjid or he prays on and off that he does not observe the voluntary prayers he does not fast voluntary he does not do a lot of good deeds and probably there are a number of other sins that he's involved in unfortunately you failed to detect these because they're not usually related to you what's related to you is his addiction to pornography whether he is good or bad with his parents this is his problem you don't ask about this whether he does pray in the message or not this is his personal preference it's between him and Allah but when it comes to pornography and it's something that is related to your own or to your own honor and dignity then you ask about it secondly or thirdly I've lost count who's counting by the way thirdly you have to look into what drives him to watching pornography and a lot of the sisters ask shall I divorce him shall I leave him shall I do it isn't that and I always say this is not the solution addiction to pornography is a problem but is not a major problem like fornication or committing adultery however in my opinion if you do your job as a wife and truly exhaust him in bed through your own ways of making it lucrative and seductive but really exhausting him in bed he will not think of watching any of this filth again the moment he opens it he says River it is nothing to watch I'm satisfied I'm fulfilled sexually but when he is in dire need and you're always having a headache and you are always having problems then this is problem take I"
