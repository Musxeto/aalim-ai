  "title": "Are people who consider halal things haram & vice versa commiting kufr? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "zadeed from bangladesh he says we know that whoever considers and he has the conviction of that that this would nullify his islam so someone who believes that drinking intoxicants wine alcohol whiskey he believes it's not haram though he doesn't drink it but he said it's not logical why would it be haram why would doing drugs be haram allah brought it from the ground it's allah azza who made opium grow or or cannabis or whatever so we we're smoking it we're doing it it's halal even if he doesn't do it he gets out of the fold of islam providing that the conditions have been fulfilled not immediately what does that mean this is a problem and a mistake that most muslims fall in if you do this you become a kafir it's not as simple as this one plus one equals two there are conditions to be fulfilled and some people come and say well sheikh is said in the ten points that nullify or break your islam is this this is not quran this is from this great imam but when he stated it you have to go into the explanation what the scholars say not simply because you don't think that a kafir is a kafir you're an immediately kafir maybe you have misconceptions misinterpretations mistakes and ignorance so you have to be careful very careful careful before you start shooting and the issue of um make thinking is usually something that nullifies islam if the conditions are fulfilled so if someone says i know in is in the quran it says that fornication is a major sin and it's mentioned in three four ayas at the prophet as as i mentioned that it was one of the major sins i personally believe that it's okay this is kufr because he acknowledges in the quran in the sunnah yet he rejects it this is there's no need to explain anything there's no need need to say but because this is clear when you come to masturbation is it something that all scholars agree upon dance there is no so if someone says that it's halal would we say that he's a kafir the answer is no because it's an issue of dispute and this person saying it's halal most likely is following some of the scholars who may say that it is makru or it is permissible when needed and not necessarily when it's haram so you have to be careful when you talk about these things"
