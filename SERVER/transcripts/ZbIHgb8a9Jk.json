  "transcript": "Harris says is it permissible to work as a food delivery person in a non-muslim country the job itself Harris is okay what's not okay is the food you deliver so if you ask me this question and rephrase it by saying is it permissible for me to deliver how long food the answer is no is it permissible for me to deliver only halal food answer is definitely yes what about if it's mixed if it's makes this harm again because you cannot deliver and assist people on doing Haram and by delivering pork or non halal products to people even if there are non-muslims you are contributing you are collaborating with them on their sin and makes you sinful as well"
