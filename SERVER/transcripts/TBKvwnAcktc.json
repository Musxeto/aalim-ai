worked and the plan he made succeeded in putting the differences is among the Coalition of the Jews of the tribe ofan and of the poist of quray of Mecca and they broke all the alliances between them and they've decided to go back to their countries when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam saw this he said to his companions now we invade them and they would never ever invade us again and this is was a prophecy from the prophet Alat wasam and this is exactly what took place after the battle of alh of the trench it was time for the Muslims to attack not to wait for them to come and attack Islam's capital in Medina when the prophet Alat wasam went to his house ready to get out of the fighting gear he met the Archangel Gabriel peace be upon him telling him that the angels have not taken off their fighting gear because our mission is not yet over and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam instructed his army of 3,000 men to go and surround the village of bani the tribe of the Jews who betrayed the prophet alhat wasam and who broke all the treaties and agreements with the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam and who were aiming to participate in attacking and fighting and annihilating Islam and the Muslims so this meant that they had to pay and they had to pay P dearly because their action was so severe and serious had they succeeded in what they were planning Islam would have not existed anymore the land had to be cleansed and purified from bani they did not learn from bani nor from bani so the third one had to be the last and final one the Muslims surrounded B and it took them 25 days surrounding them and the funny thing is the Muslims were surrounded a while ago by the pothus by the armies and by the Jews and now Subhan Allah they have the upper hand and they are themselves surrounding the table was turned the tables were turned but the thing that was surprising was the Muslims were in the same boat the poist were few days ago in the sense that the Muslims were in cold hunger and they did not have any to supply them with food and so on while the Jews were inside with all their Farms with all all the their Provisions with all their weals so they could have gone on and on and they didn't have anything to force them to surrender but Subhan Allah it is the terror and fear that Allah casted in their hearts any logical person would have agreed to stay in their fortresses and and their castles and their secure buildings they have their Provisions they have their food and water no need for them to surrender but 25 days and they could not go anymore and they decided to give up and surrender to the army of the Prophet alhat wasam it was the terror and fear thrown into their hearts now their leader Assad when he saw that they were surren that they were uh uh under Siege gathered their dignitaries and told them listen I've advised you before and you didn't listen so I'm going to give you choices you pick one the first choice let us all revert to Islam and accept this religion of Allah and then we will have our lives spared and our children and wives will be safe and sound because if this happens the prophet Sall wasallam would accept them as Muslims and nothing would happen and they rejected that they said you crazy leaving our religion and our belief to this innovated religion the new one no way so he told him the second choice is that we trick the Muslims on a Sabbath when it's Saturday because when it's Saturday they know that the Jews do not attack and do not go out so we pretend that we are in our Sabbath and then we launch our offensive in surprise so they said no way we always honor our Sabbath even if we die we're not going to play with our Sabbath so at the end the third choice Jews come on have your heads have your brains in your heads and think this is a serious thing this is we're not playing here so he told them that the third choice was let's kill with our own swords our wives and children and launch at the prophet Alat until we die with his companions let's launch at them and the setting was ready because they had all the arm armor and they had all the Weaponry though they were uh uh below the number of the Muslims yet they had no choice It's that or death so even this they did not agree to so their the leader of bani said that you are a hopeless case and get ready to die after 25 days the Jews sent to the prophet Alat wasam requesting their Ally a companion of the Prophet by the name of abuaba they told him send us Abu lubaba let us negotiate with him and see a way out of this crisis we're in so abuaba came abuaba had his wife and children in the same Village of bani so he was very close to them he wasn't a Jew but his house his farm was there so they asked abuaba what do you think you see what crisis we're we're in it's it's difficult times and we don't know what to do we're confused what do you think should we accept the ruling of the Prophet Alam on us whatever he rules we accept it abuaba said yes and he showed them this movement meaning yes accept it and it would be your NE he's going to slaughter you and abuaba was a companion of the Prophet alham what was he thinking of he tells us that immediately after after saying this I realized that I've betrayed Allah and I've betrayed the prophet Alat wasam I left them and went straight to Medina I was so confused I went to one pillar of the Masjid of the Medina and I tied myself really tight and said by Allah I will not untie myself until it is the prophet of Allah who unti me because I have sinned greatly the people went to the prophet Salli wasallam and told him Abu exposed us and he told the Jews that we will slaughter them and he tied himself out of repentance in one of the pillars of the mosque and said that no one will untie him except you the prophet Sall wasallam said had he come to me I would have asked Allah for forgiveness but because he did what he did then I see that I will not do anything until it is Allah the almighty who comes and releases him through a revelation so coming back to the situation the Muslims yes did you would you say he did this out of sympathy seeing the Jews helpless and you know as a human being anyone who's helpless and defenseless coming to you for advice unfortunately sometimes people do things without thinking when he went to the Jews and they were so close to him they were his neighbors they were his allies and at the same time they brought their children and women and they were all in crying and and and and in tears he felt soft to them so they're asking him in a very nice and humble and humiliated way that what do you think should we accept the r the ruling of the Prophet Al am when he answered them yes and he pointed and indicated that it's Slaughter he was not actually betraying Allah or the prophet Alam because he knew that this was inevitable he knew that this is going to happen sooner or later all what he wanted to hint to them that it's over so there's no way for you to fight but even that was not permissible and if he committed an act of treason the prophet would not have excused him but the prophet realized that it was done unintentionally he said something and he indicated something else which means that it was not intentionally made the prophet Alat wasam and the companions were at the weakest link they didn't have any food or water with them they were on the offensive side which meant that they were anticipating while the Jews were in their fortresses with their food and water yet Allah Asel threw the fear in their heart and what the straw that broke the camels back when they heard was when they heard Talib along with zu a and both of them were the bravest soldiers of Islam they came to the fence of the Fortress of the Jews and Ali shouted oh Battalion oh Detachment of faith and belief come to me because by Allah I will open this Fortress or I will taste what ham ABD mutb tasted I believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right [Music] back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Alman each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] subh and welcome back now just before the break the last strw that broke the camel's back was when the Jews heard Ali AB Talib shouting just outside their fences calling the Muslims saying oh Battalion oh Detachment of faith and belief come to me because by Allah I either would open the gates of this Fortress or taste what ham ABD mutalib tasted what did Hamza taste marom martom he died at the side of Allah so Ali is saying that I'm here to die or I will open the Fortress of B when they heard this they were so terrified that they lift and and and and held the White Flag saying no more they opened their doors and they surrendered to the Muslims the prophet alhat wasam ordered his Brave solder Muhammad Muslim the man that executed so many missions for the for the prophet Alat wasam and who managed to assassinate Muhammad Muslim was responsible for separating the men from the women and children and he tied them all up so they were about 600 to 700 men all Warriors and the tribe of a from the ansar came to the prophet Alat wasam and said oh prophet of Allah we're Muslims and these Jews are our allies remember what you did to B when abdah came to you and requested that you spare them and you Spar them for him Abdullah is from K the other faction of the ansar so because you allowed him and permitted him to spare the Jews from now we request that you do the same with B so the prophet Sall Ali wasallam told them would you accept and be happy if I appoint one of you to judge them and to give his verdict in them they said yes of course so he told them what about if I appoint your leader and one of your top men they've agreed and they accepted that because they know they knew that s was fair and he was their leader so the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam sent to call S and as you you recall was s healthy well he was injured from the previous battle yes he was injured from the Battle of aland of the trench few days ago and he was not in injured straight fighting he was thrown with an arrow that cut one of his arteries and one of his veins in his arm and it kept on bleeding and bleeding the prophet sallam tried so many things with him all the companions tried so many things with him he himself said oh Allah I pray and supplicate to you if Victory would be to Islam and the Muslims let this wound be my end as a martyr but if it's not over yet then let it dry and hold until I'm satisfied with the victory of Islam and the Muslims and oh Allah do not let me die until I can see your wrath on bani on the Jews who betrayed their agreements and did not honor them with the prophet alhat wasam so the prophet sent for S and they brought him and he was being carried by his companions when he saw him coming the prophet Sall wasallam told them go and help your master down from his ride and they brought him to the Magus to the Gathering where he had the Jews and the prophet s wasallam and the Companions and the prophet told him s I'd like you to judge and to give us your verdict and what the Jews have done so he looked at the Jews and told them would you accept whatever verdict I give to you the Jew said yes we would and he looked at the side of the Prophet alham but he could not look at the prophet in the eyes in the eye because he respected the prophet sallallah wasallam so he said and would my verdict be applicable no matter what to this side and the prophet said yes it would s on his way to this court was approached by so many of his tribe saying s be lenient s be soft come on these are our allies they have they were our supporters throughout time and he would not answer them from their face from his face they realized and they knew his verdict so they went back to their people telling them may Allah substitute to better allies because they are considered to be history so s said my verdict is that the fighters the men of the Jews from bani are to be executed all of them and the women and the children children are to be enslaved and The Prophet saidat wasam by Allah you have ruled in them with the ruling of Allah from the seventh heaven which meant that this is exactly the ruling of Allah these Fighters these men were brought to a big trench that was duck for them and they were all beheaded and buried in that Trench and by that the rule of Allah has been has been applied the fighters were all executed because of their treason of course the tribe or the branch of the tribe of bani that did not fight were spared B because they did not break any treaties and they did not uh uh try to kill or attack the Muslims but obviously at the time they themselves before pleading with sad knew or had an idea that this is was a great crime so they took her a warning beforehand of course they were smart enough to honor the agreements with the prophet Alam and they were smart enough to have witness what happened throughout the previous years with their Brethren and so it was time for them to realize that we will not do anything that would jeopardize our relationship with the Muslims and that is why they were spared now after all of this had finished they've collected the booty and they found that they had 1,500 swords ready to attack the Muslims and now it's the booty of Islam and the Muslims and three 100 Shields and 2,000 Spears and a lot of armor and a lot of furniture and and plates and and camels and sheep all of this was granted to the Muslims by the grace of Allah Asel because of the treason and betrayal of the Jews after all of this had ended Allah answered the supplication of s his wound was so small and Tiny and after the Jews were executed it broke up again and he started bleeding and he passed away he died as a martyr when where the Prophet Sall wasallam had given us the Glad Tidings about him and he said that s died and the Throne of the of Allah the almighty is trembling with joy because of his approach and he's coming to Paradise the prophet tells usat wasam that his napkins in Paradise are far greater than what all what's in this life and this world the prophet felt very sad for the death of his great companion sad and as the Muslims were carrying his funeral to the barrial ground to the graveyard the Hypocrites started talking and and saying it's so light what is this and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told them that it was carried by the angels of Allah the almighty and that why that is why it felt so light in that year some of the main events that took place the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam married his cousin Z bin jash and her mother was the aunt of the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam from his father's side now marrying cousins is okay in Islam and lots of the people in the west consider this not to be acceptable though there is no verse from the Quran or Hadith or not even from the Bible itself that forbids marrying the cousin so it's okay to do so the prophet Alam married his cousin Z J who was married to his adopted son Z and this was also mentioned in Surah where it was considered to be a big thing and it's a sin to marry your daughter-in-law but Allah wanted to prove to the world that there is no adoption and Zade though he was the adopted son of the Prophet s wasallam that that was not acceptable or applicable anymore he is not the son of the prophet and that is why the prophet married Zab B J I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time [Music] m m [Music]"
