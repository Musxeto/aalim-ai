  "transcript": "Rehana raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in wala al ajillo sabe o many today we had a Western Division that EEO Medina amar assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato the reply of the salaam shows that there are good students of Sher Singh masha'Allah my students don't do this usually may I welcome you for this however for this lecture and inshallah it will not bore you to death but at least we will Hashanah tried our level best to gain as much reward as we can people are outside doing things Allah only knows about you are here coming to listen to the Quran and to the Sunna and to learn the Deen for there is no comparison so inshallah we'll make it as easy as possible with the grace of Allah Azza WA JAL the title of the lecture is balance but such titles are hugely misleading because balance in Saudi Arabia is different than balance in Sweden for example the things that they think is balance we think that it is extreme and the thing that we think is bad as they think that it is extreme so first of all we have to set the ground rules and the ground rules are that Islam is a religion of balance no one can doubt this because it is the verdict of Allah Azza WA JAL can you question Allah Allah subhana WA Ta'ala says vaca delica John Newcombe Oh matin wausau thought thus we have made you adjust or a balanced nation so Allah so Allah is the one who made this balance now in order to have an idea of the meaning of balance because sometimes people have different views Muslims about balance and this is due to the fact that not all Muslims are 100% true Muslims and this is not from me this is the saying of the prophet alayhi al-salam who told us that the Ummah of Muhammad will be divided into 73 division sects cults all of them are in hell except one so this is problematic am i from that one and all of you are not or are you all from that one and I am NOT how would I know how would I come to know if I'm from the saved sect or not the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam gave me this gave us a description he said they are the Gemara so they are the majority but his majority measured by number by quantity or by quality even master owed may Allah be pleased with him the companion of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam said l-jamaa is what coincides with the truth even if you were alone secondly and this means that what matters is the quality not how many are there and because Allah Azza WA JAL tells us in the Quran women octoroon se well o hasta be meaning even if you try your level best the majority of people will not believe Allah says this so it's not the quantity it is the quality and that is why Allah Azza WA JAL described ibrahim peace be upon him to be an ummah he was an ummah what is the meaning of oma anyone knows nation this is one of the meanings of OMA or Anne Alonzo gel mentions the word Ummah in four different meanings one of them is an imam in Ibrahim Akana um matin Ibrahim was an imam someone to be followed a leader and at the time of Ibrahim there was not a single Muslim on earth except him yet Allah described him as an Ummah soap was but was he the majority or not he was on the truth so he was a single person among all the Kafar another meaning of the word Ummah is time and this is mentioned in surah use of what dakara by the Ummah the man who was in jail and was set free he remembered after a while a period of time a third meaning of Ummah is religion in now agenda Abba and Allah Ummah we have found our forefathers on a religion and the fourth and last meaning of the word Ummah mentioned in the Quran is a nation a group of people as in Surat al qasas Ummah 10 min Anna's he found a group of people trying to water their flock and cattle so in short in order for you to be among the Ummah the saved Ouma the balanced OMA you have to coincide with the truth with the heart which only comes from or an and sunnah and that is why if you look at Islam the religion not at the Muslims the people who practice it if you look at the essence of Islam not a single kafir would reject it but when they look at us how we practice it they will definitely think that this is not valid religion Islam is a religion of balance it addresses the soul as well as the body and this is why whoever works on purifying his soul he will be elevated close to the level of the Angels and those who only serve their bodies and neglect the purity of the heart and of the soul they will descend and go down until they're close to animals and that is why if you look at the people of the West or the disbelievers in general what do they pursue their lusts their desires they do anything to fulfill the desires of the body and that is why they are taking off their clothes they're becoming nude this is jahiliya and also if you go to the jungles of Africa you will also find them without clothes because they are in jahiliya so it's the same civilization but different continent whenever you don't have Islam to uplift your heart to the levels of angels you take off your clothes you want to show and expose and you follow your desires and this balance between the soul and the body is mentioned in so he had Imam Muslim a beautiful hadith you all know it by heart inshallah Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him met one of the companions in his name was ham voila and this is ham voila Al Sadd oral si D is different than ham vallah Abu Armour alga seal the one who died in the battle of hood and the angels washed him between heavens and earth no he's different this is humble a loose ad he met he meets Abu Bakr Abu Bakr what's happening how Allah says hamdallah has become a hypocrite Allah why are you saying this he said well I when we are at the side of the Prophet Allison and listening to the Quran he reminds us of Jannah he reminds us of NAR of El we feel different but the moment we go back our homes we meet our wives our children and our business we do not recognize our hearts anymore Abubakar said well why this is a problem I feel the same way that makes two of us let's go and consult the teacher the more I Lim sallallahu alayhi wasallam so they go to the Prophet and he repeats the same statement and the Prophet said by Allah hand Allah if you were here as you are with your families you will shake hands with the Angels in the streets because the level of Eman is so great and it consistent that you're with me like you are in with your families you will see the angels in broad daylight but an hour and an hour meaning that an hour for your heart to purify it and an hour for halal entertainment not for Allah not an hour for your heart and they go to the disco let's have fun a new party no this is not what the Prophet meant I saw he meant that you have to what you have to attend your things that you have to do for your body eat drink make business make money put food on the table see your children have quality time which is not related to poor aunt of Seir etcetera now how would we know the balance how can we tell it's very easy whatever Quran and Sunna checks the box as being balanced it is balanced whatever the Quran and Sunnah tells us is good it's good and whatever Quran and Sunnah tells us is bad it's bad because your intellect differs with mine people have different orientation they come from different cultures you may think this is good I think it's bad so who will draw the line and tells us no this is extreme and this is balanced it has to come from Allah the Quran and the Sunnah now a beautiful hadith also in the Sahay you all know it inshallah by heart and this hadith has two narrations one a story between salman al-farisi and Abu Darda may Allah be pleased with them all and one with the Prophet Allison and Abdullah have nomnom than us so which one you want okay different opinion between the scholars as usual so we will take we'll take the one with the Prophet that is awesome because wherever the Prophet is there there is Baraka so ramadan allah asks one of the great companions of the prophet a little of ziram who embraced Islam at the eighth year of hijra and he just before Fateh Makkah so he was very late and before that he was a very strong enemy of Islam he becomes a Muslim one of the wisest men of Arabia his son is Abdullah have nominal as one of the great narrators of the hadith Abu Huraira and Abdullah BAM they have equivalent in the number but Abdullah writes and Abu Huraira memorizes so the father finds a beautiful woman from a good lineage of Quraysh and he wedged her to his son Abdullah couple of weeks later he checks on his son's house he meets his daughter-in-law and my daughter how are you she said masha'Allah house Abdullah Oh Abdullah is the finest of all men he sleeps he fasts all day and prays all night mashallah he's the best of Muslims Rama is a smart man when a newly weds fasts all day and prays all night this means that he has no intention to give his wife her rights so a number immediately goes and complaints with the Prophet a little Absalom I would not speak to my son he's a hopeless case if I tell him Sid no no your father you don't pray like I do he looks down at me so I go to the Prophet he goes to the Prophet the Prophet calls him um Abdullah how many days do you fast a month he said o prophet of Allah is fast every single day the whole heal fasting every single day now we come and fast Ramadan sir come the let's finished imagine one more day I would have died but he fast every single day he said no fast only three days a month Oh prophet of Allah I can do more 7 10 15 that's it don't exceed 15 days one day one day off this is the Sunnah and this is the woods fasting Abdullah how many hours do you pray at night is it the whole night sure don't you watch the voice don't you know prophet of Allah and this is astonishing I found here on TV some of I don't know what's country some of our sisters wearing the hijab and singing and dancing and what kind of balance is this sure let's understand balance then we we can apply this anyhow so Abdullah how many hours you pray the full night every what kind of a man is he did he used to sleep at daytime he goes for jihad but he had an objective that is way way way beyond our job description his objective is Jenna so the Prophet told her a lot Oh Sarah not to do that and he told him how long or how what is the way of reciting Quran and he said I finished the Quran once every night from cover to cover now we come in Ramadan I ask brothers in my messages mashallah how many times do you finish the Quran period I said sure I started doing that six years ago in Ramadan but inshallah this Rama bad I will complete it if you open the Quran you'll find dust on it this is a shame this is Allah's words but we are unfortunately not putting effort ah have Nam every single night he finishes it 30 times a month the Prophet said Isis erm no finish it once a month this is the minimum well do so every night she's not I can do more 2010 7 and he stopped at 7 in some narrations he stopped him at 3 and told him he no one can understand it beyond three yeah and he finished it every three days so what's the conclusion the prophet Alastair sallam told him a beautiful statement if we can write it in gold and put it in front of us in all places we go to so that it would be our motto in life that would be good the same statement was said to by Salman to Abu Darda I would complain to the Prophet the Prophet okayed it what is a statement the Prophet said to Abdullah ya Abdullah in early rebecca alayka happen allah has rights over you what are a las rights no heed prayer etc your body in an in another version your eye has rights of you meaning health your guest has rights over you meaning social commitment and your wife your family has rights over you so give all due rights now this is balance I could be the best businessman in the world I can be rich I can be filthy rich I can have huge wonderful hotels like Donald Trump maybe but I will compromise with what with salaat happy Salah tell us or our I have a meeting salat al Madrid well I we have a conference call we cannot answer I raesha so you pray at the end of the night maybe you pray one night and seven days you miss I could be the best athlete and win medals and trophies but I will not see my wife and my children because I'm encamped all the time and I won't be able to make money except if I want soccer player football player they these are the people who make money but badminton you make money badminton nothing the poorest thing look at them skinny masha'Allah date then we will find food to eat me Allah so I'll give them hidaya you I could but and also prayer fasting forget about it I can be the best share praying all night and fasting all day sitting in the message with beads 1000 saying Allah that like some of these people do huh I had a car it's a GMC car it is 1994 model very old mashallah it was always remembering Allah when you turn it Allah Allah beautiful car it and he stayed with me for ages but I had to sell it attend so I can do this but always those who are into religion in the Masjid they don't have money because you don't have time to make business etc so there is always an imbalance I can be Don Juan I can be Casanova with my wife you know taking my children every night to restaurants to fun fairs they love me I'm the best father I'm the best husband but on the account of not going to the gym so I have diabetes cholesterol high blood pressure because I have to tolerate my nagging wife to be a good husband and I cannot have money because I'm spending most of it on them and I can have and I cannot learn religion because every time I want to go between mother Boresha or after Asia to the dirt it'll harden my wife says no I have to go and see my mother so this imbalance makes our life difficult the Prophet is given us the formulary salatu salam be balanced voilá and I swear insha'Allah truthfully if you manage to balance these things you are the happiest person on earth you will be the happiest person walking on earth because everything is satisfied spiritually and physically as well but when you have this imbalance then you have a problem nowadays all who we know have this imbalance and that is why some of us live and die only for the Paycheck some of us live and die for their bank account how much is in it where did it come from who cares I'd like to see the digits halal Haram who cares I make one ombres every year a lot of for hips callus and the rest Witten this is not the way that Allah wants it to be some of us have an imbalance on the opposite side they don't care about their needs their physical needs and they only go astray trying to reach spirituality but through the wrong doors and this is also an imbalance they go against their nature they don't eat halal or they make everything Haram some of the brothers say hey this water is I don't know maybe it still it's coming from desalinated plants of sewer and maybe why maybe toothpaste Haram because has pork say where it is a fork Pepsi coca-cola sweets everything is pork pork pork some of the brothers have this in them why are you so extreme where are you getting this knowledge from I heard someone say something on the bus so I thought Hollis I have to this is from allah azzawajal masha'Allah Tabarrok allah and this is wrong when you look at Islam compared to other religions you will find it the best religion of all some religions tell you to not marry stay in a church or a place a monastery or something be a monk don't eat this don't eat that some religions say everything is halal bismillah whatever you do as long as your heart is okay no problem Allah Azza WA JAL tells us how beautiful our religion is it says but seek with that wealth which Allah has bestowed on you the home of the hereafter and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world balance so yes we are here to go to Jannah it's it may take us 60 years and on average between 60 and 70 some of us may live until 950 years like Nora but then what it's cut us over its eternity no stopping us now but if you work hard you live forever in happiness and paradise Allah so jealous telling you work hard but don't forget your portion you are in this life Allah gives you halal things so eat halal drink Helen Mary in halal enjoy everything in this world in challah this is the balance that we would like part of the characteristics of our religion that it is a balanced religion that is a religion of the middle path that it is suitable for every generation and every location so Islam is suitable for all times no one can come and say ah ah hey this was okay at the time of the Prophet Elisha salat WA Salam fifteen centuries later this we cannot apply no you cannot why because it was designed it was made it was dictated to us by the one who created us doesn't he know whom he created a soldier Alya Alamo Mahalo Mahalo playful hobby definitely so by thinking that you can hint that the religion is not suitable now this is total blasphemy this is qu4 and this we see all over but I'm gonna stop I was joking this we see worldwide when people come and say ahi chopping the hand is barbaric this is mentioned in the Quran one of two you that you either a kafir or a hypocrite both are in hell you cannot you cannot judge or talk about these things in this is from an and these people come and try to undermine the Quran undermine the Sunnah undermine the Companions of the Prophet also Salam in order to reach to their goals no we know that Islam is suitable for all times and all generations and all locations not in accordance to your intellect in accordance to the Quran and to the Sunnah on the other extreme of the middle path or the balance these extremes cannot live for long and that is why Islam has been the same for 50 centuries all muslims say assalamu alaikom all Muslims pray five times a day to the same location fast the same month big Hajj the same house of allah azza wajal prohibit intoxicants humble wine etc prohibit fornication Gina hasn't changed it will never change because this is the religion of allah azza wajal extremism on the other hand don't eat meat why because you don't know it's halal or Haram then why should I listen to you why because are none of your a Muslim or a Catholic it's the same thing it goes both ways now it's not one way so religion is not by maybe made no certainty this is BA hair pure or Naja's pure everything here is pure but I doubt share that maybe no maybe throw it in the trash can this is not acceptable if you're sure we consider it not to be but if it's a maybe or a possibility it's not acceptable and Islam and there's a rule known as Li obtained layer Zulu be shocked that certainty is not removed by doubt and if you apply this you will be relieved I receive hundreds of questions every day from brothers and sisters and the majority of the questions share I have with wasps I have OCD I go and answer the call of nature and I feel that I have splashed my whole body with urine how heavy is your urine when it falls down if it I get splashes much what is it this is iron this is not urine and he says that I wash myself five times a day six the whole shower this is all from who from Shia wallah he plays like with us like children play with football he's playing with your mind you're certain this is I have a drop where is this drop coming from I think it's not just no it's not to the extent that even though may Allah be pleased with him was walking once and someone was washing the house water fell and he his companion said and in a narration that he said himself is it nudges or clean your water the Prophet told him to the owner of the house don't tell him why so that he would not open the door for with us every time you get some water is it nauseous no don't ask are you sure it's not just no I'm not sure Hamas the default it is it is pure this is a rule of thumb that if you apply it you will feel relaxed not like those who go to the bathroom urinate and stay for half an hour wallahi I've seen we might laugh but this is an illness I've seen people in them in the in the toilet coughing I thought that he has maybe some illness in it maybe I have to save him and take him to the hospital and I stay I wait then I hear him jumping maybe is now aerobics i wait for 10-15 minutes and the man comes out exhausted is it Oh chef Salam alaikum Salam what are you doing is that I have this problem with urinating ugly people were urinating since Adam until now they still have the same thing but no one is doing what you're doing this is this is all from who you tell me who is doing this shape on now if I ask all of you and you are all professionals masha'Allah can I have your CV some of you said ok you will give me Masha Allah 6 pages 10 pages of CV of course ace training courses positions education masha'Allah very good at least Shaitaan if I take his CV it is this much it's from Adam Stein he knows exactly how you think how you feel and this is how he comes to you from the imbalance you are either extreme in religion very tough very strong he plays with your heart with your mind like this no no three times is not enough maybe you did it two times let me do it five times after a while hmm let me take a full shower but it's better wallahi in 1990 I was in in in Damascus Syria 1990 remember the date so that you not say harsh at back to Syria 1990 how long 26 years ago huh 26 years ago it was very liberal I went there to a Masjid to attend the lecture and I gave to Kabir I went and made Woodill and this man was making wudu and washing all of himself I didn't pay attention after half 5-10 minutes we went to the Masjid and the man came along what we prayed the message Allah ou akbah and he repeated it like six seven times in Allah and then he left salat and went into two rakahs later he came with woudl and he said the same process five six times and then he left and after the Salah is over I see the man coming in giving that beer and going to make wudu what do you think is wrong with this man Shaitaan is coming to him your Nia is not correct make takbir again maybe you are intending to pray mother if this is Asia Allah Akbar again tell you what my Woodill did I wash my foot yeah you washed you washed it until it's shrunk now it's not the same size so what are you doing so he goes on and on and on and on and he and people prayed and finish the pray and the night was over and he still oh this is an illness shape and plays with him on the other part on the other hand there are those among us who don't care so everything is easy everything is halal everything is a lot of food or Rahim a fee you did not wash the right hand there is no trace of water it's okay the rest are washed if you measure the percentage is very little a lot of Agra him after you prayed three records of a sir yeah but Allah knows that I wanted to pray for sake and he comes to the people like this these people are the easiest to go into sin so shaking hands with women halal Haram Haram when everybody's doing it and the airport in the offices in some Islamic centers the sister comes and I've seen this unfortunately I don't want to mention the country and they shake hands with the other colleagues what is this is this Islamic and maybe 1020 years maybe more how are you open everything is fine hamdulillah yes shift the Eman is in the heart don't be too extreme this is how Japan plays with us he manipulates us because we are far away from Quran Sunnah but if we have poor honest order here then whatever I do I'd like to drink a glass of water so this is an example because I do want to drink a glass of it so he comes to me and said miss Mila this is an action I have to go through the filtering system drinking with the left hand is it right or wrong no the Prophet said assume that the shape on each with his left and drinks with his left then this is heaven bismillah a fee this is extreme you find people telling you this you go to the restaurants and you find people masha'Allah Western knives you know fork with the left knife with the right tie a tiny small pieces of meat in my show blood were very civilized you feel that very sophisticated masha'Allah PhD holders engineers okay this is Haram you're eating like to share fun but they don't know or they know but they are arrogant and they say it's all halal it's no problem this is how Shaitaan plays with us we have to always go back to the basics sometimes we feel that the companions may allah be pleased with them are the best of generation and they are without any doubt however even them they had few die virgins but they had who they had the Prophet as some to fix them we don't have this we have the Quran Anderson only three men came to the prophets houses sallallaahu Selim and asked the mothers of the believers and they said Oh mother of the believers what is the routine of the Prophet in worshiping salah salem and they told him he sleeps and he does this he does that the three men thought that this was very little coming from a prophet said the a a the prophet also salaam Allah has forgiven all his previous and upcoming since we're not like him so one of them said I will pray all night and will never sleep the second one said I will fast all day and will never break my fast every single day the third one was the luckiest he said I will not marry women he wanted to relieve himself from headache anyhow so the prophet alayhi salat wa salam when he heard of this was he okay ma sha allah these are my companions they are monks that he was angered by it and he went to the minbar and he said why do people say so and so and so by Allah I sleep and I pray I fast and I break my fast and I marry women who ever want or desire a path other than my Sunnah is not from me so whenever you want to do something tomorrow how do I know if I'm balanced or not compare it to the Sunnah of the Prophet or sister you will never go wrong and if we manage to do this in this case we can balance we balance in issues of al-qaeda in issues of fear and hope because we know that in Islam there are three things essential for your rápida the love of Allah I met a Saudi gentleman once he prays in the Masjid he's a pilot airline pilot and I was speaking to him and he was saying to me I don't love Allah he's westernized you know he goes and travels places well this is what he said and I said yeah sure fear Allah how do you say this don't you pray should I pray five times a day I find some Amman but I'm afraid of his Hellfire but I don't love him such a person is stupid because he did not think of Allah's favours and blessing if someone while you're walking says aji you've dropped your wallet and are in it your salary and your ID cards and everything you need how would you feel you would like to give him a gift you're so happy with him actually Allah is not giving you the wallet Allah is giving you everything you have one man become manemma I mean Allah every single favour and blessing is from Allah take off your glasses if you have glasses and put your hands on your eyes and enter the toilet when it's dark and try to like my friend urinate you will make a mess and this is the best thing of sight the blessing of hearing the blessing yes when you eat something bad and your stomach hurts how would you feel when you get influenza flu and your four or five days bedridden shivering Allah is giving you so much but you're not grateful you use what Allah is giving you in sin and this is why you have to love Allah so the love of Allah is the head of a bird as the scholars explained and fear and hope fear of Allah's hell hope in Allah forgiveness and paradise are the wings if you have one more than the other how would the bird fly in not a normal way so you have to have the balance between them Muslims have the balance they fear hell but they also are hopeful they not feel if they feed hell only they will become despair they will lose hope and if they are so hopeful in Jannah they will make sense because Allah will not put us in hell he will put all the kaffir the Jews the Christians with me no no I will not and this is why Omar may Allah be pleased with him look at the balance all mothers a second Khalifa he said if a man were to call from Heaven's all of you on earth are in hell except one I would have hoped that I was the one this is hope and if someone called all of you are in paradise except one I would fear that I am the one so hell and heaven there is this balance Muslims have the balance in their heart in their belief and for example erosional Jumeirah it's us insha'Allah who are the extremes on the far right we have the extremists the radicals the Huaraz who give the clear to everybody even if they look in the mirror you're careful oh sorry I'm sorry I'm just used to it sorry they give the clear to everybody in Saudi some of them who are brainwashed they even give takfeer to their parents one of them killed his uncle few months ago one of them or two of them or six of them from the same family killed their cousin because he works in the army they took him to the desert we want you to help us and they slaughter them now these extremists they don't relate to Islam the Prophet told the silence of some that they are the hounds of hell and in hell they will be like dogs why because on earth they were attacking Muslims and they say that you're not a real Muslim okay I go attack the disbelievers no no they are disbelievers you are worse this is what they think and on the far left we have the liberals the secularists that only have a tag with the with the religion saying Islam they don't pray they don't fast they want everything Haram to be halal and everything halal to be a questionable and they tried their level best to undermine Islam what is their Islamic name the Islamic title Manavi all these are the hypocrites who can claim to be Muslims but actually they they're not so you come to the middle path in following Islam is the middle path what do you mean by that we have two extremes we have someone who says I do not follow any school of thought all school of thoughts are not good no Hannah Fino sherry no humbly no Maliki okay what are you coming from mashallah you're a genius you don't follow anything judges or uninsured 'no and we have people like this in a zoo or unassuming 400 okay do you know arabic say no how do you follow quran and sunnah my share follows quran and sunnah so you're following him follow her if instead but on the other extreme you have people saying if you don't follow hanafi madhhab your cafe if you don't follow shari mother have your prayer is invalid okay we have quran and sunnah should know and this is found by the way in their books of those who are blind followers of math hub you stick to one math hub regardless if it's right or wrong regardless if there is a clear eye as saying Haram or not we follow them at hub and this is extreme what is the middle path the middle path is to follow the Quran and the Sunnah with understanding of the four schools of thought with the Salaf with the people of the previous generations not from my own head what did he mean our best say may allah be pleased with him what did Imam Malik say what did Imam Shafi say and we cross examine and we can come with a conclusion these are the scholars of Islam you cannot sell just simply with a pen no I will not take from them anymore I am a Sunnah or an I'm Salafi I'm super Salafi I'm extremely Salafi and screamed I saw really you're following the wrong methodology again part of being balanced is that you are easygoing when you find a share a scholar who is tough and rough and Janna masha'Allah he's like the wolf who will blow on your homes and it will all go away this is not a shape the Prophet was not like this the prophets as I'm used to smile the Prophet as I'm used to joke with his congregation but always tells the truth never tells a lie the prophets face was the most beautiful Ali salatu salam so easiness kindness is a characteristic of those who follow the balanced way who follow the middle way and this is why whenever the prophets used to send Ali salat wa salam his messengers to the regions he would say to them make things easy don't make it hard to people always cooperate and do not dispute and have argument upon you now but part of the balance is that you do not kill yourself allah awj allah says what a tapa - and for Sock'em do not kill yourself how would I kill myself if I'm sick and if I fast I will deteriorate or maybe die it is prohibited for me to fast if I take a shower because I have to pray and taking a shower would mean that my burns or my wounds would also be affected it is prohibited for you to take a shower so religion is a religion one does not say no I'm strong I can manage this is not the way of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam there is the balance in expenditure when you spend money so you have to be balanced and for example I am now preparing dinner for you all after this lecture and no dinner no this is part of the balance because we have bigger project balance is that you don't spend all what you're having and then begging people and not withhold until people say he's miser he doesn't give in charity he doesn't feed the food no the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us to be in the middle path and this is why allah says and let not your hand be tied like a miser to your neck nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach like a spendthrift so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty you know you have to be in the middle path how much time ya damn it ok type there is a more tomorrow from the Hanuman Cup you know what that is is enjoining good and forbidding evil you have to do this this is an obligation but you also have to balance it you don't go to someone who's drunk and a bottle of scotch in front of him his eyes are red and he has a nine-millimeter in his hand playing with the trigger and you say fear Allah don't you know humber is Haram and he does shoot you know this is imbalance and at the same time you don't see a lot of sins coming and you don't even say the word of advice okay this is Haram in the office mixing smoking not praying why don't you give no see huh mashallah your beard is longer than Fidel Castro why don't you give naseeha and advice people said I have to have the balance there is no balance here there is only being coward or being lazy you have to have the balance ok when can I be extreme or when can I be soft in enjoining virtue and good because the Prophet used to do this as Salam so sometimes you have to also learn how to apply the Sunnah a man comes in the Masjid urinates and the prophet and his companions are watching what would you do I would kill the man but the Prophet I just told him no leave him why if they were to startle him he would make the whole place filthy but now he is contained in a very small place afterwards the Prophet calls the man and he tells him my nephew this is inappropriate in message it it was not made for damages it was not made for filth it was made for Quran prayer and dhikr Allah the man praised you the prophet alayhi salatu salam in prayer in congregation and he says everybody's hearing or allah have mercy on me and in Mohammed and don't have mercy on anyone else why because he loved the way of the Prophet as a son teaching him but everyone else they wanted to hit him so easily is terrified of them so it is doesn't want Allah smashed it to be see the Prophet here was what was soft was kind because he's ignorant but when a booth on the old immigrant the old companion of the prophets and spoke to balad and told him bilal you are your mother is black boy are you blood angry his mother is black his mother is truly truly black she's from Abyssinia yeah but Abu that did not say it as a compliment or as a fact he said it as discrediting him when the Prophet knew about this al Sam he said Bella abathur you're a man of arrogance and ignorant he said o prophet of Allah after migrating 13 12 years ago with you and being among the first I am a man of jahiliyyah of pre-islamic era said yes because of what you said in another incident a man inside Muslim you all don't know the holly of course the a man was eating with his left hand the prophet saw him as a son he said eat with your right there I say that I cannot a lot of the people we know are like this ignorant and arrogant they can but they don't want to the Prophet said may Allah make you unable to do that lust apart he said and the man's hand was paralyzed he could not lift it to his mouth why because this is different than an ignorant he is arrogant he has defiance in his heart to Islam and to the Sunna and rejecting and there are so many examples but the time does not allow us to do this can go on but what about the dinner no dinner okay they said prolonging it a little bit okay now also part of the balance is to go against what your soul desires if it goes against the Sharia how is that we have imbalance in our affection if we love someone we take them to the roof as if they are prophets of Allah and the minute we hate them we make them disbelievers we don't believe in a Muslim no is either a saint a messenger or a kafir and this is a problem and this happens also with us in houses with our walk with our spouses a wife loves her husband greatly the minute he mentions that my mother said haleh's he becomes Shaitaan why did you bring her mentioning and she's my mother she's yes but you know what she did 16 years ago she didn't invite me to her sister when she came in Subhan Allah and by the way the saying goes with men and even worse but women are weak we can make jokes at them they will not hit back men it's a big problem so that's why I'm a little bit selective anyhow we have a problem with our emotions when we love a scholar we make him a saint whatever he says is correct but he made a mistake and no no no he doesn't make mistakes and if we hate someone even if he recites an ayah of the quran this is not from the quran we have this problem overreacting is part of our imbalance if I'm driving it so that here you drive good Michelle and Malaysian people are very nice very very easygoing in Saudi mashallah when I get in my car I put my helmet and it I become a different person you know I became very aggressive and when we drive if someone cuts over me he made a mistake I will follow him until matka just to cut over him seriously this is how we feel and how we drive why so many times someone does something wrong to you Islam tells you you may do the same thing wrong back to him or pardon him and it's best you pardon him people overreact so instead of balancing the reaction we have men divorcing their wives why divorce my wife yesterday she can i reconcile they come to me said why did you divorce her why chef she prepared the food and the salt was too much I said okay then what said I told her six times don't put so much salt and she doesn't listen I divorced her this is like having a mosquito without Zika having a mosquito on your hand and you bring a cannon boom what is this I'm killing a mosquito yeah but this is an overkill this is too much of reaction you have to know how to balance your emotions in order to be a real Muslim and that is why this balance of emotion is what we must require especially with Road age etc ash a fairy may Allah have mercy and the majority of you are sure affair here Shaffer is one of the greatest Imams of all times he's the share of Imam Ahmed in and he used to say Imam Ahmed that all people are children and students of Shaffer II in fact he's the first one to write in fundamentals of when he wrote his book rosada anyhow asha free once said my views are correct within a possibility of mistake and my opponents views are wrong with a possibility of being correct who among us use this way of communicating no you're wrong and I'm right give some way for going back this is the balance that we should have in our communication so many sisters complain from their husbands truly and correctly their husbands are oppressive they don't communicate and so many divorces take place because of lack of communication if you always give the benefit of the doubt I might be wrong there might be don't jump to conclusions this balance would make your life easy insha'Allah when it comes to love and hate this balance in affection it is part of Islam some people say Islam is the religion of peace Islam is the religion of love Islam is the religion of tranquility all of this is true but indefinitely suggests we love everyone we have pigs we love dogs we love wait where are you going at it this is not not true on the other hand when you have nicest you know nicest what is nicest nun Islamic State of Iraq and Syria never ever say Isis because in the media they say Islamic State of Iraq and Syria bombed killed slaughtered Islamic state doesn't do this this is the nun Islamic say they are not related to Islam so will you come to nicest they say everybody's kafir we hate everybody except the mirror we hate everyone so this imbalance is wrong again Muslims hate and love have peace and wage war this is the balance of the Prophet Alice of Sam who said that love in the sake of Allah and hate for the sake of Allah and having friends for the sake of Allah and having enemies for the sake of Allah are the tightest knots of Islam or Eman o the coral Eman the tightest knots of a rope no Eman of Eman is to love and hate is to have friends and to have enemies so you cannot say oh no no Muslim they befriend everybody even their enemies even those who kill them and slaughter them they are their friends no but at the same time they don't take everybody to become their enemies the Prophet as I'm used to deal with the Christians used to deal with the Jews used to accept the invitation of Jews when they invite him for lunch for dinner like in the woman the Jew woman who put poison in the the RAM she cooked for him she invited him and he attended sallallahu Salam this shows you the true and correct balance so if we would like to balance how would we know the right way the answer is as stated before not gonna repeat the lecture again the answer is to know well you're poor an to learn well your Sunnah of the Prophet s salaam to read his sirrah it's a big problem when you find Muslims not knowing the seal of the Prophet a little optional if I say selamat ah even L acquire what is this is a battle or a man nor an address or a massage parlor I don't know what is this son of Abdullah who knows tel aviv naka raise your hand what name masha'Allah - very good is this possible Salim Adel you are one of the bravest warriors who walked on feet and one of the fastest and one of the best athletes of all the Companions of the broadest on but we don't know him I once asked this survey in a school of 1,500 students give me the names of the 10 heaven-bound companions the the result was zero on the contrary I got names subhanAllah I'm Ruben all hubbub I know whom are hungry table this is new if I ask you about the wives of the Prophet Aristotle sallam said asthma no asthma is not one of them divorced no no no no he never married as master Subhan Allah what did I get this name from I once went to a hospital to visit a doctor so that there is a straight reception the lady was telling me what's the name of your patient I said Joe area she's a Jew what in Arabic said Joe area you know Joe area mental health the wife of the prophets and the aunt of Abdullah bin ambass and hardened Walid and etc so I know that's where I was my morning sorry joy I admit that had it almost all men been in masala this is different joy what situated or was it my Mona I have both daughters by the way so uh-huh she said why meaning that yeah yeah Haram why are you giving her this name I said this is the mother of the believers the wife of the Prophet situation and she was an Arab she was a Muslim wearing the hijab so so sort of what they called her job and she and she was astonished she never heard that the Prophet had a wife by the name of Joe area this is a big problem so you learn the Serie of the Prophet s term you know when mota took place the Battle of mota when Al Honda took place when Tabuk took place what is that al kharid what is al more I see here what is been you know the urban palooka what is money for Allah when you know this you have dignity pride you know how to balance things are know I cannot do this the Prophet didn't do it Isis honor oh yes I should do this the Prophet did this I son you have the balance but when you like nicest you don't even know what the Prophet did or what the Prophet did not do it is salatu salam they don't even speak Arabic kill for Sibylla that's it yeah yeah yeah odd boom masha'Allah to varrock Allah this is not related to Islam when you don't have knowledge you have ignorant and when you have ignorant that's what leads people to doing it part of being balance is not to be haste to always have patience think before you act and this is the way of the Prophet Allah solution now when the Prophet wants to do something isn't that the best thing to be done the answer is yes if the Prophet wanted to do something definitely it is halal the affinity is the right thing to do however the Prophet used to think and some of the consequences if I do this what will happen afterwards good or bad if bad I will stop though it's a good action example the Prophet said that is awesome - Aisha may Allah be pleased with her yeah assha had it not been to the fact that your people are close related in time to pre-islamic era yeah they have just accepted Islam few months ago had it not been to that fact I am afraid of this I would have demolished the Kaaba and built it again on the foundations of Ibrahim you know this Ark what is it called Al hopping in colloquial language they call it his ear is man ill this is part of the Kaaba so if you go inside in power your turf is invalid the Prophet wanted to demolish it to build it again on the foundations of Ibraheem on the pillars of the brahim and have two doors one for the people to enter and one for the people to exit if they want to see it okay prophet of Allah why didn't you do it he said because if I do this those new Muslims would reject Islam and they would say ha he's not a messenger of allah he is humilating the house of allah he is also and they would reject Islam so the Prophet was thinking isin of what of the consequences we have so many people like this once I was talking to a brother he's telling me I have shredded papers of or and what to do with it I said burn it fear Allah dock with me said yes you want me to humiliate the Quran so they burn it to preserve it this is the word of allah burning it is halal with the intention of saving it and preserving it instead of being torn and and scattered should know this is Haram if you know the fatwa why do you come to me someone else mashallah you're knowledgeable so people have weird way of thinking without knowledge so you have to be patient finally I think that dinner might be might be I'm not promising anything finally is balance a choice that we have to make no this is our destiny you don't have a choice of hmm let me be balanced or imbalanced no to be a Muslim you must be balanced otherwise you have a big problem because you're not complying with the Quran and the Sunnah and allah azzawajal knows best well wahoo Harlem when especially really merely SM was allah llahu was a lama barkhad Abdi he was holy he nabina muhammad you"
