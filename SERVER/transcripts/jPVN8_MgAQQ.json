  "transcript": "okay a birth man's third question which is worst an idol worshiper or an atheists to me an atheist is worse because an idol worshiper believes that Allah creates Allah provides Allah brings drain down Allah gives life and takes life Allah facilitates all of our affairs all either worshipers believe that but they did shirk in the towhead of the lord of the worship alleluia when they diverted the worship to other than Allah so they acknowledge that a Las lordship rubia is there but they have committed shirk in alleluia so they pray to other than Allah they call other than Allah they sake refuge seek refuge in other than allah azzawajal they fear and hope and love other than allah so gel which these things must be devoted solely and sincerely to allah an atheist says there is not an existence of something that is called the lodge you claim which means that he's even worse than animals because why would you create it he said I have no purpose of being here I was just coincidentally existing but there's no purpose at all because there's no God to have a purpose of this and Subhan Allah why do you wear shoes what's the purpose of wearing shoes he said to protect my feet from heat and from glass so I say your shoes have a purpose and you don't have a purpose your shoes are better than you so an idol worshiper is better but both of them are in hell at the end of the day for eternity so yeah I hope this answers your question"
