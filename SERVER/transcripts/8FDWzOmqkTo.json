  "title": "Women wearing perfume and going out - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now for women there is a disclaimer which most of you know but that's it's a reminder that a Muslim woman is not allowed to wear perfume and pass by men who would find her scent and smell the Prophet said addisam whoever goes out of her home wearing perfume and passes by men who would smell her fragrance then she is like a fornicator like an adulteress which is a major sin why is that simply because men are easily affected by whatever a woman puts on"
