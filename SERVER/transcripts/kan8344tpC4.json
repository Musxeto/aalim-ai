  "transcript": "question what do we believe in Islam about life in other galaxies do we even believe if there is life in other galaxies the answer would be that this is something that only Allah knows of and it does not add any value to us especially that Allah the almighty did not reveal anything of such knowledge therefore it would be unwise to go into such discussions whether positive or negative anyone who claims there is life in other galaxies is instructed to provide the evidence and those who deny the existence of life on other planets is also instructed to provide the evidence and both parties would most certainly fail to do this it's all hypothetical and it does not get you Clos to Allah such information would not get you closer to Allah subhah wa taal and we've mentioned this so many times if someone disputed upon the type and kind of the dog where the people of the uh uh the people of the cave had what kind of a dog was it was was it a German Shepherd was it uh ad Doberman then the discussing such a topic would not be very wise likewise if someone argued what kind of planet did ibraim see was it was it Venus was it Mars what is Jupiter again this is not something useful to talk about"
