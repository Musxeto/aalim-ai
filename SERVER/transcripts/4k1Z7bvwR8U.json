  "transcript": "slamming over him hamdulillah Oh salat wa salam o allah rasool allah he was early he was a happy human wala assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today in sha Allah we will begin studying one of the great hadith that jurors fokaha used to describe the prayer of the Prophet Allah salatu salam in the sense that we know that prayers are composed of pillars mandatory acts and sunan voluntary acts now the pillars are extremely important because without them whether you forget or you're ignorant or you don't know your prayer is invalid unless you make up for it during the prayer but if I remember that oh yes I take her prayer I prayed in only three records yellow my leash no it's not malice you have to repeat the whole process again I prayed for records but I did only seventh root seven prostrations the eighth one I didn't do that's okay no it's not okay you have to do it again Rajab or mandatory obligatory acts if you forget them it's okay if you don't know about them it's okay your prayer is valid if you remember while you are in the prayer you have to offer prostration of forgetfulness so and we will come to talk about this insha'Allah on time turn on voluntary prayers these are okay for you to do you'll be rewarded if you don't do them intentionally your prayer is valid no problem to that and we will come to mention maybe inshallah some of these things so hadith number 75 Nakano narrated abu huraira road a lot Ilan Hall the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said the Imam is to be followed say the takbir said the takbir when he says it bow if he borrows if he says Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah cierra by now prostrate if he prostrates and prays sitting all together if he offers the seller sitting Albahari okay honey read the second hadith please Nora did Aisha Allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi assalam offer the salat in his house while sitting during his illness and the people offer salat behind him standing and he appointed to them to sit down when he had finished the salat he said now my mom is to be followed and so many balls you should bow and when he lifts his head you should also do the same and if he says some you allow human Hamidah say robbing a local Honda and if he prayed sitting down pray all of you sitting down Al Bukhari very well now this hadith has stated before it's one of the pillars describing the prophets prayer so the Prophet says in the very beginning what is the role of the imam must be followed so we know that we may not proceed the Imam we not we may not do things before the Imam and how is that the prophecies do not differ do not do things other than things he's doing so if he says Allahu Akbar say Allahu Akbar so should I say it with him no faith a cup bra fat cap bill fat cap Bureau in Arabic means that it follows immediately in Arabic we have three joining letters and there is Wow some fat Wow means something and and it means it does not mean the order so you can start with this or with that some means the order this one first then after a while the other one some ma ha means the order but immediately so from this hadith there all the words used all the verbs used have the letter fact for the Kabbalah sokka bureau Wade Erica Falcao wear the color semi Allahu Liman Hamidah for Kulu all of them include the fur which means that the minute he says tell me Allahu Liman Hamidah immediately you say Bob Manawa look at him you don't wait for a couple of minutes and as he is saying semia you don't say Robin of the camp you have to do it immediately after he finishes and this is part of following the Imam as mentioned before also the prophet alayhi salat wa salam is the leader and likewise every Imam the hadith states that every Imam is made to be followed but the word Imam is it used only in prayer no it's used outside of prayer is it used only for good no in the Quran sort of Casas we find that it is used also for evil so the Imams can be part of those who call people for goodness and yet there are Imams as Allah mentioned in the Quran who would call people to Hellfire and how would we differentiate which Imam is this in which Imam is that by those who follow the Quran and the Sunnah so it is not an issue of how many followers do you have we have deviant Imams big turbans nice jackets or nice trench coats clean looking nice makeup when they speak they sound very emotional and they have followers in their countries and elsewhere by the millions but they are deviant they are corrupt they even embezzle people's money and they're making a good job they go to some country and say that the Prophet is crying because you're not giving him money and everybody is giving money in the guy Masha the Prophet is unable to get rain ticket back to Medina stop for water what kind of nonsense is this so there are Imams that are calling people to paradise who are on the footsteps of the Prophet Alistair and there are Imams who are deviant who call people to Hellfire how can we differentiate we have the Koran listen if I'm following the Quran and Sunna then I'm an imam who called people to paradise if I'm a deviant Imam if I say no this one is okay no you can neglect this no I would like to innovate then I'm a deviant Imam likewise we've stated that we have to follow the Imam not to come before him not to come after him in a long time and not to be with him exactly but we have to follow him and this is the fourth category that we should do the Prophet says if your Imam says semi Allahu Liman Hamidah you must say Rob been away like at hand there are authentic narrations without the Wow there is Rob bana like at Hampton so you can say both Manawa like at hampt or abandon a local camp Allah humma Rob banner look at HAMP Allah whom Arab mana well I can ham all four is acceptable and authentic hadith now the issue is the prophecy if the Imam says it you say Rob bana well I can hunt if I'm an individual what do I say if I'm praying on my own I say both if I'm praying on my own as he sent me a lovely man Hamid I have been aware I could happen if I'm the Imam what do I say once both again the most authentic opinion that I say both as any man if I am a follower or more I see only one which is the second one so I do not repeat when the Imam says Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah I don't say Samir Allahu Liman Hamidah happen over like a Hampton no I answer and what is the meaning of Sami Allahu Liman Hamidah would the microphone please it means Allah is those who praise Him Allah hears those who praise them correct our she lies the only one who hears those of prison allies the only one hey son Allah heard in the past and your side Allah he is the one who glorifies I have a question Allah Azza WA JAL does not hear those who curse Allah does not hear those who say blasphemous things or not so then Allah hears is not the correct interpretation Allah answers Allah sami allahu liman hamidah it means that Allah answers those who supplicate to him and that is why we say Robin were like al hamd that's why we're supplicating we're doing this after this and this is why it is essential for you to learn the meaning of the things you say don't take it literally because you will find so many evidences in the Quran supporting that sameera means to answer in a lobby let's say me or do i what does that mean Allah hears the doora know Allah answers the door and so on so now maybe we've learned something new today for a first change anyhow we move on sami allahu liman hamidah if they're the follower the mom does not say that he says rabbana wa laka and hamd now we come to the issue of intention some scholars took this hadith which is an authentic hadith and said it is not permissible for someone different than the knee of the imam to pray with him so if i'm praying the fault you have to be also praying the fault and if I'm praying voluntary prayer you cannot pray for do you must pray voluntary prayer why because the hadith clearly states that the Prophet said allah√≠s alot wa sallam the Imam is to be followed so you're not following him if you are having another intention but the most authentic opinion of scholars if you look at the different versions of the hadith another a lot of Hadees for example hadith of even a bus when he prayed with the Prophet night prayer I saw the Prophet change his intention another hadith is hadith Mahad even jebel and he says it's an authentic hadith and also he he used to pray neasha with the Prophet Allah so son and then go to his people he goes to his people to pray Asia for them but for him it's voluntary because he is the only one who recites Quran more than them so his intention was different to theirs and the Prophet as Salam accepted that and approved of that therefore what the scholars say that the difference of Denia the intention is not valid you can have different Nia he could be praying for and I'm praying volunteer prayer or the opposite he could be a traveler and I could be in a resident and I can be a resident and he is a traveler so denia is not significant in this issue now we come to the issue of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam saying that if he offers the Salah sitting you all must sit down and if he prays it standing up you all must stand up but this issue sha Allah we will talk about it after the break and afterwards we will take your questions so prepare them from now inshallah and to art viewers stay tuned we'll be right back assalam alaikum and welcome back we talk now about the ruling of the Imam if he is a handicapped or unable to stand so the Prophet tells us a lesser I'm clearly that if he prays standing up you should also pray standing up but if he prays sitting down you must all pray sitting down and this caused the scholars to differ as usual and they have a lot of rules and regulations and verdicts and rulings on this issue the most authentic opinion is if the Imam begins his prayer sitting down all of those behind him must sit down and pray sitting down although they are capable of standing why because the hadith is crystal clear if he is spraying sitting down you all must sit down and this has been done by the companions in so many occasions especially when the Prophet was ill alehissalaam in some incidents he fell of his right and injured his ankle and could not stand up so he used to lead the prayer sitting down and once they stood up he pointed to them to sit down and they immediately sat down and he told them that if you remember sitting down you should sit down why because the Imam is made to be followed and that is why the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam shows us the discipline in Islam not only that it shows us the humbleness now imagine if I'm the Imam and I'm sitting down and everybody's standing up how would I feel I would feel some pride and arrogance in me and that is why the Prophet says in an authentic hadith whoever is sitting and desiring and wishing that all the people stand up for him may he choose his seat in Hellfire so it's not part of the Sunnah at all to sit and people standing serving you and you want this and you wish to see this because this is a sign of arrogance of Kibler and this makes the person having these feelings go to hell so the Prophet is telling them to sit down at a salon and he did this with them and they prayed sitting down in a number of occasions scholars say if the Imam started the prayer standing up and then something happened and he had to sit down the people praying behind him continue to pray standing up why because the initiation of the prayer was in the standing position so they should continue evidence the evidence is in the last or the final days of the prophets life is a lobster on Abu Bakr started leading the prayer and while in the first raka the Prophet felt a little bit better so he was dragged into the Masjid by Allah bus and Ali may Allah be pleased with them and was to be in the position of the Imam with Abu Bakr praying to his right to the Prophet sat down and a worker back to his right and a Bakr went back a little bit so the Prophet continued the prayer as the Imam but he was what sitting down and they were all standing up and he did not tell them to sit down because they started the prayer following Abu Bakr and he was standing up so they continued this prayer and the Prophet used to pray and Abu Bakr used to follow him and the people followed Abu Bakr by this all the evidences are joined and combined and they go in one line rather than saying no you don't do this or yes you have to do that this is the way of a proper student of knowledge that he gathers all the hadith and he makes sure that they all fit and fall into the same line I think that this is all we have regarding this issue of course before we take your questions from this hadith we learn the importance of obedience and of following the Imam not only in salat but also in our normal daily lives if Allah appointed someone to be our leader to be our Imam to be our ruler it is simple to say that Islam instructs us to obey Him and Islam instruct us to follow him as long as he's not instructing us to do sin because there is no obedience to any teacher if he's ordering us to disobey the Creator as they were JAL however without this discipline without this obedience there will be chaos and that is why even if the ruler is an aggressor even if he is a tyrant as long as his Muslim and he prays we have to obey Him if he is not Muslim we have to obey Him within the limits providing that we do not have the capability to overthrow him but if overthrown he means killing of people and bloodshed and destruction in the country Islam tells you stop you're not ready yet and the pro and the cons are far greater than the pros we take your questions in the remaining time yes brother clinical term cheers honor to questions regarding the invitation for example at a home if the indentation for wedding comes and the family consists of four people and two people go and attend the invitation is it okay and in my life I had to face a situation where it was made mandatory for me to attend the program and at the same time I had an invitation for the wedding what was better for me to attend the program or go to the wedding a program and TV opportunity for da okay first of all if an invitation is for the whole family and not to a particular member of the family you're not obliged I'm talking about individuals so if someone says your family is welcome now he is did not designate a particular person so this is an open invitation but if he says that and Sayid and shrewdest they are all invited they have to all come because they've been designated now if you have other obligation if it is as important then you have to attend the first if it's a program that will program and a wedding then in this case you have to seek the permission of the host ask him that please let me free and give me the permission to attend if he doesn't you have to attend because the Dawa program is not something that is a life or death issue and his invitation is mandatory food to answer the question might be that if you have two invitations to weddings so who do you attend the first you attend the first one that came to so if I have two conflicting on the same day which one came first I don't think that they all came at the same time one of them came a week prior or a few days of a few hours and you attend the first and Allah knows best yes brother assalamu alaykum Salam Oh check my question is that should I mean we said with the Imam or after Dima that's a good question it's an issue of dispute when to say I mean with the Imam or after the Imam and the most authentic opinion is that after the a man finishes I mean we say I mean because the hadith says for either a man a fireman and if he says I mean you say I mean it's like in a poem - Mila sowlaty first you once you want to pray then you go and perform bulldoze so scholars say that you do I mean after he finishes later-model bury him Allah Valene you say I mean with the Imam so once he says well ball lean you all both say I mean and not wait some scholars say you have to wait after he says I mean and then you say I mean but this is not the authentic opinion of scholars and I'm afraid that this is all the time we have so until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
