  "transcript": "conditions of hajj comes before during and after a particular form of worship while the pillars are only on in the form of worship itself so conditions of hajj is one of the conditions of hajj that you are free and not a slave one of the conditions of hajj being same being muslim being capable not having any obstacles for example so all of these are conditions of hajj if you are saying in the beginning before and during and after if you're a muslim before during and after these are the conditions but if one of these three stages the condition is gone then your hajj is not valid so if a person becomes insane during hajj or if a person nullifies his islam and he rejects islam it becomes apostate for example then he his his hajj is not correct because one of the conditions is gone now regarding the pillars the arkan of the hajj it is within the hajj itself so if a person does not stand on the day of allah and he comes a day or two later and he wants to make up for that it's gone it's history so he cannot offer hajj anymore"
