  "transcript": "um my question is regarding the time of the prayer we know that zoho starts after the sun passes the zenith and it goes towards the west when we start to see a shadow but over there when it's mid-day or slightly past midday the shadow is more than one body length by then and we know that according to uh the how the ruling is that once the shadow passes one body length this time faster so how do we explain this because i actually checked the timing on an app and as well as the sunrise and sunset times which was at 7 00 am and 5 pm approximately which means midday is about 12 o'clock but in this case it that the shadow and the timing doesn't seem to line up so is it something just for countries near the middle east or near the equator or how does it work okay according to the majority of schools of thought in accordance to the hadith where jibril peace be upon him taught the prophet alaihis salatu the timings of each prayer he said that in the first day the moment there was zawal zawali's when an erect object is here the sun rises of course the shade would be too long of this erect object as the sun rises it goes to midday this object usually has no shade the moment the sun goes to the west there is a slight shade to the east this is the time where the begins the moment there is this slight shade to the east and the second day jibril let the prayer just before the length of the shade was equal to the length of the erect object this is the conclusion of the time and the beginning of aser time what most likely happened is that when you went to down under and you prayed there they were following the hanafi school of thought which their timing is wrong according to the hadith i respect their school of thought but definitely i respect the hadith of the prophet more and the three other schools of thought can't also be wrong when they're following the sunnah and only the school of thought of abu hanifa is right in this issue whenever there's a dispute what should we do go to the quran and to the sunnah to resolve it the sunnah resolves it by telling us that they're wrong so most likely you were praying in a hanafi masjid and the calculation of the apps were according to the hanafi school of thought calibrate it and put it according to um and you will get the right timing insha allah you"
