  "transcript": "those who sivir their kinship are cursed by allah azza wajal and they cause corruption on earth allah the almighty says so would you perhaps if you turned away cause corruption on earth and sever your ties of relationship those who do so are the ones that Allah has cursed so he defends them deafened them and blinded their vision and this is a real and serious warning now this curse is on the day of judgement and people without certainty without real conviction and belief would shrug their shoulders and say who knows what will happen but the threat is even here on earth while we are alive the Prophet said Allison that said that there is no sin worthy for allah azza wajal to hastened the punishment of the sinner with what is stored for the sinner on the day of judgement there is no sin worthy of being punished in this life more than transgression and arrogance and severing the ties of kinship those who sivir the ties of kinship may ask Allah may make duaa but Allah Azza WA JAL does not listen to that door and does not respond to it as the Prophet said Allah salatu salam Allah will continue to answer his servants duaa as long as he does not make duaa in sin or in severing"
