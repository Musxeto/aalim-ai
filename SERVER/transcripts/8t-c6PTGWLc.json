  "transcript": "uh my question is that sometimes my my mom does not go fully like 90 degrees down in rocco uh uh like my guess is he's at like 70 to 75 degrees but i know that he can go down fully uh because i've seen him do that so he's my player valid if he doesn't go down like fully 90 degrees and also if he doesn't go down then how can i like alert him okay first of all a lot of the people have this confusion that this is the proper record and anything else is invalid and this is not true this is the proper raku i agree but if you do it a little bit more this is against the sunnah your is valid if you do it a little bit less when people look at you they won't say that you're standing this is standing this is a little bit bending yeah this is not required this is yeah okay now this is record so maybe he has problem in his back maybe he has issues nevertheless whoever looks at him he would say that this is record and the prayer is valid if you would like to address it after salah and say to him i love your recitation compliment him over many things and then say that i noticed that you don't fully go to 90 degrees your core do you have problems with your back maybe he would say no i think i'm doing it right and then you can explain to him that he's not and he has to go down a little bit that would be diplomatic inshaallah you"
