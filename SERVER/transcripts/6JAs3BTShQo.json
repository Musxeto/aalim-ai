  "transcript": "question is about um make uh something that I've experienced recently. So I woke up kind of late for fudger. I did my voodoo and I saw the time was 6:00 a.m. So I immediately checked if I was having any time remaining. So the shrup time was 6:04. So the first part of the question is like should I rush my prayer um to make it before that time and u or like should I wait like after that time's up and have it like as a missed prayer and secondly if I do try to rush the prayer so and if I see like the time 604 like that's like exact time of ishra is that prayer valid or like do I have to like repeat it? First of all, you have the right to ask for one question and you have the right to remain silence silent. But nevertheless, first of all, when people wake up late, are they accountable? If they woke up late unintentionally, they didn't set the alarm. It happened that they woke up late, they woke up late miserable and sad. and it's against their will. So there's no sin on them. Alhamdulillah. So the moment you wake up late, you go and do your thing and pray normally without touching things to the best of your ability because there is no fault at you. No way ever someone would tell you, \"Oh, it's 3 minutes for sunrise.\" Wait. F pray prayer is to be prayed immediately regardless whether the sun is rising or setting or whatever you have to pray it you don't wait and delay it further and those who prayed it be after the time was due you've done it you said oh should I pray it again what's the use if you pray it again there's no use because as if you're saying that my previous prayer was invalid why was it invalid because I was late in praying So what would make the other one valid? It's even later than prescribed. So there's no point in repeating the prayer. None whatsoever."
