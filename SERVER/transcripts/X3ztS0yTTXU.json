  "title": "Physical VS Sentimental hijab for women, what is the difference? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so hijab is an obligation in islam if you want to be productive be my guest but you have to abide by the hijab the physical hijab and the sentimental hijab okay the physical hijab we know the one we cover our bodies and maybe cover our faces as well wearing the nippab but what's the sentimental hijab i've seen a lot of women lately abiding by the hijab and some of them unfortunately even abiding by the nihab which is physically required but they don't put any boundaries to how they deal with men so i've seen them chit-chat with nan mahram flirt with nan maharam laugh and crack jokes with nan mahram and when you address them they say we're wearing the hijab i was approached in kuala lumpur by two sisters or two daughters wearing the hijab wanting to take a selfie with me excuse me you just i've just finished the lecture what did you learn from my lecture i want to take a selfie alone we know this is haram because this is seclusion both of us we want to take a picture of you because now it's a reason look how shaytan messes up with people's heads do they look to be practicing they look to be abiding by the hijab but this is only the outer appearance that is covered the inside is totally corrupt and tarnished and this shows you the great impact such ideology has on the whole community when you have mr dr jekyll mr hyde personality in the same individual a person who's practicing masha'allah big beard looks islamic but at the same time he has a different private life which totally goes against his beliefs and this is something that needs maybe another lecture"
