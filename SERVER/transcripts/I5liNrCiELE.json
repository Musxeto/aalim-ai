  "title": "I reverted to islam but my husband didn't",
  "transcript": "as soon as a woman reverts to Islam she becomes Haram and forbidden for her ex husband who is not a Muslim there is no compromise in this there is no soft feelings the minute a woman accepts Islam her husband or who used to be her husband cannot touch her unless he accepts Islam as well then their marriage continues so the minute she accepts Islam they must separate and if she does not marry there still is a connection between them but this connection can never be connected until he Embraces Islam until he reverts to Islam so let's assume like after a year she did not get married married and he is still a Christian and after a year he accepts Islam they go back together without any contract without marriage because they were still married but after a year of her accepting Islam if he did not accept Islam and she felt like she wanted to get married she can immediately get married without any need of divorce or any any any paperwork because she is not married anymore to him she gets married to any other Muslim man and that is it of course we have to bear in mind that depending on the country you're living in depending on the uh legal documentation of Separation Etc this is something you have to clear out with your uh country and Allah Knows Best"
