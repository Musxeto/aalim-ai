  "title": "My father doesn't pray, can he still be my wali (nikah)? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question is my father doesn't pray regularly he is seen in the Masjid during Juma or Eid prayer as far as I know he does not know how to read Arabic properly in that case the validity of his prayer is doubtful in this situation uh can he be a Wali in my marriage will marriage be wait I am not getting married because I have doubles about this now this question is frequently Asked question among the lot of the sisters so they have a situation where they know that they cannot get married without the consent and approval of their Guardian who's usually the father and they are in a dilemma either because the father doesn't pray or is involved in some kind of behavior that would not make him a good Muslim or he might be involved in shirk or the likes so they keep on asking about this question so that we would give them a fatwa saying that he's not suitable or fit to be your wedding this is problematic issues of marriage divorce guardianship is not such issues are not solved or answered through just a phone call or a random question these are real serious matters I can't just say oh if he's like this Halas he can't be your Wali because lots of the women asking these questions are interested in such an answer why because they are in a relationship or they love someone and the father is not accepting that person different casts different nationality doesn't work but the woman is in love with him so she wants to marry him but she knows that this is not possible in the current situation so in order to get mad at him she has to bypass her father by discrediting him and this is not how it works you cannot consider your father unfit to be a guardian without a real probable legitimate reason such as being labeled as a cafe or a mushrik which has consequences I can't just go around giving take fear to people this person doesn't pray he's a kafir how do you know well he said he doesn't pray did you check it out no did he check it out I don't know he said he doesn't pray he never saw him pray maybe he prayed when he was praying maybe he prayed when he was going to the Masjid maybe he prayed at the end of the day combining all five prayers which is totally unacceptable but maybe he thought this was okay maybe he prays on and off you never know so in order for you to go and label your father unfit you have to first of all label him as a kafir which requires that the conditions are fulfilled of the fear and the obstacles are not there of the fear and also the consequences would be if your father dies you have no right to inherit his property his Wealth live in his house because he's a Catherine you're a Muslim and a Muslim that does not inherit a kafir you didn't think of that did you oops no in this case yeah well what do I do I'll start begging people no yeah my father is a Muslim this is why we have to look into it have we done our due diligence in advising him and telling him about prayer about this and that so in a nutshell as long as he's still labeled as a Muslim though bad or sinful and there is no obstacles for him to become your Wally he's still your worry and Allah Knows Best"
