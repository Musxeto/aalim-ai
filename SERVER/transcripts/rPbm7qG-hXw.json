  "transcript": "yes sir um I would like to know the relationship because my uncle sent me a video this morning that says that um the IM says um the prophet sallallah alai wasam said that we Muslims should be closest to the Christians so I would like to know the relationship between we Muslims and Christians in details because I don't know any any Hadith or any something that says such things and I'm a kind of person in my situation I'm trying to discipline myself as much as possible to be among the Muslims and um I'm not rude to the Christians but um I I'm trying to limit the relationship I'm having with them so has for me to be able to be well disciplined in My Religion so when I S okay this is this is um uh not true there is no such Hadith that states that we should be close to the Christians Allah mentioned in the Quran that the most in hatred and enmity to the Muslims are the idol worshippers and the Jews this is in the Quran and the closest to the Believers are the Christians so this is mentioned in the Quran in the sense that the Christians share a lot with us Muslims and they're more soft-hearted than the idol worshippers or the Jews towards the Muslims and what's happening in Gaza it's a clear indication a clear sign of their hatred and enmity it's in their DNA we have to admit so there is no Hadith telling us to be close to the Christians or to any other non-muslims but it is a fact mentioned in the Quran when it comes to who's closer to the Believers it is the Christians than more than the Jews and the idol worshippers"
