  "title": "Can Women wear Shalwar Kameez and go out? How should a Woman's Outergarment be? - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh my she says how should a woman's outer garment be meaning how loose in inches is wearing shalwar kameez enough because it is very colorful and attractive with patterns and designs and women in the subcontinent wear this and the doctor or the scarf of this same shalwar kameez which is put on in a way that sometimes shows part of their hair now the issue is that a lot of the people and I've said I've said this before so many times a lot of us tend to follow the traditions the customs and would want to rearrange things so that it would fit Islam and this is not the right approach Islam is our prime objective and it should fit whatever it wants to fit and whatever goes or grows out of the borders of Islam has to be eliminated not the other way around therefore when we come to women's wear when we come to women's attire what is appropriate and what is inappropriate this is not something that is judged by logic or by taste or by what's common it is judged by the verses of the Quran the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam with the understanding of the three favorite generations whom the Prophet said RA salatu salam hyrule karoon the best of generations is my generation that is his error of the companions then those who follow them the terrain and those who follow them the tablet a being these are the best of all generations now their understanding is the best understanding and when we look into the books of Shep to try to find out what is permissible and what is not we will not find the prophet alehissallaam coming and telling us a woman should wear this and this and must avoid this and this because this is not practical you remember the hadith of alarm for men a man came to the prophet that he saw some and said o prophet of Allah what should a ma him the one who's intending to do Rambla or Hajj what should hammer him where now the question is so generic in the sense that he says he might say he can wear this and this and this and and it goes on it's like someone asking you what can a Muslim eat so you start just listing the fruits and it takes you like an hour vegetables types of meat the types of nuts the types of this and that it is endless instead you go and answer in the restricted things that he's not allowed to do and that is very little so you say you cannot eat pork you cannot eat meat that was not slaughtered appropriately in the Islamic way and you cannot eat any predator like wolves lions tigers etc that's it and that Isis Halla and unless it falls under this Harlem category the same methodology was taught to us by the Prophet array so some when he answered the man about what a Muharram should wear he did not list the things he should wear rather he told him about the things he should not wear so he said that a man must not wear albornoz alba Ronis he should not wear ammama the turban the botanist is a cloak that has a hoody on it he should not wear the saw a wheel which is the pants he should not wear a kameez which is a shirt t-shirt whatever and he should not wear shoes that's it end of story so now if we look at the women's attire we after studying the evidences from the Koran listen find out that Islam tells us that a woman can wear anything she wants when she's outside of her home and none muharram men are looking at her providing that one she wears clothes that cover her body properly in the sense that they are not tight to show her figures her body strap own structure her curves and it is not see-through so that we can tell what she's wearing underneath and it should not be imitating the disbelievers so if a nation of the disbelievers are known to wear such a dress or an outer garment Muslims should not wear that thirdly it must not be attractive in by itself so it shouldn't be i catching because this defines the purpose of the hijab why are you wearing the hijab because Allah ordered us to do so secondly so that we do not draw attention and the wrongdoers would not abuse us or flirt with us or say inappropriate things to us so if you wear something that is attractive it's like calling the hounds to attack if we go back to Isis question the sure welcome is this is worn in the subcontinent so the kameez is the Arabic word of amis and amis means a shirt so any upper garment that you insert your hands in the sleeves this is called Khamis so what I'm wearing at the moment this is considered to be a kameez but it is long that goes down to cover my whole body it's a long time is what the women are wearing in a subcontinent is revealing their amis the shirt is exposing their bodies and it is tight at the waist so you can tell the women's curves by looking at that and this defines the hijab if you add to it colorful printing on it and being attractive this is another harem issue therefore this is inappropriate they must wear an outer garment that is thick and not see-through that can cover the whole body and what's worn underneath"
