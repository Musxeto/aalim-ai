need a [Laughter] whipping I amab from one a I am Le from one a Le who are we here with today we are here with uh the man himself we're absolutely delighted and happy to have you do you want to say anything to our viewers introduce yourself I'm do I have to clap no no no no no we said that's before as Muslims we have to take care of our bodies to do what to pause and and and you know flex your muscles in front of the mirror or to yeah show people that this is me Sandra d and and the likes no you do this for the cause of Allah for for Being Fit for so many things that now when you criticize the sh for being fat or uh uh not that symmetrically goodlook you're not looking at their knowledge you're not looking at their times behind uh uh thousands of books they're reading teaching and and and and compiling so this is not fair yeah it goes hand in hand you need to be able to have the meni sit down with the books you can't do it all right whether it's Monday or Tuesday it doesn't make any difference what counts is why are you doing it yes so that's the people hit the gym to get likes from girls and getting for for illicit reasons some do it for self satisfaction some do it because it's their lifestyle so again it's not something essential in Islam that oh you have to hit the gy and lots of us who hit the gym compromise their religion so they hit to gym and there are women in their SP sports bras and uh can you spot me yeah with all means so again is this part of Islam No no definitely not so again she is very humble guys uh he does not I don't think you want to give an introduction of your please praise me as much as you can I need to inflate my head a little bit no just a small introduction he studied in University correct me if I'm wrong uh and he's been giving dawa for over 20 years 37 oh mallah even better 37 may Allah preserve you and continue to use your for good sh there's a whole room full of people here that are all uh all smiles and happy to see him and uh Allah continue to you know uh keep that smile uh on your face 37 years how old are you if you don't mind me ask 36 36ah you look like you're 20 aldah alhamdulillah okay so we're going to get into uh one very interesting thing that you your whole brand mallah you started a show that you answer questions uh you use social media in a really effective way you're reaching thousands of people or even Millions maybe masallah uh where did the idea come from and how did you start it alhamdulillah I started with the grace of Allah the almighty in um the media in like the year 2000 but I started preaching Islam in 1988 I think maybe or yeah some some somewhere around this this that year and it started in Arabic I was a student of knowledge the Masid next to my home uh all of a sudden lost the Imam they looked around they saw me being a teacher in high school capable of facing the congregation and and talking without fainting or any losing track like so many people do by the way yeah there are imams that go on the pulpit and they said alhamdulillah and they fall they faint they just lose it so they told me to give the so I researched like three four hours I prepared something I gave they liked it so insisted that I do it every week what was your first about if you don't mind me asking I so I I I I duh I don't even remember what I had for lunch last week you're asking me about my so I gave the and I I enjoyed practicing preaching what I practice and what I do and as a teacher you know you have this gift from Allah that you can explain things to people so that you can tell on their faces that I don't get it so you repeat it or they got it so I I I continued doing this alhamdulillah for a number of years until the year 2000 when one of the DI who had reputable uh presence in English among the community could not deliver one of his lectures so he asked me to fill in and I said I my English is not that uh qualified to give lectures in about Islam yeah I can speak but it's the termin ology lots of the things said no no you'll do good actually you'll do well but then you'll do good English teacher is always an English teacher so I know I gave that lecture and alhamdulillah people liked it and then I was asked to make an interview to one of my his name is Shan an Egyptian brother who very well versed in all Sciences of Shar and to give a season on TV in Arabic and it was it was like this yes so he was talking about the characteristics of the prophet in things about him that how he dealt with his wives and how he dealt with with others and and I was the interviewer and I I knew the Sheik and I just talk to him naturally yes and crack jokes and the she was serious and duh and it was fun and people liked it so afterwards I was um asked to present a show on the Saudi national TV in English oh W okay so I started to give lectures from in and that had also mashallah uh acceptance among the Muslims uh worldwide because it's from Saudi Arabia in 2001 Al Huda TV channel started in Egypt so I went there stayed for a couple of months did a number of programs among them was ask Huda which is till date airing but with Sheik Muhammad Salah Dr Muhammad Salah hosting it and it went on and 2007 I was invited by Dr Zak n to peace conference in mumbay and he gave me the platform to do whatever I want whatever you want to shoot shoot so I did so many programs on S on youth talk on uh the the companions men and women around the prophet Alam wasam uh legal maxims in Islam I did which is the full book from cover to cover over almost 200 episodes wow in a workshop in mumbay uh shot on uh High uh definition cameras that I think cost like 300,000 probably for movies and things yeah even Bollywood does not have that wow definitely does not have this and I did it in Bollywood Studios so I used to be dressed like this with my students and when we go out for break or for Salat and you go and you see the Bollywood actresses andan nothing it's safe and it was fun alhamdulillah and this is how it all started amazing Mah you have a very unique way of using humor within your when you're giving da or people are asking you questions is that uh targeted towards the youth are you just naturally funny how does that play into the way I'm always serious okay I I people just take it as humor I don't know why they're laughing but this is how like like guys like you guys say This Is How We Roll yes so I I I don't with the grace of Allah intend to I'm not a standup comedian I don't you know sit and and write jokes it comes up like naturally you make a comment I'm I'm I'm I'm gonna roast you yeah yeah so I'm guessing you've seen those YouTube videos of people adding your Clips out of context and just adding the sound effects I people sent them to me oh sh you were hilarious is said I'm not trying to be everyday daytoday activities this is as usual so I know you do this Q&A um on your show so can we like hear a very like inspiring story that inspir you to do this more da so many people ask me about these things I don't collect them yeah other than may Allah make you a a bigger acir air conditioner yeah this this yes we got it clip it we got it guys we got the clip th this came naturally W and and I'm I didn't intend it of course and people keep on taking these things and neglecting the like hours and hours of knowledge and serious stuff and reminders as if they have nothing better to do than okay what was this she's last latest joke but I think this is good right cuz the youth they can you know honestly still connect with you and look at the good stuff okay if this Chef said a joke here and there you know I'm able to actually learn from him and feel comfortable watching it's a double blade uh short see some of our friends and brothers in the da Circle don't like this she you're not being serious she you should be a serious she and present Islam in a way and I say to them listen I'm not going to change my colors for anyone this is who I am and I didn't ask you to put me in daah you guys keep on pushing me if it were to me W I would just you know hide in the shade and and enjoy life but you say to me you have to come and give this you have to do this please do this please do that I get in invite invitations from all over the world you have to do it and on the other hand lots of the people who are not practicing at all zero and some of them may not even pray pick up these funny clips enjoy it and then follow the serious stuff and then I get them coming to me and I look at them and said oh this guy's not the type to ask you Islamic questions and they ask you about really fine details in frustration and forgetfulness how do you do this you're interested in that and alhamdulillah this is a blessing from Allah beautiful mallah so there's three major things I think that cause a lot of corruption uh we have major issues because of these things uh correct me if I'm wrong I want to you know get your opinion on this uh social media Western ideologies uh and then not also having uh a religion uh being Godless not understanding our purpose um can you elaborate on that those three points is there something you can say that is this uh something that is causing majority of the issues or is it a long topic this the these are okay someone comes to you and says I have a severe headache yes you say to him no problem take two pills of Tylenol I think tyol is is a prevailing so it works like magic for six hours and then he comes back you give him another two two pills yes and you do this for a whole week did you help the man no not not long term why keep keeps getting the headache and he keeps getting the headache what is the headache it's a symptom so you're curing the symptom not the real illness so the topics you're giving are symptoms okay my wife doesn't abide by the hijab my son doesn't pray on time she my husband washes porn and masturbates and this is weird yes yeah you have a wife why would you go and master it but this is another topic this Cho is rated what no I mean it's good it's good the whatever you feel okay so go to the core problem so all these symptoms would go away when I find the youth having issues these are symptoms I have to address this it's even among those who are pretending to be practicing right they have a Dr jaal Mr hide personality in the morning there's something in the evening there's something else the she wears jeans and t-shirts and he's all buffed and now he looks like a preacher from meca what is this this is what you have to focus on once you do this all of these would disappear yes okay so at the root of the problem not too much on the symptoms correct that we're having because at the end of the day there's a voice in our hearts yes and whenever these hearts are not filled with the love of Allah the knowledge of Allah I ask any Muslim you know any Muslim how many names does Allah have 99 that's not Li limited to 99 but the Hadith said it's 99 100 minus one whoever meaning knows the meaning REM memorizes them and Implement them into his life will enter Jenna okay good for you here's an A4 paper how many names can you list the best of them would list probably 20 good for you out of these 20 how many can you give me the meaning of it yes the best of them will give you five then what and who are you praying to you don't know Allah so someone who masturbates or watches porn what is the meaning of and I get lots of counseling sessions paid yes uh um from guys who yeah complain and I said okay do you know said yeah all hearing all seeing so what does it mean they don't even know the meaning because they know what it the translation is but the implication they don't have it because if you know that Allah is watching you at this moment would you do what you're doing no would you watch the filth no so you have Allah awareness you're afraid of Allah you know that Allah is watching you we have a huge void in knowing who Allah is yes if we where you know then and I think that's where religion lacks a lot this is what's wrong with um some of us today is we don't know enough of Allah we don't know enough of right and for that it's it's it's a relationship with Allah is going to be real really really weak the knowledge we have is only theoretical not practical so we know of lordship of worship of the names and beautiful names and attributes of Allah let's put it to work yeah I know all of these things but I had a man come to my mid once on Thursday so a day before Friday saying sheh look at this paper and on this paper was a famous well-known story of Sakina the daughter of so and so that she saw in Her Dream what's happening in the Muslim world and that she cried and The Tear went down her eyes and uh she gave some form of preaching and the person who saw the dream woke up and she said that she wrote this story and handed it to others and whoever uh rewrites it or print it five times or six times and distributes it he will get a fortune and whoever this cards it and tears it up Allah would send him a Calamity a guy tore it up ended losing his son another one lost his uh um trade and got broke and and imprisoned one uh uh printed six copies of it and got a fortune another one did this he got mashallah so I he said she look at this shik and they've copied it and distributed it on all the cars in the neighborhood so I said in our neighborhood Subhan Allah I'll I'll talk about it tomorrow may Allah bless you said okay take this paper and tear it up and throw it he said you do it so he didn't even fully believe it so the Guy believes that this is sh but he's afraid so I I said to the people and look what's happening I get gave a and at the end I read the paper and I said look what shik is happening and I tore it in front of everybody I got a stroke yes but nothing happened alhamdulillah aldah course this is walking the talk that was mentioning M amazing so uh to touch back on this point of social media uh mallah you're using social media in a good way I hope we're using social media in a good way inshallah um there's obviously dangers of it it could result in so much corruption people use it to let's say show relationships in the wrong way there's a countless things that we can name I want to touch on the positive aspect and if you could tell the viewers and people who are interested in using social media how it can be done uh any with the Islamic in mind first of all I have nothing to do with social media none whatsoever like8 years ago maybe 9 years ago a sister from Romania and may Allah bless her and her girls and boys wherever she is she came to me and she said she I follow your shows and I love what you do Etc and I'd like to document what you do for future references and benefit for the people so I said to her you're talking to the wrong guy I'm I'm a dinosaur I don't know these things so she said I'll take care of it and she started a YouTube channel where she used to cut the questions and put them like compile them yeah and and put some tag words to them later on uh she said why don't we make a website at the time I used to answer approximately like 80 questions a day from uh all over the place coming to my email personal email and I said okay so I spoke to one of my relatives my brother-in-law he struck his chest and said I'll do it for you and all expenses on me he said okay I like freebies so he did pay for the domain name and someone else designed it for free and the sister was handling all of it so that I would not have to reinvent the wheel every single day yes so the question that I answered about the ruling on music yes kalas she has it and anyone who asks we just give them the link yes sir and Subhan Allah she made a team of other girls whom I've never spoken to don't know them don't know where they come yes and it grew and they've made the website to what it is today all volunteer work Allah bless them and the YouTube channel was handed to another sister who took it to a new whole level with her team I think it has like 900,000 followers or something close to a million I had nothing to do with I don't know even how to operate these you're not taking any credit for it nothing zero alhamdulillah no you have to take credit for the content no I no no not even I don't it's amazing care about credits you just do what you do and just throw it in the sea as as we say in Arabic of course if as long as Allah rewards you this is all the credit you need so all what's happening the Facebook one of the sisters said we would like to make a fan page for you okay so I think it's has like 300,000 400,000 who's counting and um the YouTube the website I have nothing to do with those Instagram 1.3 million one of my fans not an air conditioner small one came and she sent me an email she can I post your um stuff on my Instagram it's in your name yes I will not monetize it I will not make money out of it I will not follow anyone said okay if these conditions are fulfilled bah and mallah now it's 1.3 I have nothing to do with I don't know even know the sister people are telling me complain to Instagram and claim it back you can make money out of it I said why should I she's doing a good job may Allah reward her for thatan Twitter is only mine nobody controls us because I whenever I have enough time and on on my hands I just go for an hour answer questions troll people and and move on an X actually um I don't like the name yeah keep it he'll he'll change it to Twitter yeah okay yes so this is uh so as you say guys go go on Twitter and look at's tweets this is another problem I want to add people are on Tik Tok are you familiar with Tik Tok I downloaded it couple of years years ago and it was like 5:00 p.m. and at 9:00 I noticed that four hours passed yeah that's what it does too so I deleted it that's what it does I don't have it that's that's all the experience you need that's it tonight these guys they get their Islam from Tik Tok they get it from their fyps so there's different sects of Islam that say different things and people just okay I have the knowledge now let me go portray it to other people and it's I feel like it's an issue for all of us well like I don't know because as I said I don't see it I don't watch it apparently a lot of the people watch my material on it yeah oh I see you every time on my fyp show I think but hope this even the serious stuff yes not only the funny stuff yes yeah so people are benefiting alhamdulillah alhamdulillah and one way or the other I think people think of me as convincing maybe it's it's a white beard they think this guy is not gonna you know say wrong info and they've seen me a lot so they got to the level of trusting me yes which is good alhamdulillah alhamdulillah and then there's other people like haters saying just taking yourself out of context I have no problem with those you know it's all uh bark no bite no B so these guys can't get under my skin alhamdulillah and the the the the truth will always Prevail so let them say whatever they want and then they have no any value and and I have no beef with anyone yes that's amazing way to approach it and I think uh they almost just Tred to creat like uh it's a cause of FNA right they can become so much FNA they want to get a reaction if you react and respond this becomes a f it's may Allah have mercy on him one of the guys was cursing him and slandering in his face and he only said it's you when it went really overboard the one who's cursing said to him listen I'm talking to you I'm you I'm cursing yes and Z said you I'm ignoring yes so I'm not going to reply to I'm not going to defend myself it's it's it's here in in in Canada we are in Canada right yeah so will you walk down the streets when it's summer yeah like a week a year um and you get dogs and people have dogs oh of course so when a dog barks you're not going to fall in your hands and knees and bark back no oh no I hope not so you're not going to go to their level let them bark actually I just from the other way if a dog breaks at me I mess with dog other well I just look them in the eyes one and then they know that they shouldn't do that again so here's what I'm going to do I'm going to pay 100K Mah I'm GNA buy Lamborghini and a bunch of gold for her are you going to stop me or no who in her right mind would marry you for these things unless she's a gold digger but just for the record I I hope hope people understand muhab is capable of doing this just for the you're not going to marry him no no definitely not alhamdulillah why are you defending him no I'm defending him so he can get married hold on hold on this is what she said there's value in our marriage if you put this much into it then you'll care more about a relationship in an in Arab proverb we say so all you who married a monkey for its wealth the wealth goes and the monkey stays as it is so don't ever think that when you talk about materialistic things and you propose to a woman and she accepts you that she's a solid woman that would be a good wife and a good mother to your kids look for someone like the ET saidat a woman is sought after for her lineage for her uh wealth for her beauty and for her religious commitment so grab the one with the religious commitment or may your hands be catching dust and dirt if you don't do so now if you can get the one with the religious commitment who is Rich beautiful and from a good family that's a win-win show me her sister I got you I'm a family man but if it push me too far I just might and you're okay with saying this on camera we can cut that part no no my wife doesn't speak that good English and again my wife's uh uh um Moto would be lots of B no b no B okay I want to say another point and I want to address the camera with this uh again please you know I want to hear your perspective on this people I think see marriage as a transaction they see it as um I'm buying my wife I can do it on financing leasing it's a Netflix subscription uh you know we could do payment plans I hear all these kind of things when it comes to Mah um how do we navigate this kind of problem this is due to the fact that we live in a materialistic way or or world people that come and propose to my uh daughters usually come they're father MH usually with because it's this is our level not the the boy the father comes and says how much M are you asking and this is legit yes because you don't want to embarrass yourself at the day of writing the contract and the the Imam says okay what's the Mahar and you say a million no let's let's start bargaining no so before things get further the guy asks so I said listen whatever you pay it's fine with me we're not selling and buying yes exactly I am buying a son rather than selling a daughter that's a good yes this is how it goes but in today's materialistic World both families look at where's the wedding going to take place which hotel how many guests what are you going to pay for Mahar what is the gold okay what about the uh videography what about this what about that all materialistic things and they end up adding to the bill something that would be making the groom indebted for like six seven years in advance so unfortunately this is what happens when you don't go for religious commitment in contrast to that you got people coming as if they're just buying any uh a commodity from the market no no this is too expensive the prophet said the Le and are the Most Blessed so no I'm going to give you one dime yes what is this at least respect the woman respect her family no no I don't want a wedding I don't want this I don't want that and they come in a controlling way and so many stupid men do look do respect they come and say she I don't know what's happening I proposed to 10 women and they all rejected me said I look at the guy he looks okay his credentials okay what was it that you said that triggered them said I don't know every time I propose to woman I said listen I'm considering mading Fe and for just to give you heads up said heads down yeah of course you should be kicked out of their homes immediately you're stupid said no she I just don't want to cheat them said who told you that you are going to get married to a second or third this is what you presume why wouldn't she come back to you and say okay listen I'm giving you a heads up if we get married I may file for after six months yes how would you feel of course so I they need to be educated they need to be enlighted with I don't know if my English is is off I'm using words from so they have to know how to treat people and how to be perceived rather than just throw bombs and then expect any good things to come out of that so how do I let her know that I want more than one that like the proper way you don't is way her knowing you don't do the prophet said Allah has prescribed kindness on everything so when you Slaughter your sacrifice make it Swift and make it Rel uh uh feel relaxed by slaughtering it quickly and you should sharpen your blade now this is for sacrificing yes if you want to get married to a second wife don't give her heads up for for the next 10 years torturing her every day listen she's going to be blonde she's going to be blueeyed she's going to be this and that she's going to be a good cook and everything that your wife doesn't have you're got to tell her my second wife is going to have this this is killing her softly yes no what you should do is keep a lid on it you're my girl you're the one and the only one and once you want to go for it a day or two after everything is finalized say listen hun I love you but it has to be done and weigh the consequences of that but you don't imagine that you're going to get married to more than one and tell her ahead of time making her live a miserable life of course and actually women are going to be jealous they're going to have some type of weight nature yes and I think we we're going to clip this and we're going to make sure it goes on Tik Tok for us young men to see because before they want the first they want they're already think about four before they want why would they marry four yeah seriously let's let's be frank I can give you an honest answer sure I genuinely believe the men who want it are guys who are just they haven't had a first wife and their sexual desires are out of control nope no 100% not true okay you say because most if not all those who want to get married to more than one they're thinking of buying another SUV and a sports car and a sedan yes so they just want to flex their muscles how many wives do you have only one I'll got like two and if you have two yeah Allah permitted four what is this yes so they're not thinking of the bigger picture and if you go to their homes most of them they have problems they're not fair they don't spend enough time they favor one over the other and it's not what it seems to be yes I've done that I've been there I was mared to two women for 25 years together alhamdulillah and I know all the headache that comes with it yes it's good if you're fair and if you're just and if you're rich which I I was the first two I was but the third one W no I had a big deficiency in that and it has negative implication on your health so I I'm diabetic I have high blood pressure high cholesterol and I have three stance in my heart because of being fair not to get overboard not to get angry not to say a a hurtful word and alhamdulillah I never did this with the grace of Allah you give you full health and continue to preserve you inshallah aldah okay very well said honestly I want to talk about now moving from Marriage I want to talk about now this word is used very easily oh I see you you're ath always welcome wife you're ath can we explain to the viewers what a deth is the prophet said in an authentic Hadith there are three whom Allah does not look at does not have mercy that does not purify and will torment them severely on the day of judgment and the youth and the third one if I'm not mistaken the one who is an alcoholic so the youth as he explained that to us the prophet when they said to him what is the youth he said he's the man who allows his woman folk to engage in illicit and immodest uh uh Behavior so the youth is not someone whose wife doesn't wear the hijab no not not only that it is something more is the one who like goes to nightclubs with his wife and doesn't mind his wife dancing with someone else H doesn't mind his wife traveling on a business trip with colleagues like to a Resort in in a 3 days business ledger trip to Vegas and what happens in Vegas as we know who stays in Vegas so he says what what what where's your wife she she went to Vegas doing what magic mic what is this this is the youth no no doubt about it so the word is a word of insult yes you cannot use it with another Muslim unless you are saying to him may Allah curse you may Allah do this to you and this goes back to you so no no muslim in his right mind would use it and if you had to sorry you had to like uh translate the word the something that came up was people would say protective jealousy is that the right way to describe it is there a better way to translate it no the youth is the one who does who allows his women folk to engage in illicit and IM modest uh behavior and he's fine with it yes she is okay Sor yes okay so can she have Instagram am I ath if I let my wife have Instagram if she has an in again you have to be specific this is too generic a woman who's fully fully hijabi modest has an Instagram account it does not show her fingernails of course she can have it okay so but if she tell me that my woman goes on Instagram showing her abs okay and in the bathroom miror shot a youth big time okay okay one more one more one more if I come to you I sayum Chef this is my wife if I introduce you to my wife is that am myth depends first of all on a number of factors number one is your wife yes or no if it's yes okay I I see a sack of potatoes I can't figure out how she looks in nothing but if she's uh uh totally in her makeup and wearing mini skirts and uh cleavage and the whole nine yards and you say this is my wife which one of you wearing the pants I can't figure it out this is inappropriate maybe you're in introducing her to someone who's over 60 like myself because you have a problem you would like to discuss again this is what you're not asking her to flirt with me it's she's a human being so of course if she's totally covered and you say this is my wife this is my sister there's no problem in that and how do we also div uh like have an understanding between what is crossing the line in terms of let's say the term of right for a woman because you know we're both single guys we're struggling we're worried single ready to mingle and yeah I don't know about mingling with SH what does that mean I have no idea you are with a sh expect me to say you need you need like you need a s you need a whipping no no you can't mingle and definitely single ready to marry yesing and and like said may Allah be pleased with when he saw someone like you guys not married and he said well one of two reasons either you're impotent or you a sinful person doing illicit actions what's preventing you from Maring one of the two no it's not new Cas I hope no no I'm not talking about myself I'm agreeing with this is what so no no no need to mingle or just you live in Canada I have so many women coming to me from Canada from America we don't have can you take my contact after this can you be our Advocates like help us yeah come on you guys not serious first of all because if I give you 10 oh sh she has to be Iraqi oh sh she has to Tobago and and Trinidad or whatever she has to be my mom says this she had to expose me H right on camera and she she has to be from Arab descent not from the south of or this or that my mom wouldn't you guys have red tapes so don't say I need take our contacts you guys are not serious whoever wants to get married there are thousands of girls out there looking for someone who would take care of them some of the boys say they want to get married when they meet someone who wants to get married they want her to chip in the expenses okay you pay the electricity bill you do this you do that no if you're a real man she doesn't put a penny in the expenses of course so again give me a break so her money is her money our money is her money no your money is your money her money is her money no joint account none of this nonsense you don't know her bank account number or her pin number for the ATM she doesn't know how much you earn how much you save nothing I can't know anything about her financial yes you shouldn't because then you'll be looking for a sugar mummy yes of course of course and your attention can become like uh clouded the most most of of the problems and disputes among spouses in North America and Europe revolves around money yes he calls she he doesn't tell me how much he ears and I say s business I paid $100 for your consultation bananas $100 yeah for how long half an hour oh wow can we do one right now make some money you pay peanuts you get monkeys yes you pay half a hour $100 you get a gorilla so alhamdulillah alhamdulillah so when it comes to selecting a wife since you we were discussing this topic um how do we be careful of uh in terms of the way like when we see a woman we obviously want to be attracted to her uh but that's not the main concern as we discussed right from thei the prophet wasallam so there's so much more important things but in terms of Attraction a lot of men will say lower your standards so you can find a woman that's good but is that something that's uh could it actually be beneficial or could it cause problems in the future the issue is not your standards the issue is in your intention most successful marriages are arranged marriages in the sense mom look for a woman I don't want her to be dark I don't want her to have um um Japanese eyes like mine I don't want her to be this I don't want to be that so you have certain features references yes and she goes and do head hunting for you and she gives you a list this girl belongs to this family to this family to this family she has a ba she has a BS she has this and that BS as in bachelor degree I know I know I I'm a teacher I said s so I told you I I know the reactions of people when I see it so you short list and say okay this one is good you do your due diligence she asks around her friends her relatives she's uh a nice has a nice temper she's kind she loves kids she um participates in volunteering work any she checks most of the boxes right you contact the father or she contacts the mother she visits them she tells them my son is lath lath means lion but he's actually a small kitten he's nice he's this he's that so they think they do their due diligence ask around and said okay the guy has bracelets and yeah his teeth will look nice in the future hopefully you never know well you have a mutual agreement you contact the father you go and sit with him he gives you an interview he likes you all boxes are checked now he invites his daughter to come in with the tea or with the coffee or with and she sits with you you look at her she looks at you you talk for half an hour that's it okay okay you go back home huh well um I think I need more time ah you want a date no wrong uh uh uh procedure the issue is is there a chemistry well not she's I I feel I feel relaxed this is a face I'd like to wake up every morning and and and and find next to me and she says he's he's okay his temper is fine he did not mention getting married to two or three in advance so yeah I think it's okay we go right this is what I did 40 years ago and I'm still with my wife alhamdulillah it's life sentence any parole but we're happy yes guys if you guys made it this far into the video this amazing brother sh make sure you guys press the Subscribe button make sure you guys press the Bell notification so you guys will not miss another video we'll be right back after this welcome back to uh the podcast second part of the podcast with uh we're going to jump into a very interesting segment we're going to be giving she a taste of his own medicine in a good way inshallah she is known for answering questions on a call also I think you do it live as well it's all live all live everything live so we have all our viewers on Tik Tok here they're going to be rolling in with questions and she is going to be doing it I guess quick fire if you can noral noral depends on this question course first question can woman go to without Mah she is 50 years old if you're asking about the legal uh um answer yes but if you're asking about the Shar answer the Islamic answer the prophet answered this question and he said it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to travel without a Mah a man stood up and said oh prophet of Allah I my name was drafted to an expedition so and so for Jihad and my wife went for Hajj the prophet immediately say go and catch up with your wife he did not say is she Young or old beautiful or ugly alone or with trustworthy companionship he said go and catch up with your wife so this is the answer of the Prophet sorry just to clarify what can you define M for the people that don't know Maham is a male relative who cannot marry this woman for life except her husband meaning her father her son her brother her uncle with a paternal maternal her nephew uh whether from her brother or from her sister and her her uh stepson her stepfather um and her husband right okay next question is Forex Trading Haram this this can't be rapid fire this has to be like heavy artillery because Forex is a digital platform there's there's no actual buying and selling so it's all a gimmick you don't know where your money is generally speaking this is okay if it is in general stocks there's no leverage there is no margins there's no borrowing with interest and there's no transaction in gold silver or uh uh currency because this has to be simultaneous give and take physically other than that if you're buying shares in oil companies or uh Commodities and Hal stuff this is Hal okay if Allah has already written everything why life because if you came on the day of judgment and Allah said okay you go to hell you go to heaven he said I didn't live said no I know that you would have done this and that said prove it to me so Allah is the most Fair the most just he is giving you a chance to choose now what are you doing you're choosing the right thing or the wrong thing why are on Tik Tok this is Haram but watching this podcast is okay so alhamdulillah you made the right to decision alah next question there's a lot of Subhan Allah things we can't say very yeah saying uh the best way to learn the Quran to read it memorize it understand the meaning of it and do it as a regular daily habit not not not yeah less than half an hour a day this is the easiest and best consistency is the name of the game so my Dua isn't being answered what do I do you're a liar the prophet sallallah Al said whenever a person makes Dua Allah answers it in three different ways number one oh Allah give me $1,000 boom you get $1,000 either by some someone granting you a relative dies and you inherit $1,000 or any other means number two oh Allah give me $1,000 Allah doesn't give it to you cash but it was pre uh uh it was pred decreed so that you'd have an accident that would smash your front spoiler and your headlights and cost you ,000 and by a few millimeters you evaded that and Escape it so you say oh my car is this my car is that my ability to drive no Allah answered your Dua so he deflicted this harm from you number three oh Allah give me $1,000 Allah doesn't give you to you in cash Allah does not deflect harm from you but Allah stores it on the day of judgment so you come say whoa what are these mountains of good deeds and you you will be told that this is your Dua on that day you ask for $1,000 on that day you ask for a beautiful wife on that day you ask for this and that and I'm giving it to you now in good teach if God exists why are their children dying so if God does not exist why do they still die that's a stupid question with all the due respect this guy is stoned or something listen listen listen to me yes who owns this universe God so if he decides to Burn It To The Ground who has the ability to complain or object no one if I take a $100 bill and I burn it nobody can say what are you doing this is mine it's none of your business we believe that Allah is fair and just he would not do something without a legitimate wise reason but we are unable to see that because we're so limited in our knowledge and our comprehension it's like a 70-year-old who's the doctor says we have to operate to take his appendix or he'll die he go he looks at his father he says it's going to be fine they put him on the stretcher they take off his clothes they come with the anesthesia and he sees the surgeon with I don't know what they knife a scalp or something yeah whatever the hammer in the nail I don't know so the guy looks at his father said Dad the guy's going to cut me up said it's okay F son it's going to be fine now the son doesn't see the wisdom of it yes but the father does yes and Allah has the highest example Allah Asel tortures children not because he loves to torture them there's a bigger reason and wisdom and benefit from that without Darkness we would not appreciate the light without illness we would not appreciate appreciate Health yes without poverty we would not appreciate wealth and so on so you could ask from here till F why did Allah create Satan if he knows that Satan is going to deviate us why did Allah create volcanoes and earthquakes and you only look at the negatives and you don't see the positive why do you say why Allah gave us sight hearing health wealth Prosperity a sealing over our heads food on our table and the likes you never ask why Allah made breathing so cheap and affordable to everyone you only look at the bad things that you don't see the benefit and the the wisdom from which Satan is controlling you and making you think and Allah knows this last question she promise yes I promise she's asked this multiple times no I'm not available I can't get mad okay so B sorry I just s for the question okay I'm just going to ask a different question it's hugging sorry okay can woman travel with big group of girls or do they need a m no I answered the first question yeah it answers this question multiple times yep you guys got the answer replay the live can I just tell them that sure or you want to just tell it to them five seconds no you tell it to them I'm okay guys just just here said it to us you guys can rewatch The live inshallah thank you so much I hope we gave you a little taste of your own show here in Canada the coffee uh no The Latte inside joke guys okay um so she you've mentioned the prophet s wasam multiple times if you had the chance to speak to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam what would you say to him how would that conversation go what would you ask I'll just say I love you that's it I can't say anything more so well said well said honest it's a question that you can answer in different so many different ways and it's it's a true honor and hopefully we all can unite in Janan all right we're going to finish with this this our podcast is called one aah we're a tradition here we're going to ask you one aah that comes to mind or resonates with you every time you hear it and we the viewers and us would love to hear it in there is nothing greater than aat see and it has the description of Allah and this is why it's the greatest Ayah in the whole Quran and if you look at the greatest Surah of the Quran is you want us to answer yeah greatest Surah in the Quran he should be shot these guys are the one being interviewed they're on the the hot seat so and it begins with praising Allah in the first three verses alhamdulillah so anything that includes the description of Allah the beautiful names of Allah is great so by no means there's nothing greater than thank you so much for coming on one Ayah thank you so much for giving us your amazing knowledge and if we could we would sit for multiple hours but we know you have to go we know you're on a tight schedule and who said that I would be willing to sit with all the respect for having me it was a pleasure and I pray to Allah that he makes that this uh uh podcast a good and beneficial one for the umah and to make you guys steadfast on Dean and to increase your knowledge in Islam and and to cement the love of Allah and the Prophet Muhammad in our hearts in everybody's watching inah will be back for part two in the future where where come back in the summer inshallah when it's actually warm yeah you if if I live that long I am 64 years of age alhamdulillah I'm just waiting for my SMS give you a long life and then what you keep doing what you're doing and then what it's going to end at some point that's it so alhamdulillah as long as I'm still able to stand walk and pray without needing a chair I'm I'm I'm fine and I pray to Allah that he gives all of us a good ending on on on and he does not make us grow old until we're scile and people have to change our diapers and and service I hope that we reach that age know I am M from one this has from you know I mean [Music]"
