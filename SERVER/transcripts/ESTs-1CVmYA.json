  "transcript": "foreign we continue to study this blessed book of and we've reached Hadith number 53 the Hadith of our mother may Allah be pleased with her and who will read this for us reported that the prophet may peace be upon him said if supper is served and ikama is pronounced one should start with the supper in another narration there is no prayer complete while in the presence of food or while wanting to answer the call of nature very well now in this Hadith the prophet Allah is telling us is showing us how to achieve the perfect prayer and part of achieving the perfect prayer is that you let your mind free don't have anything that occupies you and remember may Allah be pleased with him if you perform the ablution and then you pray to rakas without being distracted with but without thinking in this world what would happen Allah would forgive all of your sins previous sins and these are voluntary rakas so imagine if this was attained and achieved in vodraka and fourth prayer what would happen definitely it's of a higher magnitude so the prophet is telling us Allah about a condition that may happen with any one of us which is you come to your home whether it's Aloha where it is if it's Asia and the food is served and the Akama is announced so what is the proper thing to do if you follow Your Instinct if you follow your guts if you follow whatever you want to follow you will say I'll go to pray I don't need food I'm not hungry but if you follow the Sunnah you will stay and eat this is the Sunnah why because even if you go to the Masjid you'll think oh that roasted chicken looked so good and the cold drink with ice um you're thinking about the food and if you're hungry it's even worse so the prophet is telling you this is an exceptional case you may sit and eat and Scholars differed what to eat would I eat the full big lamb in front of me which would take me three four hours or would I only take one bite and two and leave Scholars say that you eat what you need which would take the food of your mind and usually this is done by taking half a plate eating it you feel full you go for prayer and you still have one or two rakas because eating is not that long now also among the things they indicate they say you have to be careful not to be cheating and what do we mean by cheating that every time you come home it is time for night prayer for Aisha prayer so you always call your wife and say listen the minute it's five minutes four minutes before ikama put the food so you come and you find the food and you eat and you miss Salah no this is not permissible because you're cheating Allah azzawajal is giving us an exemption that we can eat and miss the prayer every now and then but not every single day and not every you have the breakfast always before the Akama of Fajr you have lunch always before Akama of the and you have dinner always before Akama of Asia out of five sixty percent discount I'm I'm doing good no this is not appropriate at all and this is always found in Ramadan I don't know here in India when do you give a comma of Maghrib immediately after a then or you give 15 minutes you give 15 minutes most of the countries do this why they give people time to eat so that they can attend the prayer when they are full according to the Sunnah alhamdulillah also there is another and that is you do not Pray when you are in need to answer the call of nature so if you have the urge to urinate or pasture and the time of prayer is close don't pray go and answer the call of nature yes but it may take long maybe the prayer would be missed no problem Allah will give you the reward but it is not at all acceptable for you to go and in the prayer you're doing this what are you doing I just want him to finish he will not finish until he finishes so going into prayer with such a state definitely takes the soul of prayer out what is the soul of the prayer to Bow and prostrate without even contemplating no that is why the prophet is telling us Allah you have to free your mind not to occupy yourself because the greatest deed of yours is Salat if you perfect it everything would be accepted imagine the prophet said the first deed you will be held accountable on the day of judgment is Salat so if your Salat is correct all other deeds will be accepted your fasting your zakat your Hajj all of these would be acceptable because your prayer was good and Prophet says but if it was rejected the prayer was not acceptable you were not in the sense of Purity you did not pray it on time you did not have sure in it the prophet says all of his other deeds will be rejected as well then your fasting your zakah your Hajj will not be accepted so this is a very serious thing to take care of and to try your best to have your full concentration while in prayer we move on to Hadith number 54 and 55. and who will read it to us narrated by Omar the prophet forbade praying after the Fajr prayer which prophet um the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam forbid praying after the Fajr prayer till the sun rises and after the Asura prayer till the sun sets saying there is no prayer after a sub morning prayer until the sun rises and there is no prayer after al-asra late afternoon prayer until the sun sets Okay these two hadiths talk about the same topic and there is The Forbidden times of prayer and this is a long topic we will try to summarize it as much as possible during the day and night there are times Muslims are forbidden to pray not any prayer but voluntary prayers that do not have a legitimate cause General voluntary prayers and these times as mentioned in this Hadith are two and some Scholars make them as five and actually they are three so now you've got us confused are they two three or five well it depends on how you look at them so the two times mentioned here are after you pray aser until the sun sets and after you pray Fajr until the sun rises and it does not State how far it should rise and we will come to mention this inshallah what is the third place or the third time the third time is when the sun is rising when it becomes midday and before it declines exactly when it's in the middle of the sky and the shade of an erected object is no more because the directed object is there the shade was decreasing as the sun was Rising once the erected object does not have a shade it is forbidden for you to pray and this usually takes about five to ten minutes very little time may Allah be pleased with him indicates this Hadith indicates to us this time and he said that three times the prophet Island forbade us from praying and from burying our debt so these are the three times now how would we make them five times we make them five times by saying that from Asar till the sun is about to set this is one time and from the Sun time setting this is extremely forbidden so this is a specific time that takes about seven to ten minutes now from Fajr time till Before Sunrise this is a long time this is forbidden for you to pray the minute the Sun starts to rise this is completely prohibited and forbidden because this is a limited time and the Restriction is there and the fifth time is when what we have described when the sun is in the Meridian in the middle of this kind now what is forbidden for us to pray the prophet said forbade us from praying and he did not elaborate so Scholars differed a lot among their differences we exclude the mandatory prayers the five daily prayers these you pray them any time whether the sun is coming is going as long as you've missed it for a legitimate reason you prayed example someone goes to bed and wakes up for Fajr prayer as the sun is rising what do we tell him to do he says I have to wait five minutes until the sun rises no pray immediately no problem someone wakes up not praying al-assur and the Sun is setting immediately go and pray you don't have any excuse to postpone it or wait for it we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back and welcome back in regard to the times that we've forbidden to pray in some Scholars said that you are not allowed to pray any type of prayer other than the mandatory prayer so if you pray answer after also you do not pray any type of prayer at all and some Scholars said that no you can't pray a particular number of prayers and this is the opinion of Imam Shafi and also may Allah have mercy on their souls and they said let's look at the different number of prayers after Asura prayer we concluded prayer if there is an eclipse of the Sun do we pray the prayer of eclipse or not those who said you do not pray any kind of prayer said yes you do because this is something that the prophet instructed us to do they said okay after praying answer prayer they brought a dead person and we would like to pray the funeral prayer to bury him do we do that or wait until Maghrib they said no you do that yes you pray so Scholars said if you allowed this in two or more prayers this means that the Restriction is not General the restriction which is do not pray is not General there are specifics that we exempt from it and among them is the funeral prayer and the eclipse what else the prophet said Allah whenever some of you enter the Masjid he should not sit until he prays to urakas I prayed answer and I went to another Masjid an hour and a half before Maghrib I went in what should I do should I stay standing up until Maghrib or should I sit without praying the turacus scholars say no you pray the turacas because these are not General voluntary prayers what you're not permitted to do is after praying answer you say hmm I have an hour and a half what to do what to do what to do I'll pray 50. say no sit why I'm praying for Allah yes but you're praying in the wrong time and the prophet told you Allah do not pray so you have to comply and you cannot pray such prayers so this is the way of the scholars by looking at all the evidences you combine and you join all of them together and apply them all because those who said no you don't pray any prayer neglected that there are instructions for us to pray so they neglected this Hadith but these Scholars such as when they looked at the whole picture they gathered all the evidences and they applied it by saying yes you must not pray any prayer that is General but if it's a specific prayer you can pray it and one may ask what about istihara scholar says you can pray it afterwards you don't have to pray it now though it's a legitimate reason but you can pray it afterwards unless you're about to do something you have to do it now for example someone is going after assert he met a friend and his friend told him I'm selling my car for so much money and he thought that it was a great deal but he said if you don't give me the money now I'm going to the car market I'm going to sell it there I'm not going to wait for you so the time is very restricted for him very limited so it's permissible for him to pray and buy the car because if he waits the car would have been sold elsewhere and he would have lost the reward we move on to the final Hadith today which we read something similar to it number 56. after the sun had set and said o messenger of Allah I could not offer the Asura prayer until the sun was about to set the prophet said by Allah I have not even performed the Asura prayer so we turn towards Busan awali near Al Madina and the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam performed abolition for it then he performed as a prayer and then and the son had said and then he offered the Maghrib prayer after prayer this Hadith was mentioned before but the scholars talk or use it for a different purpose and that is if someone missed two or more prayers for a legitimate reason what should he do for example someone goes to sleep at midnight and for illness or for any other reason he does not pray Fajr he does not pray and he wakes up at Asar time just before Maghrib so what should he pray or how does he pray the majority of Scholars say that he has to pray and follow the sequence and that is he has to follow this unless her prayer is about to be over so if he wakes up like five minutes before sunset if he prays Fajr then answer would also be out of time so he would be praying three prayers out of time but if he praise us he would pray it on time so he would be only praying to miss Salat two missed prayers so the norm is you have to pray in accordance through the order and Asar unless the other time is about to be missed as well in this case it becomes a priority so that you would be praying to Mr prayers instead of praying three missed prayers is this we open the floor for questions preferably about the times of prayers preferably about making up prayers and the likes about praying with your mind occupied elsewhere yes brother Sheikh if I am traveling in a car with a group of non-muslims and I cannot ask the car to be stopped you know because we are trapped can I do my prayers in the car itself if the time is there if I know the direction you're traveling you're traveling or in the town I'm traveling in the car I am in the car in the town or between cities between cities or in town no in town in town if you're traveling in town you must stop at all cost at any cost if they refuse tell them you have to stop and drop you because you in town you're not traveling and you cannot pray in town sitting down not facing the Qibla not doing your prostration and bowing as you're supposed to because you are in the town if you're traveling it's a different issue and we will come to that inshallah by traveling you may lose some of the conditions such as facing the Qibla such as not being able to stand if there isn't any possibility of doing it and we will come to discuss this inshallah in detail once we reach there Sheikh you mentioned in one of the Hadith about if a person has a desire to visit the toilet that he shouldn't pray but if the karma is given in the you know the people are going to pray and a person he doesn't have that much amount of Desire it's just like you know he can control it for two hours one hour so what should he do join the JAMA or the Hadith is fighting the call of nature the Hadith is referring to fighting the call of nature so if you're fighting it yes you have to go and answer it but if it's a light thing that you have the ability to wait for an hour or two it is not something that occupies your mind the funny thing is a lot of the Muslims do not answer the call of nature because they don't want to perform Moodle why don't you go and answer them no if I go I have to take my socks I have to go to the bathroom no no I'll pray and afterwards I answer the call of Nature and which tells you the level of interest and importance of prayer in their hearts as well there is this one narration at which I wanted a clarification but once Bilal one who had taken the responsibility to wake up all the Companions and the prophet and the prophet woke up and found Bilal sleeping so he said not obilal you did not wake us up so he waited until the sun had risen completely and then they performed the Fajr well this was not actually for the Fajr to my knowledge because the Hadith stated that the prophet Islam instructed them to move and change their location and he stated in the Hadith that this is a location where shaytan was present that is what made us sleep and that is why the scholars say that if a person oversleeps Fajr in a place he should change his place so if you overslept on Fajr in your bedroom don't make up the prayer in your bedroom go to the living room and this is Hadith of Bilal is in the sahih why because they say the prophet Justified this this is a location where shaytan was here let us move so this is a legitimate reason but it to my knowledge it has nothing to do with the rising of the Sun and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
