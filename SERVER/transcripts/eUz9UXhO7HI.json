  "transcript": "we know that when a man and a woman decide to separate this is either done by choice when the man himself divorces his wife by saying aunty tada you're divorced or we're divorced or by the woman filing for her and she compensate her husband by returning his dowry or parts of it and in exchange for that financial compensation he agrees for hire and they separate or it can be done forcefully by the Muslim judge after studying the case and finding that marriage cannot continue or that there is something that prevents the marriage from existing such in the case of one of the spouses rejects Islam and becomes an apostate in horror what happens is that there's a mutual agreement usually in some cases the judge enforces such a process where the wife says she wants to bail out she doesn't want to stay in this marriage and she has her reasons if verified and legit and the husband does not want to the judge forces him to and if the husband is ok with that and he decides to settle by accepting his dowry back or part of it any financial contribution in this case the separation takes place so the moment he says I agree and he takes the money they're separated they are not man and wife anymore and a woman in the whole ER process has an ADA"
