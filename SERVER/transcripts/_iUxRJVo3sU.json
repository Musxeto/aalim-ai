  "title": "Imam is slightly tilted towards a different direction, is praying behind him valid?- Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Abdul Wahab says if there is a slight divergence between the Imam and those praying behind him so the Imam is a little bit tilted while everybody else is praying in a different direction is the prayer valid answers yes you see when you are not actually in the harem seeing the cup the carpet a blur and you're far away from it you are obliged to face the direction and the direction may vary and the prayer is still valid imagine this dr. Blay is this way and I'm praying this way there's no problem as long as the diversion is acceptable the Prophet said are they a sort of sum to the people of Medina and we know that Mecca which is the Qibla is to the south of Medina so the people of Medina this is their South the Prophet said to them I racism what's between the East and the West is Qibla so all this is considered to be a crib Allah but of course if you know that it's this you shouldn't divert but if we do divert a little bit your prayer is still valid and usually the Imam would turn a little bit to the right or to the left because when they had built the Masjid it wasn't built straight to the Hitler it was built with a little bit of diversion so after the Masjid was built and they've discovered that the tabla is a little bit tilted it's easier for the Imam to tilt himself rather than the whole draw which they have marks on the ground so this is what usually happens in the sharla the salat is valid when Allah"
