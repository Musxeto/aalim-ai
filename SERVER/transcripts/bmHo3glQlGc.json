  "transcript": "ald if we look at our whole and Noble book the Quran we would find that Allah the almighty is addressing us Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is speaking to us and it is a book of knowledge which we have to and we must learn from it and among the characteristics of the Believers that allaha has mentioned in the Holy Quran is the characteristic of fear so a Believer has to be fearful Allah the almighty describes the prophets of Allah by saying verily they used to hasten on to do good deeds and they used to call on us with hope and fear and it is not true that we should fear that we should worship Allah asael by fear alone as it is not true as some other religions say that we should worship Allah by love alone or by hope and Wishful Thinking alone and that is why the salaf used to say whoever worships Allah by only fear he is Hari he is among the and whoever worships Allah by hoping and wishing he is M he's a person who does all the sins but still has this wishful thinking and whoever worships Allah with only love then he is a zandik he is someone who left the religion because Allah is not worshiped except with love fear and hope to together and what is fear when we talk about it we have to Define it fear is a feeling that one finds in his heart and it's a painful feeling it's not a lovable and kind feeling it's a painful feeling that resembles the burning of a person's heart because he is afraid of something bad happening to him or of a punishment that is coming his way and the reason of such a fear is either because you have done something you should be punished for or you did not do something you should be punished for not doing it and a True Believer fears Allah no matter what status of belief and or level he's in he's always fearful because if he is a good Muslim if he's a real practicing Muslim offering Good Deeds doing Haj masallah praying five times in the Masid Haram offering funeral prayers at the end of the day he is fearful because he's not sure that Allah would accept this how would I know if I'm sincere or not am I sincere or am I boasting everywhere I'm in Hajj I'm doing Hajj I did Hajj 10 times 15 times I've prayed so many times I come back at the end of the night and saying that mallah I have so many good deeds I I need a calculator to count all these Good Deeds so I think I'm entitled to make a little sin here or there this erases all of your good deeds so a a True Believer is always fearful Fe fearful of Allah the almighty and this is one reason for fearing Allah to fear to fear your own short comings and your sins and another reason for fearing Allah is because you know who Allah is and you know his magnificence you know his glory you know his power and might subhanahu wa ta'ala and the minute you contemplate about this you start feeding him he's not someone that you can deal with without great love respect and fear subhanahu wa ta'ala if he wishes he could demolish the whole universe and no one would ask him why did you do this no one can ask Allah Asel anything at all and that is why whoever knows Allah well he would fear Him the best and this is why the prophet Alat wasam said that by Allah I am the most knowledgeable one among you of Allah yet I'm the most fearful among you from him so they go Hand by hand knowledge and fear and that is why Allah says in the Quran which mean which translates to I wish you can see this it is only those who have knowledge among his slaves that fear Allah but it has to go Hand by hand your your knowledge of Allah and your fear of Allah and this brings us to the fact uh the fact that not necessarily knowledge to be a PhD in Islamic Studies or knowledge of t or knowledge of f not necessarily a person who's knowledgeable of Allah to be articulate and able to give lectures no you can find someone who is knowledgeable of Allah but he's illiterate he cannot read or write he does not hold a prestigious job he does not have a house he does not have a car he's poor this is a well-known fact yet he fears allaha most so his fear is an indication of his knowledge of allaha while if I find someone with five phds yet he does not practice Islam properly he does everything that Islam tells you not to do and you never see him in fer prayer in the Masjid you never see him coming the first to the Masjid to pray with the congregation you never see him uh uh refraining from things that Allah forbade yet he says I'm a knowledgeable person is he knowledgeable no he has to have the knowledge that makes him fear Allah by doing what Allah the Almighty wants him to do and fear has a lot of benefits but what should we fear of before we go on to the few benefits that I've collected what should we fear of first of all we should fear Allah the almighty and our fear of Allah is portrayed in refraining from sin and doing what Allah wants us to do not in public because we all fear Allah in public every one of us fear Allah in public mashallah but the minute you're on your own the minute you lock your door the minute you travel to a foreign country where no one knows you here is where your fear of Allah is displayed correctly and that is why Allah mentions in Ayah 12 inah alab that Allah says those who fear Allah in secrecy when they're not attended those are the ones that Allah would reward them greatly and would forgive their sins so you have to fear Allah among the things that you should fear greatly are your sins because whatever things happen to you in this life they are the result of your sins as Allah said this in the Quran any Calamity that befalls upon you it is due to your sins I had a car accident last night it's my sins what sins if you ask any Muslim you have sins what sins I don't fornicate I don't drink and I don't steal what do you what what do you want me to do more do you pray five prayers on time yeah sometimes but I sleep and I'm at the office it's a Time I go back uh to home I'm tired I sleep but I pray on time M do you have sin no okay what about uh uh uh Haram transactions so I'm what Haram my my house is on mortgage and I'm depositing Â£100,000 in the the bank and I'm getting 35.5% a month what's wrong with that it's transactions Hal so you're using Usery you're using riba you're doing this and you about what about your tongue say what about my tongue say do you do you lie yeah white lie only not gray maybe black no nothing uh uh you know racism but white and gray okay what about backbiting the usual I talk my about friends you know colleagues Neighbors in the Masjid imams she masallah this is a major sin yeah but I don't not I do not fornicate I do not steal I don't drink in intoxicant these are all sins so you have to fear them because whatever happens to you here it's a result of your sins and if it doesn't happen here Allah has stored it for you on the day of judgment what are we going to face not on the day of Jud judgment in our Graves and this is the third thing that we should fear may Allah be pleased with him used to sit on the grave after burying someone and he used to cry until he wets his beard and they say to him his companion Subhan Allah we mention hell we mention paradise and you do not do what you're doing at the moment why is this he said the grave is the first stage of the Hereafter if you pass that everything is paved in front of you and if you don't if you're punished in your grave and what's coming is even worse so this is something that we should be fearful of we should be fearful of how we die does anybody have doubts of dying seriously no alhamdulillah are our acts actually verifying this belief our acts do not verify that we are going to die we behave as we are going to live forever not only that that even hypothetically speaking if we die we're not going to be hold accountable we're not going to be held accountable for the sins that we've done and this is why we have to anticipate the moment when it's going to come when is it going to come tonight Allah knows best tomorrow next week next year Next Century this is far-fetched but it's going to come and when it comes whatever or whenever it comes this is what or how you will be resurrected on the day of judgment so whatever you die on you're going to be resurrected on if you die prostrating ill on the day of judgment you will be resurrected prostrating everybody would say this guy died while praying if you died in your I don't know if this is suitable topic to address as you're going for Hajj but believe me I wish I die this death if I die while while wearing theam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that he would be resurrected on the day of judgment saying everybody is on the open arena and he's the only one who's saying raising his voice so imagine this with a person giving a toast on Christmas Eve Imagine This on someone who dies with a heart attack with is a mistress or in a nightclub or doing something Haram or at least the least of all our worries he dies with a remote control in his hand and he's flipping all these cable channels watching what something that does not please Allah and he dies so this is something Muslims should be fearful of because we have it in black and white this is what you're going to be resurrected uh on what are the benefits of feeding Allah a lot among the most prominent is that if you fear Allah Allah the almighty would make you do the things that he wants and make you stop the things that would harm you on the day of judgment what drives me to pray F prayer when I've only went to bed at 3:00 a.m. what makes me wake up and go it's it's I'm tired and here in in Saudi Mah you wake up and it's cold you can't make W or the other way the other way around if you're in Birmingham or if you're in the UK it is extremely cold what is making me wake up in the middle of the night I don't have any colleagues I don't have my boss with me I don't have my relatives what makes me make woodoo and face the meca and pray it's the fear of Allah what prevents me from taking a bribe which allows me to change the model of my car what prevents me from embezzling from stealing from doing Haram transactions from borrowing from this Muslim because I have a long beard my friend I need 100,000 quid but I'll I'll give it back to you on time and it's history what's what stops me from doing this that I fear Allah so this is one of the greatest benefits of the fear of Allah the second benefit is extraordinary which has results of this fear in this life and excuse me for changing the specs because age has it sto uh it says here that whoever fears Allah Allah would make everything fear Him Subhan Allah and they justify this by saying because when you fear Allah the almighty Allah Asel casts upon you light and wisdom so so many times and I've noticed this you find people who you respect immediately by just looking at them you don't fear them in the sense that you're afraid that they're going to beat you no you're afraid of them because they have this posture this this this status of respect where did they get this get this from he might be your subordinate he might be your employee but this fear of Allah in him Allah makes this reflect upon all and that is why those who have have if a person has a wife that does not have mercy on her of course and a sister has a husband who does not have mercy on her and if he has a child that does not pardon or excuse him and if he has a neighbor that he's not safe with or a friend and colleague that does not give him advice or a partner who's not fair with him in his partner ERS ship and when a person has a soul that always urges him to sin and when he is in a world that is so beautifying itself to him and looting him to come and when he has a desire desires and whims that overwhelming and when he's weak and he's overtaken by his weakness and when he has this rage and anger that overtakes him and he has this enemy who is Relentless and does not sleep and he is all the time looing him and trying to seduce him which is Satan when you have all of these things but you fear Allah Asel Allah would suppress them and Allah would make or give you control over all of these things but and underline this but if you fear one of these things more than you fear Allah Allah would abandon you and he would make you on your own and he would make these things overcome you and this is why this is what's happening at the moment whenever we find a Calamity or trouble in our life it's because of our lack of fear of Allah we're afraid that we may lose the mortgage we're afraid that we may lose the job we're so focused on pleasing our spouses we're so focused on making our children happy even if this angers Allah it's beside the point I want to live my life well this is not your life your life is to fear Allah and once you fear Allah everything is paved in front of you and it's if you look at the Muslims you would find that they are divided into three categories regarding fear of Allah the first category is the far extreme those who fear Allah with extreme to the sense that they reached the level of Despair they look into their sins and they look to their shortcomings and they neglect Allah's mercy so they start blaming themselves I've done wrong I've done I've done a sin I've done sins I have so much on my back it's it's too heavy of a burden I cannot live with this Allah would never forgive me how would he forgive what I have done it's so gross it's so serious and it keeps on pressuring them until they explode and by exploding they would say if Allah is not going to forgive me so why am I worshiping him I will not ask him for forgiveness I would not pray I would not do anything they only looked at the side of fear and Punishment and they've neglected Allah's mercy and kindness had they gone to Allah and ask him for forgiveness he would have forgiven them but they only looked at this side of strength and mighty and Power on the opposite side of of of the line is those who claim to fear Allah but they their actions deny this they say we fear Allah but they do everything in the book that goes against Allah's commands and against Allah's desires and these are the majority of the Muslims whenever you see someone doing a sin and you say this is Haram what would he say Allah is most forgiving okay yeah but still you're doing a sin yeah it's okay it's okay we have a saying here the people of mecah they say and this was mentioned by may Allah have mercy on his soul he said the people of mecah whenever they do a a sin they say we make a total bath and then we make ta around the Kaa for seven days and then everything is gone and another so-called knowledgeable person of he says that whenever I make a major sin I just say Subhan 100 times and Allah would forgive all of my sins what is this is it cart blanch you can do whatever you say and just you know let's kiss and makeup it's gone no you don't know Allah if you think that you are encouraged to do this and do this and Allah will forgive you you never treat Allah like this it's like God forbids and Allah has the higher example it's like going to a child to a kid and you slap him in the face you give him candy and then you want to slap him again so I'll give you a candy what would you expect and Allah has the high example you never treat Allah the almighty in such a fashion because he will destroy you and all those who live on earth without even having any second thought subhah wa ta'ala he is the owner and sustainer of the whole universe so you should be fearful of him the almighty and this leads us to the third Group which we pray to Allah that he makes us among them and this third group is the one on the middle path they fear Allah but they also wish and hope in Allah's mercy and at the same time their actions verify Their Fear and that is why the prophet says whoever fears he would travel at night time and and whoever travels at night he should reach his destination so by traveling at night time everybody's asleep if you fearful you would travel at night so that you would reach your destination before the deadline and this is an example of Our Lives we live on this Earth yet if we travel at night in the sense that if we do our best our extreme best and go and give it all the way then Allah will forgive us what is the translation of this that it's verily that the product the thing that Allah is displaying for us is expensive what is Allah's displaying for us Paradise so you want it you have to work hard for that it was said that a fearful person is not a person who cries and weeps and then he wipes the tears of his face a fearful person is a person who abandons what he will be punished over this is a true fearful person we see I don't know about you guys in in in in Birmingham I've never fasted Ramadan with you in here the masjids in in in Saudi Arabia when they pray Twi when they make they make the Dua you Fe you you hear a lot of people uh uh sobbing is it the word you know you know crying and shouting and masallah and the minute he goes out of the Masjid he lights a wow the prayer was fine was great mashallah what is this I can't I I have to go and catch the latest uh uh TV soap oppra I I'm late and he go what did what did you do where is the actual verification of your fear of Allah is not the crying it's your actions it's your fear of Allah that makes you stay away from Haram how many people you know who pretend to be fearful of Allah yet they deal in briberies in here we have Mah corruption uh uh very little alhamdulillah alhamdulillah people are laughing it's their mistake not mine uh people bribe like crazy they give under the table over the table in envelopes and and Corruption is everywhere in the Islamic world not here alhamdulillah um you got people using dealing in Usery riba you got people doing a lot of things that go against Quran and Sunnah you don't need a scholar to tell you that this is Haram they're doing it okay where is their fear from Allah I make every year I make five Omas a year one of the editors of a very prominent English newspaper in Saudi Arabia very prominent actually there're twoo one of them I went to his office to speak to him about putting the photographs of women at the last cover in very bad poses and with comment this is this is Saudi Arabia this is the country of Islam you should not do this when I spoke to him he said sheim is this better or this and he got me a a big photograph of a woman posing in her bikinis so he was expecting me you know to to flare out and jump from the window maybe the nearest fire exit I said what is this he said come on Don't Preach me I have got three 37 people into Islam I managed to convert 37 people to Islam and only last week I was at the at the Shan in Paris with two cute girls you know talking them to them and and and calling them to Islam and he's laughing and he's you know thinking that this compensate for his bad Deeds this is a person that does not fear Allah or Satan has manipulated his thinking thinking that I have credit I can do whatever I want the prophet tells us by Allah I hear what you do not hear and I see what you do not see and by Allah in the heavens it is making a squeaking sound because it's so heavy with angels to the extent that there isn't a spot of four fingers without an angel prostrating putting his forehead on the on on on the heavens four fingers how many angels does Allah have Subhan Allah and the prophet then goes on to say by Allah if you knew knew what I know you would have laughed little and cried a lot and you would have not enjoyed your spouses on the beds and you would have gone to the deserts crying and asking Allah Asel for forgiveness this is of what of of the prophet's knowledge do we have this knowledge we don't that's why we're not doing any of these things if you look at our predecessors the righteous predecessors Sal like the prophet like his companions like all the schol scholars of Islam you would find that they have combined the knowledge of Allah and the fear of Allah and they displayed this in their lives for example the prophet Alam is the best human ever to walk to Earth without any doubt and Allah forgave all of his previous sin and the coming sins as well yet he used to pray until his feet were swollen 6 hours 7 hours once a week every single night and he would he would they would ask him oh prophet of Allah why do you do this if Allah has forgiven all of your sins and he would say shouldn't be I be a thankful and grateful servant of Allah whenever he used to recite the Quran they would hear his chest what is it wizling wheezing and it's like a Boiling Pot of the crying he is in sallallahu alaih wasallam he once asked abdah Mas to recite the Quran and he said prophet of Allah it was revealed upon you he said yes but I'd like to hear it from someone else Abdullah starts witha until he reaches verse number 40 and the prophet says hold it stop here and he looks at the prophet and the prophet is weeping sallallahu alaih wasallam where is he weeping from Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him may Allah join us and you with him on in Paradise the prophet said when he was in his dying bed let Abu Bakr pray and lead the prayer AA says oh prophet of Allah he is a man once he recites the Quran people would not comprehend because he cries to that extent not one prayer the whole time whenever he recites the Quran is he Faking It is he making it up these people had the fear of Allah in their hearts the real fear once recited Surah yusu and in the first or the second raak he broke into tears and he could not finish the prayer he finished it you know they could not understand anything of him who is Omar he is the I don't know if it's it's a good description or not he's vicious and strong vicious is maybe no he is the strongest man of the companions of the Prophet Alam and the most feared upon them yet when it came to Allah he would break into tears because he fears Allah and the fear is not something you can see it's not an idea you carry it's in your heart in it shines all over your body may Allah be pleased with him ABB all the other Companions of Allah of the Prophet when you read their biography you get astonished and you sometimes Shan comes to you say come on is this real yes it is real these people knew Allah and that is why they trusted Allah and that is why nothing stood in front of them now we are ignorant of Allah and our trust is in Barkley or in Lloyd it's never in Allah and that is why everything is against us and all the time we're in despair ah it never comes in my way Allah doesn't do what I want Allah doesn't do this well you didn't do what Allah wants you to do you didn't fear Allah how you should fear him and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam said that Allah says in the that by My Pride and Glory Allah is swearing does Allah need to swear when Allah says something everybody believes it but when he swears upon something it means that it has great significance so bear your attention to it give your attention to it Allah says by My Pride and Glory I should not combine two safe status for an individual or to status of fear this is something that cannot be what is it Allah says if I make make my servant safe in this life I will make him terrified on the Hereafter and if he fears me in this life I will make him safe on the Hereafter but you can't have it both ways you cannot be safe in this life having fun enjoying doing whatever you want of sin and neglecting Allah's instructions and hope for the best on the day of judgment yes I think I'm going to be next to the prophet Alam maybe a LEL down you can't but if you fear Allah in this life then on the day of judgment Allah would make you safe and that is why and and a lot of people hate the topic of fear and they say come on you you you are you you're terrifying us you're making us frightened give us something of Hope give us something of paradise well alassan albas may Allah have mercy on his soul he received his companions once who were complaining they were saying AB Muhammad oh Hass Bas we sit with people they remind us of Allah and they terrify us to the extent that our hearts are going to you know crack out of fear so what should we do he said by Allah to sit with people who would terrify you until you reach safety better for you to sit with people who would give you comfort until you reach what you fear and that is hell so this is a good companion this is a good friend of yours who would usually not terrify you but remind you to fear Allah to do what you must do and to refrain from what you shouldn't be doing until you reach Paradise"
