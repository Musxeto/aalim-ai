blessings and salutations on our beloved messenger and be the the guide of this upon his noble family illustrious companion up until the end of times our dua and prayers records us among those who attain he satisfaction in this dunya and importantly in the eternal of the allah make us [Music] wherever you may be watching us live from today we welcome you to this exclusive episode and special online symposium which is entitled making the last 10 the best ten and alhamdulillah duo from our noble deen these are indeed very noble and auspicious days and nights particularly which we are in right now and we ask allah subhanahu wa ta'ala to grant us ease and success and to make us among these successful ones during the month of ramadan especially so those who attain the great and immense good the excessive barakah blessing rewards that allah subhanahu wa set aside free strive hard during the last 10 days and nights of the month of ramadan my dear brothers and sisters in islam it is now our pleasure to be welcoming our special guest for this particular episode on believers podcast 40 and this exclusive is none other than [Music] and welcome to all of you in south africa and worldwide may allah azzawajal accept from all of us and from the whole ummah of islam our prayers and fasting and our duas and all our good deeds for joining us today it's always a pleasure having yourself with us and for taking out today may allah richly reward you as we begin today's discussion we have seen the see the theme of our program today and that is called making the last 10 the best we would like to know what are those means firstly that we can do towards bettering our connection with allah throughout this time but particularly i would like to begin with yasha asim if you could kindly give us an overview in terms of what are the general virtues and what is the excellence pertaining to these last 10 days and nights we find ourselves in of the blessed month of ramadan alhamdulillah [Music] used to offer a lot of ibadah during the month of ramadan the month of ramadan is a season where people try their level best to get closer to allah azza it's a season of quran it's a season of charity it's a season of night prayer it's a season of zikr so it's a whole package deal and the prophet alaihis salatu salam used to try his level best during this month of ramadan however in the last 10 nights of ramadan the prophet salaam would even excel further and he would the moment that the ten nights hit the the prophet allah used to do things that he did not used to do before so he used to revive the whole night through dikkar quran and prayer wake up his wives and tighten up his waist wrapper which is a metaphor to not having intimacy with the wives or it is a description of what a person would do when he's about to do something physical and something hard so if you're going to carry something or do some sort of activities you tighten your apron so that or your waist wrapper so that it would not fall down this is what the prophet used to do salaam during the 10 nights of ramadan especially a specific beautiful ritual that the prophet would not do other than in ramadan generally speaking that is seclusion so these ten nights the prophet hassan would seclude himself in the masjid not leave the masjid except for whatever is humanly needed such as answering the call of nature or if the food would not be brought in he would go and eat and come back that's it he would not visit a sick person he would not follow a funeral he would not go anywhere he would not have any type of intimacy with the wives 10 nights and days excluding himself in the masjid only in these last 10 nights of ramadan which highlights a lot of importance to these 10 nights and it's like when racers are engaged in a hundred meter or a thousand meter or even in a marathon when they come to the end of the race they try their level best to put everything in their power because this is what makes it or brexit so generally speaking these last 10 nights are highly valuable due to the nature due to the existence of one particular night which is not similar to any other night during the whole year where allah revealed a whole surah about the virtues of this night a full chapter of the quran telling us that it is better than a thousand months one night better than a thousand months in all aspects in forms of worship in forms of multiple uh multiplication of uh um the good deeds in the benefits one reaps out of it the whole nine yards so this is a form of putting the virtues and the benefits of these ten nights in a nutshell yes sir i hope i hope i didn't bother you guys to to sleep no yes so we would like to know as well in terms of when we speak about that there are general verb relation to the final the month of ramadan but specifically within the life of the believers why has allah subhanahu wa ta'ala wish worshipers to be exerting themselves to the best that they can throughout this particular time does what he wills and all of allah's actions are wise and based on knowledge so we don't have the right to just to ask for justifications but we can speculate so allah azzawajal told us that in these 10 nights there is a special night allah could have told us which night it was but this defied the purpose of making it unknown and why is that so that allah azzawajal would encourage us to excel in ibadah to anticipate the great reward without knowing when or where it is and this is why in the beginning leila and by the way leila tulkader means the knight of great value this is one of the interpretations of the name is value one of the other meanings of it is the night of decree where allah azzawajal mentioned in surat that this is a blessed night where every thing that is precise is being decreed in it so it is how allah reveals to the angels what will happen in this year so the angels know who will die and who will be honored and who will be humiliated and who will be rich and who will be poor and where it will reign and where it will be famine and drought in this particular night for the whole year as we know everything was prescribed 50 000 years before allah created the creation the universe so nobody knows what's been prescribed but in this night allah reveals to the angels what will happen in this particular year one of the meanings of is that it is tightened so nobody knows where it is specifically and this is why they say that lailatu is from it has been tightened and lessened so this night was made unknown and ambiguous so that everybody would race and put all of their effort in these 10 nights to seek allah's forgiveness allah's bounties allah's reward allah's favors where if we were to know that it's on the 27th we would neglect all the other nights and just focus on that particular night some say due to the lifespan of the followers of muhammad sallallahu alaihi due to their the shortness of their lives because the hadith says the prophet said the lifespan of my ummah is between 60 and 70 years and rarely you will find people passing that so the prophet died when he was 63 abu bakr died when he was 63 romer died when he was 63. earth man passed that he was in his 70s or so or 80s ali died when he was 63 so this is the average where the previous nations people would live for 200 years 300 years north peace be upon him gave dawa to his people for 950 years and some say this is how long he lived 950 years and some say no this is his dawah maybe he left lived for longer than that so in order to compensate the ummah of muhammad ali islam for their short lifespan allah substituted them with one night which is that is equivalent to 80 plus years so if you worship allah sincerely and wholeheartedly you may hit the jackpot and be awarded 80 plus years of good deeds and remembering allah and quran and and pray and night prayer in the whole thing and allah another question as well that that we would have asim is so people would if leila is something that i have to strive hard will give me and so this is the great and that comes from allah azzawajal now people would ask the question which deeds can i do on this night particularly and also yes knowing that allah subhanahu wa hid it away from us so does this mean that we have to seek for the night every night within the last 10 nights only on every alternate night which is the odd nights what is the best at regarding now this is a big topic of dispute among scholars simply because each scholar looked at a particular hadith and clinged to it neglecting the other hadith so some hadiths reiterate that most likely it is the 27th of ramadan however we have authentic hadith that it was cited on the 21st at the time of the prophet and other nights also we have a hadith stating that you should try to detect it on the odd evenings of the last ten so people say oh okay odd evenings meaning the night of the 21st and by the way as muslims we know when we say that the night of the 21st meaning that tomorrow morning is the 21st so the night of the 23rd meaning that today is 22 at night it becomes the night of the 23rd so it's not today and for example today is 23rd in um ramadan in saudi it means that after one hour and a half when sunsets inshaallah it will be the night of the 24th because the night precedes the day in islam and this is why on the last day of ramadan 23rd the 30th of ramadan when the sun sets we call this night the night of eid though aid is tomorrow but because the set this is the night of tomorrow the night of reed now having said that those who looked at this hadith said okay if the prophet said detect it on the odd numbers of night this means that it's the 21st third fifth seventh and ninth however there is another hadith where the prophet stated said detected for nine nights remaining seven nights remaining five nights remaining one would say okay how would i know what is remaining if we cannot tell until the day of eight if we because the month can be 29 and can be 30 depending on citing the crescent at the end of the month ebentamia came to the conclusion that this hadith indicates the possibility of laylatul khadr to be in any of the last nights not only as we used to think in the odd numbers because if the month is 29 this means that the odd numbers are 21st 23rd 25th 27th and the 29th but if the month if ramadan is complete and it's 30 days then the odd numbers from the back onwards nine nights remaining this is the 22nd not seven days remaining this is the 24th and so on so this is more logical and this falls under the category that combines all the hadiths together which makes us unaware of the whereabouts of nayla so we have to focus on both odd and even nice because we don't know whether the month is 29 or 30 days i hope i did not confuse you guys with this but this is the analogy and the explanation of sheikh al-islam in tamiya and chosen by sheikh even if i mean as well as well now i'm barack allah when seven remain five injured then this my dear brothers and sisters in islam as our honorable sheikh has explained it indicates to us that we should strive towards seeking out layla even in the even night would you say as well that besides the noble hadith of rasul allah quoted some may also say that sikh every night because it may be an odd night away but it may be an even night where someone else may be in a part of the mate the night itself that you desert yourself every every single night after because this is our south africa as an example we are one behind in fact then yourself saudi arabia and majority of the night for yourself it's an even night for us so can we look at it in that light as well here chef of course indeed you can look at it but to over analyze it is a trick of shaytan now one of the best ways of attaining laylatul qatar is to totally ignore reports saying that oh most likely it was last night most likely it was the 21st so many people dreamt of it saw it the night had the sun the following morning was uh was yellow or red etc if you listen to these reports you will not be successful in getting lay little cuddle if you totally ignore it and do your level best as they say put the pedal to the metal and try your level best to excel every single night as if it's your last night wallahi you will get lailatul qatar's reward whether people like it or not alhamdulillah our next question and like to know on the quran what are the indicators that we are given in terms of the signs of laylatul because they they see the night itself they want to know would then come we know that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala says and there will be peace and tranquility until the dawns are there we can and in that we can learn the quran in reference to insha allah this night it could be if we were to look out for it during the night time first of all i don't have confirmed uh reports or evidences that would explain it as we as if we can see it the authentic hadiths state that it the ayah says it's salam it's peace which is relative compared to other nights so would that mean that on that particular night there will be no fighting no wars no crimes no but it is compared to other nights a peaceful night a night of tranquility whether this is on the individual basis whether this is on the group's basis or the um spaces it is a night of peace secondly the prophet told us that the following day the sun would rise up without having any uh glow or rays so usually you can look at it unlike other days where it's so uh shiny that you can't take a straight look at it likewise the prophet said alaihis the night of decree itself is an easy night it's neither hot nor cold again says that this is relative because if you are in up north in the scandinavians for example it's snowy it's snowing so how can you say oh it's not cold and it's not hot no though it's snowing but it is compared to yesterday and tomorrow it is relatively a moderate so whenever it's extremely hot in ramadan that night compared to the night before it and the night after it would be moderately hot and in cold winter compared to the night before the night after it would be moderately cold so this is one of the signs of uh uh the prophet mentioned alaihis allah likewise one of the third confirmed signs that that night of laylatul khadr the night itself night is dark but that night is glowing though the prophet said that there won't be any uh shooting stars but the night itself it's at the end of the month there isn't a full moon yet the night the skies are a little bit glowing and this light is an indication that this is the night of al-qaeda of course we know that this is the most night that the angels descend to the earth maybe this is one of the reasons of the light allahu alam i have no idea about that statements among the in terms of their belief with regard to certainly inauthentic or certain aspects that people may be relying upon that you would like to clarify in this regard your shaykh a lot of the people depend on dreams and the prophet allah hadith clarifies this he says i see that most of your dreams indicate that it is this particular night so we believe that the dreams may have a a role to confirm whether it is or it isn't but where people say uh that they've seen lanterns in the sky they've seen windows open they've seen this and they've seen that all of these things have no basis in islam and one should not yani uh put any emphasis or importance on what people uh uh say we get out of whatsapp messages swearing by allah it was last night and and and taking strong oaths that it was this particular night and all of this as i as i said earlier is a deterrent these are obstacles so if i am convinced that it was last night what should i why should i try and pray in the remaining six or seven nights i will let go and this is a grave error that muslims may fall upon and allah knows best and then another question that we also would have uh is the fact so which matters of ibadah have been legislated from our believers as um forming them during this time what will allah give us in terms of reward if in this time okay before i answer your question i don't know is it my connection or your connection because like 35 of what you say is cut due to internet uh delays and so i don't understand the question clearly but i managed to improvise and understand it insha allah so i hope when i'm talking it's not like this is it so i don't know if it's my connection because i'm supposed to have 5g so do you hear me any uh fluently and and continuously uh your side is clear yes good alhamdulillah okay okay when we look at what we should do in these last 10 nights that allah did not limit us to a specific otherwise as humans we may get bored so imagine if we i can only recite the quran a lot of us would find this difficult and complain so i can't recite the quran i get bored i get sleepy i get this i get that subhanallah allah azzawajal with his grace did not limit us to reciting the quran the vast majority of the prophet's time islam used to be spent in prayer and in prayer you do a lot of reciting the quran but you also do a lot of roku which you do a lot of zikr in it and a lot of sujud which you do a lot of vikr and dua so it's a combination of prayer which is the highlight of the nights of reciting the quran which is the month that the quran was revealed in in zikr if i were to detect laylatul qatar what should i say so the prophet said to him and in some narratives the one who pardons and you love those who pardon others so pardon me very few words very profound meaning so this is time for dua and i am shocked for of those who have debts of those who have calamities of those whose family or relatives are sick and they go on knocking on people's doors seeking help when it is the time where allah azzawajal says who's asking so i should give who's supplicating so i should answer who's seeking forgiveness so i should pardon allah is calling you to him allah extends his hand in the evening so that those who had sinned in the morning would repent and he opens his hand in the morning so that those who sinned in the evening would repent this is the time for you to knock on allah's doors so you can alternate between these good ribadas of prayers of reciting the quran of making thicker and of making [Music] they may be our muslims the world would feel despondent at the fact that perhaps they have a lot of sin that has held them down previously in their past life and now what motivation does the time of laylatul and these final 10 days of this blessed month what motivation does it give them to know that we have an allah azzawajal a lord who is as he says allah forgives and he accepts the repentance what advice do we give this who may feel utilize this time now for reformation case our hearts okay again i've lost 40 percent of what you've said but i will try to play it smart and think that you said what i understood so those who are negligent of allah's mercy this is their season and this is their time king has a specific time where he opens his doors and he answers people's requests and allah has the highest example subhanahu if you ponder upon the hadith of the prophet allah you will be terrified the prophet sallallahu assalam once climbed up and he said i mean i mean with every step so the companion said what are you saying i mean to o prophet of allah so the prophet said islam jibril came to me and he made three duas one of them whoever attains ramadan like us and is not forgiven yet admitted to hell fire may allah further him in it so the prophet said i mean it do i made by jibril peace be upon him and the prophet said i mean do you have a shred of doubt that allah would not respond to it no allah would respond allah would answer it so the prophet is telling us that whoever attains ramadan like us yet fails to be forgiven hence admitted to hell fire due to his sins he doesn't deserve any mercy may allah further him more in hell fire this is an incentive these ten nights are your only chance of survival these are your only route of escaping hellfire if you lose this chance you'll never make it unfortunately if you miss it as you've missed it in the previous ramadans all these years you will never be successful in your whole life so it is a season in the west when apple announces that they're selling their iphone 14 and it will be tomorrow or three days from now you find people queuing under the rain under the sun under the snow for three nights for four nights just to get the first chance to buy that product allah has prepared a product for you in paradise where you will be there for eternity not for a ten thousand years or ten million years for eternity and you're refusing to queue you're refusing only to pray tarawih prayer and night prayer imagine the grace of allah he tells you he who prays with the imam that is night prayer until the prayer is over he prays with her he will be accredited as if he prayed the whole night so if you pray isha with the imam then he prays taraweeh which is usually six to eight raka's then he postpones it until 1 30 or 2 o'clock in the morning and they pray another seven if you manage to do that with the imam allah would accredit you as if you prayed from isha till fajr and this would mean that you've prayed the whole night prayer of lailatul qatar and this means that you're a winner little time we are not capable at all of being like the self staying in the masjid for 10 hours worshipping allah praying reading the quran no no we are too lazy we are we are bombs unfortunately but allah has given us this minimal work maximum an hour and a half of prayer maximum in some masjids it's only half an hour or 40 minutes total of tarawih yet allah with his grace favors you with praying the whole night yet you fail to do that why i know people who take the whole month of ramadan their annual vacation just to fast and pray and make zikr and they are ready to work the whole 11 months of the year without any break because they believe because they feel the reward from allah the almighty so this is your chance my friend as a sinner coming from a similar sinner this is my chance and yours and this is my advice to you and allah azza knows so includes pertaining to the reward of this time chef now say the one who has lost out on this great that person is truly deprived as you have indicated to the hadith of rasulullah [Music] what more encouragement do the believers require in terms of utilizing the now well as you've stated again you're i could not understand your question but yes whoever is deprived of its goodness he's deprived and there is nothing else he could do and usually such people unfortunately not always but usually such people they have seals on their hearts that's why no matter what you do as long as they're not willing to break the shackles and these seals and head to allah azzawajal asking and begging for mercy allah will not guide them so again alhamdulillah three nights are down six or seven remaining there is still a big chance for you there is still a big hope for you if you're still interested and allah azzawajal will accept you would there be any concluding advices you would like to give to our brothers and sisters in terms of the great month of ramadan the time of reformation connecting with the noble quran checkpoints are there that we can utilize in terms of making sure that benefited to the best that we can people differ some of us are fortunate with the grace of allah throughout the whole year too fast mondays thursdays the white days 13 14 and 15 to have a portion of every single night to offer to hajjud and to accomplish reciting the quran at least once a month meaning reciting one jesus a knight this is the bare minimum and they remain seated in the masjid after maghrib and after fajr or after assa and fajr to recite for 20 minutes or so their ascar of the morning the earthquake of the evening and they observe thereafter after the fart prayers before going to bed after when they go out of their homes therefore their whole life revolves around islam and therefore when ramadan approaches they don't see any difference rather than they add a bit to it and they're comfortable with that unfortunately those who are negligent throughout the whole year when ramadan hits they are enthusiastic the first three four days and they're very happy and they're going out of their way trying to get closer to allah unfortunately they become bored they become resisting to this habit that was introduced to their lives in the past three or four nights and some of them unfortunately fall down they begin in the beginning of ramadan like a shooting star they're very bright they're very enthusiastic as the nights progress the lights fade away and so many of them in the last 10 nights of ramadan all what they care about is shopping for aid buying gifts going to the malls and neglecting the core of ramadan the most important time of ramadan this unfortunately can be a sign of failure because if allah wanted good for us he would have guided our hearts and this is why you are astonished when you see a person sitting in the masjid raising his hands engaging in dua for half an hour one of the guys says okay i don't know what this guy is asking for i raise my hands i finish everything i want from allah in 60 seconds i look at him in a pity way and i say well this is problematic if everything you want from allah is summarized in 60 seconds this means that you neither know allah nor know what you need you have to acknowledge that we are full of flaws shortcomings and sins and we need allah in every breath we take and every step we make we need allah in everything we do because if allah does not support us we are losers in the dua the prophet used to say alai taking and this is the punchline do not make me trust myself not even a blink of an eye do not let me depend and rely on myself not for a blink of an eye and unfortunately we totally depend on ourselves oh i managed to secure the revenue of the company for the past three months i thought i achieved the targets i did this i did that no it's not you who did this it's allah who made you do this but you're failing to acknowledge this so if you notice and analyze that you're wasting your time you're not utilizing this season and you're not aware of it this is a very negative indication that maybe allah does not want good for you and allah knows best and then finally to allah before you do go after eid itself how does the belief is for steadfastness going forward and if we look at the month of ramadan what lessons do we take from it that beyond we can become min okay if i understand your question correctly the salaf used to say the sign of acceptance of your good deeds that allah will support you to do more good deeds and the sign of rejecting your good deeds that you will turn back on your heels and you will resume doing the sins you used to do before this season so if you want to know whether allah has accepted your fasting your night prayer and your dua let's see what you do on the day of eid some people feel as if they are chained during the month of ramadan the moment read is announced they are unchained and they do everything they want to do so they celebrate eight with free mixing listening to music watching haram movies some of them even prepare in the beginning of ramadan or in the middle of ramadan that he is going to his holidays in the aid to non-islamic countries to celebrate and to feast on islamically what are you doing this is a joke we usually say in saudi when you ask the brother what are you doing he says listen i fasted 30 days for you now it's time for my eight i'm going to party and i'm going to drink i'm going to do everything but this is a joke actually it is a reflection of what's truly happening people think that they fasted 30 days for us i fasted 30 days for you no you didn't that was supposedly for allah so it's a clear indication whether allah has accepted your fasting if you continue maybe not as strong as you used to be in ramadan but at least you continue to read the quran unlike so many people who do not touch the quran until the following ramadan 11 months you see dust on their copies of the quran no a proper muslim continues to have a portion of quran every day not compromising it he starts to pass the six days of shawwal so that he would be awarded as if he had fasted the whole year and he also tries to observe mondays and thursdays and if possible the white days he on the night of 8 does not forget to pray with her in a portion of his night prayer so if not 11 raka's as you used to do in ramadan maybe seven but don't leave your night prayer every single night charity is not only limited to ramadan he looks for the poor the orphans the widows the one in need and tried to help as much as possible throughout the whole year and this means that allah has steadfastness in this dunya as well that was the last question from my side think that there were some of our viewers who wanted to know if you would be i've lost your relations i don't know if you have the time i totally lost you i just heard alhamdulillah and we've lost can you hear me now chef now i can hear you they know if shachasim will be answering some of their questions yeshe i'm not sure if they are still with us right now and if shaykh asim has two or three minutes remaining for that i have no problem but i would appreciate it if you can what's up it to me because your line breaks so i'm afraid i'm going to lose a lot of it okay fine yes so my brothers and sisters if any one of you who are viewing us right now have questions please try to do so promptly at our sheikh insha'allah if there are any all right check assume there is a question from one of our viewers which says what can i will paraphrase it if he cannot attend masjid the message during 10 nights and i presume it is i think the question was uh what can i do if i cannot attend the masjid and you're presuming it's a sister or someone who's sick alhamdulillah allah azzawajal did not limit the good deeds to the masjid the sisters are more rewarded for praying at home and the reward when they pray home is confirmed by the prophet allah therefore okay if the the brother is a man and he's unable to pray in the masjid a lot of the companions used to pray home may allah be pleased with him did not pray the night prayers at the masjid because he was the caliph he had the country to run but he used to pray for hours at home so this is an alternative if you're unable to pray in the masjid stay in the prayer place hold the mushaf read as much as possible in night prayers and allah azzawajal would reward you immensely for that as well another important question that does come up regularly is the fact where is the place of ertica for the female for the women women can perform erticaf in the masjid this is permissible the prophet alaihis salat was in one year put set up a tent for himself then mother aisha mother hafsah mother zainab they all set up these tents out of jealousy so he got angry of them and said take them all out so this means that women can have atticaf in the masjid but it is not that recommended for them because we know that praying in their homes is better than their attending the prayers in the message so a woman does not perform attica unlike what most people think they think that earthy calf can be done in prayer holes or in musa and this is not true etikaf can be done in my home this is not true ertikaf can only be done in a full fledged message that is what nobody can sell nobody can move to somewhere else so it's not a prayer hall it's not a muslim it's a full-fledged masjid a woman who does not go to the masjid she does not perform atticaf but she sits home she reads quran she prays she makes the care and she makes dua all right check the next question i have sent uh via what's up it reads what advice can the ship to seekers of knowledge who have come into the deen and having their first ramadan and their continued journey to allah first of all it is important for a seeker of knowledge to have good companionship so allah says in surat al-qaf make yourself patient with those who remember allah and worship allah morning and evening seeking his face this is what a seeker of knowledge should have good companionship good students of knowledge people who would remind him if he were to forget to correct him if he were to err secondly when this happens he will find that they as a group are building to themselves a road map where they start to seek knowledge systematically and preferably they go to the islamic center they seek the guidance of the sheikh there or a student of knowledge or a graduate of medina university or the so so that he would help them make a road map for themselves to follow once this is done they should start with his guidance to study classical books little by little to memorize the quran little by little to know the tafseer little by little and they balanced their time between apida between between tafsir engaging with the community with their brothers so that they would hang out together they would play football or soccer together they would go to holidays to they would be a community within themselves seeking knowledge having good companionship and this inshallah would affirm the iman in their hearts and would cement the knowledge in their chests inshallah allah when it comes to giving in the last 10 nights can one intend to give a certain amount each night dividing the amount in intention but donating a lump sum or even each night no this is a an innovation there was a circulation of a whatsapp message that that every night you have to pray two raka's so that it would be this and that you have to give charity so it would be this and that oh this is all not true and not authentic you when you want to give give immediately the whole thing don't divide it you will not be certain if you're going to live after tonight or not and there wasn't any recommendation from the prophet or one of his sunnah that every night he used to give a date or he wished to give food or he used to give charity so trying to divide your donations over these 10 nights is an innovation that is baseless and allah knows the next question comes from a viewer who i presume masha allah is a river to islam the question states what can they do or how can i find a righteous friend outside south and question as i see it as usually practicing are labeled as wahabi extremis and there are many deviant sects this is a long topic now originally speaking we will not go into labeling people and segregating and dissecting them because for a revert to do this it would be easier for you to just say oh i'm not interested i'm leaving islam may allah forbid but this is how shaytan works when he wants to deter you from practicing islam he would try to put obstacles or which one i would i follow this so they say wahhabi this one they say he's a super salafi this one is a sufi this one is a shia this one is oh it's so confusing they'll tell you what i quit and this is not the right thing as a leavert you came to islam study islam where is islam quran and sunnah okay who should i follow okay problems to me and try to act like a wise man if you are sick you have stomach ache what do you do i go to the hospital which hospital you're gonna choose uh this hospital why not that hospital um because they said that this one is good okay which doctor is going to see you the er doctor why not the dentist oh because they say the dentist is for your teeth not for your stomach see there is a methodology you follow when you want to check on things don't put obstacles when it comes to deen because this is shaytan this is satan messing up with your head to make you reject everything no look for a trustworthy sheikh that you like his knowledge that you trust his methodology and his religious commitment and his moral conduct his effects he's also accredited by other scholars he's consistent throughout his years on what he says he doesn't change color there are deviant scholars who change their colors every five months some of them change colors to the highest bidder so he says right he's right wing if somebody pays he's left-wing he's a communist he's this is that don't be distracted follow scholars who are consistent who are known for what they're saying who are logical your logic accepts 80 of what they say 20 this is pure following you you may not find the wisdom behind it but you follow because it falls under the 80 which is logical when you finally manage to reach such a person or persons they will be able to guide you now if you're not in south africa worldwide there are islamic centers and we can tell which is following the sunnah which is following the righteous predecessors which is on the right track and which is deviant so if you do your homework you check you ask you will inshallah be in good hands the next question comes from a mother in relation to her son it says that my son is 12 and mukhelev he is berlich and he asked perform ertikaf alone at the masjid down the road however the vika that the scholars partaking at that mosque is totally against the sunnah should i allow him to do ertikaf there alone what does sheikh advise mean fatlik i advise if this young man has someone to accompany him and to guide him upon the sunnah that he should be allowed if he's going alone he is susceptible and prone to being deviated by the people there so he must not be allowed to go to messages of innovations at this early age they could manipulate him and try to have him follow their innovations and bad evil ways but if he has a an elder brother who's upon the sunnah or his father would accompany him or his uncle who's upon the sunnah would protect him would be with him all this time yes he has to be allowed and supported insha'allah barakallahu another question reads that a government signs an agreement with another country to make a road on an interest-free loan but after a while they made change design or change to the design i presume because citizens what the road is complete to polish it i do not understand the question correctly um [Music] if the government is responsible for making the road then it's the responsible of the government if the people borrowed money on interest-free loan to make the road with the approvals of the government and citizens themselves failed to follow the conditions and the policies and the standards of the government this is a mistake of the citizens and they have to pay for that so i'm not sure what the question is all right um unless the viewer comments again chef we will be able to get clarity on that but for now the uh viewer who said that they were referring to good company they mentioned that they were actually referring to a righteous friend or religiously they are referring to okay good so what what is it that you want they were referring to how can they find a righteous friend outside of saudi arabia oh who said that only saudi arabia we have righteous friends we have evil friends as well in saudi arabia righteous friends are not limited to a location even if you in caracas or if you are in johannesburg if you are in kambala if you are in nairobi there will always be righteous practicing muslims where to find them usually the islamic center go there befriend of the imam try to explain your situation and conditions with him and he will set you up with people to memorize the quran to learn arabic to go and play football with to go and dine with and bit by bit you will select not necessarily he gives you 10 people they will become your best friends maybe two of them are good to be your good friends maybe all the ten so it's not something imposed upon you it's chemistry you find that masha'allah five of them are great to be with the other fives are just acquaintances so you will find lots of righteous and practicing people even in los angeles even if you're in new york you will find these practicing people inshallah [Music] [Music] no question as we don't want to take further time of the sheikh schedule um because it will soon also be approaching madrid time within jeddah insha allah so they thank you sheikh and i see that the question is may allah bless you i mean i want to let you go today the brother he he the brother clarifies his question he says that the government approved the project but later changed its design because people were not happy and the government borrowed a loan from another country that is what it well this is this is not the people's mistake it's the government's mistake and they will be in charge and responsible so they can take the government to the court and sue them because the original design was approved and the road was constructed according to the original design that was approved for them to come and change the uh drawings and the plans and to order it to be demolished just because people did not like it there are others who did like it so they should be responsible for their lack of responsibility and poor judgment not the people another question sheikh do women in ertikaf have higher rewards than others at home so i presume the sister is asking that if they were to go to the masjid as a woman perform the etiquette while there are other women at home who don't go too late i mean no no no the answer the answer is women staying home are highly and more rewarded than women who go for ethical there is no doubt in that at all all right so if that is the final question from our viewers and our listeners out there then we wish to thank our honorable hakeem for joining us today would you like to give
