  "title": "Ruling on seeking waseela from Prophet ï·º - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sirdar from india says i have a doubt about asking wasilla fro from muhammad sallallaahu Selim in our supplication is it permissible see one proposition would make a difference if you say asking vasila from muhammad alayhi salatu salam is different for from asking mozilla for Muhammad we as Muslims are instructed to ask the vasila and the fabula and alma camel Mahmoud to the prophet Isaiah after every event we hear and the Prophet said is awesome whoever hears the event and repeats after them other than what he had said and then says o Allah give our prophet also Salaam the means the vasila and the virtual for the illa and mohamed mahmoud which is the praised place on the day of judgement the Prophet said whoever asks this for me then he will win my intercession on the day of judgement and whoever the prophet intercedes for this means that he inshallah would be accepted by Allah and Allah would accept his intercession so asking the wasilla for the Prophet is permissible not only that it is highly recommended to do and we do this every single day five times a day at least now asking the vasila from the Prophet array salatu salam is completely prohibited and it can reach to the level of shirk and associating others with allah because you cannot ask anything from the Prophet array salatu salam the prophet is dead and whoever says that he is not dead he is insane Allah in the Quran says in the chameleon or in her magnitude you are going to die and this is your debt and they are as well going to die when he passed away sallallaahu seldom the Companions washed him they offered funeral prayer and they buried him so if he's not dead then what was this play all about again seeking the vasila for our Prophet Elisha Ram this is highly recommended and we do this all the time but seeking that we see that from him or asking him to intercede for us or requesting him to do things for us this is completely prohibited and Shaitaan the devil Satan has succeeded in fooling the majority of Muslims through this through exaggerating their love until they go out of the loop of Islam whether it's for the Prophet as Salam or for the his family for a debate or for saints or for scholars or whatever such such exaggeration is completely prohibited and I know for a fact that a lot of the those so-called scholars who pretend to love the Prophet Elisha salam and who managed to fool the normal people the laymen and claiming that they love the Prophet Elisha sturm and we have to kiss this piece of cloth or take this hair and glorify it and whenever we hear the Prophet s term we name we have to rub our eyes with our thumbs and we have to put our hand innovations after innovation these so called scholars they make millions and billions of money they charge those who follow them because they fool them and they would make these plots to distract them from following the Quran and Sunnah and they would extort them for money they would take them they would become richer and richer and they pretend to be pious and got feelings upon Allah they love Allah and they use this as a camouflage to hide their desires and whims they never followed the Quran they never followed the sooner but they gather a lot and a lot of followers who donate who blindly follow whatever they have to say and they are a sect of Islam they are not part of Islam I've read a book for one of them who exaggerated about the profit area so some so much that it took him out of the loop of Islam though is from this country from the holy shrines he used to say that the grave of the Prophet Elisha was Ostrom and this is found in his book it's printed and circulated he said that the grave of the Prophet the area that contains the prophet's grave are a sort of a body so he's referring to the grave and he reiterates and says I'm not talking about the body I'm talking about the gray the grave itself this grave this piece of land is more honourable than the camera itself why because it contained the body of the Prophet as a son not only that he says it is more honorable than the throne of allah azzawajal he's not referring to the body is referring only to the hole in the ground what more blasphemy would you want from such people that exaggerate and fool others in the name of Islam in another book of his he says if you go to the message of the Prophet areso Salam go and stand next to the grave and with humility and submissiveness say assalamu alayka oh well you're addressing the prophet Noah he says say assalamu alayka wa assalamu alaykum assalamu alayka allah assalamu alayka about it these are four names of allah azza wa jal mentioned in verse three of Surat al-hadid and this infidel is telling you to say it to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said no you misunderstood the fact altogether these are the names of Allah but we meant that he is the first to come out of the grave and he's the last to pass over the syrup and he is the vow of this and he's the button of that where did you get this from at the end of the day I will find someone like him saying that the Prophet is a rahman al rahim the Prophet is Rob bull and I mean and it's not like what you may think or believe this is all blasphemous this is Cooper and what led them to that such a level is their exaggeration in the love of the Prophet as ram through Shaitaan Shaitaan is fooling them he's playing on them and they have fallen into his traps so it is not permissible for you at all to worship to call to ask except Allah Almighty why go to others I can make millions out of this I could tell you come to me I have a direct link with Allah so she'll pay me 20 percent like some sects in in Islam pretending to be Muslims they charge 20 percent of the income of an individual and claiming that this goes for a debate it goes for the family of the Prophet is RAM and all what we see are people getting richer and richer and they have nothing to do with Islam so be a Muslim be logical follow the Quran and the Sunna don't follow what I say don't follow what Tom Dick or Harry say to you only follow the Quran and Sunna because this is what Allah is going to hold you accountable for on the day of judgment"
