  "title": "How to wash face in wudu? Do we wash under chin or from hairline to chin is sufficient Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "so our first question is from imran does washing below the chin until the boundary of the neck include uh in washing the face in wudo or does washing it until the chin is sufficient and what about the hairline if we have very narrow forehead the face was not defined by the quran the sunnah and hence we refer to what the arabs understand from the word face so all the jurors all the scholars of islam and the scholars of the language say that the face is what we face people with and they define it by the area from the place where the hair starts to grow until the end of the jaw the lower jaw and from the ear to the ear this is the face this is what we face people with and this of course is for normal people if someone's hairline is here or he's bold we don't say to him you have to wash your whole head the norm is this area is where the hairline begins and this is the end of the chin this is the face so what goes below that is not part of the face that you have to wash so the neck or what's underneath your chin is not to be included in washing your face your face is what you face people uh with and i hope this answers your question imran"
