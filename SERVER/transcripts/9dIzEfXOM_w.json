  "title": "Steps of satan to take you down!Repented many times from sins, no remorse anymore - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as he's from sri lanka he repents from his sins and he has sincere remorse then he falls weak and does the same mistake or same sin again and he repents but his remorse is less and now he's afraid he's been shattered and torn from the inside because he's unable to find the remorse well i have good news and i have bad news the good news is that as long as you repent accept your repentance it's not that you have to repent and if you fall in that sin again you'll be in hell for eternity no allah is most merciful he knows that you're weak and you are sinful by nature and that you will fall in this sin often or every now and then unless allah azza protects you and saves you so as long as you sin keep on repenting the prophet said allah every son of adam is sinful and the best of those who are sinful those who continuously repent that was the good news the bad news is that if you continue in this sinning repenting sinning repenting sinning repenting you will come to a stage will you you will not repent anymore and this is how satan works on our heads once we are acquainted and familiarized with the sin we tend to love it so basically we make a sin after doing it and enjoying it we get this burning feeling in our hearts that tears us apart so we repent we show remorse we ask allah for forgiveness we do a lot of good deeds and we find that before sinning we were here after sinning we went here after repenting we are here so we're in a better place unfortunately those who are not fortunate and go back to that sin they go in a down viral or spiral movement a process why if you're among the lucky ones allah will maintain your repentance and you will keep on sailing to paradise insha allah with good deeds with good remorse you're okay those who fall back into sin they will do the same process of repenting finding remorse asking allah for good for forgiveness and doing good deeds but they will notice that the amount of the remorse is less so they try and try to maintain their distance from the sin they will find that in their heart their resentment to the sin has grown less so a couple of weeks ago when they saw that haram clip or heard that haram music or song they felt really bad afterwards now not so much a couple of months down the line they will enjoy it whenever they remember it few weeks or months down the line they will not have this remorse anymore on the contrary they're planning to do it next week or listen to it or watch it or do whatever sin they were doing after a while they'll not be ashamed of it like they used to last year they used to do it in hiding now who cares if people watch i'm not ashamed this is me don't judge me and they start attacking people don't judge me whatever i do is between me and allah azzawajal you have no right to judge me okay so now i am i'm mistake doing the mistake uh and the error of trying to help you after a while they become advocate to the sin so instead of just watching and listening to haram or doing haram they call people come and join me tomorrow night i'm doing this and that why don't you join me in doing this we'll have a good time and this is the end of the legacy where you become an advocate of shaytan you become someone who endorses massa and sin so my friend be careful or you'll be in real bad trouble abdullah"
