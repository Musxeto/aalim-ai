  "title": "The reason why Prophet ﷺ‎ hated those who talked a lot - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign those who talk a lot the prophet is hated them why he himself people could count the words that come out of his mouth but they were filled with wisdom and Iman and would only get you closer to Allah azzawajal and hence he did not like those who talked a lot because those who talk a lot usually talk in vain and there is nothing beneficial from what they say Allah says in the Quran no good is there in much of their private conversation except for those who enjoy in charity or that which is right or conciliation between the people most of our conversations are based on what unworthy matters on things that have no benefit and every time you ask people what are you doing they're saying to you we're killing time a crime that time did not commit yet it's being punished for why do you kill time they just waste their times in idle talk the prophet did not like wasting time in speaking like this without any benefit and Allah stated in this Ayah that if you enjoy in charity this is something Allah loves if you speak about that things that are right so anything that is beneficial whether in this life or in the Hereafter or that can get you closer to Allah this is something that Allah loves and thirdly when you reconcile between fighting factions between two who have Feud among themselves then this is something that Allah azzawajal loves"
