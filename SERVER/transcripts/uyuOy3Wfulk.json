  "title": "Is a sin greater if its done while adhan is being called or during Quran recitation assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I wanted to ask this question um I will not go in details but if mine is doing an act act that could be a sin and Adan is happening at the same time or one is listening to a meeting which is Islamic so is it a sin in itself the sin is a sin whether the Adan is going on whether the Quran is being recited whether the Sheikh is on YouTube giving a lecture this has nothing to do with your sin now what doubles or triples the sin if it is accompanied by mocking and ridiculing such rituals so a person is smoking that's sinful that then is being given and he continues to smoke this has nothing to do with the advance and if someone says to him is being called and he says yes I'm repeating behind the mother he says yes but you're smoking he said this has nothing to do with that should know you're mocking Islam said no I'm not mocking Islam I love Islam I love that I don't intend any disrespect so again this is from shaytan it has nothing to do with that or with these rituals and Allah Knows Best"
