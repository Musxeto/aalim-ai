  "transcript": "in Islam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he came to Medina he found the people of Medina celebrating and playing and in a state of Joy on one particular day so he asked them what is this date and they told him that this is a day that we used to celebrate long time ago and we celebrate this annually so the prophet sallam denied him from doing this and he told him that we have only two feasts in Islam and that is the Feast of and the Feast of so it is not permissible to have an innovated celebration or Feast even if it's celebrating the National Day celebrating Mother's Day Labor's day whatever day you can mention it it is not permissible in Islam now going to the prophet alam's birthday if you want to analyze this to know if it's a Sunnah or in an innovation first first of all people celebrated on the 12th day of R and the authentic opinion of Scholars that the prophet was born on the 9th of the third month of the Islamic calendar the consensus of old Scholars that he died on the 12th of or the third month of the Islamic calendar which means when you claim to be celebrating the birth of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam you're actually celebrating his death you have to always have a pattern to follow to know if this is a Sunnah or if it's an innovation anything that draws you closer to Allah has to have an Evidence you have to follow someone that is the Quran follow the Sunnah follow the companions in order for you to be on the safe side so if you come to the m the celebration of the birthday of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam celebrate his own M the answer would be no the only indication to his birthday was that he used to fast on Mondays and they asked him why do you fast Mondays so he told him that this is the day that I was born in and this is the day that Allah revealed the Quran so if you wish to celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Sall wasallam fast every Monday the prophet himself did not celebrate his birthday nor did his companions Abu Bakr Omar and Ali may Allah be pleased with them all and no one doubt that they loved the prophet sallallah Al wasallam more than we did the prophet himself did not celebrate the birthday of his grandfather Abraham or Jesus or Moses or any of the prophets of Allah which indicates that it is a clear Innovation so whoever celebrates the birthday of the Prophet Alat he either knows more than the prophet and this is Blasphemous because no one knows more than the prophet s wasallam or he is claiming that the prophet knew that it was it is good to celebrate but he did not inform his umah and again he is accusing the prophet sallallah wasallam of betraying the message and not delivering all and this is again an act of blasphemy [Music] m"
