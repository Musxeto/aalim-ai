  "transcript": "and one day while he was out of his house his father ibrahim came all the way to makkah he was an old man not recognized by his wife the wife and his daughter-in-law so she he asked her how is life to you and she started complaining that life is difficult life is this we don't have enough food we don't have enough provision it's a place of desert nobody around us so ibrahim after the meeting said to her when your husband comes back greet him and read him the salam from me and tell him the old man says change the doorstep change your doorstep so he left and after a while ismail came and he said did anybody visit us because he's also a prophet and a messenger so she said yes an old man with the following description came and he uh said to greet you and to read you the salam and ordered you to change your doorstep so he said this was my father prophet ibrahim peace be upon him and he is ordering me to divorce you go and reconnect and rejoin your family for i have divorced you and then he married another woman and somewhere down the line ibrahim came back again he visited his new daughter-in-law asked about how their life was and she praised allah and she said everything is fine we have alhamdulillah so many things she was grateful she showed her gratitude so he said the same to her greet him read him the salaam and tell him keep your doorstep and when ismail came said to her that this was my father and he's ordering me to keep you as you are a good wife so now in the subcontinent some parents are using this example which was mentioned in an authentic hadith when they ordered their son to divorce his wife and they say we have this right over you as ibrahim had the right over his son and we say to them this is totally true if you were a messenger of allah if you were someone as fair and righteous as knowledgeable as ibrahim peace be upon him then yes you may have the right to instruct your son to do so because if you come to me dear einstein who is using this hadith and said to me well allah mentioned in the quran that ibrahim came to isma'id the same incident ibrahim and his son is made the same two people but a different scenario and he said to him my son i saw in a vision that i'm slaughtering you so what do you see and the son said oh allah oh my father do what you are told and you will find me among the obedient so ibrahim set him down and wanted to go and slaughter him so if my father comes to me and says my son i saw in a dream last night that i'm slaughtering you so you have to obey me like ismail obeyed his father and allow me to slaughter you are you crazy would any father expect his son to say to him yes of course not he'd be insane he's been committing suicide and the father would be a murderer not with ibrahim and ismail because they are messengers of allah this is a revelation so abdullah those parents who force their children to divorce their wives without any legitimate reason just because they don't look like how she looks or just because she's not serving them like a proper maid which is unfortunately the case in most of these joint families in the subcontinent they get their son married in order to get a helping hand to get a maid or a servant to cook for them and to clean and to wash and to serve their daughters not only that and also their husbands of the daughters and the children this is unfair such parents are oppressors allah will punish them in their graves allah will punish them in the on the day of judgment for such ill treatment of their daughter-in-law and i've asked and have counseled hundreds of families and i always ask the mother would you allow your daughter to be treated this way in her husband's house she said no to subhanallah then you're not a believer the prophet says one of you will not reach the level of iman until he loves to his brother what he loves for himself if you love for your daughter-in-law what you love for your own daughter then you're a believer but if you don't well you have a problem you"
