  "title": "Must we pray 12 rakahs of sunnah once or everyday to get reward of house in Paradise Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "imran says we know the hadith about the reward of paying the 12 raka's sunna throughout the day which is building you a house in jannah do we get a house in jannah if we prayed it once or must we pray it every day to be eligible for this reward it's an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars say that this reward is for every day and allah's generosity has no limits others say that this hadith refers to who's ever been observing these 12 rakaas throughout his life and the middle path would be that it is that is the house made for those who observe these 12 raka's generally speaking because people tend to sometimes oversleep or forget or travel and not pray them so such random and once in a blue moon excuses does not take a person with the grace of allah from those to be qualified to get this reward and allah azzawajal knows best"
