  "title": "Calling the Athan and Iqamah when Praying alone or outside the Masjid - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Asif second question he says he works in the university and whenever he goes to attend the prayer he goes into the prayer room or prayer hall and he doesn't know whether the students before him called the Adhan or not so should he do that first of all brother Asif lives in a Muslim country and the scholars say that if a person lives in an area where there are other messages that had called Adan the Adhan is a followed chief ayah it is a communal obligation if one must  did it this suffice is the rest yes it is a highly recommended shouldna to be performed so for you guys in a prayer hall at the university or in the masala of your company or in an area that is surrounded by messages but it is not a masjid itself there is no need for you to call the Adhan if someone was there at the beginning of the time waiting and the time for adonys been cold and he stands up and called for the Adhan that's good but it's not an obligation so if you come like 10 minutes late and you look around and there are no students or maybe they prayed and left and you say okay can I call the Adonis's there's no need for that because the event has been called in the city all together and hamdulillah but you have to make the Akama of course"
