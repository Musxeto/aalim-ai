  "transcript": "she says that last week we tackled an issue of using the phrase ers Ulala and I explained I think that yeah is a preposition that used to call someone so if I want to call a friend I met for example I said yeah I met or I say yeah well ad if I want to call a boy so yeah is to call someone and we use this with yeah Allah help us yeah Allah protect us now using it with the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam as in the cases that she mentions she says sometimes when a crisis takes place or a calamity we say Allahu Allah now this is called East Erica you're seeking help and refuge from the Prophet Allah saw Absalom and this is major coup for this is shirk because this is only possible with allah azza wajal he's the only one who can help you the Prophet that is our son is dead in his grave in our worldly measures he is alive in the sense of the bursa which is a stage between this life and the hereafter but he's not alive in the sense that he is getting married and eating and drinking etc like we do and going to the toilet it's a different life altogether yet he's dead that is why he was washed shrouded preyed upon and buried no one disputes about this so calling him is shirk when someone has a numbness in his foot and he says ya rasulallah again you're calling the prophet alayhi salatu salam inaudible mafra there's a weak hadith I believe it's narrated by IBN hamad all day long an imam that whenever your leg numbs you offer salutation to the Prophet Arisa lobstering or remember the Prophet is a lobster but this is not authentic and hence it is different than saying yara saleh and calling him to save you so such calling to the Prophet Alice flotsam or even to the angels and have read few fatwas here and there saying that even if you say to the Angels ya IBAD Allah are you nuni oh yeah I bought Allah as she do nee that this is shirk they say no no no this is not sure because the angels are there and they can guide you how are they care how can they guide me where is that found in the Quran and Sunnah so I might as well say o angels cure my illness because they can't cure my illness with the grace of Allah they can help me find lost objects with the grace of allah what is shirk then so all of this is not acceptable"
