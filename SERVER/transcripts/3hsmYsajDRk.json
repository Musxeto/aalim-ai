  "transcript": "before I just run alive I'm looking at my list here unfortunately and I don't know why I really have not gotten a chance to to verify your position on this and please forgive me if if um but we have some brothers here you know who you know this the whole thing is unprecedented never happened before and of course we have Imams wouldn't have that body of jurists where we can you know get instruction and so forth and every man becomes his own fatigue his own jurist so we got some blood unfortunately in America introducing the notion of virtual football and in a meeting and of course for me this is like and in Waiting earth do you find and evidence for that when there was no live stream during the time of the process of solemn Nora a loud speaker and we stood and we said this is what is your take on the ship and I'm sorry I have not verified your position this so well my position is that as you have stated justly that we all shoot from the hip unfortunately scholars are numbered yet because of our exposure in social media in TV channels everybody knows us we think that we're celebrities so we tend to masha'allah make our own rules when we don't even may collect the basics no we are not scholars we depend entirely on scholars we are just a relay station relay relay to the people what we hear from our scholars we comprehend it we filter it for them and Allah gave us the chance to explain it to them they may think that we are good teachers and we explain things well I asked the Messiah the real scholars of Saudi Arabia and elsewhere and they said that such virtual jamar contradicts and defines the word of Jamar so what do you say let's rage a man says Jeff I'll pray behind sudais he's in Mecca but I'm in my in the vicinity of my home and I have air conditioning and I can see it on a 50 screen LCD man is expensive and the Haram looks beautiful so I praise Allah this is not Jannah you have to be in congregation HD man and this is why scholars say that if I live next to a mosque in a Masjid and I'm jacent to it and I'm in my bedroom and I can hear the Imam loud and clear can I join the jamar with my brother the answer is no you have to be physically there otherwise although I did not order us to do it and what happens if I need to answer the phone or something should I put the imam on pause and i leave what what is this so no okay this is totally not permissible it's an innovation deal may Allah order worship how similar very logically yeah I mean you're nicer than us I guess we needed to be nice as you to to be listened to yeah they look alike"
