  "transcript": "she from bangladesh asks if my twin sister and this is irrelevant whether it's your twin sister whether it's your younger or older sister whether it's your mother with one of your mahrams so the question would should have been if not one of my mahram women was wearing her jeans and she asked me if she looked fine in it or not if i say yes would i be sinful first of all saying yes to something that's truthful is not sinful so if she asks you whether she looks fine or not and you have and you replied positively this is not sinful by itself looking at the auras of mahrams and nan mahrams is sinful commanding a sin is sinful not forbidding evil is sinful and i would know that people say whoa sheikh what is this what did she do wearing jeans for a woman in front of male mahrams or females usually is not permissible why because it's genes no because it reveals her figure and body structure so it shows and illustrates her buttocks her thighs because usually such jeans are fitting and the prophet alaihi salatu-salam cursed the women of hell fire whom he did not see yet he gave us a description by saying they are cassiat ariyat they are wearing clothes but actually they are not wearing clothes oh how could this be they're wearing clothes but they're so tight as if they are not wearing anything so like when women wear leggings for example this is as if they're not wearing anything this falls under the category of cassiatin ariyat they are from the dwellers of hellfire as described by the prophet sallam also if they are wearing clothes but these clothes are see-through like so many so-called muslim women wear in weddings and i'm talking about conservative uh countries and communities you would sign you'd find a woman going there in front of other women wearing see-through clothes that exposes her cleavage her back her thighs and they have no shame why would they have any shame if they don't have iman the prophet said that iman and bashfulness go side by side whenever a person is stripped of bashfulness which is there is no iman this is the teachings of the prophet ali so this is evil for a woman to wear such tight clothes in front of her mahram men or other women if she is in front of her own husband she could wear anything the sky's the limit there's no problem in that insha allah but not to wear such jeans so the sin on your side nasheem was to wear such clothes in front to see your sister wearing such clothes without forbidding evil but to compliment whether she's beautiful or not this is not a sin by itself"
