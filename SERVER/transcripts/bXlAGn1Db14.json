  "title": "My reverted wife's muslim step father was her wali in our nikah, how to rectify this Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uthman from italy he says he got married to his wife after she reverted to islam and her guardian was her stepfather who happened to be her mother's husband who was a muslim now we know that anyone who is not from the paternal side cannot be the guardian because this is the system that islam had put so the father has to be the guardian who's a muslim same religion or at least of the bride and if not then the son and if not then the brother if not the paternal uncle if not then the paternal cousin etc you cannot have any of the mother side the maternal side to be the guardian of a girl only the paternal side who shared her name with her with the exception of the son of course so they got married now they heard that it's not correct or valid what to do very easy or very simple go to the nearest islamic center in italy and the imam of the islamic center would look at the marriage certificate and would renew the marriage for you on the spot because the prophet said allah there is no marriage that is valid without a wali a guardian and another hadith he said the sultan or the muslim ruler or whoever takes his position such as the imam of the islamic center is the weddi is the guardian of anyone who does not have a guardian and allah azza knows best you"
