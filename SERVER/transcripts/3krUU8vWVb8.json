  "title": "Pointing your feet towards the Qibla - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "asking about the ruling on some Arabs sitting and extending their feet towards the Qibla while sitting in the Masjid so if this is the Qibla I just stretch my feet to the direction of the Qibla he says and I feel this is wrong well what we feel is not necessarily right or wrong it depends on the Quran and the Sunnah and in the Sunnah the only thing that the Prophet hasn't told us not to do is not to spit while we are in prayer in the direction of the Qibla because you're facing a large Dajjal and the second thing is not to urinate or defecate in the direction of the Qibla other than that the Prophet had never Allison indicated that lying in any direction or stretching your legs in any direction is not permissible however if you think and believe that the people in the Masjid would be offended by that it's best for you not to do it"
