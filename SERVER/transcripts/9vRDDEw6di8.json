  "transcript": "yeah so essentially it's regarding like uh kind of products with images of living things so sometimes my kind of parents uh request me to put like bed sheets uh for my little sister and her bed that which has like uh maybe drawings of Mickey Minnie Mouse or sometimes uh to give her like milk with uh well in the cup that has like cartoonic uh characters or sometimes even a to just maybe fetch them like a bag or a jacket that uh for example a bag that might have the face like cartoonic face of a dog like when they want to go out or something you have to distinguish anus between grown-ups and kids children are permitted to play with dolls aren't they so they have statues but these statues are permissible for them and likewise if they were to play with other uh uh toys and the likes that may mimic the creation of Allah fetching uh your sister a jacket that has a a Mickey Mouse on it or a bag or a lunchbox or the likes you did not purchase these things so you don't have any sin in bringing them you can advise and say to them it's best not to wear such things for our children because they're not protected from Shan and they don't have the immune system to save them from the Jin and the likes and by putting these images on them they're most vulnerable and they're probably would be negatively affected by it this is advisable you can give such advice but you won't be sinful for moving product a from this a from place a to b or for buying cereals that has um a lion on it or a roaster or whatever these are all negligible things and Allah Knows Best"
