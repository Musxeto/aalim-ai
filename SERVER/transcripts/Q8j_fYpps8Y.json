  "title": "Coronavirus COVID-19: Masjids canceling prayers & Friday prayers - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay Ash's question is clear they're asking about the regulations that their country is placing regarding the covet 19 virus known as corona virus but again we've said this before Corona is the family and there are lots of members of this family like MERS and SARS and the normal flu etc all of these are considered to be part of the corona virus and the current one is called covered 19 so some countries Islamic countries have regulated things that may be shocking some Islamic countries prohibited praying in the Masjid cancelled Juma prayer in their message now we are ordered to obey the Muslim ruler and so many people are objecting why are they doing this why are doing that this is illogical this okay those who are speaking like that are they talking out of a medical background or they're just enthusiastic and just wanting to vent most of them are not medical experts so they are complaining they are pointing their fingers it's a conspiracy they don't want Islam to prevail they don't want us to pray in the message of Allah those Muslims who gave that instruction they run a country they are not running a company they're not running a house with their family members they have a huge country to run and a huge responsibility to protect the people whether they are locals or expats so the responsibility lies on their shoulders when they take such an executive decision it might be right and it might be wrong and I hope this is something we agree upon if it is right they're rewarded twice for that as per the hadith mr. haddle hack him and if they were wrong in such a decision Allah would reward them once because they did their best it was wrong but they did their best so is Lama country's when they come with such executive decisions that may shock us maybe not something that we like we have to understand that they have a different pay grade than ours the responsibility on them is far greater than ours therefore we have to comply whether we like it or not because this is what al ahmar who came up with this out of his honesty hat now when we go to non-muslim countries though they are not well al Ahmar per se but again we have to obey the laws of the country they didn't tell you not to pray they told you to pray in your home they didn't tell you that we will close the mosques indefinitely and we know that the virus was spread in South Korea the hardest hit area was in a church that had a congregation of 200,000 plus and they did not declare it and they kept on spreading it in the whole country from that church so don't be impulsive don't think with your emotions instead of thinking rationally if you are told to follow certain procedures and this is for the detection of your family and all those around you in the community and it Charlotte will be only for three or four weeks until it's totally contained because such pandemics are usually seasonal they come and all of a sudden they disappear they go away you have Zika you have Mars mares you have SARS you have whatever it comes and goes sometimes without any vaccine that's why they may not even develop a vaccine because it's too expensive for them greedy for more suitable companies are always like this so I believe that we should abide by what our medical authorities are advising us it is always best to be safe rather than to than be surety and allah azza wajal knows best"
