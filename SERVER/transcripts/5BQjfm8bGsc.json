  "transcript": "foreign [Music] quisite for the validity of your prayer so if a person starts to pray without a then oreakama the prayer is valid the adhan is highly recommended if there are other people who would hear you and if already the people have messages and their then was called so if you call the Adan so the others in the house or the vicinity or the work place would heal you that's fine but if there is no muslim and no Masjid then the most authentic opinion is that that is mandatory for you to give the ekama is highly recommended but it's not mandatory and it has no impact on the validity of your prayer and Allah Knows Best"
