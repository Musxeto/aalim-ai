  "transcript": "likewise Malik may Allah be pleased with him was a rich man he gave a loan to someone and that someone did not have money to pay back so started asking for his money that's his right and the man said wah I don't have and they started shouting in the Masjid so the prophet looked at them in the Masjid he said what's the problem said I gave him money long back and he's not returning it and the man says Prophet I don't have so the prophet said how much is it said XY Z so the prophet said take half of it and leave half and forgive him in half of the debt and he said to the man give him half of the debt said okay half is better than nothing and the man is happy because now I can afford half but not the full payment so problems can be solved but if we try to do this with a good intention and with loving one another w we will have a good life and a good community"
