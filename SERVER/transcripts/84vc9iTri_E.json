  "transcript": "uh so my question is uh is wearing a cross without the belief in it an act of kufur because my grandfather has on his Facebook um a post saying Merry Christmas with a picture of a cross and uh I don't know if it was like resembling uh you know Mary and Jesus like the Christian version of them so I don't know what should I do in this situation if I don't tell him anything am i c yeah would you like to take him out of the fold of Islam uh no I don't but I don't want to take myself out of the fold of Islam why are you taking yourself out of the fold of Islam it's none of your business don't visit his Facebook page and if you can open the issues of AA indirectly that would be fine but just jumping to conclusion and if you notice your question Yousef you'll find that you have a problem you said what's the ruling on wearing a cross without believing in it and when you gave the example you said that he posted something on his Facebook book so he wasn't wearing it correct so definitely there is a a gap or a loop here that has to be fixed wearing a cross without believing in it this is something between an individual and Allah we can't say whether he believes in it or not the action itself is kufur when adim may Allah be pleased with him who was a Christian and one of the rulers of the tribe of came to visit the prophet Alat interested in Islam he was wearing a cross so the prophet said to him the moment he saw himam remove this Idol from your neck the prophet did not ask him what do you believe or do you believe that this is an idol that you worship other than Allah like most Christians do they worship the cross they kiss it they believe in it they hold on to it and they even kill vampires with it yeah I don't know what this does to them anyhow and unfortunately some of the Muslims innovated something to mimic them so now they have their Crescent and they think that it is sacred and they have it on their Menat they have it on their Masjid as a symbol and their flags all of this is not from Islam this is an innovation but this is beside the point so wearing a cross is an act of kufur whether you believe in it or not because you're wearing it and this is an idol what's in your heart is between you and Allah but we do not say that such an individual is a cfer for wearing it because there are conditions to be fulfilled obstacles to be uh prevented before doing such a thing and I hope this answers your question"
