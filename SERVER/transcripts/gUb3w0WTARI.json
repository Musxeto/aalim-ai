  "transcript": "says what is the significance of the number seven eight 6 in islam people say 786 means bismillah or to know something whether it is related to islam or not we have to go to the basics we have to go back to the quran the sunnah what made islam exist as it was revealed and as it began fifteen centuries ago almost fourteen hundred and forty years islam has been on the same page and muslims have been practicing the same rituals why all religions would remain maximum a couple of hundred years and fade away look at other religions nothing is as it used to be practiced except islam what gives islam the momentum what preserves the practices and the rituals of islam the answer is very easy whatever was revealed and given at the time of the prophet alaihis was this is called islam anything added or taken out would be not from islam meaning allah says in chapter five surat al-ma today i have completed your religion and made my favor upon you complete and i accepted islam to be your religion so the religion was completed at the time of the prophetic anyone wanting to add or subtract from it must bring evidence so at the time of the prophet allah did anyone give any importance to the figure 786 the answer is no nobody ever paid attention to it so what is 786 ah this is something that came up maybe 100 maybe 200 years ago maybe less maybe even three four decades it was initiated most likely by people who thought because satan messed up their minds big time they thought that numbers had a secret in the quran in the islam so they started finding that there are significance of a particular set of numbers here or there as a coincidence or as a test from allah and they wanted to cascade this over the whole religion so that it would be perfect in their sight not knowing that this is what satan is best in so he messed up with their minds and convinced them to mess up other people's minds as well so they gave preference they gave importance to the figure 21 and the kadyanes and all these deviant cults that are not related to islam the baha'is i think it's it's not the hadiyanis but all of them are out of the fold of islam place great importance on the figure 21 so they fast 21 days instead of fasting ramadan and they have importance of the number 21 and the multiplication of the number 21 and they say that this has to do with that and all of this is total nonsense total bogus not related to islam or any other religion but the tendency in the hearts of people of ignorance is to look for something that is unique something that is rare so that i would be holding the torch while everyone else is looking up to me and say wow they came up with something new not knowing that whoever brings such innovative things in islam it is rejected and allah would not accept that from them mother aisha says may allah be pleased with her the prophet said alaihistalatusam whoever innovates in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected and this is part of the rejection having said that there are people who may make some correct observations out of their good intention to islam but cascade this to other areas which are wrong so you may find people who are righteous muslims and they come with a conclusion or or an observation which might be true about a particular number of things in the quran and then they want to cascade this to everything so for example they say if you look at the quran it mentions the word day 365 times so it is equivalent to the number of days in the year or 360 days i don't know who's counting and if you look at the number of this or the number of that you will find the month is mentioned 12 times etc some might be true but if you follow the pattern as scholars did they would come to find that 90 percent of what they're saying is not authentic but again this is shaytan showing them that this is part of the miracles of the quran blah blah blah which is not quran is not a book of science it is a book that is miraculous that is challenging that has a lot of miracles in it but it is not a book of geology or a book of physics or mathematics it is something just to give you hints of its miraculous nature so going back to the issue of numbers one must stay away from these things because they are more confusing rather than being facts"
