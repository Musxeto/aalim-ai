work will desert impede our worker David Attenborough alla rokunova lollitint phenom David Allah no one on this earth is sitting idle without looking without searching and without pursuing the ultimate goal which is happiness every one of us looks for happiness searches for the peace of mind even if we have to pay every single dime we have in order to achieve that happiness is almost paradise on earth the disbelievers and the believers look for it the educated and illiterate the rich and the poor the healthy and the sick everyone strives to find happiness however not everyone achieves it it's a gift from Allah though we believe that none of us intentionally looks for misery and hardship no one wants it yet this is the hard fact that not everyone can achieve this happiness and whoever misses the road that guides to happiness would eventually would inevitably be among those who are miserable and depressed on the day of judgement Allah Azza WA JAL has divided the people into two types there is no third to them Allah Azza WA JAL says the day it comes no soul will speak except by his permission as Dajjal and among them will be the wretched and happy so there are two types on the day of judgment either that you will be among the wretched in hellfire or you'll be among those who prosper and be happy in general and Ansari has Mahadeva Muslim the angel who is ordered to breathe the soul into the womb into this embryo into this fetus he asks Allah Azza WA Jalla on the 4th month when the child or the fetus is 120 days old he asks Allah male or female rich or poor age or lifespan and whether this individual will be Richard or would be happy and prosperous I pray to allah azza wajal that he makes me and you among those who are happy prosperous prosperous and winners in this life and in the Hereafter now if you analyze we work 9 to 5 we struggle we waste our daily lives over trivial and important things but how is it possible to win happiness in this life let alone winning it in the hereafter - Allah being here in the message it shows that insha'Allah we're winners as long as we pray 5 daily prayers we fast Ramadan we give zakat we try our level best to be away from sins inshallah we're winners in the hereafter let us look short term how can we attain happiness in this life see happiness in this life in this world is relative for example to those who do not have mansions fancy homes cars wealth to the poor these people seem to be the happiest of them all and to a heedless nerd who's unable to communicate with people he believes that a playboy who has sinful relationships is the happiest man on earth and if you look at a person who's bedridden who's been afflicted by so many illnesses and diseases when he looks at a healthy person a strong individual who is capable of doing playing sports and going around without any problem he thinks that this is happiness for those like you and me who spend hours after hours in government offices trying to pursue someone to make or to give them the signature and end their plight to them a happy person is a man with influence with power in Arabic we call it wasa pie this is the happiest man it's not what you know it's who you know this is a happy man who can facilitate things with with just a phone call the reality is that each one of the categories that I had mentioned has some level of happiness this is true this is undeniable but this type of happiness is limited it is not full power why this limited amount of happiness the believer and the disbeliever gets it the rich and the poor the righteous and the sinner this type of limited happiness has its price has its burdens and has its consequences among these limited types of happiness is the type that was mentioned in the hadith the Prophet said Alice also and for things are from happiness one a righteous woman to a spacious house 3 a good neighbor for a comfortable ride if you get all these for you're a happy man but this happiness is what it is limited it will never last forever this limited happiness it's like what we find when we fall into sins we enjoy it romantic regardless of your sin when you fall into sin it's fun it's enjoyable the minute the sin ends you get so much depressed sad you feel like committing suicide what is the solution what is the remedy make another sin and a third and attend until you drown in a swamp of sins and this is what is known as el mahisha to banca the depressed life Allah says in the Quran and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life and we will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind he'll be resurrected blind on the day of judgment but we're talking about this life this depressed life is what each and every sinner is living at the moment but check we cannot see it we see these sinners on the media happy joyful enjoying life yes who is committing suicide who's committing infidelity who is caught red-handed in every filthy sin on earth they are they depressed who's in and out of this counselling in psychiatrists visitation they are this is a depressed life and you cannot survive it unless you indulge in more and more sins brothers and sisters let us be realistic let us read the biography of the Prophet Ali salat wa salam his house if we can call it a house was a very small room that would not suffice for the bed of Aisha and himself to pray at the same time imagine how small maybe less than three by two whenever he wanted to prostrate he used to pinch Aisha so that she would remove her legs when he was when she was sleeping so that he can prostrate there is not enough room it was so low no one could stand straight in his home he could spend and his wives two months without cooking without lighting fire in their homes and they would feed only on water and days but was he not the king and the master of all those who were happy he was the happiest man ever to work the earth and his thought was Cinna look at lo prophet Noah they had two disbelieving wives but they were the happiest people Ayub peace be upon him a prophet that is an example to all of us was afflicted by an illness for not 18 days not 18 months but for but for 18 years to the extent that his people took him and throw him near a dumpster because of the illnesses that were yet he was happy if they were happy they didn't have the money they didn't have the power they didn't have what we consider to be signs of happiness then what is happiness happiness is not in having sinful relationships happiness is not in watching movies and listening to music and driving glamorous cars happiness is not in living the westerner dream happiness is not in a glass of wine or in a dose of drugs these are all mid-majors and means to lead you to misery and depression real happiness cannot be seen by the naked eye real happiness cannot be quantified or measured real happiness cannot be contained involves or saves you cannot buy it otherwise we would have spent all what we have just to attain real true and endless happiness real happiness is a feeling that one has within his chest it's the comfort in one's heart it's the tranquility when everything is falling you get to feel strong you get to feel firm and steadfast it's the peace of your conscious when you go to bed that is clear real happiness lies in your conviction in Islam it lies in your belief that what allah azzawajal has revealed is the ultimate truth that is accompanied by action in accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet as I'm not according to your desires and whims real happiness is this convection conviction and the good deeds that you do accompanied by content that whatever of whatever Allah has decreed it is from him and it's the best that can be done the Prophet is Salam used to say he who says I am pleased I accept Allah to be my lord Islam to be my religion and Muhammad to be my prophet whoever says this he will taste the sweetness of Eman why don't we taste the sweetness our of our prayers why don't we taste the sweetness when we read the Quran why don't we taste the beauty of fasting Ramadan when we're kind to our spouses when we are obedient to our parents why can't we find the taste because our hearts are not filled with true happiness [Music] ha ha ha may Allah be pleased with him road towards to one of his rulers abu musa al-ashari may allah be pleased with him as well he said that the goodness goodness lies in being satisfied and content so if you want the goodness on earth be satisfied and content and if you're unable to be satisfied and content you have no other choice but to be patient and tolerant all holy had our star ilaha do elephant festival in the mover for Rahim al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen why shadow la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah wash hadwin muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh sallallahu aleyhi wa ali he was so happy he edged marine being far from allah is one of the main reasons for being depressed miserable and not being able to be happy contented is very important / the sand sisters and content is in your heart when you see something better than what you have and you feel rebellious why them not me you will never be happy but when you are content with whatever Allah Azza WA JAL gives you you are the happiest person on earth those whom Allah willed not to give them money I know people who are stone broke whenever you ask them Salam alaikum RC how are you oh Allah he all what you hear is halal music music is Haram this is halal music they praise Allah they thank Allah they are filled with content and there are millionaires when you ask them how are you brothers and they only complain only nag only wine and there never content with all what they have some people are deprived from having a Sun Allah doesn't will it for them some of them are contented they're happy some of them are depressed because of that listen to what Allah Azza WA JAL says and let not their wealth and the children impress you O Muhammad SAW Allah Allah don't be impressed by their wealth or by the number of children they have Allah only intends to punish them through them wealth and children in this world and that their souls should depart a death while they are disbelievers so don't be deceived don't be deceived brother and system when you see the disbelievers having what you don't have when you see the openly sinners having what you wish you could have there are a lot of these heedless among us who are blinded by their fake lights by their false civilization they think that happiness lies in imitating the disbelievers in their lifestyle in the way they look in the way they speak and a lot of our youth are from this category they think that being sophisticated being intellectual means that you have to wear and act and behave like them until a lot of the Muslims are like the people of Arun Allah soldier says those who desired the worldly life said oh we wish we had like what was given to Arun indeed he is one of the great fortunate and this is a problem when you cannot value your beliefs when you cannot appreciate a Las gift to you you look at those whom he is angry with and you wish you like them you have a problem where is Tarun now where is the happiness that seemed to us he was enjoying where is frowns Feroz might his army his power where are they now where is the strength of had and the mood where are the billions of dollars that were consumed through bribes riba and embezzlement for those who had done this where are the long hours the playboys had spent in his harem relationships and in nightclubs where are these long hours that a lot of us had spent at work or at pleasure neglecting his prayer neglecting his kinship neglecting the rest of his obligations all of this is in hell where the losers end to stay there had been only servants of Allah that sins are the greatest blockers of happiness happiness is a gift from allah azza wajal and if you seek happiness through what Allah had made Haram you are a loser a servant will not find the true taste of happiness until he worships Allah as Allah has commanded him until you come from this vessel that you intentionally deliberately willingly imprisoned yourself in this vessel which says I cannot be happy if I practice Islam I cannot be happy if I abide by the Quran and Sunnah I have to change something you will never reach that because the Prophet RA salatu salam the happiest man ever used to say my satisfaction was put in prayer I only find my satisfaction my calmness of the heart when I pray so whoever neglects his prayer delays it does not perform it well he will never find the taste of happiness if we look at our household a lot of the women and the men are not happy the divorce rate is Brocket high and why is that because they have tension stress anxiety depression all of this accompanied by the children being undutiful their spouses cheating on them the parents are fleeing and running away from their children all of this because they're pursuing happiness in places other than which Allah has directed us to look for it therefore we must fear allah azza wajal to the best of our ability we must look for happiness where Allah told us to find it in this life is a stage where we are tested where we are supposed to work and Allah tells us is not gonna be easy we have to work it and make it a bridge to Jenna with His grace and favour and long ago Imam Muhammad even humble may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great Imams of Islam was asked ohmmm when can we find the taste of comfort and happiness when when can we find it and he said may Allah have mercy on his soul you cannot find it until you place your first foot in paradise don't be delusional true happiness can only be attained in Jannah live for 80 years live for a hundred years than what it's your grave then what is resurrection then what is either Jannah or not either paradise or Hell so make that your prerogative make that your objective make that your target and insha Allah Allah with His mercy Allah with his favor and grace and blessing upon us would make us among those who would set foot in paradise Allah other than our Hamner Rafi Noir for now what a Weldon periodical Allah to him now oh Allah make us among those who are happy on this world Allah make us happy on this earth and make us happy when death comes to us and make us happy when we are underneath with this earth Allah make us among those who are resurrected being happy Allah make us among those who are blessed make us among those who are contented make us among those who are rich make us among those who are healthy cure the illnesses of our sick people have mercy among the deceased who have departed us and don't let us be among the miserable among them the press among the readership it is you who is most forgiving oh so allahu wa sallim ala nabina muhammad why he was so happy he remain"
