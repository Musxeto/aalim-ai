  "transcript": "foreign because sometimes they will come and say salam and they might give their hands so how can i know how do you know your mother like i know the words but when it goes to different people i can't understand how do you know your mother i know my mother how do you know your sister i know my sister how do you know this woman i don't know this woman so don't talk to her don't shake hands with her but sheikh maybe she's my mahram okay give her a kiss but i don't know if she's my mahram what do you want me to tell you efrahim this is a logical thing this is not an islamic question you're asking me someone you don't know if she is your mahram or not mahram the default is you refrain and stay away from her until proven otherwise your mahrams are known and you can count them on your fingertips your aunts your nieces your sis sisters they're not masha'allah in the hundreds so you can count them you know them anyone else that you're doubtful stay away from her and allah knows best"
