  "transcript": "from holland he says what are the six exceptions of riba imam nawawi mentioned those and he explained them there is poetry combining them i don't remember what i had for lunch yesterday i'm too old to do this but generally speaking these six issues relate to advice and warning so say they say if someone comes to you to ask you about a person they're about to get in a business with and you know that this guy deals in riba and steals money and he would cheat him so you have to tell that individual no this person does this and that related to his question if a person got a proposal from a man who's interested in his daughter or his sister and you know that this guy is a junkie or a drunkard or he doesn't pray but nobody knows this about him you do so you have to warn him if you have a problem with someone that requires you going to the judge and you say this man broke into my house and stole my wallet no one would say that oh okay this is reba no you have to do this you have to tell the police you have to tell the judge about the crime he had committed and this is not backbiting if you know of a person going to seek knowledge from someone who's not trustworthy not a scholar not from a sunnah jamar rather he's an innovator or he has corrupt akida and you have solid proof that the knowledge he's giving is totally bogus and corrupt not because he made one single mistake in his lifetime you tarnish his reputation no i'm talking about people of deviancy of biddah then yes you have to warn the individual by saying that this is not a a good person to learn from it's haram for you etc i don't know four or five maybe i don't know who's counting number six maybe just to conclude if i can warn someone who has authority over someone who's below him so i know a friend who does drugs or i know a girl who's behind her father's back is having an affair with a boy and i've advised these people and they would not listen if i advise or talk to her father or his elder brother and say listen your brother is doing this and this and this and i'd like you to intervene diplomatically in a good way find out for yourself and then try to stop him from doing the haram that's good so i hope these are the six roughly i'm not sure nevertheless may allah have mercy on his soul went a bit further and he said i don't agree with these six exceptions because you can warn people in most of them other than the police and the judge stuff when someone asks you for your opinion about what do you think of sheikh so and so who gives tafsir or who teaches akida or who teaches and i know that he's not good to teach not because i'm jealous of him not because he's making a lot of money simply because we have the facts in black and white he's not qualified he has corrupt akida he's been deviant for so many years if i can warn people who trust me and seek my advice without mentioning his flaws so he says can i learn arabic from so and so and i say i don't advise you to do so he says why he said you asked me for advice i gave you my advice you want to know why you have to do your homework i'm not going to go deeper than that this as imam shokari says is a higher and better stance when you warn people and allah knows best"
