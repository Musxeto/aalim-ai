  "transcript": "I was listening to a lecture of scholars and he's saying that when you want to ward off evil eye you didn't you don't say masha allahu la quwata illa billah' this doesn't work you have to say allahumma barik or allahumma barik Lihue oberek allahu laka and used the word though the verb of being blessed may Allah blesses bless you may Allah make this thing blessed etc so is this right the most authentic opinion is that the best of the best toward of your own evil eye is to say allahumma barik or barakallahu lock this prevents this blocks your evil eye from proceeding so you cannot harm that the person that you've you've seen what you liked however masha allahu la quwata illa billah he's mentioned in the Quran and some scholars say that this does work as well so if I hear someone looking at for example my currencies Wow masha'allah la quwwata illa billah inshallah this is enough I don't have to go say no you have to say Berrocal mahalik you don't have to do this and the best is for him to say barakallahu lock masha allah la quwwata illa billah is said when i see something of my own so if I'm if I see one of my children doing well at school I wouldn't say Allah o Mubarak I would say masha'Allah Allah Hotel Allah because he's mine if I see my car or my house and I like it I say masha allahu la quwata illa billah but if I see someone else the most preferred is to say allahumma barik la who may Allah bless this for you but if I say masha allah la quwwata illa billah this does the job insha Allah Azza WA JAL"
