  "transcript": "uh you have to know that dawah was gradual in some cases as in in the case of mecca the prophet was not instructed to fight he was instructed to address them in very short sentences as we will come to the characteristics of the verses of makkah surah it's very short it's it's focusing on things that are different from those in medina for example if i meet someone who is not muslim i would tell him brother wearing gold is haram for you and you should not make his bad raise your trousers a little bit and grow your beard he would not accept this because i'm talking to someone with not without the foundation what should i talk to him always believe in and i always face this personally and people ask me whenever i approach a christian and i told him i tell him islam is this islam is that said why do you make music for britain and i say because this and that he said okay why gold is forbidden for men and not for women and why women have to cover and why can i start deviating from the main cause which is come to common term telemetal help we have to all of this is side talk at the moment i will not discuss let's discuss the main thing do you believe in the existence of allah one or many if he believes in one do you believe of his wisdom of his power do you think that he will create all of this and leave them astray without guiding them he will send someone okay who did he send what did he send let's analyze what he sent and then if he accepts we go into detail if you go to medina time now i'm talking to a muslim and the muslim says you explain to me how there is only one god this is the other way around what is this i'll tell you you believe in one god he says yes you're worshiping the grave he says yes i said this is not islam you have to worship one allah how can you worship a grave how can you slaughter to a priest or to a welly how can you ask someone who's dead to uh help you to pay your debts to get to help you get married although this is shirk okay now let's go into sharia you have to do this this is and this is the evidence so this helps you in knowing how to talk to people and if you notice the sunnah of the prophet it was exactly like this if i don't stand up i'm going to sleep the prophet sallallahu alaikum treated the muslims differently he treated the ignorant differently than those who are knowledgeable the prophet he was eating and with him was a and he was a child he was eating from the dish and his hand was in the front in the middle so the prophet says three verses three sentences say bismillah you did not say this when you ate and could be a meaning eat only with your right hand and eat from what's in front of you very soft very lenient this is what we teach our children from the early age right eat with your right hand eat with the right hand the third time slap him in the face no we teach him teach him until he grows on this we'll never severe with our children we want them to love islam not to hate islam whenever i'm i'm angry with my children and i'm i'm very angry because i did something wrong the first thing i say what did you pray said no go and pray so he always associates prayer with punishment because i'm angry this is wrong so you have to learn this from the prophet the man the child eat with your right when he and the hadith in sahih muslim when he saw a man eating with his left he said eat with your right hand the man among the companions was arrogant he said i cannot so the prophet said may you be able not to and the man's hand was paralyzed and he could not lift it to his mouth now this was severe but why because he was arrogant a man comes to the prophet's masjid a nomad he starts urinating the prophet is sitting in his companion and the companions were furious they wanted to jump and kill him the prophet said islam leave him until he finishes why prophet is wise if they interrupted him he's going to make the whole masjid filthy now he's containing it in one area after he finished the prophet ordered a bucket of water to be poured so that the whole place would be cleaned by the water mixing with this and he brought the man and he said my son or my nephew it's an arabic word the son of my brother yeah this is said from the elderly to anyone who's young that's why we always tell a man who is old uncle amma so they said my nephew the messages are not made for this film they are made for prayer supplication reciting the quran very easy very soft nowadays if someone does this what will you do with them kill him we will kill him he did something wrong the prophet is setting the example for us from dawa on the other hand when one of his companions came with a golden ring in his hand the prophet islam did not tell him no this is not right he took it from his hand angrily and threw it on the floor and said one of you come to a stoney a fiery stone and puts it in his hand a fire you put fire in your hand he was angry and he left the companions told the man take the ring and sell it it's your ring take it and sell it give it to your wife said by allah i will not take something the prophet through leave it i'm not going to take it for us it's over he goes to abdullah in us wearing clothes that were painted in red and he tells him the minute he sees him your mother ordered you very strong language your mother ordered you to wear this what am i a child a prophet of allah am i a child talk to me like this immediately realized the graveness of his sin so he said o prophet of allah shall i wash it said no burn it because this resembles the ko far way of dressing if we realize this we know how to make tawa we know when to be angry and when to be lenient we know when to be strict and when to be soft this is one of the benefits of studying the mecca and the methane and also studying the seer of the prophet salallahu you cannot be harsh all the time because then you will be easily broken and you cannot be soft all the time because then you will be squeezed huh easily nobody yeah and they'll be there people will take you for granted the knowledge of the seer of our prophet alice islam is known through the makki and madani we know all the things that relates to this and the benefits of learning how the companions and the scholars gave lots of effort to preserve this science and this knowledge for us and the many surahs okay before we go to the madness how many surahs are monkeys 94 86 okay the scholars usually neglected the number of the maki surahs why because it's longer so it's wiser to do to go to the shorter which is the madness and this is used by the prophet israel in a number of incidents when a man came to the prophet said o prophet of allah what should a mushrim person wear i'm going for umrah or for hajj what should i wear the prophet allah if he wanted to list the permissible things to wear he would spend two three days you can wear white you can wear blue you can wear brown you can wear green you can wear yellow you can wear whatever and then you can wear a dress made of cotton a dress made of so-and-so also a fabric it is endless so the prophetic some chose to answer the the easiest way of answering which is you should not wear this and you resected it in five or six categories you should not wear which is the trousers you should not wear the panis which is the shirt you should not wear which is the thing that covers your this is for men for your head you should not wear the baranes which is also like the moroccans have with a cap on it uh you should not wear a hoof which is shoes all of these are you're not allowed to wear anything else no so this limits it likewise scholars when they talk about makki and madani they would not say we have all of this maki now the easiest thing is to go into talking to the shorter portion which is the medullary and the magnesuras that are agreed upon scholars are 20. and these surahs are i didn't do this mashallah good set up i think there is more to that isn't there more okay i didn't count this was it 20 yeah because there are parts of the disputed surahs that the most authentic opinion is to be included within the medany periods such as and so on but we will come to that insha allah now when we say that this is does it mean it's 100 revealed in medina no the majority of it was revealed in medina which means that there might be a small portion that was revealed in mecca but the this does not change the name of the surah itself nowadays i believe that in the mushaf printed in medina they don't have this the the famous uh of medina before like 20 30 years ago they used to write on every heading of the surah madaniyah or makiya or mixed they say like 80 verses are madami and ten verses are maki but nowadays they don't do it because it does not have that much value to the reader of the quran unless he knows that the whole thing or these specific highest it would not add any value especially when it's disputed upon so there are 12 disputed so 12 plus 32 makes uh i gave the answer i should get a present plus 12 plus 20 makes it 32 and the remaining are 80 82 82 verses in medina what are the disputed ones there are 12 and the one that has mk means that the most authentic opinion of scholar that it is revealed in makkah so al-fatiha was revealed in mecca initially but was also revealed in madinah it was revealed a number of times because it is the greatest surah of the quran and we could spend another hour talking only about fatiha about its greatness about its cure to our hearts and to our bodies and this is something that people fail to realize that it is a form of remedy it's a cure to our hearts this is those without doubt and it's also cured to our illnesses when i have my children they fall sick i mean immediately to them and with the grace of allah they are cured but this does not prevent me from taking them to the doctor i take them immediately also to the doctor believing that i have done what i should do of recitation and of dua because the source of cure is allah the doctor is a cause the medicine is a cause when my heart is connected to the doctor and i go to the doctor please cure my son this means i'm not a proper muslim i go to the doctor to find the suitable medication because allah tells me to go and look for medication but not because he cures or the medication cures only allah azza so the fatih has the greatest surah of the quran and what is the greatest verse of the quran and this was makkah and medina so it takes the ruling of surah it is in medina because when it was revealed even abbas may already please with him said that the people of medina were the worst when it came to weighing food you know what motafine is what is those who don't weigh properly so allah when they buy something from people they take exactly what they need so i'm gonna buy from one kilo i take one kilo exactly and when i'm selling i sell 990 grams 950 grams and allah azza stated in this surah a concept that we all should always remember allah says don't they think that they will be resurrected one day if you want to treat someone if you want to steal something if you want to do something haram when you recall that there will come a day i will stand in front of allah and i will have to answer for the things i have done you will refrain from this and also this was in mecca this is disputed upon but the most authentic opinion is it was in medina okay the rest is in mecca of course uh characteristics of there are certain characteristics of mecca can have some waterproof every surah that has an oath assam is mecca can you give us an example why see there are there are three letters of oath of qasim in arabic and usually after the wow you make kasra the vowel this has nothing to do with you're just saying this is joining a letter also he so again b is a letter which when joined to a kalima it becomes assam and so these are the three letters so any surah that starts all of these are considered to be surahs every surah that has any surah that you find and so on so many the minute you see this this is a word and surat uh maryam as well there is a verse this word kalla when the arabs hear it they feel you know shaken it's strong in in arabic this is very soft but when you say to and even to arabs no you don't use it because it's it's very strong it's a keller so it has the reprimanding sense sense of punishment that listen this is something serious this is one of the characteristics of the mecca surah begins with disjointed letters they all of these disjointed letters are considered to be out of the mechy surahs surahs that have verses of prostration how many verses of frustration do we have in the quran 15 14 now you cannot say that have different opinions fifteen fourteen should i say which one it is 15 to the most authentic opinion the difference is with the sajna in surah saad whether it is means bowing but the word means he fell to the ground so some said no this is not sajdah and some said no this is sajdah because it's stated that and they have also differences whether the the surah uh which surah has two prostrations hajj and whether they're all any prostrations legitimately or not the most authentic opinion is that the whole 15 where from the sunnah to prostrate and this leads us to the ruling on frustration of tilawah is it mandatory torsina can i prostrate to a direction different to the qibla why hijab normally but yes even the sisters when they're in their houses they can because it's not considered to be salah the salah starts with fakbeer and ends with the sleep what other sajdah can i do like this do we thankful and this can be performed as i said it's not part of the salah but this doesn't mean that you in the masjid putting your back to the wall of the qibla and you come to a verse and people are sitting in you prostrate is this advisable and you're challenging people no this is not a muslim does not do things where people would not understand it's definitely more rewardable for you to face the qibla and to be on but if you don't and there's no one around you can do this inshaallah without any problem and any surah that has the stories of prophets not the names of prophets the stories the detailed stories of the prophets this is with the exception of al-baqarah but all the rest are included and also be any surah that has the verse with the exception of again pointed earlier and all the surahs that begin with how many are they got you three no two no sisters one what which one alhamdulillah we have five words foreign where it goes i don't want to make"
