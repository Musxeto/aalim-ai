  "title": "Imam rushes into ruku during silent rakah Can I finish my Fatiha then do ruku #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my said an IM in India does the ASU very fast and he rises from ru very fast in a way that he has to R the fa and in the subcontinent people don't see it mandatory to recite fat behind the in a silent RA in such a case if I recite the whole fat and then catch up with the IM in Ru is that valid this is valid inshallah if the Imam is is super fast and you're unable to catch up with him but I would highly advise you that you should not pray behind such an IM even if you have to pray the second Jama or choose a better Masjid because congregational prayer prayer is the essence of your day whether it's or is this is the F prayer a pillar of Islam if you don't pray it correctly what good is it and if the Imam is ignorant and doesn't recite it correctly as if someone is rushing behind him and and running to to beat him up then this guy doesn't know Allah and you're better off praying somewhere else"
