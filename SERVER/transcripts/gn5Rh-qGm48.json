  "transcript": "question today was about I'm regarding an interest so um here in Japan there is an app and similar to eBay where you can post and then um whoever wants to buy your product can buy and then the app offers um for whoever wants to buy to buy that product in you know in deferred payments like you can in monthly installments and for that and depending on the price they they they have their um you know service fee let's say so for example if you buy um a product worth um 500 USD and then if you want to pay it monthly in like three or four months depending on the price on the period the period and then the the overall price of the product their service fee changes so I wanted to know if this is um an interest and then are you buying or selling Abdullah I'm I'm going to buy okay if you're going to buy in installments there are two conditions that must be fulfilled number one that you're buying straight from the owner now the app is not the owner so definitely they have financers they have Banks they have a financial institutions who are investing and saying anyone who wants to buy in installments they've got a credit card or a debit card or a bank account that we can hold them accountable if they default it on the payment then go ahead here's a hundred million dollars so these are interest based loans from a third party and this is Haram but if the owner of the product I'm selling this pen on eBay or in whatever um app and I'm telling people this is uh for one euro and if someone says listen I can't afford it can you sell it over five months time and I said okay it's 1.5 Euro and you have to pay me this much every month he says okay agreed then this is halal because I'm the owner I have the right to sell it for a Euro or for a hundred or for even a thousand Euros is my product what price I uh give is none of anyone's business whether I give it for cash or on installments this is my job this is condition number one condition number two is that the price is fixed before we agree so it cannot be this is 1.5 Euros over five months time okay agreed and we sign an agreement but if I defaulted in one month he says you have to pay 1.7 and if it's one year now you have to pay three euros and it goes up as long as I'm not paying on time or he gives me a list of choices it's 1.5 in five months but it can be 1.7 in seven months and three dollars in one year and so on and I sign without specifying which scheme I want to take it is open no this is riba so this can do conditions if the products Halal if you're buying it from the owner and if the final price that cannot be one cent extra agreed upon before the agreement alhamdulillah this is permissible Allah Knows Best"
