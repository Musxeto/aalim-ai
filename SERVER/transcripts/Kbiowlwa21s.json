  "transcript": "oh and welcome to lessons in the chapter we're studying n is uh we're staring about the condition of prayer the conditions of Salat conditions of prayer and the Hadith we have uh uh with us today Hadith number6 62 narrated The Prophet Sall alaih wasallam said if the Garment if the Garment is ample wrap it around your body during the Salat meaning prayer a narration by Muslim has you should cross the two ends and if it's tight you should wrap it round your waist now this Hadith to understand it you have to realize that at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam people did not have wardrobes full of clothes you know the maximum that a person would own was probably a garment one piece of long piece of cloth so in this Hadith the essential thing for a Muslim is to cover his and as we've mentioned before a male's is from his belly button to his knees so this area must be covered it is not permissible for anyone to see this area with the exception of his wife only the wife can see this so by this we understand and we learn that those who wear shorts in their houses with their kids you know boys and girls and sit with the with their thighs exposed this is Haram this is not permissible and those who play sports also wearing shorts those who swim wearing you know swimming trunks that expose more than what what it hides again this is also not permissible it's it's Haram now as far as Salat as far as prayer is concerned the prophet here sallallahu alaihi wasallam is giving us the way that a person should behave if he has one piece of garment so he tells us if it's a long piece of garment then he may wrap it around his waist and then take the end the two ends of it and throw them on his shoulder so he would be by this covering his whole body but if the piece of cloth is tight and it's not sufficient to cover the whole body then he should cover what is minimally required which is the area from from the waist to the knees so that his prayer would be accepted some of the scholars said that it is obligatory to cover the shoulders so if someone is in the open for example or or having a sea cruise and he swims and he comes out of the water and he wants to pray but he doesn't have any clothing except his swimming trunks which is from his waist to uh his knees then IM Ahmed says that his prayer is not acceptable he has to have a t-shirt he has to throw a towel on his shoulders he has to cover his shoulders the majority of Scholars the other Scholars say no his prayer is acceptable yet it's recommendable not obligatory it's recommendable to cover the shoulders and uh this what this Hadith tells us about now as again this cannot be realized or imagined because we have lots of clothings we have T-shirts we have everything that we wish to wear we have a lot of them but at the at the time of the Prophet they had they used to have only one piece of cloth one piece of garment to wear throughout the whole uh year because this is what they were able to afford the following Hadith Hadith Sal narrated by they will be pleased with her she asked the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam can a woman pray in a long dress and Veil without wearing a lower garment he meaning sallallahu alai wasallam replied if the long dress is ample and covers the surface of her feet now this Hadith again is not authentic it's a weak Hadith and from this Hadith and many other hadiths we learned that women at the time of the Prophet used to wear a number of sets of clothes you know dur and so on different names and different different usages and uh a description to them but what we need to learn is that in order for a woman for her prayer to be accepted she has to cover her a and as you recall fat what is the of women in Salah when there are no men watching the whole body except their hands and the face except the hands and the face and we've mentioned also that Abu hanifah and Imam Tamia say that even the feet are not considered to be during prayer that is when there are no strange men looking but if the uh the house is the the husband or the son or the brother uh are present then it's okay uh uh to cover to uncover the feet the hands and the face it's okay as mentioned earlier but we have to note that the dress of women though there is no one in the room except her husband or her brother she has to wear something that does not see through you cannot see through it and something that is not uh uh uh tight because if the clothing she's wearing are tight and show her figure this is unacceptable and if she's wearing something that is not tight that does not show her figure but you can see through it again this is not acceptable which means that a woman woman may not pray in a garment that is so thin when she bows or prostrates or she even when she stands it you can tell the description of her body this is unacceptable it's also unacceptable for men to wear tight pants and pray with them because it shows their figure and it's also unacceptable for men to P to to wear see through clothes and because again the reason reason for covering the so that there is no FNA so that sexual desire is not aroused and by wearing ample clothes by wearing things that cover the body that does not show the figures of the body and that does not show what's under that piece of clothing uh uh one succeeds in doing this any questions or should we move on the following narrated by we were with the prophet or okay narrated by we were with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam during a dark night and we became uncertain about the the direction of Mecca we then prayed without being certain when the sun rose we discovered that we had prayed towards the direction of other than the so this verse was revealed so wherever you turn yourselves or your faces there is the face of Allah very well now this Hadith talks about the third condition of prayer Mr Muhammad which is Abu Malik facing the facing the it talks about facing the it is a condition that has to be fulfilled providing that one knows where the is in this Hadith it tells us may Allah be pleased with him tells us that they were with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in a dark night this Hadith was uh uh graded by as weak and some Scholars say it is weak yet we talk about it because it talks about one of the conditions of Salat so says that we couldn't figure out where the was so we prayed to a particular direction we thought we give the matter some effort and we thought that it was appropriate to pray in this this direction because this was a gut feeling that it is in this direction we had no compasses we could not see the stars and we cannot determine which direction is which so it's logical that they do not postpone the Salah as it will the time of it will run out shortly so they prayed on this direction after uh uh it was all cleared out theyve discovered after the sun has risen that it was the wrong direction so they discovered and realized that they have prayed to the wrong yet Allah has revealed to them the verses that says so uh wherever you turn yourselves or your faces there is the face of Allah providing that you have done what you are supposed to do and you have you know done your best if you face other than the this is acceptable because Allah will accept your prayer again we don't have to uh uh uh go into much details as it has we have talked about this uh before brother uh fatty say for example someone he doesn't know where the is and he's like in a place where he can't pray uh and there's not a Mosk around for instance in a non-muslim country for instance can he just walk in the car and just sit in the car the way it's parked and just pray uh towards uh like the direction where the car is heading without finding like without praying towards the because he can't find it find out where the is you know I have one question why does he pray in the car is he's traveling yeah so he's traveling in a city or outside the city in a free City like the furthest mosque the closest mosque is pretty far away and he cannot reach that mosque on time no then he should uh uh uh uh you know stop the car and pray outside the car he doesn't wa regardless you do not pray in the car it's not allowed for you to pray in the car because one of the pillars of Salat is standing up when you can when you're able to stand up you have to stand up so F obligatory prayer you're not allowed to pray it in the car or in the airplane unless you're standing up except if there's a necessity meaning that there is there are turbulences uh on the aircraft you're traveling on and you there's no possibility for you to stand up or to go to the prayer uh area so then this is something you have to do but but what if it's during a period of time where it's probably dangerous where like people didn't at that certain time uh respect Islam for instance for the international incidents taking place and he was afraid okay to to talk about uh uh this particular case we'll pause for a short break and we'll answer your question inshallah just right after the break all the prophets are brothers and they uh represent the same message what was the call of the Prophet what was his invitation he was inviting inviting to what so the prophet said oh Allah Grant your mercy and the one who is tolerant if he you know if he sells on one who is tolerant if he buys and one who is tolerant when he seeks his rights in this program sheh abdurahman deashia presents reminders a bouquet of various reminders and admonitions that we need to strengthen our faith taste it sweetness perfect our acts of worship and refine our morals try to discipline them in the best way those daughters will be his shield that means those will be the reason the cause of his protection from Hellfire because of what taking care of them what you have in this life no matter what you have is less and it is the Huda TV wishes you and your family a spiritual and rewarding Ramadan and welcome back brother fat had an interesting question it deals with terrorists and terrorist attacks and what how we should pray when uh uh uh when put in such a situation I don't I hope you don't have any terrorist links brother okay go ahead what's what what was your question I'm saying again if someone is in an area in a non-muslim country and there's not a mosque or close by and he's afraid to stand outside and just pray in the open standing doing and and it's him alone or with a friend for instance and his his car is parked in the parking spot and he cannot move it so he's afraid and there's no MUSC around and he doesn't want the the time of prayer to pass him can he just go in his car lock the door sit in the driver's seat pray sitting finish his prayer then come out and continue his Affairs seriously speaking this is one hell of a hypothetical situation it can be imagined if you are surrounded by zombies and the minute you open the door of your car and they're going to snatch you and you start eating you but even though in such a situation if you drive for about 10 15 minutes away from them it's going to clear out so let's assume that you are like some of the brothers just mentioned a while ago you are driving in a safari park and it's a long drive and if you park your car and you come out a lion or a tiger or a crocodile or uh or whatever animal would jump you and probably harm you so you have no way of leaving your car and the closest uh distance for for for clearance would be uh uh not sufficient for you to pray after you reach it then only then you may pray but you have to remember that there are so many things that are imaginable and not real lots of the guys say I'm in a a situation where I cannot pray I can't do this I can't do that may I have the excuse to do so some brothers call me and say well we are in a country where Islam is being oppressed though it's a Muslim country but if I don't shave my beard there's a possibility that the authorities would come and Inter interrogate me and ask me questions and maybe throw me in jail for a week or so so is it okay to shave my beard this is hypothetical now how many of the brothers have faced such a a thing said well I know one out of a million then this is this is not a good excuse so you don't do this you do it it's permissible for you to cross the line if you are faced with danger if you are being you know harassed or you're being uh uh uh punished for something that Islam tells you it's okay not to do it in such a case but but just because you're afraid or you're imagining things your phone is tapped or people are following you then this means I have to shave my beard my wife has to take off her uh nikab and cover and we have to be westernized just to be normal people this is unacceptable brother Mustafa had a question um the same the same almost the same question suppose you're driving and then you're stuck in traffic and you know for sure that the nearest M when you reach it you're going to miss prayer is it allowed for you for example to park your car and then pray in your car sitting of no while you're sitting stand no you remember that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that I was given five things that no other prophets or messenger has been given and the second thing he said that the Earth was made for me a place of prayer and evolution which means that even if you're suuck in in traffic you will be able to find a place to park your car and pray PR even on the pavement on the or on the on the asphalt or anywhere it's not you have to pray in Mosk no you can pray anywhere but the problem is with praying sitting down because this means that it's exactly like if a person says well I I I don't have water to perform a bution and my house is about an hour drive so is it okay to make are you in the city said yes are there mosques around said oh plenty are there grocery stores around oh yes I can buy water like crazy but I don't want to I'm I'm used to performing ablution in my house so can I pray with tum answer is no as long as there's a possibility or you're able to go and get water you can't pray with tum as long as you can park your car and pray standing up you are not allowed to pray in your car again brother fat but isn't there an Evidence of taking the direction of the on the da on the camel and praying on it yeah but what kind of prayer only voluntary prayer there was not in no no obligatory prayer none whatsoever at all it's a a prerequisite that you face the the When you pray obligatory prayer and as far as the other forms ofnah preferred Sunnah also the The Scholar say you have to follow or you have to face the direction of the and you have to be standing up now prefered uh voluntary prayer that has no cause and no reason you may pray in any direction you wish but I heard that he like wrote a book on the back of a c going to pilgrimage and did he stop to pray every time like on the on the standing up there are so many issues here one that is sh you heard yeah and it it's not a a method of transferring or transporting knowledge through hearsay award say you have to have it written down secondly it was not it was who wrote wrote the book of Z and he did not say that he wrote it on Camelback because even if you have you ever ridden a camel have you ever been on camel's back you imagine yourself they didn't have any fountain pens huh they didn't have any you know one of them nice pens we have they had to had ink in one container and the feather and they used to do this so imagine what would happen what kind of you know calligraphy you would have at the end of the day this is not the true thirdly now you are assuming saying that even if he wrote it on the back of a camel would it be logical that he would Dismount and pray every single time a prayer comes they didn't have any bathrooms on their camels so he had to answer the call of nature so what would he do whenever he had to answer the call of nature so you don't build your allegation on on possibilities we have a rule in it says Whenever there is a possibility then this is not good for it's not an Evidence so if you say that I have an Evidence but it might mean so and it might mean the other way then immediately you reject this this is unacceptable evidence has to be clearcut and straightforward coming back again obligatory prayer you have to face the ca the and you have to be in the standing position unless it is impossible or it there's a hazard on on your health or life then it's already okay for you to pray sitting down uh we move on to the following Hadith Hadith number 10 if I'm correct 165 yes okay go ahead please narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger Sall Al wasallam said the direction between the East and West is a can you explain thisth for me f the direction between East and West is the oh so North is and South is how would that be the direction between east and west facing Caba yes so it's either North or west no how what what do you mean by no Mustafa yes yeah it can be right so you have to know what is the origin of this Hadith to be able to understand it Muhammad yeah because loc in a Middle East and one side is Mash other side is M so between both of them is there's so if I face North or South it's okay no no nobody says this this Hadith the prophet said it when he was where in the in Medina in Medina when he was in Medina now where is the for those who are in Medina it's to their South it's to their South okay so this is the and this is south and this is east and this is West so if I go this way I'm not facing the directly and if I go this way it's nice shair it's nice I'm not facing the directly so the prophet tells us that if you cannot pinpoint a then whatever between the East and West is considered to be so small diversion is accepted but if you go all the way to the east this is not accepted if you go all the way to the west or to the South this is not accepted so you have to understand where what the context of this Hadith is is so that you don't go into details that are not unnecessary do do you understand this this means that if I can pinpoint the directly I can pray to it and any small diversion would would would be okay any small Divergent would be all right and there's nothing wrong in this you don't have to be really you know uh uh uh to down to the details and exactly the degrees and and the minutes of of the direction it has to be this it's it's preferable yes but if it's unintentional it's okay now the condition of facing the we you're excused in many cases not to face it when one when are you excused not to face the when you don't know no when you don't know and you tried your best and you couldn't know this is one two you're riding a vehicle and to play the sunna prayer no no I'm talking about obligatory prayer when you're in an airplane well not necessarily no when you're too sick to move excellent when you are unable when you are unable to face the because of illness or because you're tied you are in locked in a Cell God forbid and you can't face the this is the only Direction you can then you could you may do this another one and last we will inshallah conclude our our episode with it in case of fear so it's not the airplane it's not the car it's fear if you're afraid if you stand up then something bad will happen to you something awful would take place then this especially in the case of a pilot if a single Pilot Flying the aircraft and if he stands up and prays Hell Breaks Loose so he is supposed to sit down and continue and pray uh as he is I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time a h"
