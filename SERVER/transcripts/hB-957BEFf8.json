  "title": "Getting waswas / whispers from Satan about Allah & Islam, what do I do? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he has whispers about allah and about religion and so does mubashir from bangladesh these whispers are generated by shaytan and we all know this the companions had it and the prophet said to the companions may allah please with them that this is a sign of iman because they did not talk about it and because of the iman in their heart shaytan is whispering to them because the vast majority of people they don't get these whispers because they don't have a man in their hearts so when you get these thoughts what should you do first of all look for the source are these thoughts generated by an angel or are they generated by shaytan no one can say i don't know no you we all know 100 is shaitaan if you know it's shaytan why are you adhering and listening to it allah described the plotting of shaytan to be weak indicated can you be weaker than shaytan that doesn't make any sense if my enemy brings me a mug and he's my enemy i know he wants to kill me and he said this is green tea i prepared it for you go ahead and take a sip if i drink it would i be responsible for killing myself and says yes it's your mistake you know he's your enemy why do you adhere and believe what he says to you without any doubt likewise shaitaan whispers these thoughts into my head why would i believe him then it's my mistake and there is a lot of things to be said in this regard on how to counter shaytan but this would take a long time and this is why we have counseling sessions where usually we talk and exchange a dialogue with the person who's suffering from these thoughts and ask him subhanallah why are you getting these thoughts are you the chosen one among the 2 billion muslims on earth you're the only masha'allah righteous and practicing person who gets these thoughts or you are the one who allowed shaytan to mess up with his head so you have to fight and acknowledge that this is your enemy talking to you and prevent him from communicating with you at all awesome"
