  "transcript": "so elbows of Juan from Kuwait says that if there was a person who was in need let's say for a surgery for something that was of a necessity and this person is classified islamically as poor or needy and I gave him from zakat money as help this is permissible providing that this person had he known that it is the cat would accept it I don't have to tell him because this would hurt his feeling but I know that he's in need and he takes the cat if I were to know that this person does not accept the cat I cannot give him from zakat maybe he's a say it and he feels that he should not take from the zakat though he's poor but he does not take from the zakat and he does not accept it in this case I should not give him from the zakat but if I high most likely think that he accepts it I don't have to tell him so I give him ten thousand euros for his operation for his treatment whatever and after a year he comes back to me and says may Allah bless you here's your ten thousand euros now either I tell him if it's okay okay this was from zakat so this was given to you you can keep it or I just tell him that it was a gift keep it if he insists on giving it back and refuses to keep it in this case this money is not mine I have to immediately give it to the poor needy as if it is today's zakat being given out so I cannot keep the money if he doesn't want to keep it I can take it and give it to someone else who is needy and Eliza JAL knows best way"
