  "transcript": "a brother says can we have two intentions for voluntary fasts like fasting the six days of Shawwal plus mondays and thursdays the answer is yes all types of fasting whether voluntary or mandatory you can combine with them the intention of Mondays and Thursdays and also the white days so if I have a missed day from Ramadan I can fast it on Ashura and hit two birds with one stone expiration of my sins of one year I can facet on Arafah expiration of the sins of two years plus making up from for my mistake of Ramadan I can definitely do it on Mondays Thursdays and the white days there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
