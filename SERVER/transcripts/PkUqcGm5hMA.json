  "transcript": "it is one of the six articles of Iman and this may come as a surprise to a lot of the Muslims and I always have fun discussing this with them in counseling sessions so when I say to them so do you know the six pillars of Iman he said of course shahada praying said no USM this is these are the five pillars of Islam so there was an upgrade yep there there are six pillars of Iman and unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are totally ignorant oblivious of these six pillars of Iman mentioned in the Quran mentioned in the Sunnah and elsewhere so these are to believe in Allah to believe in the day of judgment to believe in the angels and The Messengers in the scriptures and to believe in the Divine decree whether good or bad now when we say to believe in the day of judgment this means that there is a day of judgment A Day of Reckoning a day of accountability and this is what gives us salus and comfort because when we are oppressed when we are wronged and we are unable to get even what gives us Comfort is that there will come a time of accountability course and this is the day of judgment and when we worship Allah and when we do good things and we don't see the fruit of it at present believing that there is a Day of Reckoning a day of accountability gives us a lot of comfort that okay is we're going to get our reward a little bit later"
