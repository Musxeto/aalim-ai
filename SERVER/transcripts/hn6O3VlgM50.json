  "transcript": "let's just say online saying that playing football is forbidden because it is going against the hook playing football okay yeah uh well I heard that because they said that you follow rules in it which go uh against the hook no it doesn't go against the Hokum of Allah but it's uh any other than Hokum of Allah other than yeah so they said that yeah first of all we don't take our religion from the internet definitely our religion is so precious that we have to know who we are learning it from likewise if I have a stomach pains I wouldn't go to the internet and ask any Tom Dick or Harry to tell me what's wrong and then maybe open my stomach with uh uh a knife and and take my appendix out just because I read an article so you have to know who you're taking your religion from first of all second of all what they're saying is a logical it's bogus why because according to them traffic lights are ruling with other than the Sharia of Allah so when I see a red traffic light I have no problem I can cross it and this is and with all due respect stupid nobody does this nobody says this because this is endangering your life and the life of others and going against a ruling that does not go against Islam rather it goes in line with the rulings of Islam so playing football eating with a spoon and a fork which is not from Sharia sitting on a desk using the laptops who's not from Sharia Etc and researching hadith's online is not also from Sharia all of this is permissible and it has nothing to do with ruling with other than what Allah has mandated and Allah knows best this"
