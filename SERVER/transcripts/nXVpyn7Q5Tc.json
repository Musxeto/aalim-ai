  "transcript": "mohamad he says I suffer from depression and it makes me have suicidal thoughts I know how bad it is in Islam would you give me some tips on how to escape it depression is an illness it's a feeling and there are psychiatrists who have diagnosed this illness and put its symptom PSA's in a very long list and they said that if you have like four of these then you should seek medical attention and from an Islamic perspective Islam looks at it from both angles first angle is the cause of it and each person's depression differs from the other so one might be caused because of marital problems financial problems maybe the children in the home he's unable to straighten them up his problems at work with the bosses or with the colleagues his problems with him self or herself not having the self esteem self confidence and so on there's there can be many reasons your past your sins that are overwhelming you and in order to be able to treat this we always ask the brothers and sisters who feel depressed to strengthen their Eman why is that see brother Mohammed says he has suicidal thoughts now a Muslim never gets these thoughts at all because he knows the consequences of such an action so for example if someone is in debt and someone wants from him his money he would be doing something illogical if he goes and borrows with a higher interest rate ribbon from someone who would break his knees for example if he doesn't pay on time this is illogical so when you have so many problems and you kill yourself and you know that Allah will throw you in hell and that the torment of hell is so severe and and serious and painful that one second in it would not be or cannot be compared to what you're suffering on earth this is nothing this is child's play so as a Muslim if you have strong conviction if you believe in Allah if you believe in the Quran if you believe in the Sunnah if you believe that Allah Azza WA JAL has preordained everything before the creation of the universe 50,000 years ago and that Allah is most knowledgeable and Allah is most wise and Allah Azza WA JAL is most merciful then you should know whatever is happening to you that this is from Allah and your belief tells you to feel calm and to get the tranquility because once you look at the great messengers and prophets of Allah once you look at the great scholars of the Seraph and the torments and the tribulations and the calamities they had been afflicted with and you compare this to yours you know that alhamdulillah you are in great favors and blessings of a large dodger compared to them so this helps a lot to remove your depression and thinking logically helps a lot as well if allah azzawajal were to afflict me with the calamity now let me see the different scenarios i can choose from scenario number one i can bang my head in the wall and cry all night long for my loss or for my calamity the result nothing a very big scar maybe few stitches and an awful headache but my calamity will remain nothing will change scenario number two I could keep on complaining to people Allah did this to me Allah did this to me and look what happened why people are not suffering as I am why these disbelievers or this these sinful people are not being afflicted like I am and again your calamity will not change however you'll get more and more sins the scenario number three is that you are content and if not content at least you are patient content is a higher higher lever level see you must be patient you do not complain whatever happens I handle I'll try my level best to solve the problem to get rid of such a calamity or tribulation but if I'm unable this is what Allah had decreed upon me what can I do nothing and here is the difference between a believer and someone who does not have the full conviction in Islam this person is highly rewarded at the side of Allah and he is elevated in paradise as time goes on and he's patient if he adds to that content when people ask him how do you feel today and he's suffering yet he says al hamdulillah I am fine everything is fine he's content he's patient he never complains then allah azza wajal would reward him Allah would love him and most likely Allah Azza WA JAL would find him a way out of that calamity because it was a test and this person passed the test the other two failed to pass the test therefore you have to look into depression and ask yourself few questions is this self-imposed or was it suggested by Shaitaan by Satan trying to depress me trying to sadden me trying to make my life miserable and the lives of those around me you will find that this is from Shaitaan and Allah described this in the Quran in different locations telling us that such intimidation is from Shaitaan such sadness is from Shaitaan such worries and whispers are from Shaitaan so the best thing for you to do is to put your dependence and your reliance on Allah so she'll feel confident in Allah trust a large that were JAL when you hold a child an infant and you toss the infant in the air what does the infant do he laughs its head off why because he trusts that you're going to grab him if someone toasts me in the air I'm gonna cry like crazy because I don't trust that person so you should and Allah has the highest example of course you should trust Allah Azza WA JAL and this would relieve you from all types of depression you are suffering from insha'Allah Yousef"
