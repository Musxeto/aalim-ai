  "title": "Fatwa regarding -Paris Terror Attack 2015-",
  "transcript": "is our first questioner from the emails and he says any words regarding the recent terror attack in Paris without any reservations the crime that took place in France in Paris is a crime it is a sin it is prohibited it is something that should be condemned however as Muslims Islam is a religion of fairness and Justice so as we condemn this brutal attack and this crime because of its nature and because of its negative consequences on the reputation of Islam and the livelihood of Muslims in these countries we all also at the same time must condemn similar attacks so when you ask me to condemn such attacks I do that without any reservations but at the same time there has to be a balance what's the ruling on the killings of the children and women and innocent people in Palestine in Gaza for example what is happening in Syria what is happening in Iraq in Afghanistan in Yemen drone attacks innocent people are being killed by whom and for what reasons so 12 people died this is a crime I agree but at the same times time we should also look at the bigger picture about the other atrocities and crimes that are taking place by the enemies of Islam and the Muslims are negative they're not condemning this as well but as soon as 12 people died in France mashallah everybody is condemning it is this fair and logical yes it is a crime and if I were to be asked whether to report these people before they committed the crime or not I would definitely 100% say they must be reported and if you know someone who is about to make a terrorist attack you must report him you must hinder him and stop him because this is tarnishing the reputation of Islam and he does not represent Islam by no means now more than that if we would like to compare Apple to Apple which is more severe and hideous in the religion of Islam killing a dozen of people or insulting the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam and The Messengers of Allah Jesus Christ Moses all prophets of Allah and insulting and depict icting and ridiculing the religions of Allah Asel definitely the latter is blaspheming it is an act of kufur and it's far greater than the slaying of a dozen people which is a crime by itself that is not to be looked down upon it is a serious crime but which is more severe why didn't we hear from the Muslims worldwide condemnation why didn't we hear from presidents and heads of state condemnations to these countries and to these uh uh means of media that are doing this harmful and shameful attack against our religion against the religion of Allah against Allah himself this is an irony that has to be addressed there's something wrong in our Islam when we are quick to condemn the killing of 12 people give or take one or two while we look the other way when it comes to insulting our messenger our Prophet Alam does does this justify the killing the answer is no it does not because this killing cannot be executed except by the head of state so if I'm in Saudi Arabia and someone does this it's not for me to do it it has to go through a panel of Judges who would give their verdict and then the ruler the head of the State can either executes it and Carries On the punishment or he pardons the individual or puts him in jail this is up to the ruler the Muslim ruler other than that it's no go it's not for you and me otherwise we will be living in a jungle but again compare Apple to Apple now they say that this is freedom of speech and what they were doing was okay well I beg to differ because in these countries there is no thing such as freedom of speech except if it was against Islam against religions against prophets against Allah against Jesus Christ this is freedom speech say whatever you want if it's against colored people if it's against uh uh previous colonies no problem if it's against the Palestinians the syrians the Iraqis afghanis step on them they're trash but when it comes to the Jews they'll put you in jail anti-semitism M you're not allowed to talk about Jews where is my freedom of speech your freedom of speech ends here if it's against gays and homosexuals no you have no right none whatsoever to speak about this if it's about this and that your freedom of speech ends but if it's opposition groups talking against our leadership talking against our religion in our countries and we jail them after being Tri tried and convicted and we decide to flog them or to jail them or to do whatever punishment that is dictated by law the law of the country you hear president of countries condemning this brutal attack on freedom of speech what irony what cont contradiction no what enmity to Islam I would say so to put it in nutshell I condemn this brutal attack and this crime that took place in Paris these people do not represent Islam I'm not even proud to be affiliated with them and I do have my doubts whether they have been paid off by other sources so that they would tarnish the reputation of Islam because in Islam we do not Advocate we do not encourage such coward attacks yet we do condemn these cartoons and we do condemn these attacks because look what happened elsewhere seven eight countries tens of different Publications they reproduced and republished these uh uh depicting cartoons so did this attack did this crime serve Islam or was it against Islam and I would not go into the causes and the reason reasons of the existence of such fanatism and terrorism in such countries because this is not the right program to discuss these things"
