  "transcript": "wah Srila handily Latvia I mean what's under Los Alamos needed if he was I mean he remains I'm not bad it's a great privilege for me today to have someone who is extremely close to our hearts who is a belonging chef of us the great majority of us in Europe and the Arab countries and wherever you are really in the world that is well known and come to life by the grace and mercy of allah subhanahu wata'ala after the extremely busy schedule of the chef's is being able to come this evening to come to an extremely small mission which many people have named the faithful anchor bullet has come to give us the privilege of his wisdom and knowledge that he has attained over the years I refer to our beloved chef the daddy chef I seen I came from Saudi Arabia he is an extremely well-known chef within Saudi Arabia itself and within the english-speaking world the chef has had numerous programs on eco-hula and Mitch and on a daily basis I see him on the suru√≠ channel - at the moment the chef is director of a well-known company in Saudi Arabia basting ginger so without further ado without me boring you too much and I would like to introduce our chef and get him inshallah Thailand to start Selam aleykum who knew that Ocelot was my loss where you are Ali he was laughing he related whatever another few corrections to the brothers introduction and first of all when he started his introduction I wanted to look right and left and see where this Sheikh was the world renowned internationally in Saudi Arabia you haven't left anything this is not not true at all I'm only privileged by the grace of Allah surgeon to be able to construct few words in English and I'm from Saudi Arabia that's why people give me some importance not that I have that knowledge or that I have that that wisdom or anything to do of that and it is yonezawa here it is out of his not let's let's not say wishful thinking but out of his daily good gesture massamba that he is thinking too well of me but this is not the appropriate way of introducing any Muslim because the prophet saw Solomon's told us when he heard someone complimenting another Muslim City you broke his back now he's talking like this as it spider the house is described so this is not actual and this is not correct with the brother said regarding being a director I quit my job six months ago now a freelance something to have dinner so I'm able to travel a lot done before and with the grace of Allah Gani it's I'm doing so consolidation in business but not as a nine-to-five job regarding the topic steps to Allah religion is a very big title if you may say however I thought of talking to you about some of the things that are so basic unfortunately basic things we tend to overlook so many of us have wives in their houses they have children in their houses and they take their love for granted and they never look back to see what we're giving in return so we expect a lot of things but we do not do what we have to do it therefore it's just I didn't like that to myself and to you about the basics in this life and in this time we fail to identify our basis and therefore if you go to the kids in school and say what is your objective why are you studying I'm talking about southern India the majority of children would say because my father would beat me if I don't go to school so if the schools doors are closed what will you do holiday they'll be more than happy not to go for a year or two they don't have disincentives to go to schools if you ask a person who goes to college it's the same thing if you ask a person who goes to work and earns money to put food on the table he has the same problem the same dilemma we do not have an objective a proper Muslim is unlike any other Muslim a practicing Muslim is unlike any other Muslim because he knows that the sole reason for his creation it is not because of the Prophet or in some of the servants it is not because this or that Allah has Allah stated that in the Quran or mahalo portal Jinnah would in Silla be able to endure only the sole reason for creating the jinns and the humans is to worship allah azzawajal and some of them worship and some of them do not so this is why Allah has ojen created the whole universe this is why Allah Allah created the humans and did you to worship allah subhanaw taala but does this mean now we know that this is an ayah in the Quran and we know that Allah created us for this sole purpose reason does this mean that okay now I know I will remain in the message it I will never leave until they take me to the graveyard why because I want to worship Allah definitely not again if you limit your thinking without knowledge you have problems you have to understand Islam through acquiring knowledge and the first thing you would say what mahakal gender is is that the aquatune except to worship me so what is worshiping allah azzawajal worshipping allah intelligent as identified by a maintained via mail maja mercy upon his soul it is a name it is a description to any act whether verbally or by action or by your heart that you do that allah azzawajal approves off its a name to anything that you do or say that allah azzawajal loves whether it's visible or invisible so if i have great mercy over my brother no one's easiness but it's in my heart this is a form of worship if I say something that is good then this is a form of worship person subhanAllah this is worship if I tell a brother let's go to pray is just worship if I do certain acts and I intend by these acts to worship Allah is urgent there are forms of worship as long as Allah approves of it as long as a blue Allah Georgian loves it so this expands the definition of worship it is not only limited in prayer fasting giving zakat and performing Hajj not at all the Prophet says Alice awesome even the Muslim you put in your earlier wife's mouth Allah Allah grant you with that ish set up a charity so even putting the morsel in your wife's mouth small honor don't stop her mother she choke her to death know this what was intended a Muslim the Prophet tells owners of even if you have intimacy with your wife Allah will give you some aha and the companions minds to know the hey wires one of us Taine's his desire and lust and he gets some of the prophecy yes sorry sorry Sarah you see if you put it in harm would you be sinful it's the essence and likewise if you put it in hell that Allah would reward you for that give me one delusion that is like this even that's like so the intention is extremely important providing that it Allah Allah approves it and this is form of worship now this is basic but if we tend to revive this conviction and belief in our hearts our lives would be much much more different because now when my father tells me go and fetch this from the grocery shop I do it because it pleases Allah so from here to the grocery shop and back I am in good deeds I'm worshipping allah azza wajal if i wake my little sister and she doesn't want to wake up for Fajr prayer and I kindly wake her up in a nice way till she wakes up in praise so many good deeds then I have but I've been missing because my intention is not correct and my intention is not correct that because I don't want to from here to the grocery shop and back I am in good deeds and worshiping allah azzawajal if i wake my little sister and she doesn't want to wake up for Fajr prayer and I kindly wake her up in a nice way till she wakes up embraced so many good deeds then I have but I've been missing because my intention is not correct in my intention is not correct that because I don't want to because I did not know of it now Allah Azza WA JAL does not look at the color of our skin does not look at how we are built how tall how short how then Allah does not look at our bank accounts for our properties or how much we have the Prophet said our son had it inside Muslim Allah looks at our hearts and our DS and these are two important things because the majority of us to look know that Allah looks at the hearts so that these are not important no they have to coincide in the sense that if your intention and heart is good but your actions are bad Allah would hold you accountable if my intention is good to give down with you people mashallah this is something good but if I go to a nightclub and pick me a blonde new dancing and flirt with for the sake of Allah I'm just kind of giving him a doubt this is how I know likewise reversal if my deeds are excellent I'm an excellent diary am excellent imam an orator I give lecture the soul but my heart is corrupt my heart is filled with hypocrisy with doubts with I'm a liar but I'm just pretending would this help me on the day of judgement I'll be thrown into hell so that both things have to coincide a lot looks as in the Prophet as some hadith is a Muslim looks at your hearts and your deeds so if you're defying your heart is a priority purification of your heart working hard to fix this heart is extremely important because you've seen it so many practicing people are now not practicing especially idioms you see it in in the West a lot people committing acts of apostasy allah azzawajal says in the quran that the believers call allah and say from banner LAN Zhu Zi Luo man al-qaida in hiding they stop from the depth of the heart saying that our Lord let not our hearts deviate from the truth after you have guided us and grant us mercy from you so if you don't continuously ask allah azzawajal you have a very very big problem the prophet a little it says the majority of his drop from Selma was asked and also no I shall of the eleven and a number of companies narrated the same hadith or similar to it what was the most of the prophets to harness a lot of self you would think probably all night who give me a lot grandpa Jenna or like this or that no she said the majority of the prophets daughter the most the book of the prophets daughter is Allah of Muhammad Liberty except it can be heard I think o Allah the one who turns hearts who flips hearts o allah azza wajal make my heart steadfast on Islam so they asked fellow prophet of Allah so many times you ask Allah for this so what is it are you afraid for us and then the Prophet said I said that the hearts are between two fingers of Allah fingers and he flips it as he wishes those whom Allah has dojin wills it will stay steadfast on stuff and those whom Allah Allah wills it will when he had to be left me imagine getting a grant a safe future from this they will be converted and deviated from the straight path so if the Prophet arremato son is the one asking Allah most for this so what about us this is a problem now each one of us think of himself thinks of himself that he is the elite he is the highest and the top in Hindman and with my he-man I can change the whole world and we think highly of ourselves and if you just scan your 30 days that have passed and check how many players you've missed how many fashion you did not bring the Masjid how many soon as you did not offer after the after mother enough generation before Roger if you just make a checklist you'll find that you are among the worst Muslims ever so this is what we convince ourselves with yet we do not ask Allah ocean to make our hearts set pass on Islam well the Prophet who is he he's the Prophet as a sermon yet he this is the bulk of his drug so what must we do to remain steadfast on Islam especially in this time and era and in this location of the world how is it possible well you have to ask Allah Allah for guidance you cannot survive on your own you cannot do anything on your own as a Muslim this is what we believe that if a lot of soldiers does not will it I cannot inhale my breath if Allah has object does not worth it I cannot explain myself even breathing is by Allah's approval so I am a need for others assistance and guidance in every single thing I need and the minute I feel that I am standing on my own and what I'm doing is by my own strength or by my own knowledge but by my own ability then I have committed a grave and serious sin that might even notify my Islam once you think that you are independent and you don't need a lot soldier you don't have trust in Allah you'll have dependence on Allah you become emotional even have that excessive may Allah be pleased with him that if a person says had it not been for my neighbor's duck the burglar would have broken into my home home and robbed it the manifest says whoever says this he has committed an active ship why it's my neighbor's duck that made the sound that startled the the feet and he ran away he did not break into my house had it not been for that duck he would have stolen my house even I'm fast never be pleased with him said this is because you attributed a favor and blessing of Allah soldier to a duck rather they should have said it had it not been for the grace of Allah that made the duck do Sol Sol Sol Sol look in your life is looking your business look in your everyday activity do you attribute all the blessings and favours for margin then certainly have reckless drivers mentor sake you don't how reckless we drive and I myself personally drive in the state in front of my home 140 million men do anything just to go to the grocery shop so it's way that the people drive there they don't have any road sense however so many times a lot of those it blesses me and others in avoiding accidents and we never attribute the storm up so if we pass by someone who had an accident look at this schmuck doesn't know how to drive if I were in his place I would have you know did this with the hand brake and spin the car put it in reverse and marshal luck it would be there this is what we we what we do why because we neglect unless favors and blessings and that is why we have lost there isn't any connection between us and Allah has soldier so what to do to be step faster listener we have to turn into a lock we have to turn to Allah Elliot DISA we have an attorney we have to turn the languages we are in turn to Allah position in the funny is that whenever you are afraid of something you run away from it except Eliza when you feel what probably you will run to him and that is why allah says in the quran i feel whoa in allah so flee to Allah verily I am a plain Warner to you from him you run to Allah a soldier I made a mistake I'm I'm innocent I'm simple by nature I am simple the prophets analysis of Cordova maha-bhagavata inner act a weapon by fact everything the son of Adam is sinful however the best of the sinful ones are those who repent what was it last unit pendant to Allah Allah what was it last you felt remorse felt sad felt bad about the sin you've done and felt bad about the sin you've done in the beginning we do since we feel that with a try with me feel depressed the following day we get weak and we do it again the following day we do it again and again until the heart is as cold as ice until the heart is as hard as stone and then we do not repent we do not feel remorse and we do not regret what we do and then we move on to a further stage in the dungeons of Hell by asking people to share the same with us at the beginning we were sinful now with callers to sin so this is a big problem that a lot of the hearts are corrupted by it without you knowing it it's not that you sitting though now you want people to share the sensor that you want be better than me sin is the easiest thing to do in this life you don't have to be a genius to say you don't have to be a rocket scientist any person considered a woman does this you know okay a sister can easily take of The Hitcher whether she's Aglio beautiful it doesn't require a lot of talent a brother can easily skip further prayer then easily of deal in interest buy a house and mortgage can easily fornicate can easily take a log of whatever he can do whatever he wants easy but this is a sign than a lot of them does not love you because of my sergeant did not guide you while it is difficult to be on the straight path it is difficult to pray it is difficult for systemic nature it is difficult not to lie I want to say something but I can't I love lying lying is nice I'd love to say vulgar jokes it makes people happy makes people like me I like to cheat I like to be seen this is human nature that allah azzawajal told us not to do allies purifying our salsa so sinning is very easy anybody can sing but be sure that when you send one of the goodness love you because Allah gives in this life wealth to the Muslims and to the non-muslims and who's the richest man of the world because it is it it is gone what an affair and then now there's another one coming Chinese and what Mexican limit is of origin so many people mashallah and I'm unimpressed by the way if I say or the tenn heaven-bound so Allah gives wealth to Muslims and roosters who's the richest country in the world we know who's strongest people who always gets medals in this ordinary non-muslims who is this that was the - is that non-muslims so ambassador gives this life health wealth power to those whom he loves and to those whom he does not love because at the end of the day it's a transitional period it's only a few years and then it's heaven or hell forever but Allah does not give a man Allah does not give a slab Allah does not give the tranquility of the heart except to those whom he loves and I prayed to Allah so doesn't he makes me a new among so if you look at an ayah which always frightens me insert the Toba chapter 9 verse 46 Allah says has the gelato which this is our typical letter I do Lahore good that were lacking why didn't he have explained in English what I think I am welcome bahasa who fought Ibaka who will opera do man fighting a messiah and if they had intended to march out the hypocrites certainly they would have made some preparation for it but they didn't so what happened Allah says but Allah abhorred they're being sent forth and I dislike them that they don't work out in March so what did the motto so he made them black behind this means that if I don't wake up for culture today and go to the Masjid it is not me Allah so that made me lag behind because unlike this like me so I have to do something so that Eliezer they would like me again and it is something you cannot predict you do what you do you do what you have to do and ask Allah so just to support you but at the end of the day it is almost with so if Allah does not give you no fear if Allah there's not a you to do this you are in deep trouble you have a lot of concern to look for mmm analyzed diligent also warned us so many times people say I hate the Prophet says so so so Allah soldier says so so so yes why are you doing this this is Haram this is something mandated for you to do you must do it and we keep on or spawning delay starting Allah Allah says in the penguin colony we'll have it at home well observe command a mute mean will be out whatever when a dozen people yeah and we shall turn their hearts and their eyes away from guidance why as they refused to believe that in for the first time so the minute you hear about Allah or other living soul of re residents you immediately embrace it don't delay it don't postpone it because you don't know if a lot of them will seal your heart and then you will not be able to accept it here it's different in southeastern Allah we are blessed by honey a lot of messages yeah in between epic state and a state you find three formats you and what people are coming to the message that Thomas has been given and we have loved speakers so we all know that this apartment the imam is reciting but the fact that highly the first rap everybody is going to the masjid you find punks you find youngsters you find elders in the cars or going in the opposite direction not being able laughing and joking and you look in the faces it's blank you don't see any expressions it's just laughter laughing without any feelings and you know that a lot of them has see you there then even if you smile here this machine is that a second okay they go why because they refuse in the first part and that is why allah so said is not making it easy to for them to listen and then a lot of the time did you go and give that one to people Muslims it is premised on the part of the person that is not able to connect and we were like this before that for a lot larger job back to this we were even worse than this because I think a compliment pardon the man nah wah wah are they comfortable it is like this you have been in the past but a lot grace over you that you have been guided so now you have to look and understand so one should be extremely careful that Allah does not fit his heart the minute you find the truth coming to embrace it abide by it and in order for our hearts to remain steadfast on Islam in this time in this society it's difficult if I go outside of the Masjid do you think that only let alone or people would call me to join their ways you have this in your schools let then you have it in universities you have it in your work place everybody wants you to blend in president what's the problem your citizens of this country so what's the problem no blending and meaning leaving your people abandoning your conviction not being practice this is something is the divided between death and life life and death this is something I cannot you know this is my core reason of existence in that is my Islam my pride my honor my dignity is in my religion it's not in my citizenship it's not in my bank account its in what I believe so this is something I cannot compromise yes we can't coexist we can try to make the best of it but providing that nothing comes close to Islam because Islam is my priority so what to do to remain steadfast on Islam first thing Allah Azza WA JAL begin to us upon earth a book of guidance this forum if we abide by it it would be the solution whether you like it or not a book of guidance this forum if we abide by it it would be thus to gender whether you like it or not hold fast to it try your best to abide by what's in it and implement it in your life and you'll go to Jannah and it is one of the greatest means of putting your heart to be steadfast a larger tells us in the Quran and those who disbelieve say why is it not the Quran revealed to him all at once you know we know that the Quran came over a period of 23 23 years maybe I have to ask a few questions because I'm saying that some of the others are starting to those and when I see people dozing I start to touch my stuff yeah yeah I'm an old man you cannot even fathom in that's better so maybe I have to ask some questions that they know that so beware you have camera so 23 years before I has been revealed so the father said why was it that revealed all at once Allah says I sell jelly thus that we may strengthen your heart thereby the reason the main reason for God to be revealed over the years on portions so that it would strengthen the prophets heart resource so the best means of strengthening our hearts is reciting the Quran without the Quran you cannot be a proper mystery without abiding by the for Ireland having a portion of the Quran to be recited and read every single day you're not a proper Muslim and if you ask people nowadays how much of the file do you need a day ok a week yeah a month maybe so how much I'm happy about every Ramadan I've tried to finish it once the past te Ramadan it was too difficult but yeah I mean before that who did I pyramides to finish it once and the whole year nothing if you open the Quran a couple of time in the people's house it's filled of doesn't why is that they don't use it the majority either put it on the dashboard in the glove compartment Monica why because this is cheaper than an insurance policy Eliezer would save me who said that this is if you put the Quran in your glove compartment thinking that it will prevent you from accidents this is  if you put it in under the pillow so that your wife would not assassinate you this is again ship and anthem does not help you it doesn't do anything for you as such but reading it and implementing what it is what's in it this is your life this is the remedy for all of your illnesses and problems so abiding by the Quran is extremely important and the less than the least you can do is finish the Quran once a month so every day you read one juzo so by the end of the donor month you've completed the Quran and you go on and on this is the least you do let the Prophet instructed Abdullah Abdullah smell things with him and with his father when after Lucknow said I can do more than that why because the Prophet told him this when he knew that abdomen finishes the Quran once every night he was a newlywed his father went to him and he saw his daughter-in-law and she said how is my son he was just mad a couple of weeks ago and the woman was a righteous woman she does not complain as much about the work of a he fasts everything today and he's a praise night prayer every single night he's a pest of worshippers I'm gonna Rasmussen one of the intelligent companions of the Prophet SAW he understood her message meaning that if he's faster all day and prays all night he has no time to have intimacy with her so until now she's still a virgin so immediately complain to the Prophet are some sentiments we have a problem in the Prophet a son brought up tomorrow him and the massive yet separate mass tonight I'm not gonna lie about it great the whole night with no Prime from cover to cover every night can you do this profit on them no no finish it once a month then I can do more once every 20 days I can do more once every 10 days I say I can do more once every seven days in this is in the behind and in another narration in Muslim as well the prophecy in three days and you cannot you should not do it more than that 83 nights he finishes the Quran so do you think that his memory is okay doesn't buy it but I have my heart a smile not familiar with these with him in Hajj came to what have you know when hatch people are tired his companion said I prayed Asia in Aqaba behind the form of Ibrahim and after like a good my prayer I saw someone standing beside me and trained so I looked and I find I found it to be a Flandre fan he started with a decline mean that he could eat a burger on the field saw at the bottom and he concluded to saltiness in oaxaca he did not bring any other mucker from i shared affection the whole forehand look at the love of these people the Quran and look what it resulted in less than 10 years they had a whole state reaching from Asia to borders of you of Europe and the two ladies mmm empires fell under them because they abided by the piranha look at snow what coral do we can what what I do we know if someone says to you during their otherwise no I don't have to it's not mandated we're gonna work on this is know what you know it's that one bit it is but how long okay what do you know five six okay what's the meaning of coral darkness no mission the Ossipon in our yeah I know this is so the fun of what does it mean it's me so you don't know what you recited and you want to get closer to a larger not even knowing your book it is the only book on earth that has not been altered or changed for the past fifteen sessions and the language of the book is still used today and ours so we understand it it's not a dead language is still a living language and this is one of the miracles so the four hand without it you have a big problem among the reasons or the means of being fast among the reasons are the things that help us stay steadfast on Islam and make our hearts purified is following the Sunnah of the Prophet SAW service a large Allah says in the Quran say if you really love Allah and young helmet tell them if you really love Allah then follow me Allah will love you and forgive you for your sins so you have to follow the Prophet an interpreter you do not have a choice I've seen people nowadays being selective in the sense that they scan the Sunna versus wrong the beer yeah this is okay because people respect me if I'm gonna cues to please please broke the mirror being generous no I have to save money being brave I think it's better to be called coward one thousand times than being said about one time look at me yeah yeah yeah so they spending quality time with your kids I have better things to do so you're being selective no to be a proper Muslim to be a practicing Muslim you do not choose and take what you want and leave what you don't like them the whole Sunnah of the Prophet s son that is for your purification of the soul once you follow the Prophet a sample of loves you guys believe me if Allah loves you can anyone harden will ye know what that meant if Allah loves you can you ever feel depressed no one loves you the whole world serves you if you feel a lot a lot would make everything else afraid of you but if you feel others than allah allah would make you afraid of everything if you trust a lot a soldier Allah will make this whole world come to your service but you have to believe you have to love Allah so if you have to follow the Prophet I didn't saw it will serve unconditionally you have to follow him blindly and this is the biggest one of the biggest problems are around here and in the Arab world people think that yes this is Sunnah convince me convince you what should I kiss you without respect and go to hell I don't have time to convince you I tell you this is a psycho high this is like a Muslim this is Sunnah Buddha would tell me they decided manager in the prophetic this is a sign for Hari this is like a Muslim this is Sunnah Buddha would tell me the decided manager in the authentic hadith believe it then your practice news I don't have to convince you because the issue of convincing on the issue of logic you know give me a logic why this is how why I have to do this this goes against the principle of submission imagine you going to traffic on the street and there's a radar written and a traffic light and you cross and admire and they give you are fine and you go to listen know convince me that the whole area there was not a car in sight in five kilometers the answer there's no one no soul so why should I stop convince me what will he do you can this it put your jail for a number of days and then you'll convince I hope you didn't this is a huh this is unlike Islam Islam is total submission yeah fear the Prophet says this you do why less because I'm a little distracted me so I do without asking for justification or for the logic behind this and anyone who claims to love the Prophet an exercise without following him is a big liar if you love someone you obey him your father tells you son go and get me a glass of water you see that I love you so much I love you alive from all of my heart are you sitting down go and get me water to Allah he my father I do anything to please you I love you so much are you keep on with your PlayStation two or three or whatever Xbox with me and you don't go is he a person who loves no because a person who loves obeys if you love the Prophet a son you obey Him if you don't obey Him if you say that no this is not logical then you're not a proper lover to the Prophet is love yourself among the greatest means of being steadfast on Islam is drawn if you think that you don't need this if you think that you are saved from trials and tribulations that you don't make you run then you are among the biggest losers the prophet alayhi salaatu son that old shed a didn't house one of the companion he told him said that if you see people gathering gold and silver and making it as treasures in their houses so they are so much into this dunya they have gotten lots of money what should I do the Prophet said I said if you do this then have your own treasure and he said what is my own treasure and the Prophet said that is awesome you should say or ma this is your own treasure oh Allah I ask you for step sets fastness in this math emotions in Islam to be steadfast on Islam and I asked you for the resolve to adhere to the path of guidance so dua is the greatest means of being steadfast on Islam when you prostrate among American living for all that can be on a team and when you say it say it with fear and with hope feel that Allah soldier can any second flip our hearts I have friends close friends who used to be daddy's who used to have publication books sold in the until today and cassettes for the lectures we used to give footballs and lectures and so and so now may Allah have mercy on us all no beard smoking watching TV so under the ankles praying often on he came to meet once in my Masjid and I gave him advice after the whole and happy that he acted a little bit but it is human nature leadership is stronger than you you don't I took him online after the open to agree hurt we went being him alone and it was like 45 degrees centigrade after Truman I didn't extremely hot the guy we went to the graveyard he took off his sandals and he walked barefoot it I wanted to be any practicing stomata Catullus is too hot I'm staying up I can't I can't even walk and the guy stood there in front of an open grave no one was there was open for 20 minutes although he weeping I thought that he's not about crying so it is wrong the grader is crying crying and I said the guy is dead Tomas he's gonna better bury him and he came afterwards how did that felt cleansed felt so good but he couldn't go back again he's trying his best and I prayed a lot sir can you say me that Oh like I think about young women what la he he was one of the few that when he speaks that people do not utter a word so articulate so yet if you would much about in an Arabic in the Quran verses and then the hadith but all of a sudden nothing out of the blue so when you frustrate you ask Allah Ya Allah don't make me let those it's very easy it's only like 15 please Jill at first class that's it I'm like everybody else blendin easy but then I would lose my life I would lose this dunya I have only few years maybe few months Allah knows and then it's agenda and at WestEd I keep it so I'm afraid and that is why I have to supplicate make drop but a lot of them have a big my heart heart steadfast whenever I see myself falling a little bit into sin I have to react and sometimes you act harshly in the sense that to prevent myself from giving in from feeling weak because the minute you taste it you want some more and more and more until you end up like them Arizona presenters home to be steadfast you have to be on the straight path you have to be on this DePalma a las ocho says and verily this is my straight path so follow it and do not follow other paths for they will separate you from separate you away from his back I'm glad that has only one time there's only one survived so don't look at the different sects around the Prophet told us that there will be how many sects 73 all in all in hell except one one those who are on the same same time as I and my companions so the school of hanifa the school of chakra the school of magic the school of Hungary they're all in health right there's a part of the sex right no they are the same path of the Prophet and it's not for me these are not the sect's mentioned the sect mention are the grave worshippers those who believe in Saints and awliya those who do not recognize the attributes of Allah they say Allah does not live here Allah does not watch illogical does not speak so no economy they say the Quran is not all those words these are part of the deviance of course the deviant sex are so many and you can all know them by just looking at them those who follow the Quran those who follow the Sunnah they are on the straight path and among them the four schools of thought as long as the rakia is exactly as what the prophet has done has brought to us among the things that make you steadfast is remembering Allah ticket making dhikr now look and try to ponder on what runs into your mind when you walk from your house to the machine is it so kinda Allah or is it this mysterious singing and chanting and music and so a lot of the people because they listen 24/7 to music on the in your card well I I had people coming to my question an actor mother liberation prayer they came to me in session I have a problem see what he said whenever I go to bowing or prostrating before attitude instead of saying subhanAllah subhanAllah I start to sing so or at least our sets of heard are beings of hundred in problems what they said that's weird why is that and after an investigation he tells me that while I was coming to the Machine I was listening to FM radio and there was this song and I was listening to it it invades your heart these things invade your home you can't stop them and the heart is like a vessel you either fill it with good or if you add to it anything bad it was corrupted it's like having a rotten box of apples and you bring the best and freshest Apple in the world and you put it inside what will happen the whole box will turn into good apples I wish it will immediately corrupt and rot the good Apple and the heart is the same thing either you keep it only for Allah Allah and fill it with remembering up corrupt and rot the good Apple and the heart is the same thing either you keep it only for Allah object and fill it with remembering Allah or if you have other illnesses coming in other filth coming in it will corrupt your heart extremely the Prophet Allah said Nicholaw as erosion and he gave us an example it is your fortress from shape on you know personal hassle muslin the the origin book it's called fortress of the Muslim why why is it called this way because a prophet told us that Ali his thought was Sahab he said no Maryam told Zakarian I told ya he told them that Allah has instructed you to say five statements to the sons of Israel and Eve in any didn't so if you were not going to say humble you six if I don't deliver it then a lot of punishment is John please be upon in the prophet of Allah and the Prophet is telling us what are these five stations and one of them he said is it a large Dajjal advised me to instruct you to make dhikr to remember Allah why and because this is similar to a man who is running in the desert away from an enemy who wants to kill him and all of a sudden he found this great strong fortress and he went in and he locked himself in and the enemy is helpless now they cannot do anything to me likewise the prophets understand they cool but when you remember allah shaitaan does not come close to you what is the meaning of hotness in english it means a bigger national flatness this is a shape on you know whatever became Allah an English hotness I have with you I can find her Nass is the one when you remember Allah increase and when you forget he comes in this hadith of the Prophet as a service that Anna's at the heart if you remember allah he retreats and goes away the minute you neglect Amazonas remembers he invades your heart this is the Hannah's Canessa is to hide and retreat so this is what the prophet has some is telling us that remembering Allah knows of them yeah how many times do you say stuff for law predict how many times you taste some analogue pounding if you say it 100 times aloud forgive all of your sins even if they are as as the form of a seat so Panama will be handy 100 times what life takes less than females don't it takes less than three minutes but how many of us say it on the on the other hand how many of us use the F word or the S sort I think or the L F word it's like so Panama due to some they use it extensively and their hearts are so blasted it's so covered that they are unable to remember our last name and they'd rather say these bad things among the things that we have to try our best to acquire so that we are steadfast on Islam not hardness that fast is patience the prophecy lesson no one has been giving any favor of blessing of Allah so they are greater than patience it is the greatest gift of a large division imagine with it you become generous with it you become kind with you become tolerant with it you become loving your wife and children with patience you become able to tolerate any injustice that takes place on you and with patience and your heart is as big as an ocean if you're impatient well lucky you feel that you are living in a Pepsi can though you're living in a big mansion because you're not able to take it and patience is divided into three types as scholars saying patience on doing good deeds to prefetch your time you need to you have to have patience why should I leave my warm bed and the heater is not working and the water is cold and walk all the way to the mission when all the drunkards are walking and laughing and joyful to come and pray 2 rakaats and the amount graceful so Halima he prolongs the prayer he prays for more than 10 minutes Roger pray and they walk back home again you need a lot of patience to do the second type of patience is being patient on not doing sin ok this is very very tempting called it's Ramadan tempting a cigarette lying in and in the living room then just calling me to have a before to only a movie that is so glamorous and advertisement everywhere I go Sherlock Holmes I'd like to take a look at it it's tempting but when you have patience for memorization you say yeah then what I'm gonna end up in hell is it worth it not worth any sin that your soul calls you to just like that match and put your finger on top of it and just count from one to three if you can then see if it's worth it go ahead if it's not that help fire is 70 times greater than Earth's fire and it would have been enough to have earth fire over there the third type of patience is the greatest type of all which is meaning patients patient when unless tribulation with all those calamities when Alice testing before me this is the greatest allah azzawajal tests me in loss of money loss of health and loss of a loved one how would I react why me banged my head in the minute why not him I went was to a lender and my family may Allah have mercy on his soul he's not dead but he's dying he was like in his mid sixties it was sick so I went to him uncle Bella's it'll make it easy this is inshallah forgiveness for your sins this is my son I have no complaint only inquiry is I've been praying for a line that must for 14 years never missed the trail look what's happening to me well my neighbor for 40 years he I've never seen his face in the Masjid and he's as strong as a bull and I said uncle eat no complaints what are you gonna complain more than that you've notified one of your good deeds you're actually complaining to an objective oh why me not him subhanAllah 65 years old and seriously the guys it looks practising he prays in the machine in the first row that is my say Yamaha devil 400 the one who turns and fifths hearts 65 businesses like this I don't know how it's gonna end with him they're wiser than grant him guidance and make his life and on Islam and in the last few moments among the best things that would make you steadfast on Islam is to choose your company not the company working on choose your company who you go out with who you mix with if you are mixing yourself always with righteous people then all what you will hear from them is just like Allah here Baraka Buffy Allah have a philan a philan him on one one dick and they will call you to that church and they will go with you to the Masjid if they see you drink with your left is every second my ship and drinks with Georgia with his left so use your writing and so they always advise you to always correct you they always give you any good advice that would make you excel and with make you elevate in the level of image however if you choose the other company then you have a big problem because your friends always call you to go to the pub to have a smoke to skip prayers if you tell them I'm going to braise yeah he'll make dua Viktor big look over when you come back from the ball so they make you they intimidate you this time you will not go for Madison I don't want them to you know Mark about me and this is the peer pressure that we should advise our children to be aware of not to be bullied at at the same time to choose who they go with if he is much about your friend is half of Quran he he prays all the prayers in the Masjid he wants to go play football go ahead as long as you go with Mohammed Ahmed go ahead you're in safe hands you're not perfect either they have their own shortcomings come on they're not so hobbies but at the same time they are in safe hands Hashanah they will come always back to square number one so good company is extremely important so good company is extremely important the worst company I know of is the medium this you know devilish remote control since it takes you to Alice in Wonderland you see what's his name boss boys what was it was a horse and it takes you places it makes you gives you fantasy it makes you the strongest man in the world it makes you the best lover in the world that makes you the first person to draw and killing in blood it's a world of fantasy and the worst thing for your heart because it conducts your heart it brainwashes you without knowing so even the things that you used to think to be good it changes it to look bad and it changes people than society's not only Muslims even the non-muslims yet if you go to the Far East and I'm from Britain from the Far East if you go to the forest and 20 30 years ago ask them about the beauty of a woman they'll give you a description similar to what they have nowadays if you go to Africa you come to Europe if you go to Asia the beauty specifications different it's not the same it's it's one mold that they see and the beauty pageants and the movies and soap operas and it's bring washing us things that we used to consider to be taboo things that we used to consider to be forbidden nowadays it's okay don't be extremist what's wrong in this happening with that or this happening in here so this is among the greatest things that we should try to protect ourselves protect our children from because it corrupts the heart extensively and finally do not put yourself in harm's way never think that you have the strength and the Eman to stand in the face of tyranny or to stand in the face of temptation a lot of the brothers think that they are up to it the Prophet said Isis um if you hear the dead Jan if you hear the Antichrist do not stand in his face and run as far as possible because you never the process you never know one you've come to him with full of Eman and then you return from his court as an apostate do not trust yourself and trust your amen they can Anna I can't do this bring it on anything I can take it no do not go to that and I seek a large divisions guidance and help and I pray to Allah that he makes me a new steadfast on this game and to make us among those who propagate the deed and practice the game until we die so that we had would be privileged to have the companionship of the Prophet I saw something general model Anna was all emotional marketing chef and Martin and I would like to work us on behalf of you our great times to share share a seaman that came for taking time out to come I have he's just on the verge of getting a cold but does that gonna last a for that the shaman when it goes back to at blessed and sacred land that he shall a Calot us unto our forests the very essence of doing hard on us and itches like this is simply because that we need to remind each other time and time again the reasons that we bring different speeches is that maybe than one of the speakers that we listen to human traits are hardworking touches a thing that is very cursed to listen to us making us to think about things well I from the many sayings of the Shepherd since we've been here I think the entire Mahara was for me a fanfiction coming to the mission but it is the thing you take things from this so what you need to do is now try and take from this and benefit yourself try and do better because I think what many of the things that the chef said is no thought of it very simple things that we can do he's not asking you to go out and pay your thousands of pounds of sadaqa to go build the Masjid to go would you call it try and bring as many Muslims as you can but it is simple things that we can do in the comfort of our own home that we can remember last panel with had from time to time when we are sitting there that we remember last time father when we're at school when we're at work when we're on the road there's many occasions that there is nothing for us to do and we might get to use our times at with the things that the sheperson so char like powder we hope that the chef I know I keep harassing him on his mobile phone when I call him when he doesn't know me that much but he shall not we hope that in the future he accepts from us any invitations that we put to him and wherever whatever he's in London and whenever he's in London that he comes and visits us be either like a criminal if anybody has any questions inshallah and the chef is happy to take them busy lankan so there but merely can't do it no no no no this is from Shaitaan the brother is asking about that he is blessed from Allah that he wakes up for pleasure without any problems while people complain that they have problems waiting for father so he's afraid that he may be waiting for further because it's customs and his house he's been automatically doing it without intending and this is from Shaitan now no one wakes up he goes to the bathroom and makes water in this cold weather goes to the Masjid saying that this is customs you would find any excuse to skip this so this is definitely from shape on what you are doing is for the sake of Allah reviving your intention and for now and then for the sake of Allah by Jenna thinking of the reward the Prophet tells us our son whoever makes although in his house and goes to the Masjid only for the sake of praying in the message Allah would write to him with every step to the Masjid husana a good deed and he raised a bad deed and if he reaches the Masjid and this is mind-blowing not it is authentic sight of the opening and if he reaches the Masjid then finds out that the prayer is over is finished Allah would give him it's similar to the whole of their reward no mr. Fred a lot of the Muslims when they're home they say ok it's like five minutes for a farmer if I'm able to and I walk it's gonna be like 12 minutes so by the time I reach them is in the last rocker no I'll get a pickle so how long I mean this means that your intention is not pure go ahead if their prey prey on you when Allah would award you this and always by as I said contemplating in the reward the Prophet says as some whoever prays pleasure in German in Masjid Allah would register for him as if he prayed the whole night night rain from Asia to badger just for playing to rehearse Oh Roger in the machine and lots of the Muslims neglect this and I've been told in some messages that only three attend the prayer the more thing the Imam and the man who has the key for the machine I thought was a teeny or was it in I think and the Machine I know that I'm a man I remember the name of the message now is the only thing that was blast Nucky I think when the fattiness books in some like movie see when I asked the brother how many mashallah pray Fajr appear is in motion I said Dean Rose I was thinking that you talking about it and another person this is a disgrace yet if you are unable to maintain magic is very easy to be misguided because this is your we call it a narrative your capital Wasserman this is the capital that you're trading with if you don't have capital you have no choice what's your question make what made the woman made older didn't make what made the woman made who did it then ha someone has must have done it right who made this cup someone can it be done by itself No so the someone definitely has to be there so to make this world people are so perfect the world is so perfect so huge mountains beautiful vast oceans how many insects do we have gazillions and this is a number we have so many insects so many birds so many fish so many animals so many this and that look at that this world cannot be done by itself but it is so perfect that there has to be someone who didn't know who is this one I don't know he has to reveal himself to us I know that he is powerful I know that he's knowledgeable I know that he's wise I know that he is capable of doing anything he wants and a person or an entity with such description would not leave us alone would not create this perfect creation and let it be it would have to tell us what he wants from us and the purpose of our creation is like someone making this machine and puts it on the market and does not put a manual to it people would look at it the same oh it's a mirror it's a black mirror other sick people should know it's a cupholder nobody knows what it is and this is the same such perfection such a delicate thing definitely you have to bring a manual to it positive created this world and not only he gave us the manual he also sent someone to explain it to us and the Prophet Arabic mission or salesman descent of the Prophet at a salon to set up the perfect human being so they need anything that you see someone has to have unit if you break a glass in your house and your mother comes in who broke this how do I know that someone poking little me mm the glass is broken the glass is cut you have done it on your sister did it no maybe happy myself there has to be someone you want the long version of the short version because I'm always asked about this question now what is the ruling on product sort and Fatiha in prayer all consensus of scholars that it is mandatory for the individual and for the eminent they differ on the ruling of cravat and fatiha reading al-fatiha for the one who's praying behind any map and they said this issue of dispute Imam Abu Hari and Imam Abu Hanifa - if I sense that you don't read it at all imam abu sorry said you have to read it in every single raka and he said it should be dispute now she'll have a simultaneous merciless assault look at all the evidences not one to all of it incre and compile it and then ponder the father and said at the conclusion it is recommended to recite the factor for the person praying behind any man if the prayer is loud but if the pre-plan is silent it becomes a pillar its mandating because when the imam recites it as if i had recited it hadith of a becomes a female of vision and when he came to the machine and the Prophet was bowing position with his companions from the door he said how can I walk straight and the prophets vouches Allah and he bound and walked that way and then he was in the line in the room whenever the Prophet fish sauce on the phrases witness because if I did then the Prophet said may Allah increase you in your carefulness but do not do it again now Obama can adapt decide the Fatiha and the Prophet destiny go and make the prayer again which means that for the moon it is not mandatory it is recommended when the prayer is loud such as in the first two records of average Russia or the Torah cos of pleasure but in the silent regards it is magnitude now this is the most authentic opening coming back to your question in this that is leaving the gap between fatiha and surah we learn every single step of the fair from that is awesome who said pray as if you have seen me pray I haven't seen you pray profitable but your compan is it so I listened then gathered and compiled what they have reported about your prayer and I follow whatever they had said now when it comes to the gap there is no gap at all the prophet a son did not stop did not have a gap between fatiha and the soul the only gaps he had in the first chakra was then to look positions at the Tempe who hasn't decided in a Muslim word of Allah may Allah be pleased with and said o prophet of Allah do you see when you say Allah but and before you start hesitation what do you say in this short pose the prophesied by Allah I thought that no one would ask me except you very much because he knows that he's so keen on knowledge I thought that no I would you know snoop around except you and that is why he come he accompanied the practice for three and half years but he is the most among all of the companions in anything happy why because he was 24/7 with the Prophet just something to fill up my stomach that is it I don't need no new clothes or set of wheels or what I need is just food and the Prophet told him I used to say a llama boy Beniamino pyoderma the known and the last or the second pose is before he goes to record and that's a new play he mentions this in that in my saying that he does this so that he could take the breath you know after reciting the surah and you finished to make the video you walk about so this is a short post for this now leaving a gap between fatiha surah is unfounded there is no evidence to it one would say this does it say share song show doesn't in harem well we take our religions from the house will do respect any to them we take our religion from if they follow her if they don't follow it so what they are not the Companions of the Prophet Sunnah therefore they have no authority over what and what not to do so if you would like to be sanctified I should say okay you say it's recommended and that ma'am is not leaving a gap he finished the fact they started with oh so I hope so what should I do if I want to recite it if you want to recite - go ahead well he's inciting the surah you say I'm do none of you had me normally in a quick fashion but if not and you listen your prayer is completely better than functions of shortly start from Allah above alone hukum so allah or salam ala sayidina muhammadin wa ala he was like a shadow in Oh and emotion Oh"
