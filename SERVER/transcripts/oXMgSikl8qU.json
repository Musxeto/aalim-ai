  "title": "Visiting Dargah and seeking waseela from the dead - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed anis he says my question is what is the ruling on visiting a dargah or a draaga I think it's called dargah is it shirk because some people go there just for making duaa and they think that the person who is in the grave can help them and they also seek his vasila and when we ask them why are you doing this and then they say that he is a ladder towards allah azza wajal what is a dargah if I understand it correctly it's like a tomb of someone people think that he's a saint someone who is a righteous person close to allah azza wajal and they usually built on top of it a dome or a structure they light candles sometimes they slaughter sacrifices others may wipe it and wipe their bodies seeking Baraka on blessings others may go round it in circles like doing with the Kaaba in Tawaf etc so what's the ruling on this it is one of two either a person is going there thinking that this deceased can benefit us and can protect us from harm and we make duaa to him and we ask him for things that we would like to be done and we may sacrifice for his sake this is all shirk calling him is shirk asking him is what do you mean by sheer shirk is associating others with Allah Allah mentioned in two eyes in the Quran in Allah Allah Allah futile I use Raqqah be he allah as allah does not forgive people that associate others when with him so this is as they say the cardinal sin the most aeneas sin that Allah does not forgive so if a person goes to dargahs and call the dead or ask them to benefit him or the likes this is Schick and he's out of the fold of Islam even if he prays five times a day panics Hajj give zakat fast Ramadan because he associated others with Allah thinking that this person in his grave hears us and answers our supplication then he is a mushrik likewise there is a famous story that a person said that for ten years have not been having any children and I'd like to have a child with my wife so one told him ask Allah he said I've been doing Ramallah every week nothing happened so then he said okay in this case go to the grave of a Husein so he goes to the grave of Husein he writes a paper and he throws it and he asks and her saying for an offstring in nine months his wife is giving birth to a child what is this this is a test from Allah so this man did not trust allah azzawajal so allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala prevented him from having a child when he went and associated others with allah and he completely gone out of islam he was again tested with a child to test his a man and he flunked the test the second type are those who goes to Darla's and they know that this that person has nothing to do for them they have no power but they believe that doing doing near that grave is blessed and Allah answers it so the ask Allah thinking that the door here is Baraka and they may also touch the sand thinking that it is Baraka not thinking that the deceased can harm or benefit them by no means so scholars say that they or even go round it in rounds like Tawaf Kaabah believing in Allah Azza WA JAL not in the DC scholars say that this is a major sin and it's considered to be minor shirk and it is indeed means to major ship because usually 1% maybe one over a thousand of the people who go there do not believe in the deceased the vast majority believed that this peer or this mallanna or this willy-willy Allah is the one who controls the universe and has the ability to do what we want him to do which is shirk so the second type is means to shirk and it's minor shirt but it is indeed one of the major sins of Islam and Allah so JAL knows best we"
