  "title": "If imam breaks his wudu after fateha, does the new imam & followers repeat fateha? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um if a single person is leading his woman in the prayer and breaks his wudum after finishing the recitation of the Fatiha then he leaves to redo his abortion but somebody joins him without being there for the Fatiha should that person start where the Imam left off or recite the Fatiha again for himself that person when he joined the Imam who had already recited the Fatiha his Fatiha has been done by his Imam so when the Imam broke his wudu and left and this person either became an Imam to those behind him or he's on his own he continues his prayer regularly and normally which means that he doesn't have to repeat the fact how he repeats he recites another Surah and goes for prostration for Bowing and continue his prayer Allah Knows Best"
