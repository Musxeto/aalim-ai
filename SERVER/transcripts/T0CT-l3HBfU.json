  "transcript": "uh my question if uh if I would be praying by myself and I follow it up with the sun after but by myself do I then also have to move to a different spot or does that not is it not necessary anymore by myself okay so basically speaking the Hadith stated in regards of J prayer as in theith of mu sufyan and else and others and also in congregational prayer and in general praying the F so all these hadiths they state that if I pray F whether in or or alone and I want to offer after the F Sunnah prayer I either have to speak to someone or change the position this is only after praying the so yes you have to go a little front or back or to the right or to the left if you want to pray the Sunnah"
