  "title": "Giving charity and helping Non Muslim friend vs Poor Muslims - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "son says that his mother has a Christian friend and she's asking him that is his mother to help the daughter of this Christian friend to go to school and he is telling his mother that there are so many needy people in Pakistan and elsewhere Muslims that we could help them instead and you're right in what you're saying because the priority always comes to the Muslims and we do not compromise with this our allegiance regardless of your nationality to Islam so anyone who's in need as Muslims we have to first prioritize him or her rather than giving the money or the help to non-muslims and this goes without any questions if you have a Muslim if you have a brother would you help the stranger when your brother is in need definitely not then this would be insane nevertheless helping this Christian friend or her daughter by giving her money is permissible in Islam no one says that this is a sin but it's an issue of prioritizing these spend atures in according to what would benefit you and your mother best secondly your mother should refrain from taking a non-muslim as a friend as a close friend as a confidant as someone who she gives allegiance and enjoys sitting with because this is not part of the Muslim etiquette we respect them yes we deal with them nicely yes but we don't take them as close friends and allies and Allah knows best"
