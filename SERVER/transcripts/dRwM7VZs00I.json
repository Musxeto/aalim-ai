  "title": "Masjid gives fajr adhan / athan a few minutes before actual time, is it permissible? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah [Music] in order to be able to judge such a situation I would say that you have to be one of two either you are a person sitting in the wilderness in an open area where you can look towards the east and recognize when the actual true Fajr appears when the white thread separates the darkness of the night from the daytime and in this case if you're able to do that and you hear the Adan being called two or three minutes earlier this Adan is invalid and not correct because you cannot give the adhan announcing that the time is due and that the break of dawn is due unless it is actual which is not but as you will wait until the Adan is over and usually after two and three minutes of the Adan the time is actually due you can go and pray in the Masjid the prayer is valid the second man whom you may be is someone who's dependent on the apps so he sees that the app says that the prayer of Fajr is due at 503. and he hears the Adan at five o'clock so he judges that the app is valid and the Adan is invalid and this is not correct because the Advan Isa ibada is a form of worship and we as Muslims are obliged to Trust the person giving the Advan whether he's doing it right or wrong as long as we don't have any proof so I'm not obliged every time he gives the adhan of Maghrib before I break my fast I'm not obliged to go outside and look at the sunset with the sunset or not yet because the prophet Allah made then a form of an announcement for us Muslims and he told us that the person giving the Adan in Arabic is called he's entrusted with this responsibility given to him so we trust him he calls that we break our fast when the sun sets he calls Adam we refrain from eating at the break of the dawn so I hope this clarifies the issue a little bit brother for us"
