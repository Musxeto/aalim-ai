  "transcript": "as for the second question the the brother is asking about the number of different religions why is that well nowadays you tell me you have a group of 10 each one believes in something else not necessarily a religion but they have their own ideas because human nature differs so each one would come up with an opinion with a scheme with an idea and he Embraces it and he calls people to it not necessarily religion so if we agree on that then it would be only natural that Allah the almighty would reveal his religions To His prophets and Messengers each in due time and for a specific nation and after that Allah would obate this and would send another messenger with a new religion until this reaches the religion of Islam where the Allah the Mighty sent his final messenger and he gave him the final Revelation and that is the Quran which has not been changed all the other books and religions no one can claim that this is their sacred book that has not been touched or unchanged the only book on Earth that can claim this for 15 centuries without changing one sentence one letter one word in it is the Quran therefore all the other religions they have the right to claim that their religion is the religion but as intellectual people we ourselves have to go and put these religions through the acid test so that we could know is this a divine religion does it have the answers to all the questions of humanity throughout the or throughout time and through different places or is it limited to a certain period of time or does it it does not tackle the spiritual the physical the economical the political needs of people we have to as intellectual people segregate between these religions and look into each one of them to know which is the most authentic the most accepted by Allah that is the final and perfect religion and then follow it I claim as a Muslim that Islam is and I'm ready to challenge anyone who says otherwise challenge them peacefully in the sense that I have an objective in life I know what Allah wants from me I have the Quran and the Sunnah that controls every single thing in my life and I don't need clergymen or priests to come and tell me how to worship God this religion is not revealed and it was not sent only to be practiced by professors and doctors this religion is sent down by Allah the almighty for all of humanity so the man the janitors the doctors the drivers the engineers the pilots the teachers the students the children the women the handicapped everybody can practice Islam and can understand Islam and can find the benefit physically and uh uh uh emotionally and mentally in this great religion of Allah and Allah Knows Best"
