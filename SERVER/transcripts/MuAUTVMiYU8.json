  "transcript": "Abdallah again from UK Salam alaikum Santo ma shake my second question I need to add something as well change that to brothers I sitting let's say a example two brothers are sitting in the Masjid and I go to the first pad on the right I gave him the salaam he replaced me and I give the second brother on the left assalamu alaikum he's extend his hand face the Salwa alaikum Salaam but he does not look at me he looking at the brother because he's on a conversation he just say walakum ceremony continues talking so he does not look at me this is my question if that because I found it bitter or then rude like why does he not looking at me he just give the Salam request the Salam extends his hand but does not look at me that's why I asked the question why did you do this so I wanted to clarify on this okay brother Abdullah is question is clear so he goes to the Masjid he gives Salam to the first person assalamu aleikum the guy replies waalaikumsalam he gives salaam to the second person who does not look at him so yes he shakes hands or they come Salam and he's looking elsewhere so brother Abdul is saying that this is route and I agree with you this is route but it is not prohibited and he we have to be always not apologetic but we have to always care for others I don't know what the brother has in his mind what problems are burdening his shoulders I don't know if he is having a fight with his wife or his child is in the hospital or he is overburdened with that or any other reason so I always give brothers and excuse I pardon them so as long as he replied to my Salam verbally and he shook my hands even if he did not look at me so what people usually Abdullah would take positions against those who interrogate in question and make them feel uneasy so when someone says check I spoke to you that day and you were not very happy speaking to me sure I was talking to you and you were answering someone else people who interrogate me and keep on asking me questions like this I would rather stay away you don't want this you'd like to be the kind of person that everyone loves you everyone cares for you everyone loves to sit and talk to you but if you put people under pressure why didn't you look at me when I said so now why was your hand so soft and not a tight grip maybe you don't want to shake hands with me maybe you are racist do you think that I am from this ethnicity or that and you think no of me or you look down at come on I have like a gazillion people I can befriend with and you're making this trouble for me please keep your distance and stay away from me so we don't want to reach that limit and may allah azza wa jal expand our hearts to our Muslim brothers and sisters this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you fear Manila what Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
