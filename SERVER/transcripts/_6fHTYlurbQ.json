  "transcript": "I have a question so according to a Hadith when you wake up when you wake up late or F it's and you miss it because Shan urinate in your ear right and since urine is n do we need to purify our ear and make before we we can pray again uh if you can see it yes if you have to of course definitely but if you can't see it how will you purify it use your imagination you use your mind the Hadith first of all is in and it's an issue of dispute whether it is related to fer prayer or to night prayer and if it is related to fer prayer the urine of Satan is not physical you cannot see it so if you say to yourself no it's NES I have to wash it okay keep on washing it till when till no sh that's that's a lot of time so why how do you know that was removed maybe there's something left and this is what Shan does to you and he messes up with your head like this so ignore it and move on"
