  "transcript": "an anonymous person says I'm married but have not done Rosati yet Rosati in Aldo means consummating the marriage so the contract is done she's his wife but they have not consummated the marriage she has not moved into his house permanently he says they are saying his in-laws after one year you can take your bride home due to their personal family issues my question is till that time can I have intimacy with my wife using contraceptives using condoms first of all as long as this is the agreement between the two families in you agree to that you have to honor and respect it she is your wife the moment the contract has been signed you had the right to say no I demand to take my wife tonight or next week or next month or next year this is up to you because you agreed to postpone the consummation of marriage for a full year you have to honor that as long as she is with her father's responsibility and in his house he provides for her financially you are not obliged to do anything or give her anything however for you to consummate the marriage not publicly but between you and your wife totally legit totally halal you're not sinning you're not fornicating you're not doing anything wrong she's your wife you could talk to her you can touch her you can look at her no problem however we have customs to respect so people know that she has not consummated marriage and after three months she's got a baby what is this people would accuse her of something that is not honorable her father would be feeling like he was stabbed in the back so generally speaking you should not have any intimacy with your wife until you get the green light from the father how is that possible I'm too shy to ask well if if her father says to you come and spend the weekend in our home and they allocate a room for you and for your wife to sleep in what what greener light are you looking for you have you must be color blind if you don't see this but if they are careful not to leave you guys for too long alone and every like 5-10 minutes someone knocks on the door do it like send drinks like some juice like some food like what is this it's an open buffet kalasa don't know what anything you get the feeling that they don't want anything to happen so that it would not tarnish their reputation and the reputation of your wife therefore you have to play it safe you can always demand that listen I'm not gonna wait for a year I want my wife and I want it ASAP my house is ready it's furnished I'm financially capable then inshallah things would progress behave Milla"
