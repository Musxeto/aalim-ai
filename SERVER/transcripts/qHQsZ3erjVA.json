  "title": "Can we play Video Games that have female characters? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says can we play video games where there are characters of females video games are games if there is no music in it if there is any nothing haram in it it becomes okay but unfortunately nowadays video games are so real that you see female characteristics characters who are more beautiful than reality itself they hand pick them and hand draw them that they are seductive that you can't take your eyes off them and this is why probably you lose all the time you should watch so such characters are haram to watch and just being a cartoon doesn't make it halal so there are porn by cartoons would that make it okay to watch definitely not so you said that they covered their aura yes but if you're talking about in a general uh um tense if these women are not actual women and they don't show their figure how uh um their wastes and measurements are portrayed they're just like a mario kart for example yeah the girls there are girls like they're not women so i don't think think that this is a problem but when it comes to mortal combat or the likes where you have real live character characters in front of you this is not permissible"
