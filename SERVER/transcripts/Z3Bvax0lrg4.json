  "title": "Wanted to feed the poor every day in Ramadan but they need cash more, can I now give them cash?",
  "transcript": "she had the intention of distributing 50 sandwiches a day to the poor in her locality which is a very good uh notion and like sophiana theory used to say ramadan is feeding the food and reciting the quran he means that these are the two prominent things that happen in ramadan and unfortunately our neighbors next door neighbors are starving to death and we are having like eight or ten courses and we are stuffed with food to the extent that we are unable to pray tell away and this is wrong so she has a noble idea and she thought of doing that which is good now the problem is that when she contacted her hometown they told her that there are so many people who are in dire need so she thought that okay can i change the the money that i'm paying for the 50 sandwiches can i pay them cash to these people who are in need the answer is yes because you did not vow you did not promise allah this was an intention you can go back on your intention anytime you want"
