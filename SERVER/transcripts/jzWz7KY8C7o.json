  "title": "Muslims who are Racist towards black people! #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so in light of the Hadith of about B um in regards to racism um there a lot of racism um against uh black people everywhere and that's okay because you know people are ignorant but when racism comes from the Muslims and it is very natural to disl someone that is ring towards your ethnicity how do we deal with the fact that these are Muslim ority have to love our brothers and sisters the racism is right in your face at the same time of course without any doubt the mistake coming from a non-muslim is far less in gravity than when this mistake happens from a Muslim if a Muslim gives a derogatory comment or a racist comment this is far greater than a non-muslim doing the same because a non-muslim has no boundaries they don't have any things uh to restrict them while Muslims have their beliefs have Quran have Sunnah have the fear of Allah unfortunately your fingers are not the same length they're not alike and likewise Muslims there are Muslims who are practicing there are Muslims who are practicing but not fully there are Muslims who are not practicing and there are Muslims who are not Muslims except by name so we as individual uals have to rise up and not be affected by such negative comments as I always always always say when you're walking down the streets and a dog starts to bark at you you will never fall on your hands and knees and bark back because you're a human being you're not a dog so when such specimens of people people treat you in a racist fashion it kills them softly when you pay no attention to their comments or their racist uh um rhetoric or their behavior if you turn the table on their heads and when they make such racist comments you reply by making a joke it will kill them because they were expecting and anticipating a negative reaction you becoming angry you're cursing them or saying bad things about them when you make fun of it and you laugh or you simply ignore it kills them softly so be the better person and ignore the dogs that bark"
