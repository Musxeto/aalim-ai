  "title": "Prostration of recitation (Sujood at Tilawah) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "that know that the prostration for the person reciting the Quran was known as SuJu to tell our a prostration of the very cetacean is obligatory and man and a footnote here it is not neither obligatory non-mandatory so this is a correction that you have to understand it is highly recommended but it is not mandatory or obligatory upon the person reading the Quran and passing by a verse that includes a recitation frustration so if someone is listening to a person recycling the Quran and he passes by this ayah the answer would be that yes it is not recommended for the listener to prostrate unless the email or the the person reciting prostrates himself so for example someone is sitting next to me and he recites a ayah of frustration and he said and he prostrates so as a listener I'm listening tentatively to him it is Sunnah for me to prostrate but if I don't there's nothing wrong in that now if he recites and does not prostrate it is not recommended for me to prostrate it is not soon enough for me to prostrate and likewise if I'm listening to the radio it is not part of the Sunnah for me to prostrate once I hear the eye being recited now"
