  "transcript": "allah says can a woman get breast implants breast implants one would think that this is a contemporary thing and we have to give it some thought it's not a contemporary thing at the time of the prophet one of the companions if i'm not mistaken his name is arfajah had lost his nose during war due to injury he had them make him a nose of silver but as we know silver when it's get in contact with water or moist it changes color and gives a bad odor so the prophet ordered him alessa sam to take a nose made of gold so such implants were at the time of the prophet and this is why scholars have come to a verdict saying that such implants if the reason of it is to remove a defect or an abnormality or to restore what is normal then this is permissible and this is why it is permissible to have a crown or to implant a tooth those who are getting bald and want to transplant hair this is okay women who have a defect like they're flat they have their chest identical to men's there are no curves and their husbands are turned off due to breastfeeding due to natural causes such abnormality such a defect can be changed with such implants providing and this is extremely important that it is medically safe so it would not cause in cancer or any other diseases because of these implants and this goes for the whole body even the rear the buttocks if a woman can face problems of not being normal like normal women now this is different to a woman who would like to increase the size so that her beauty would be more she's normal or she's beautiful but she wants to be shockingly beautiful this is haram because this is altering the creation of allah azza without a legitimate reason someone who has six fingers wants to remove the sixth one to look normal this is totally uh a permissible someone who has a big big huge nose that people mock and laugh at him and he feels inferior and he's always depressed and it's really bad no problem in downsizing it and having cosmetic surgery for such a purpose and a larger knows best"
