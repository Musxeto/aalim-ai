  "transcript": "verse states that verily good deeds days bad deeds and this is exactly what came in the hadith of the Prophet that is a lot son when he advised one of his companions to fear Allah wherever he is and to follow every bad deed that he does with a good deed so that it would erase it so this means that if you do something bad and you repent to Allah and you feel remorse immediately do something that is good for example if you look at a woman with a bad look and usually all forms of looking at women is a bad look so you immediately go and pray 2 rakaats or give 10 riyals as charity or say something that is good or ask allah for forgiveness then this would erase it with the grace of allah"
