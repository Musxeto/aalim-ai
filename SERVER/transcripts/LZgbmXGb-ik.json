  "transcript": "shift keep permissible to use the voucher which we get from the Google pay app to to use what vouchers voucher yes how does it work like yeah for instance per person an amount of money you'll get a reward when we scratch it it may be something related to uh mini coaches like so so if I understand you correctly Google may have an app where you can transfer money to other people and this app usually saves you money because you transfer for example a thousand rupees and they send a thousand rupees to brother Abdullah but in the process they'll give you a voucher on Uber eat or a cash back of five rupees and this is permissible inshallah there is nothing wrong in getting cashbacks or a voucher when you don't have to pay any prescription it's just transferring money from one place to the other there's no problem in that Nilda"
