  "title": "Ruling on Facing or Giving your back to the Qibla in the Toilet / Washroom - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what is the ruling of facing or giving the back to the qibla in the bathroom there are seven to eight different opinions of scholars as mentioned by al-imam shah khani in his beautiful book nail altar and other scholars as well without going into details the hadith is obvious that it is prohibited said that we went to syria and we found that the bathrooms were built in the direction of a kaaba so we used to tilt and seek allah's forgiveness so that we won't be facing or giving back to the qibla the most authentic opinion is that it is prohibited to face and gives you back to the qibla when you are in the open where you are outdoors and if you are indoors there's a barrier there's a wall in front of you then this is not prohibited yet it is not recommended there are scholars who said it is totally prohibited to give you back or to face the qibla while answering the call of nature whether you're indoors or outdoors but it seems that it's more likely to be permissible indoors especially if you have nothing to do with it you were forced to be in such a situation you're not the one who built it of course building it intentionally while knowing that is sinful and allah knows best"
