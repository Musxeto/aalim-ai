  "title": "Is there a hadith that the closer we are to the imam, the more reward we get? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what about I got you from what I heard that it's a the moral the more closer to the emap the more reward is but and then uh the thing is there's like this one brother I was talking to and he said there was like like no Hadith about it or anything and he said that it could be an innovation and because like I believe something that there was no Hadith about so I was just like asking like is there any Hadith about this because I'm kind of like confused about it are you asking about physically being close to the Imam while you're praying in congregation yes of course the closer a person to the Imam the higher the reward is and this is mentioned in a number of Hadith one of them is the famous Hadith of Friday jumwa where the Prophet says whoever uh wakes up early and takes a good clean bath and walks to the Masjid and does not ride and gets closer to the Imam and listens unlike those who sit at the back uh Rose just to lean on a pillar or a wall the prophet says and uh gets close to the Imam and listens so the closer a person is to the Imam the better it is for the worshiper and Allah knows best Muhammad"
