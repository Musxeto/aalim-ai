  "transcript": "to clarify one thing you've we you've mentioned that um the issue of strength and so on we know that the sahaba radhiallahu participated in in spreading the deen and and they had battles uh people like waleed were champions of islam abu dhan and others so do we say is his strength not part of masculinity or is it separate or how does it work when we engage it against some of the examples of the sabbah such as khalid or hamza who were known for this skill and this this attribute first of all strength is not physical because you get arnold schwarzenegger and he's not a muslim may allah guide him to islam i mean he's just one of the the strongest who used to be one of the strongest but he's strong but not a muslim and you get someone like abdullah ibn masroot who could barely do anything so does this shed some doubt doubt under iman no one then masculinity no if you look at hassan no he is one of the three poets of the prophet he used to be encouraged by the prophet sallam to give poetry and he said and say to them your poetry that would criticize them because it's more severe on them more harsher than throwing the arrows yet he never fought in a single battle everyone knew that he's so weak in fighting physically right but he could do something that would benefit islam so with the grace of allah it's not one mold it's not a clone that we all have to be in the same shape everybody has to be uh masha'allah articulate and talkative and give speeches no no no it differs from one place to the other now is it a plus well allah says allah says prepare to the enemies of allah whatever you can from strength so we are encouraged to be strong not to be violent so it's a strength without violence to be physically fit to be intellectually fit this type of strength is highly recommended in islam but it is not something to be blamed if a person does not have it in him masala masala"
