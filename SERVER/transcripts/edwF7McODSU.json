  "transcript": "the next question what is the best book to study or books of to stud as well as you there isn't any such thing as the best she who's the best scholar in our times there is no ranking of the scholars okay we have the Billboards now for this week the best is and number two on the list is with his latest hist we don't have this everyone has something in him every has something that stands out there isn't something that okay let's go into an MMA fight and see which sheh is stronger it's not like this likewise in books of when you talk about and you ask what's the best book in a this means you don't know a because what are we going to talk about this is a part of or are we going to take talk about the six pillars of Iman the belief in Allah the day of judgment the Angels Messengers uh scriptures and the uh uh Divine decree or are we going to talk about this and that there are so many things it's it's a wide spectrum of Sciences and knowledges knowledge so the the question itself shows that you're not serious you want fast food what's the biggest cheeseburger no l us hold the man Mayo you don't do this you go and seek knowledge the best of all is the Quran without any doubt then you learn the then you learn the books of whether of or depending on your level sometimes you have to start and this is what I always advise my uh uh friends with the first thing you should start with is the beautiful names of Allah before everything anything because you need to know who you're saying allahar and I always say this in my lectures if you ask people how many names does Allah have you say 99 Names mashallah masallah how many names do you memorize from them power is out so the best of them would say 1520 she good for you how many of this 15 or 20 do you know the meaning of said whoops two or three everyone knows this Surah what's a 99% of the Muslims said beats me you recite it 20 times a day at least and you don't know what's a it's one of Allah's names I don't know I have no clue so we have a problem when you don't know Allah who's you worshiping and this is the the most important science in the world is the science of Allah's beautiful names and attributes because the importance of the science is related to the importance of what you're studying and you're studying the names of Allah so again I hope this answers your question"
