  "transcript": "Allah if you come to janaza and you perform taiyam while there was a possibility for you to make wudu meaning that the water is maybe five ten minutes away then your prayer is invalid because is a substitute when there is an inability to use water either because it does not exist within the vicinity and the time of the prayer would be over by the time I reach it or because my inability to use it due to severe cold that would harm me or kill me or due to an injury that would harm me or delay my recovery but if neither reasons is there then I cannot perform to Emma and the prayer is invalid"
