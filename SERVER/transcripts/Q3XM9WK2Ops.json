  "transcript": "so some people make videos in front of Kaaba like okay wait wait wait some people make videos in front of the Kaaba yeah yes it is not for educational purposes or for motivating Muslim it's like I take Talk video like I want to know what's your uh take on people making such videos in front of first of all my take is that people should devote their work for the sake of Allah azzawajal I go to Mecca I go to Medina do you see me ever posting pictures of myself and well I'm taking omrah oh this is a Masjid of the Prophet Allah no why don't I do such things don't I like people saying good comments and say masha'allah may Allah bless you share you are a righteous share that no everybody likes to be praised this is human nature but you don't want to spoil your good deeds by showing off So when you say alhamdulillah Allah blessed us with doing blah blah blah you may claim that I'm doing this to encourage people to do hamrah and this is between you and Allah I'm not going to judge you my take is I don't have to encourage people through through showing them that I did umrah because they also when I go to a Hilltop where the Sun is setting I do take selfies and say look at the beautiful sunset look at this look at that and every moment of my life is being shared on social media why all what I want is attention or to be followed or to have likes or to be famous and recognize and remember this is one of the doors for shaytan it corrupts a lot of people's hearts so I would say refrain now if you're doing this as a tutorial okay I have many followers so I want to show them how to make umrah this is once in a lifetime no problem but every time you go to umrah you take selfies I'm drinking zamzam look I'm squatting while drinking zamzam this is the Kaaba this is oh look at this man he's praying he's reading the Quran this is inappropriate it takes the spirituality out of the uh of the heart in addition to the fact that sometimes you also may be doing a problem when you're photographing people without their consent and this happened to me a number of times I did not give my consent to people to take my photos and publish it and I don't like this and I don't endorse it so it is inappropriate unethical to do such things and Allah Knows Best"
