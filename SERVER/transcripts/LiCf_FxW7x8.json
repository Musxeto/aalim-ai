  "transcript": "I stay in bahin and there is an Islamic Bank by the name of albaraka bank which is 100% Islamic now they have some um system where if we put our money in fixed deposit uh so if you fixed deposit for 6 months they give you 4% or 4 and a half% based on your amount so is it uh is the percentage fixed on the capital meaning you will get if you put your uh money for 6 months we will give you 4% of this uh 100,000 din you put is it fixed the 4% I mean yes sir yes sir is it fixed yes it is fixed like if I give 100,000 they will give me 4.5% this is totally riba and it's totally Haram to deal with such a bank any fixed amount of money which is the percentage because you said 4.5% of the capital not of the profits the profits is no problem because we don't know what the profit would be it can be five Dirhams Dinars it can be 5 million Dirham Dinars there's no problem in setting a percentage over the profit but when someone says give me €100,000 and after 6 month I will give you back € 104,000 meaning 4% over the capital invested this is complete riba total riba so regardless of what the bank's name is or what they're doing or they're claiming to be 100% Halal if it's like what I said to you it is totally Haram to invest with them"
