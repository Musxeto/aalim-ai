  "transcript": "foreign what's the ruling for the wife and the children to benefit from his earnings he's bringing food he's bringing money he's giving it to his family it's an issue of dispute among Scholars some say this is Haram money they cannot use it or utilize it some say no it's fine totally fine they can use it as long as it's not stolen if the earning is Haram due to the means of earning it but not the actual money as in stolen goods then he is sinful for his earning but the money itself the dollars the banknotes are Halal wants they're transferred to buying goods or giving it to his kids and wife third opinion is that you can consume whatever is needed and whatever is Surplus from your need you must refrain from that now this is something between you and Allah what you would like to choose it's up to you Don't force me to follow what you think is best or is more cautious or um this or that this is your opinion stick with it you feel Allah azzawajal don't take anything up to you my own preference and opinion is that I support the second opinion which states that if the earning is through Haram means he works in a bank deals with interest he sells Haram stuff like Media stuff or cigarettes or the likes the earning the means that he's earning from is Haram his income is Haram for him but once he exchanges hands with this income he gives it to his wife he buys food he buys a house it's because comes Halal for them all to keep as heirs or as in his life this is what I am convinced of and this is the most authentic opinion now you don't like this opinion and you think that it's best it's safer to not take anything go through you go ahead with it but don't condemn others who don't share your opinion"
