  "transcript": "Enron says we do not have female sections in our message when we urge the administration to open up female section they look at us as if we have committed some major sin by requesting this can you please throw some light on this and run I don't know seriously what kind of conviction these people have it is very sad when you have a board of directors or the administration of a Masjid running it and they have zero knowledge about Islam the only reason they're running the Masjid is because they most probably financed building it and they know the wealthy whom they can milk for money in order to maintain the Masjid now having said that it is essential that we do not appoint people in our businesses in our administrations in our organizations in leadership positions except those who combine both religious and administrative abilities when you appoint someone in the administration of the Masjid and he doesn't know or he does not possess the proper knowledge about Islam he'll shoot from the hip he'll come up with ideas that go against Islam and he thinks that whoa this is a beautiful PR gimmick I'm doing this for the reputation of the Masjid let's host a Sunday sermon what are you doing so no no this is good for the interfaith dialogue a sermon in the Masjid Sunday sermon so you get catastrophes from such administration such people are ignorant they should not be allowed to lead the Prophet said allah√≠s allot wassalam do not prevent women from attending the Masjid and their prayer in their homes is better for them so the Prophet clearly alayhi salatu was-salam stated that it's sinful to prevent women from praying in the Masjid and the administration in the subcontinent prevent women from praying in the masculine this is sad they're going against the religion of Allah even Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father Abdullah have no madam no hoppip he's the narrator of the hadith do not prevent women from attending prayer in the Masjid so once he was saying this hadith in the presence of his son Bilal out of jealousy when Bilal heard this hadith do not prevent women from attending the prayers in message he said by Allah we will prevent them even Omar was outraged he cursed him and swore bad words against him that no one had ever heard even oh mercy and he's saying to him I tell you the Prophet said do not prevent women from attending praying in the message and you say I will prevent them by Allah I will never speak to you again go away and don't let me see your face his own flesh and blood until the day of even homers death and his son is trying his level best to seek his father's forgiveness father by Allah I intended only good when I said what I said because we've seen what women had done by going out not wearing the proper hijab by doing this by doing that I didn't mean to defy the prophets instruction or to deny it Salah Lahari or Salam but I was impulsive and I said the wrong word please forgive me and his father would turn his face to the wall and not speak to his son until he died this is how the companions may allah be pleased with them valued the commands of the poor of the prophet alayhi salatu salam so when such administration comes and says that no we will not open a section for the women to come and pray in and they look at you as if you are crazy they don't know what they're doing they're rejecting the instruction the command of the prophet alayhi salatu salam may Allah protect us you"
