  "transcript": "assalamo alaikum wa rahmatullah and welcome to with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman I be your host for the show thank you for being with us we're looking at how we can make sure that as we live our lives as Muslims that we stay with the Prophet that means following the Sunnah that he left behind for us to follow in particular we're looking at the relationships that he had with the people around him interactions and how we can follow that example our guest is Sheikh awesome al Hakim thank you for being with us from Saudi Arabia Salam alaikum and welcome ye come said I'm gonna hold a lawyer or care to and does that mean okay for having me thank you if you look forward to a great discussion with you our subject today we are gonna be talking about the grandchildren of the Prophet peace be upon him there were not many grandchildren only two very well-known figures in Islamic history Hasan and Husayn can we start by confirming that a very unfortunate series of tragedies the Prophet endured regarding his children dying burying many of his children and as a result of this this is the reason that there's only two grandchildren that he left behind him didn't let him behind I mean sallallahu wasallam of Alucard I have the yellow suit I mean nabina muhammad invalid he was obvious me I'm a bad first of all this is one of the misconceptions among the Muslims that the Prophet Aleph Sam had only at Hasan and Husayn to his grandchildren okay he actually had more so from Fatima who was his beloved daughter and Ali who was his cousin he had al-hassan he had Alassane he had Morrison and he had 2.2 granddaughters where uncle zoom and Zeynep Uncle Tom was married to Robin hobb who was way older than her and her father you he wanted to have a marital relationship with the descendant of the Prophet aerosol salam and Zeynep was married to of the line jaw from the vitaly her cousin if i'm not mistaken then the Prophet Isis Iran had from his daughter zaynab bint mohammed he had oh mama and he had Abdullah so he added that is oh mama the daughter of hablas and Ali the son of a blasts and the Prophet had from raha his daughter that was married to earth man one son and his name was Abdul and he died when he was six years of age so in total these are the grandchildren of the Prophet SAW Salam well none of them is a hasson Hussain uncle tomb for her marriage to Omar and oh mama for the hadith swear the Prophet a son used to carry her and pray and lead the prayer while carrying her and other hadith as well hmm okay great thank you for clarifying that and just to follow up in terms of those grandchildren that survived did they all survive meaning he didn't have to bury any of the grandchildren he had to bury some of them I see and there are authentic hadith where for example the son of ropey and earth man the Prophet asaram buried some of his grandchildren and he was also in Sante Cadiz he held one of his grandchildren while he was dying until he died and he wept so Lala Selim and some of the Companions even pointed this out to him and say you cry hmm this is a minor people somehow shocked yeah a sign of weakness yeah and the Prophet said no son this is a sign of mercy so men do cry because this is human nature he was solo song was a real man yeah we've got to talk actually about mercy a little bit later so thank you for bringing that up one part of Islam if we look at the Sun we can learn a lot about many aspects of life one often neglected part is health and diet and healing I want to touch on both of these subjects health and healing and look at how the Prophet peace be upon them demonstrated a concern for that and learn from these examples we'll start with this tonic so you have a newborn an infant a young person they can't eat food that adults eat what do can you what can you tell tell us about this this tonic is it chewed or smashed dates okay first of all when a child is born there are a number of etiquettes to be followed where do we get these etiquettes from from the Prophet himself erase all of them and this is one of the benefits of studying the seal the biography of the Prophet erase a lot of them that we tend to get deep into learning our religion through him so lala haria awesome so one of the rituals or one of the etiquettes of receiving a newborn is that the first thing that enters a newborns stomach would be a small tiny piece of date and this was proven through the authentic Sunnah when the Prophet was brought a little son with a child to sort of bless him and he took a small piece of date he shooed it okay quite well so that it would not get stuck yeah rather it would be absorbed totally by the child and he put a small piece of it in the ceiling of his throat yeah so just putting it there and the children by nature love sweet so this newborn did not even taste his mother's milk that's what I was gonna ask you that's the first thing hmm and the in the hadith it says that the Prophet smiled when he saw that newborn liking what he is tasting and he sets of hon Allah the people of Ansar love dates and this was like a couple of hours old child what's the benefit of it as Muslims we usually don't tend to relate things to medicine to science because it's an added value but even if science did not prove anything we adopt it because the Prophet did it Ali has salatu was-salam so scientists say that this helps immensely to fight the deficiency in glucose in the newborns a blood stream modern science looking at the benefits of this practice at the project correctly so they say that this practice prevents the deficiency of glucose in the blood stream of a newborn which means that it would help not in getting his muscles loosened or to get shortness of breath due to the deficiency of glucose and not to get his skin blue these are things that modern science nowadays have proven but again we as Muslims rely entirely on the Sunnah of the Prophet area so understand I must say Sheikh I'm a bit envious of you because you're a Saudi national and some of the best dates are in Saudi Arabia here in Egypt it's hard to get the high quality ones my country of course the US imports them and I'm really missing those good days inshallah send you a box of them thank you thank you I look forward to it I we would like to move next to this practice of akika the Prophet peace be upon him he said that every boy is mortgaged by his I akika so slaughter for him on the seventh day and shave his head and name him would you please elaborate on the profit in this in this he's saying every boy is mortgage by haqiqa what does he mean by that and what's the wisdom behind haqiqa I think this is a problem of translation okay see a lot of the times we have big issues when it comes to translating arabic text into other languages if the person translating it is not knowledgeable in both languages yeah and at the same time is not knowledgeable in Islamic studies you have issues I remember once I was doing a lecture on funeral rites and there was a hadith and I was looking for the interpretation of it the hadith states that there are seven people who are martyred or considered to be martyrs other than those killed on the battlefield mm-hmm okay and one of them in Arabic is a LeMat alone the word almot alone has two meanings one is a person who's stabbed again al motto own mm-hmm a person who was stabbed the knife okay so it comes from a pun and the other meaning which is the right translation is someone who is afflicted by the plague who died is due to the plague the epidemic the disease so the interpreter of the hadith who happens to be an imam in the US on his website said that one of the martyrs is the person who's been stabbed and imagined someone reading this and saying okay I'm going to downtown LA and meet a thug and have him stab me so that I'll be a martyr this is the wrong interpretation the wrong understanding likewise in this hadith it okay prophet said Allen salat wa salam coleauxv Alamein more Tajin on the apricot a meaning that each and every newborn is pledged for pledged non-mortgage not mortgaging mortgages selling and buying houses through interest and banks loans grant but this is not what is meant it means that this newborn is pledged he's related to his opteka what is our PR our paper is a sacrifice that a person offers whenever he is blessed with a newborn whether a boy or a girl with difference of the numbers pertaining to each one of them and I don't know if we have time we we will go further into a shake after our first break we'll be back and shall continue our discussion now all they can welcome back we'll continue our discussion about the akika with the Sheikh Azam please you started before the break to talked with us about akika but please continue with this one of the things that the Prophet instructed us to do so Louis alam was to shave the head of the newborn did that apply to both male and female newborns okay I think before we go to the shaving aspect before the break we wanted to talk about the meaning of being pledged yeah that's it that's right you're right let's do that so what is the meaning of being pledged to or connected or related to this the scholar said that whenever a person does not slaughter this sacrifice as a form of gratitude to Allah for blessing me with a child then if the child were to die at an early age he would not intercede for his parents because his parents fell fell short from following the sin of sacrifice the other interpretation as the scholars say would be that those whom their parents do not offer the heart iike the sacrifice for them they will not protect their children from Shaitaan so he would have some sort of influence over them as they grow up as in the case when a person has intimacy with his wife and he does not say bismillah if he's if he does and allah azzawajal decrease that from that night a child is a result in then if he does Allah will protect that child from Shaitaan if he doesn't Allah will not so it's almost the same thing as the scholars say to us there are etiquettes for our keeper the age for example it's the same as the age of up here and Oda is a sacrifice we offer when we do not perform Hadj we offer it under aid of hatch so it has to be 60 months old if it's a sheep at least or one year old if it's a goat you can these are the principle the two animals correct and the most authentic opinion is that you cannot slaughter a camel or a cow and have seven shares like you do in hatch this is a different story it's an issue of dispute but this is the most authentic opinion and also when it comes to the number of sacrifice we have to give it differs from if it's a male child or a female child okay and again I can hear them saying the women as usual coming and complaining and this is male chauvinism and and and all the this nonsense they have this is Islam in the sense that we are to execute what Allah tells us to do we have to perform what Allah orders us to do in Islam there are five incidents in cases where a male is double the female one of them is the happy part ok if you're blessed with a baby boy you slaughter two sheep I say if you blessed with a girl you slaughter one sheep ok the second is when it comes to testimony so Allah mentioned in the at the end of surah al-baqarah chapter 2 that the testimony of a man is equivalent to the testimony of two women so if I have a transaction selling and buying loans and the likes I have to have two male witnesses if not then one male witness and two female witnesses so this is number two number three it deals with blood money so if a person by mistake killed a man he has to give a hundred camels or what's worth of the value of a hundred camels to his family this is blood money okay but if he kills a woman he gives 50 camels and I've no know I've lost track the fourth or the fifth I don't know is when it comes to inheritance so as mentioned in chapter 14 Nyssa allah azza wajal advises you about your offspring leave the kareem if you have the insane the child male boy has double the female girl in inheritance so if I have a son and a daughter he gets two shares she gets one share and the last and fifth category where women are half of the men is in the reward of freeing a slave the Prophet tells us how they stole of 'some if a man fries a slave Allah will free with each organ of that man an organ of the one who freed his slave from Hellfire mm-hmm so this is a great virtue to freeing slaves and Islam promotes freeing slavery like nothing else yeah there's a spiritual incentive yeah so if you free a slave with each organ of that slave allah free is an organ of you an arm for an arm like burning the whole body and then the Prophet says yourself and whoever freeze to women slaves Allah will free one of that person so these are the five incidents yes yes and so it all started with akika and the animals that are offered depending on male or female so thank you that accountant accounting of course the meat has to be distributed but a lot of us may think that it has to be divided into three divisions one for charity one for gifts to the neighbors and loved ones and one-third we consume it like the odd here and this is not true our data is different from out here that all what matters is the shedding of the blood as a form of gratitude for the sacrifice to Allah knoweth what to do with the meat it's up to you and the sky's the limit you can put it all stored it in your fridge you can give it all to the poor you can invite your friends and loved ones and have a feast and eat it all and you can divide it into different parts and distribute it here and there so the social impact when the Prophet SAW is salam performed i  for his grandchildren can you what do we have in our records about that the social impact how did it affect the people when they saw the Prophet doing this peace be upon them for his grandchildren actually it's not only for his grandchildren this is an Islamic practice for each and every individual to perform once he's blessed with a child now is it mandatory or is it voluntary it is highly recommended but if someone does not perform it especially when he does not have the financial meal means to do so he's not sinful yet let's assume that I grew up and discovered that my parents did not offer the article for me is there any harm for me to do it now after all these years scholars say there's no problem in that it is rewarded Oh what was the social impact imagine in Modena when it they were poor and they did not have sufficient means and food whenever the Prophet s salaam slaughtered the sheep and invited his friends and companions and loved ones what impact that would leave on them they would be happy yeah they would make a lot of dua which we know that we have to do to the one who is blessed with a child in a certain format and the poor the needy and those around you will benefit from it as well mmm good you touched a little bit on some of the guidelines or the rules of principles governing I Kika just a other question about this and you said that we could do with the meat whatever we chose whether it be charity for our own consumption or giving to our friends or what have you any other thing that is most important to think about consider if we want to do this for our children or grandchildren well see there is an etiquette maybe I failed to mention that which is that there is a time a time frame it's not a time frame it is it's a time recommendation okay so the Prophet ordered us a little time to slaughter this are pica on the seventh day of the child's birth and this means that if I were to exceed that limit a my sinful dancers know because it's a pseudonym mm-hmm but some scholars say that it is best to have the multiplications of seven so if you can't do it on the seventh day don't do it on the 14th I see if not do it on the 21st and if not then the sky's the limit one last quick question we're out of time but very quickly about charity the Prophet SAW I saw him instructed his daughter Fatima to give the equivalent weight of the her son Hussein's hair in the form of silver for charity purposes why here and what's the significance of that the Prophet instructed the Saudis of Salaam when someone is blessed with a newborn child to name him on the seventh day to slaughter the akiha on the seventh day and to shave his head in another narration he said remove this filth see when a child comes out of his mother's womb there are a lot of things stuck to his skull to his scalp so by shaving the hair you ensure that the skin is fresh it can breathe it's clean even if you wash the sculpt with with shampoos it's not gonna help because he's been there for too long hmm so shaving it gives the head a healthier look and a better way of of breathing part of showing your gratitude to Allah is to weigh this hair which probably is like 3 grams 4 grams is its peanuts it's not even half a half a dollar or a dollar yeah and you give it in charity but do we do this for both boys and girls or only for boys it's an issue of dispute and I am inclined to the opinion that the filth is in both hmm heads love a girl and a boy so shaving them would be the right thing to do great thank you very much check for your answers your time your patience we have reached the end of this episode we hope to continue with looking at how we can continue to be with the Prophet in our lives thank you very much as-salaam alaykum wa rahmatullah"
