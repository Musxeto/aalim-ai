  "title": "Parents give daughters gold when they get married but don't give the sons, is it ok? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i have read that parents should treat their children equally when giving gifts and there is a hadith relating to it my doubt is i come from south india and what i have seen is when the parents get their daughters married they give a good amount of gold as a gift which is a very valuable gift and when their sons get married they don't usually tend to give any gifts or if they give it will not be equal to what they give to their daughters so i am a little bit confused on whether the practice is correct or not could you please clarify i don't know to tell you the truth and i will not put myself in harm's way by giving you a fatwa without having prior knowledge of it what you've stated is totally correct where is your dilemma then why don't you say the women the girls are getting 20 dollars of gold and the boys when they get married they get zlich nothing so why don't you say that this is right this is wrong i don't know because i have to verify it with the scholars is the gold given to the girls part of a gift or it is part of the tradition that the in-laws are expecting the girl to come with because if she does not come with such gold she will be humiliated she will be looked down upon i don't know so i need to research it and insha'allah or the number of i call answer me back and give me a verdict then i can clarify this later insha'allah you"
