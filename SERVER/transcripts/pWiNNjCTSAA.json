  "transcript": "if I touch something with urine on my hands such as a tap like one week ago and now I have what hands and then I touch the tap even though no traces I've not just on the tap or my hand does the hand become impure if yes wouldn't this cause a lot of hardship especially since I might have not touched a doorknob computer phone Etc like to what extent does the jazza transfer and go away first of all those who think like this Sami they have a serious problem urine should have been washed why would you be so neglectful in having soiled hands with najasa and then you go around touching things and then you ask what should I do this is your fault in the very beginning secondly everything around us is pure by default is this pen not just or pure it's pure how do you know Sheikh maybe the person who used it before you had sold hands maybe he had urine maybe he did not wash Maybe and maybe your parents are not your biological parents go and do a DNA test maybe so no we don't apply maybes here the default is it's everything is pure so if you are certain that you've touched the doorknob with soiled hand and you are certain that urine has transferred to the doorknob then this doorknob is nudges if you come after one week you should see traces of najasa if you don't see traces of najasa then you may assume that people have used it and removed the najasa afterwards may not so the default it is pure until proven otherwise now point three najasa is not Coronavirus it's not monkey smallpox that spreads it's not the plague so some people make a single tiny drop of urine capable of contaminating the whole house the whole mansion the car the seats the engine the tires of me what is this give me a break when a Bedouin came to the Masjid of the Prophet is urinated inside the Masjid the prophet sallallahu ordered them to pour a bucket of water on that spot so that it would overwhelm it and that's it no need to dig the Pebbles and the sand and throw it out the water overwhelmed the amount of impurity so now it's all pure therefore you don't have to go to such extremes and then accuse Islam of causing a lot of hardship it's your fault from the very beginning so be aware of the Naja says and don't be neglectful and take things easy and at the same time don't go overboard and make najasa spread as if it's a plague or a virus"
