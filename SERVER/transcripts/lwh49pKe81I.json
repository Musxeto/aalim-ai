  "transcript": "is it permissible to serve in United United Nations peacekeeping Mission As an interpreter with Armed Forces like like French French language interpreter French interpreter so our soldier our only job is to translate from French into English and vice versa which country in Central African country like Congo central Africa Mali uh then uh Ivory Coast like this if the mission of this United Nation Expedition which is a military force is to enforce the law and to keep people safe and to prevent um forced or uh military conflicts and to keep the peace then your role there is is but if the armed forces are intervening or invading or manipulating what's happening such as in Mali for example which is a Muslim country and we find their wicked means of intervention and and their involvement in politics and dirty politics no you're not allowed to do this if they're involved in killing people or atrocities under the flagship of the United Nations saying that we're a Peace Keeping Force when they are actually not doing that this is not permissible my advice to you stay away out of all of this politics is dirty 99.999 and getting involved in such forces and you'll be part of them and the people would consider you an enemy and it may endanger your safety and well-being so it's not worth it it's not a good cause it's not in the uh sake or for the sake of Islam it's only for the sake of money look for a better job elsewhere where it's safer and there are no controversial issues involved in Allah knows best this"
