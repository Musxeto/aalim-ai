  "transcript": "Allah the almighty tells us the very beginning of [Music] Surah Allah says Al do people think that they will be left alone because the they say we believe and will not be tested Allah says and we indeed tested those who were before them and Allah will certainly make it known the truth of those who are truthful and will certainly make it known the falsehood of those who are liars this beginning of Surah anab truly tells us that life is merely a Calamity it is a test or a number of tests not necessarily sad and bad to the soul it can be also with testing You by wealth or health or by power and high positions and usually it is associated with poverty with Hunger with illness Etc things that are sad and bad to the soul yet testing from Allah can be in the negative side and also can be in the positive side yet people only know the negative side Allah the almighty says and we test you with goodness and with things that are sad and evil to yourselves and all of this is merely a test and an examination from Allah the almighty and it is not a sign from Allah that people are not tested that they are close to him as Allah mentions inah that man usually says when Allah grants him wealth that Allah is favoring me and when Allah deprives him from such wealth and tightens subhanahu wa ta'ala things upon him he complains and says that Allah is humilating me Allah says no meaning that this is not the case and if you look around you'll find that people have a lot of wealth in their hands yet they are so far from Allah subhah wa ta'ala and you would find people who are close people who are righteous to be among the poor and deprived so this is not a from Allah that he prefers or favors a group of people over the other but it means that Allah is testing people for example look at Prophet Prophet a job I think his name is in English and if you look at him he was tested for 17 or plus years in his health till people people abandoned him so people neglected him because of the amount of illnesses he had yet he was a messenger he was a prophet of Allah so definitely this was not because of a sin he had but this is from Allah to test his belief and to test his true Iman and to raise and Elevate his position in Paradise if you look at the prophets of Allah since the beginning of of time you would find this manifested in so many different ways Adam peace be upon him was tested by Allah not to eat from The Forbidden tree and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala descended him to Earth because of his sin if you look at n peace be upon Him Allah tested him by asking him to call his people to Islam for about 950 years Years yet they did not listen to him not only that his wife and his son died as disbelievers though he tried relentlessly for them to come and accept Islam if you look at ibraim please be upon him he was a nation by himself ibraim peace and praise of Allah be upon him defied all laws of his people he destroyed their Idols he called him to Islam not only that when they threatened him to burn him alive and even when they set the fire and ignited it and threw him in that fire he was there waiting patiently remembering Allah and having all his trust in Allah subhana wa tala not only that when he was 80 years old Allah commanded him to circumcise and he did this with a tool that Carpenters used to cut wood with 80 years old he circumcised himself and not only that when Allah instructed him to slaughter his only son as a sacrifice he complied immediately without any hesitation the same happened with his son is peace be upon him when his father told him that I was ordered to slaughter you he was 14 or 15 years old he said oh Father do as you are told and you'll find me among the patient if you look at Yousef Joseph peace be upon him his brothers throw him when he was just a child in a well he was bought up in the house of the ruler of Egypt and he was seduced by his wife yet he preferred to be thrown into jail he preferred not to fall into sin because he was among the chosen ones and the list goes on when you go to MSA peace be upon him when you look at what happened with David when you look at all the great Messengers and prophets of Allah you will find that their lives were a number of calamities and tests from Allah because they were the chosen ones which means that when the prophet says when Allah favors a group of people Allah will test them this means that the more testing you are getting the more favored You Are by Allah and whenever you see that there are no calamities coming upon you when you see that everything is going smooth and beautiful this is also a test from Allah but it can also be what is known as meaning that Allah is postponing for the aggressor until his time is due so whenever you see Allah is favoring you with gifts with blessings with health with wealth it's a test and if you're sinful it's not only a test it is like a bait for you it's a bait because this would increase you in sin and then when Allah takes you he will not let you go at all therefore this is a call for myself and for all of us to look deep down in our souls and selves to see if Allah is testing us not only that to see if we are patient to Allah's test if we are complying and feeling the satisfaction with Allah's tests and we pray to Allah that he makes us steadfast on his path on his way and not to do anything that does not please him because whenever a Calamity Falls upon you it's a death from Allah if you're patient Allah will reward you if you're not not only you are sinful but no matter what you do it is not going to be removed by your complaining so Scholars say a wise person does when a Calamity Falls upon him what a fool does after a month a wise person does when a Calamity be falls upon Him exactly the same thing that the fool does after a month when a Calamity Falls upon a fool what does he do he cries he shouts he complains why me why not someone else he maybe hits his head may maybe tears his clooth but after a month you would find him calmed down and he forgot everything that happened to him a wise man does this exactly when a Calamity Falls upon him that is he knows that it is from Allah he's patient he is accepting what Allah has decreed upon him and he does not complain and all what he says alhamd so I pray to Allah that he makes us patient and that he makes all calamities that fall Upon Us weather away and go away so that we can worship him with a clear and clean mind and heart and Allah Knows Best"
