  "transcript": "sh you mentioned that the Layman should follow a well respected scholar and not just anyone who appears on the TV if that is the case then why should we ask you questions and even if we do aren't you also relying on those same Scholars to provide your answers I think I may have Mis misunderstood something you have misunderstood a lot of things when you come to this show and ask me either you don't have anything better to do or you trust me if you don't have anything better to do of course you're sinful and you're not supposed to follow someone like me but if you trust me and you know who I am and you've been following me for almost quarter of a century and you can see the track record that I have with the grace of Allah that I've been blessed by then you do have a reason to trust me now you ask ask yourself don't ask me why you're following me because if you don't know why then there's something wrong in your head the scholars say you need to follow a trusted person a scholar a person of knowledge that you trust his knowledge his moral conduct his AK his religious commitment and his opinion if you find someone like that abide by him and hold on to him and follow him other than that then this is your own choice this is what the choice you're going to meet Allah with and Allah Knows Best"
