  "title": "The true Fajr (break of dawn) and mistakes in some timetables - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister asks uh sheh the place where I live now for Ramadan it has iMac and after 30 minutes it's fer but I see no light so it is not true fer should I delay the fer an hour later now when it comes to the issue of fer which is the break of dawn there are so many opinions and views and rather than give you a fish every day it's best that you're taught how to fish yourself therefore let us look at some of theth governing this issue the prophet tells us in an authentic Hadith that there are two fer one which is a false fer and it's like the tail of a wolf or a fox meaning it's vertical and then comes the true fer after a while which is horizontal and can be seen on the top of the mountains and the hills it's pitch black before fer 40 minutes 30 minutes you see this vertical light that comes for few moments and then disappears this is false fuder then you can see the whiteness the white thread in the head in in the direction of the East and this is the break of dawn so it's not necessarily that the whole world glows so it would be Dawn it can be simply this thread of whiteness in the direction of the East then the prophet says in another Hadith if the Night comes from here and the day goes from there then it is time to break your fast likewise in the opposite when to refrain from eating and drinking when the day comes from here and the Night Comes uh goes there meaning the break of dawn and also the Hadith of Bal and the prophet told us that there are two for one is done by by B and this does not prevent someone from eating and drinking it's only a reminder so that those asleep can wake up and have their pre-dawn meal while mak's aan is for fer and everyone has to refrain and they can pray fer from these evidences and also the verse in the Quran that you must eat and drink until you see the white thread from the black thread which meaning the break of dawn we know that as an individual I can eat and drink until I know it is time for the break of dawn if I can see that visually I would not pay any attention neither to the aan of the Masjid nor to the timetable and the calendars so if I'm living in an open area in front of me is a desert or the ocean and I can see it's pitch black then I can see the white thread I will refrain even if the aan has been called 10 minutes a half an hour before no problem I can see it visually the problem is that when you cannot see it visually so you have to trust and rely and we have two methods of trusting and relying either on the timetables or on the MU the man who calls the aan in the Masid as a Muslim I can trust the person giving the aan because he's an individual a Muslim and trustworthy the Tim taes I have can be trusted but the problem is my watch may not be accurate some reasons here maybe I did not put the right date for the calendar Etc therefore it's best always to R r on the MU however if I know for certain that the MU is not reliable meaning that on the 30th of shaan the aan of f was at 5:00 a day later which is the first of Ramadan he gives the aan at quarter to 5 15 minutes in one single day definitely this guy is taking a buffer zone and I should not pay attention to his call because it's not accurate I believe believe that the calendar or the timetable of calculation is the most accurate as I've stated this so many times before except when it comes TOA prayer Isa prayer is wrong but the other four uh uh prayers are inshallah according to um the correct thing however the concept of imak this is found in Egypt in Turkey in Syria when the or Syria in Jordan in in other countries they usually give 15 or 20 minutes before the actual of fa and they call it imak so people refrain from eating and this is wrong you eat and drink and do not refrain from anything that is halal until the aan is called the time of the aan the break of dawn is the time of refraining from uh eating and drinking"
