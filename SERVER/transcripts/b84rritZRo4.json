  "transcript": "gial from bangladesh uh can we force our friends to go to the masjid with us i've asked real but i could not get a proper answer how do i force my friends to go to the masjid force means that i have to have a gun to point at them a sword a stick if i'm their boss i would threaten them to fire them if they don't go to pray to the masjid but if they are my peers they're my friends they're my buddies i cannot force them i can invite them i can encourage them sometimes i can leverage on them by saying that guys if you don't pray with me i'm not gonna hang out with you anymore i can't hang out with people who don't pray this is a form of arm twisting but it's not forcing so can we do some something like that yes but can i force them at gunpoint or force them with physical forced answers no i have no right to do any of this"
