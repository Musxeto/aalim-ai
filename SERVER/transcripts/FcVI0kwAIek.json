  "title": "Can I give allowance to my wife & children from the interest I get from the bank? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "first of all when you are forced to take interest money from the bank over your savings because some countries whether you put current account saving account no matter what account they will give you interest whether you like it or not I think this is also applicable in India to my knowledge so in this case the interest money is Haram money you cannot benefit from it you cannot utilize it so you have to take it and dispose of it without having any um interest or anticipating any reward from Allah when you give this money to your wife as an allowance or to your children you're hitting two birds with one stone because you have to give your wife allowance whether you like it or not so instead of giving it from your free Halal money you give her from Haram money this is not permissible at all and Allah Knows Best"
