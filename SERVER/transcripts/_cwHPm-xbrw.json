  "transcript": "she's saying that based on your pce uh TV conference she says that you advis that if the parents keep shelting with the children that there there would be no s Sak in the home and she says when she tried to follow the way that you were saying that that she should advise and and the children are saying that she becomes she became very soft how does she operate in such a situation first of all we have to um identify the meaning and Define the meaning of Sakina Sakina is tranquility mhm it's the peace within and I mentioned in that lecture MH that this is attained by following the Quran and the Sunnah and by following the footsteps of the Prophet Alat what I understood from sister sabah's uh remarks and question that she is trying to discipline them but they say that she is becoming too tough and too strict mhm even either way if they're accusing her of being soft this is good as long as they do not cross the red line okay see every house we have to have red lines that we do not allow others to cross once we identify these red lines then we may vary and change from one way of dealing with the children to the other but what should be prevailing is love respect mhm and a room to breathe and to maneuver yes I find it out of experience that struggling a a child and suffocating him does not help if you monitor every move he makes every breath he takes then this would cause him to innovate ways to cheat you so in an there is an Arabic saying that states that the master of his people is the one who pretends not to see Subhan Allah so there are so many times that we have to pretend MH now people who are impulsive and are they have this strong love for Islam when they see their children do something that they think and believe that is wrong they immediately get haywired and they would like to you know punish to spank to um put some someone in a curfew not to leave not to do this and they don't see how the children perceive this yes the children see that anything you do is coming from Islam and Islam is rough it's not the way I used to always joke with my friends but this is a fact a while ago whenever I went into the house and I saw one of my children do something wrong when my child does this wrong thing and I tell him that this is not good or tell her that this is not good you shouldn't have done this the first thing that I say afterwards is did you pray so I'm always connecting prayer whenever they're doing something wrong as if I'm reprimanding them and they said no I didn't pray go and pray so what is connected in the child's mind that prayer is a punishment well it shouldn't be so I advise her that she should pretend not to see things now I'm not talking about major sins or big sins or any kind of sin but at the same time you have to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages if I am on the clock on their head do this don't do this it's only dos and don'ts they will never love me they will never love my religion and they will try there to go out of my reach in sight"
