  "transcript": "from saudi arabia says that we are in the season of the diwali and they celebrate this the hindus and the sikh and uh uh the journeys as well i think they call it this they also update these five days each has their own reason the hindus uh if i'm not mistaken they celebrate it because the coming of uh rama and sita after being exiled for 14 years and these are gods who has the power to exile them maybe a superior god and they have like 6 000 gods everybody is a god in this religion of theirs and that they are also celebrating the killing of a devil called mahisha or something like that and they celebrate for five days and it's uh they they put candles and lights and decorations and unfortunately i went to some of the gulf states and i saw these decorations in the hotels subhanallah in the island in the peninsula of arabia the core quarter headquarter of islam where the shirk is coming and this is sad this is the least that we can say so what's the ruling on congratulating them it's the same ruling with all other religions we muslims are not permitted to congratulate other faiths of things that are related to their religion something like that a celebration of the returning of two gods after being exiled for 14 years how can they be god in the first place how can we approve having other than allah the almighty azzawajal to be our lord our god where is the tawheed so by congratulating them you're endorsing their beliefs and you're approving of it and this is totally prohibited in islam one would say they congratulate us well excuse me they're congratulating us with what we believe is the ultimate truth we have no shred of doubt in our religion we totally believe that islam is the true religion and the final revelation so when they congratulate us they're doing the right thing but when we congratulate them this would not be at all true"
