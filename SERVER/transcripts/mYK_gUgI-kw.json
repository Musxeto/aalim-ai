  "transcript": "hello 169 in the chapter that deals with the conditions of salah was narrated by abu murthaid and i believe that brother noor will read this hadith for us narrated by abu martha may i will be pleased with him i heard allah's messenger allah don't pray towards grave and don't sit on them don't pray towards graves and don't sit on them now we have a rule in the fundamentals of that says that whenever you're forbidden from doing something it means that it is not accepted which means if you are forbidden from praying after assa and you insist on praying then your prayer would be void and not valid another example a person comes abu malik and says that i have never it's an oath that i fast one day and this man does not fast this day until the day of eight and on the day of eight he says i'm gonna fast today so would his oath be fulfilled by fasting that day no because it's forbidden for him to fast the day of eid and if he does fast the day of eight it's not accepted therefore he still has to do and make up for that one day that is an oath that he made it another on uh himself likewise the prophet says here in this hadith that do not pray towards graves now he is making this something forbidden if a person goes into a cemetery and it's us or prayer and he skipped the prayer with the congregation and he prays in the cemetery would his prayer be acceptable from the rule that we've said it it is not acceptable it's forbidden for him to pray if he prays he has to pray it again once he goes out of the graveyard or of the cemetery and why is that this is to protect islam to protect you from a possibility that you may associate others with a lot of people would jump to conclusions and say who would worship a dead person who would worship a corpse that died well this question sounds very logical but throughout the history we had we've seen people worshiping that people and they're still doing it until today and this is a sign of the absence of iman the absence of the heed and the absence of a clear mind to tell you what to do and what not to do in uh says that this is one of the greatest tricks and traps of satan to muslims where they he make he makes them glorify the dead and this is you know you can see this whenever you have a scholar or you have a pious person and he dies satan immediately comes and say to you that this is a great loss so we have to bury this nice or good man and when you bury him we have to do something extra we have to glorify this man we have to uh uh respect him even after his death and people start to innovate bits and pieces here and there until they worship this dead person and this is found in lots of islamic countries where you have mosques and you have dead people buried inside the mosques and they claim and say that we don't worship them but if you see them going ground for example the grave of al-hussein and hussein is the son of ali that means he is the grandson of the prophet salallahu and and hussein is has been assassinated he was killed in iraq in karbala and if you look at the muslim world you'd find that there's a shrine for him somewhere in iran and another one in iraq and a third one probably in egypt i don't know if they have anything for him in in syria i don't know if they have anything for him in in afghanistan no uh in afghanistan uh the graveyard okay now they say in afghanistan they have the grave of ali ibn abi talib the cousin of the prophet sallallahu this is strange ali never ever left the arabian peninsula he was in iraq how did his body reach afghanistan it definitely did not but people came and said well the muslims there need you know a boost they have strong islam so what can we do to make this strong islam redirected to bad islam let's put the awliya let's put these ideas of uh uh making this place sacred for them and this diverts them from the quran sunnah and he succeeded if you go to to iran they tell you that this is the grave of hussein and if you go to karbala or to syria they say that this is a grave of hussein and if you go to egypt they say that this is the grave of hussein may allah be pleased with him one of the camp companions of the prophet salla sallam his grandson and one of the masters of paradise the prophet said that it is brothers his grandsons are the masters of the youth in jannah they are the top and the leaders the head of youth in jannah and if you look at this situation it's not unacceptable so you mean to tell me that his legs are in iran and his body is in karbala iraq and his head is in egypt this is not acceptable then what is what's acceptable is that shaytaan satan comes to people and he tells them to glorify these dead and to think that they have powers so that you should supplicate to them you should pray to them and you should slaughter them and this is what we call fitna allah has put us on earth to worship him and he put us on earth to examine us so if we pass the exam it's heaven for eternity if we fail the exam allah knows what will happen and what made me say this was that i have friends i know people and allah examined them in different ways there's there's this man that was married 10 years ago and until today he doesn't have any children so people instruct him go to the kaaba go to the holy mosque pray to allah that he grants you a child so the guy goes for two three years nothing happens then this man comes up to him and say why don't you go to the grave of al-hussein in egypt or in iraq whatever you want the guy has branches so you can go whatever is convenient for you go to al hussein and supplicate there and see what happens so the guy says let me give it a try he goes to the mosque and he sees people rubbing the walls of the chamber and and throwing letters and throwing pieces of clothings and people saying oh yeah saying do this for me do that for me and the guy gets you know the feeling and he starts saying yeah hussein grant me a child grant me a good boy and bang within nine months his wife is delivering a healthy uh beautiful boy what would this man say he would say that i've prayed to allah azza in the ka'ba in the haram for three years and nothing happened and look in less than nine months i have a child then this is the real power this is the power of the people no it's wrong this is a test from allah azza and you've just failed the test and you're not a muslim anymore by calling and praying other than allah you become a non-muslim so one would say and argue okay then how did it happen how did this man uh got successful in in in having this child who gives a child in the very beginning it's allah allah azzawajal who grants you this child grants you health grants you wealth so by asking other than allah azzawajal do you think that al-hussein himself has the power to give you anything do you think that the prophet salallahu has the power to give you anything without allah azza definitely not we are told not to glorify the dead not to praise them they're dead we ask allah for forgiveness for them not to go and seek what we want from them and that is why it's forbidden for us to pray to graves do you recall any incident uh fadi where people you know started glorifying and praising the dead and then they ended by worshipping them like in the in this in the stories of the companions or or before yeah the story that the quran brought in love monatos that that they were very great people yesterday they were all people that were good one of them for example a lot used to get dates and put some wheat with it and make a meal for the pilgrims whenever they come he used to give it to them and the minute he died they put a shrine on his grave and they started worshipping him before that we have abu malik five pious people on time of satan i know yes and what happened when they died the people uh first they you know they made the statues at a like a square in the city why to remember them yes what do you remember them and what good remember their goodness that's exactly the point that ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him and with his father told us that at the time of noah there were five good people and everybody respected them and the minute they died they felt bad about it so satan came to them and told them that why not build statues on top of their graves so whenever you see them you remember how pious and good they were so you do exactly like they used to do and they did so and after this generation died new generation came in and they saw these statues and they saw how people you know admired them and and glorified them so satan told them do you know why they've built these statues because these people bring rain so call them supplicate to them and they will make it rain on you so they did so and they associated others with allah azza and they became mushrikeen and that is why we are told not to have any forms of statues or drawings that may resemble any living creature one would say do you think i'm gonna worship mickey mouse in five ten years time or or my pokemon well you will not worship it but it's forbidden because you don't know what may happen i believe that we have to break now inshaallah we will be right back islam is a comprehensive way of life it deals with everything the prophet sallam wanted to empower people and he wanted them to feel the responsibility not just to rely on the state the companions and in particular abu bakr umar uthman ali in the beginning they were not pleased and they were not proud to become the khalifa these days we see the candidates running to become the amir islamic state has to provide all inhabitants with the basic needs it has to fulfill their basic needs of the main foundations of the islamic state is to establish justice we read before the break hadith may allah be pleased with him the prophet says don't pray towards graves and we've gone through this and we said that it is not permissible to pray in a cemetery or in a graveyard and don't sit on them and it's not it's forbidden to sit on graves a question just popped into my mind and i hope i find the answers the answer to it with you guys now i've read somewhere or the other that the prophet salallahu once had a black woman cleaning the mosque do you know this hadith she there was this black woman cleaning the mosque and once she died and the prophet was asleep on islam so they buried her at night and when the prophet woke up salam the following morning they told him about her and he was angry that they did not wake him up so that he could perform the funeral prayer and he went to the cemetery and he asked where her grave was and he salam performed the funeral prayer so is it possible or was it obligated because here it says do not pray towards graves was it obligated or this one is obligated or do you have an explanation mustafa well i think the prophet muhammad did not pray to the grave it was just he prayed the janazah prayer or in her when she was in her grave but he did not actually pray with raku and sujud what do you think fadi i think he was not facing he was facing the qibla and the graveyard was behind them and scholars said it's permissible to pray in this order as long as you're not praying at the grave i think you know it's prophesied it's something special for him well actually what brother mustafa said was the right answer which is it's forbidden for you to pray normal prayers to a grave but to pray the funeral prayer is allowed because you're not bowing you're not prostrating and to pray a future prayer you have to have the body or the dead person between you and the qibla so it cannot be performed when he's behind you it should be he should be and or she should be in front of you as in the case of the prophet yes sir but isn't it permissible to pray say for instance you went in to visit to visit the graveyard and it's time to pray and there's a mosque far away can you do jamaa at the graveyard next to it like if the graveyard is behind you and you're facing the kabbalah yes yes yes okay providing you're not praying too towards the grave but again from the other hadith scholars say you should avoid praying in the cemetery you should go out not within the boundaries because this may lead a little bit later on you know a month or two later that okay the graves are at our back then on another stage they're a little bit on to our right on our later stage they become in front of you so just leave the cemetery uh what about somebody who has a cemetery inside his house is his house considered to be to be grave or to be symmetry no now this is an awkward question because it's not usual though there are people that have their burial areas in their houses but sometimes i see uh who stains uh in the grave as uh to keep keep the grave for to he stays inside he makes he uh agree for himself yeah he spends the night there yes this was reported by some of the scholars in long times and i don't know if this is a fact or a myth because it's reported and you have to you know synchronize lots of the things that you you read and it says that there was this caller whenever he prayed risha he used to have a grave in his house he used to go in it lie down and put a piece of wood on top of him so it's complete darkness and he's staying there in this ditch until it's uh the break of dawn and he's saying convincing himself telling himself that oh you're dead now it's hell or heaven and you have uh so many things that you should have done you have not done them and when it's the break of dawn he goes out and says to himself okay allah has brought you back again so let's see what you do because when you're dead you won't have the chance to do this now this is yeah yeah any far-fetched i believe that this is too much a person goes and it's an innovation this is a bidad this is not recommendable though some people say it and think that wow the guy spent eight or ten hours in the grave look how fearful he is from allah this is not fearful this is not instead of spending nine hours in in this ditch and you you should have prayed the whole night night prayer you should have studied the ilm you should have taught people you should have done something useful in your life but to sit to lie down in in this grave-like ditch and think that you're doing something good this is not good so this is unacceptable this is an innovation you should make use of your time you know you find people they call them they have different names but you find them in mosques sitting there for like 20 hours a day maybe the full day with beans like uh prayer beans like a thousand one long and they have these strange zika and they opened the books and they they said this is it translates to the prayer that opens things that are closed what is this is a master key and they say no this is a special prayer given to us by wali so and so and by scholars and so and it's good that it does this it does that is it sunnah it's no no no no it's even more than sunnah this is the wali he's not a prophet he's a wali this is blasphemy this is kufur if you think that anyone could be better than the prophet and they start to make noises and sounds and they start to say allah allah allah allah like thousands of signs what are you saying say this name of allah we say it like seven thousand times uh between prayers what use of that said oh this is dikkar did the prophet ever said isam allah allah allah and he kept on repeating it he said no so how do you innovate in it this is this is forbidden and after some time instead of saying allah allah allah then they don't go directly by saying the name they use a pronoun they say who meaning he so instead of saying allah they'll say him him so in arabic what is this this is a dog-like barking this is not prayer this is this does not relate to islam at all so it is definitely not sunnah to put a grave in your house and instead of lying in your bed you go down there and lie in it this is an islamic but some people used to live in graveyards living in graveyards is different than living in a grave say if you work in a graveyard then you have your house next to a graveyard nobody lives inside the graveyard usually there are probably poor people or but it's not a place to live in i don't think it's very friendly place you know to invite your friends and let's have dinner in my place where do you live next to grave 2003 it was for a serial killer but if you wish we can change the scenery to another place this is any not logical or not acceptable though it's possible people they don't know about people's lives but praying to a grave is forbidden you should respect the grave the cemeteries to the extent that it's forbidden for us to walk on graves with our sandals on the prophet saws though sometimes you have to walk on graves because the whole place is filled with graves you have to take your sandals off now sitting on a grave is completely out of the question sitting on a grave is completely out of the question because the prophet told us that whoever sits on the grave as if he's sitting on a burning stone this is a punishment and this tells you the respect we have for the dead they're dead their history but we respect the dead and likewise how would you think that we would respect the living our respect to the living should be even more uh and more and all of this not praying to the grave is to safeguard the tawheed to safeguard the monetism your belief in the oneness of allah azzawajal and that is why there are so places in the sunnah where it tells us do not say the following allah and so on allah and muhammad because in arabic it's when you say allah muhammad or masha allah whatever allah wishes in you this is associating you with allah and saying that allah wishes this and you wish this and this is not acceptable in islam uh we move on to the the following hadith hadith number 170 narrated when it when any of you comes to the mosque he should look and if he sees impurity or felt on his sandals or shoes he should wipe them and then pray in them mustafa this hadith talks about which condition he talks about impurity about purity removing the filth as we recall that purity is divided into two and this is essential that you understand this because then you know what purity is it's not only performing evolution this is one part of it so purity is considered to be removing the filth and lifting the state that you should be either taking a total bath or uh performing abolution and in this hadith it tells us that when you go into the mosque at the time of the prophet you could also pray wearing your socks wearing your shoes now we've said that in our times this is not acceptable simply because the mosques are covered with carpets and carpets take any dirt that you bring to them when you step on these carpets so it's not a sunnah it's not recommendable you should not do this and in this hadith the prophet tells us that one should look into his shoes why to see if there is any filth in it in inujas an impurity and if there is any impurity one should remove it but if there is nothing then he can pray and he has nothing uh to do with it is it sunnah to pray wearing sandals mustafa yes it is sunnah to wear sandals because prophet muhammad told us to be different uh from the jews and the christians because they the jews know not the christians the jews because they uh only pray uh without wearing sandals beer fitted footed they pray barefooted but muslims can pray both ways and it's preferable if you have your sandals on and you're praying in a place that does not have any carpets that you pray wearing your sandals i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program i believe inshallah that there are few issues still to be discussed so we will delay that too until we meet next time then wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi"
