blessings be upon his Prophet Muhammad sallallah alaihi wasallam I welcome you dear viewers to this episode we're with our dear sh discussing the topic of Witchcraft magic so to begin with we have our dear Alim from Saudi Arabia Sal from the UAE and she Muhammad Sharif from Canada may Allah reward you all for joining us now I'm going to start with you sheim when we talk about witchcraft sorcery magic I mean this sounds something like out of a fairy tale it's something that we're taught growing up you know people turning into frogs and Dragons this is what might come into some people's minds when we're talking about magic could you just clarify for us is this what we're talking about or are we talking about something a little bit different this topic is quite interesting because you have people who have gone astray and they have made so many superstitious ideas about it and believed it so their life is consumed throughout these stuff whether it's magic sorcery or evil eye or Envy or Jin and it destroyed the life of a lot of the Muslims now does magic exist which we call or some call Black Magic well actually magic is Magic it's a does it exist the Quran tells us it does does the Sunnah tell us it exist the Sunnah tells us that the prophet was casted by a spell so we believe in this and there is no option for you to believe or disbelieve Allah described what had happened to Prophet MSA peace be upon him that he was also deceived by what the sorcerers did and this what is one part of magic which is illusion and there is another type of magic that maybe would tell us about after a while but in essence yes this exist exists in Islam however we have to be very careful when we label it when we study it because it has to fall under the parameter of Islam which is comes from the Quran Sunnah now you mentioned that the prophet peace be him had a spell cast on him now this is going to bring into some people's minds you know you have the you know Harry Potter type Abracadabra where magic is just like this power that exists we don't know how it got there where it came from and I'll ask you salm when we're talking about the effects of magic like if someone you know casts a spell so to speak or does sorcery where does this power come from I mean is there a power called Magic does it come Froman does it come from Allah where does the source of this ultimately derive from first of all let us start from the fundamentals from the basics is a reality magic is a reality it exist as mentioned the Egyptians they were experts in this field in the field of Witchcraft and that's why the miracle of Moses alisam was in this particular field because Allah subhana tala when he sends a messenger or a prophet he gives him a proof that supports his truthfulness okay and supports he gives it to the people as an evidence that he is sent by Allah something Supernatural and the medical which we call it the medical has to be in the field that the people master so that the challenge will be meaningful okay if you are a wrestler you don't challenge a boxer but a boxer against a boxer fine a wrestler against another wrestler so the challenge will have meaning so many people they have different fields they mastered so at the time of mam they Egyptians that was the field so Allah gave him the staff the stick and he threw the stick now what the magician does he deceives your side deceives your eye we have to understand one thing that magicians cannot change the reality of something for example he cannot convert this table into something else or turn a human being into an animal and an oh this is nonsense we have to understand this so when The Magicians they threw their robes the people it appears to the people that they were like snakes moving now Allah commanded his Prophet Moses to throw his staff that became a real snake and by the way if we have two magicians and they are doing tricks and deceiving us this magician is seeing the robe is a robe not a snake I am seeing it as a snake the other magicians seeing it no it is a Rob because he knows the tra he knows so now when the staff became a real serpent snake and swallowed all of them prostrated why they prostrated realized they realized that this is something cannot be magic because they are the experts in Magic though before that they were promised by the Pharaoh that he will bring them closer to him as advisors and he promised them many things but when they saw that medical they realized this must be from Allah and this is a true prophet and immediately they believed they knew there were no tricks now she Muhammad I'm going to ask you as she Salim said you have trickery or slight of hands like when you have card tricks and this is something that a lot of the viewers might be asking themselves does this mean that magic tricks for example pick a card I'll tell you the number is this is this witch or does this fall into a different field you know is this magic and and I'll allow the to to explain more about it but uh what we find in the communities is that a lot of people just when they can't explain something they just automatically say it's when things are going bad for them in their life they say oh somebody did Magic on me and there's just this proliferation they're like I know it's magic somebody has a restaurant that you know their business is not going good instead of advertising they say somebody did Sahar on my restaurant and just this proliferation you actually and I found as you travel from country to Country some countries are very obsessed with it some countries you never hear about it it's like so is this really going on or is it just you know people playing in their minds well actually it depends on how you look at it if I'm not wrong Sal comes from the origin of s which is something that is hidden hidden and conle very subtle so usually when we look at those who make magical tricks and they put like three cups and put something in one of them and all of a sudden it disappears or they tie a knot and then they cut the rope and they tie it again and it's a whole rope again now this one would say that this is a a trick that depends on how quick your hand is but wasn't this the case with The Magicians at the time of Musa they were using their tricks and some say that they used to use ropes and put mercury in it and the minute you throw it on the ground it moves and and it they gave the people an impression that this was a snake so some Scholars say that these kind of card tricks are permissible others refrain and say no this leads to bit by bit and after a while you'll get someone in a box and with his head and the feet usually it's not a he but this is in Islamic countries probably and then they saw the box and they separated and and people would wow what a nice magical trick but is it a nice magical trick or is it a source of a forbidden Act of and it goes on and on people walking on water maybe it's an illusion done by cameras and and TV Etc they fly they bury themselves in snow for like 10 hours and they come out living as Muslims we believe that these acts are assisted by Jin by the devils and that is why they can't do things that seem to us unnatural and not within the capabilities of humans but does it have to be assisted by Jin like I mean sometimes those things that you're talking about they've been explained and people so this is how the guy buries himself for 10 hours this is how he puts himself in a tank of water like in the tank of water they'll say that he has an amount of space to breathe and it seems like it's full of water but it's not he just puts his head up and so on so I've seen people say oh it's Jin but it's not even Jin it's just a it's just a trick now just uh on this point because as you mentioned maybe sometimes it could be Jin other times they just fooling you and this no doubt is part of the game whereby it will pull you in slowly like as I've seen you know Harry Potter and all of these and you kids get Amazed by Magic so the line becomes blurred so the moment that they see real witchcraft what we're talking about s they're already accustomed to it because they've been taught that magic is fun they've been taught it's amazing you know you see these movies about witches and it seems appealing to kids so this could be you know one of these things that's going to fool people into thinking witchcraft IS F like because I think you were mentioning previously that it's even taught nowadays in some universities this is true well this was mentioned by Sal probably it is true but the thing is we in Islam know that a is one of the seven major sins is it not so it is there so now we have to go into understanding which is the that the prophet was pointing atat and we know that as a penalty code in Islam which is only to be executed which is only to be implemented by the ruler by the head of state he's the only one empowered to do this it's not for any one of us to do so we know that the penalty for such in Islam is execution which tells you that the gravity of such a sin however as you've pointed out now people I'm talking about Muslims this is what I address usually usually they bring up their children on such stories and fables for example Harry Potter and what he does all of this is UN Islamic we know like mentions there is no possibility of you kissing a frog and it becomes your handsome prince this is another possibility only Allah has the ability to change such creation so if you have a hamster and it changes into a man or if you have frog and it changes into a beautiful princess I wish that was a reality I would have started Gathering frogs but this is not true however this is how our children are brought up it's normal to see a 5-year-old child with a stick saying Abra Kadabra what is Abra Kadabra you know I grew up in the west and I grew up with with those things and I don't feel that as a kid we actually believe that stuff you know we read those stories of kissing frog and whatnot but it didn't really affect us and we it's so exaggerated that people don't believe it so it might be going a little too far to say Muhammad I believe that you are not an example because the teacher used to ask the female students to sit next to you in class because they know good boy yes so but look at the other examples where people wear Superman cape and they jump from the balcony and they died and they died children are afflicted they are so associated with these things that they believe in it and they wish that it is true and we know this from the superheroes and how they want to imitate and want to do okay there is a probability that not all of them definitely not all of them but there is a big portion and that is why these movies these novels sell because people find in them something missing those who do not have Iman those who do not have the Quran in their heart they want to fulfill and to fill the Gap in their hearts with something that is spiritual even if it is fictional before we get too far ahead I suppose I want to pull it back a little bit because we're talking about witchcraft you know a person sees Abracadabra they poke their wand they see it doesn't work so you see that there's magic that's not real but then we have real magic and I'm going to go back to could you tell us a little bit about the angels that came toan and I suppose this is going to lay the foundation for what really is alhamdulillah first of all just I want to add something regarding children Muslim children and Muslim parents we have to fear Allah subhana wa tala and we have to educate our children islamically and we have to build up their AA and strengthen the belief in their hearts so when they see such things they know these things are rubbish because they have this firm faith and belief this Doctrine has been drilled into their hearts that what we have to do otherwise they will be just victims and they will be brainwashed through the media coming to to the issue of the the is a reality as we mentioned the ruling in Islam for a person who studies the that he is out of Islam it leads to apostasy and the punishment is capital punishment and the evidence isah Bak that when he sent the first magic started practiced is by the Babylonians in Babylon so Allah sent down the two angels harut marut these were two angels not that because they are fairy tales about harut and Mar they were tempted by you know that lady and Venus by the all these things are not true two angels sent down as a test so Allah can test Us by anything and if someone POS the question but the Angels they don't teach anything kuur but if Allah told them to do so they cannot disobey Allah Allah they cannot disobey Allah but before teaching anyone take care we are going to teach you but we are only a trial and test so don't become a disbeliever which means if you learn magic you become a disbeliever indeed now before we go into more details with this insh we're going to go to a very short break it's uh interesting the discussion where it's going so dear viewers do stay tuned inshallah and we'll be back after a very short moment [Music] welcome back dear viewers we're here with our dear discussing the topic of Witchcraft and sorcery now before the bra you were talking about these two angels that came to now as you rightfully mentioned that these were a trial they came to test mankind now what is it that they came to test mankind with first of all as Allah said so the ones that teach the people are the so those two angels they were in Babylon did not teach people magic and people thought that the reason behind his power that he was controlling the demons the Devils through magic it's the Quran that came to say that no Salomon did not disbelieve but the Devils did they were teaching the people and the they said that Sanam or Solomon he took the books of magic from the Jin and put them in a locker after the death ofan came to bani is and told them you want to know the secret behind the power of Solomon magic see he was using this books it's the Quran told us that or Solomon did not commit but these are the books that the used and by the way even the or thein they don't know the Unseen we all know the story he died is standing and they were working and they did not realize that Sanam is dead till the insect at the staff and he fell down then and only then they realize now is is a belief and a person learns it this will take him out of the fault of Islam there are many types of mentioned the casting the spell some types of the can kill okay because they are using the Gin some types of like for example a man cannot approach his partner and attraction yes either they make you love your wife too much that you are crazy about her and that's why most of the customers with all due respect to the sisters are the woman the customers of The Magicians are women okay because for example one will tell the other do you want to control your husband keep him just like a ring in your finger that he would not ever think of marrying another woman I know he a magician you can visit him and but of course he charges a lot and he's ready to give and he will ask for something like hair or because that exactly what happened to the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam and then all of a sudden this man he was used to be kind beautiful to his parents all of night he hates his parents now you've brought up two interesting points here which might not make sense at first we've mentioned that the Jin who are the ones that the magicians use to put their magic into effect you've mentioned that they don't know the Unseen in reality they're powerless other than the power that Allah has given them but now on the other hand we're seeing that this magic which the Jin are involved in can have certain effects so how can it be that the Jin are powerless on one hand but yet magic seems to have an effect the answer in the same Ayah we read they cannot harm anyone by this except by the will of Allah so Allah is allowing this to happen perhaps as a test a trial universally okay you're taking me now to the will Allah will it universally not legally because the will are two types the universal will and the legal will in nutshell Universal will thinks that Allah does not lie but yet he allows these things to take place in his kingdom for a Divine wisdom behind it and the legal will is what Allah loves for example he wants us to pray but not not necessarily what he loves takes place but what happens happens universally according to his will there's a Divine wisdom behind that so yes by the will of Allah subh tala so when like the time of s Omar a thief came that was CAU and when they were about to chop his hand off said ohir by Allah I stole by Allah's will and Omar said by Allah we are chopping It Off by Allah's will yes you stole according to the universal will of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and now we are also cutting it off by the will of Allah so the Allah will these things to happen because there is a Divine wisdom behind it so what is the magic that's forbidden is it just the are we saying every single magic even the ones that lead to it yeah so in Islam one of the principles what leads to the Haram is Haram one of the principles of the Shar and this is the beauty anything the Avenue that will lead to Haram is Haram Avenue leads to kufur is kufur because there is one principle in the okay so the ruling that you apply to the goal is applied to the means that's if it's proven that this is going to lead to if it is leading that way now this Muslims call they differentiated differentiated between the which causes harm and S kills people and causing drift among the spouses and this is of course the one that the sh the other type which is trickery or or skill illusion illusions that is different one and the rulings are different alhamdulillah I believe that the the topic of magic alhamdulillah we've entered into it quite a little bit there's still a little bit more to go but unfortunately we have run out of time so may Allah reward you dear for the contribution to this topic and may Allah also reward you our dear viewers and I hope inshallah that you've benefited from this program as much as we
