  "transcript": "first question about the month of rajab and shaan this requires a lot of talk about it and I'm afraid this is not the right platform to do so but in a nutshell what circulates in social media and WhatsApp this is not authentic Hadith so you should not uh uh make Dua in it regarding the month of rajab the month of rajab is one of the Sacred four months of the year so we have the month of Mam and rajab three andam are in a row the 11th the 12th and the first month of the lunar year while rajab which we are presently in is the seventh year the seventh month of the lunar year they are s sacred in the sense that Allah instructed us as in Surah chapter n that Allah made them sacred and we should not transgress or wrong ourselves by committing sins so it has this uh uh blessing of it that one should be careful not to sin as usually done in other months though sin is Haram in all the months of the year 247 but it has more gravity to it seriousness in these four months what people think that fasting in rajab is recommended this is baseless the prophet Alam was not reported that he used to fast exceptionally in rajab it was like any other month what people report that on the 27th of this month it is the night of is the night Journey the miraculous night journey I don't know what they call it in uru because most of these Innovations come to us from there where they say shabat or maybe this is the the middle of shaan and something else similar to it this is all baseless and it has no uh um advantage or Edge over any other night and to specify it with or any other Sal this is an innovation and it is prohibited the month of shaan is different the prophet used to fast a lot of it and he used to justify this by saying a lot of the people are neglectful because it's before Ramadan and it's after rajab which is a sacred month and people are neglectful they don't pay attention to it so I'd like to fast and he used to fast a lot of it if not all so this is recommended having a night in the middle of Shan the 15th of Shan thinking that is sacred and one should pray ETA of these innovated prayers all of this is baseless and Allah knows best uh Fus from"
