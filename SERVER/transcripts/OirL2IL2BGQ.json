  "transcript": "in alhamdulillah [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] overcome [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign says in what translates to in the Quran and Allah has made for you from your homes a place of rest and made for you from the hides of the animals tense which you find light on your day of travel and your day of encampment and from their wool fur and hair is furnishing and enjoyment for a Time these homes we live in are one of the greatest blessings of Allah upon us and Allah's blessings are countless unfortunately the silent killer is our ingratitude to whatever Allah grants us how many of us complain and whine about trivial things while many of our Muslim Brothers are homeless Under the Sun under the rain under the wind some of them even cross the Seas and deserts looking for a better life while we have all of these blessings and favors of Allah yet we fail to show our gratitude to him every boy and girl dream of the day when Allah azzawajal grants him his name his favor so that they can rejoin Under One Roof and establish a Muslim family these homes we live in are the first brick in order to build an Islamic society and community if these homes were fine then our societies and communities would be fine and when we speak about Islamic homes certainly we're not referring to the fabric whether it's made of concrete clay or wood rather we are talking about what makes a home Islamic or unislamic and this is what happens inside the home the level of Iman the inhabitants of these homes have so you as a Muslim must ask yourself a question right now today before Allah asks you this question on the day of judgment and before that in your grave is your home an Islamic home or it is it not Islamic every home before you build it you have to establish the foundation and the foundation of a Muslim home is the correct and wise decision of your life partner the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says if there comes to you one whose religious commitment and attitude pleases you then marry your female relative who's under your care to him so Choice number one Choose Wisely the man that proposes to your daughter or to your sister and as a man you have to also choose the right wife it's not what many of us may jump to choose the prophet says a woman may be married for four reasons a woman is sought after for four reasons her wealth her lineage her beauty and her religious commitment therefore seek the one who's religiously committed may your hand be rubbed with dust which means may you prosperous if you do so home the man and his wife have mutual concerns they respect one another they care for one another and respect is an essential pillar of marriage the moment you see a house that has no respect let it be known that this is an unislamic marriage an unislamic let me rephrase that and an Islamic home and the children would be brought up in a miserable fashion and way the wife respects her husband and appreciate whatever he does the man encourages his wife and appreciates whatever she does there is no criticism there is no ridiculing and this is how the children grow up to see love compassion and respect Imam Ahmed says about his wife um he said I lived with um Saleh for 20 years never argued or disputed upon one word what kind of a marriage is this the woman in this Muslim home is a righteous perfect role model for the children there's no shouting there's no abuse there is no nagging or annoying of the husband may Allah be pleased with her our mother the prophet came to her and said oh Khadija jibril is giving you the Glad Tiding of a house in gen made of a pearl where you will not hear loud noise nor there will be any form of hard work for you because this is the life she gave to the prophet Allah what happens inside of our Muslim homes there is no music there's no forms of Haram entertainment Netflix show time and the likes rather it is all remembering Allah azzawajal so is it a Masjid no it's not a Masjid but everything revolves around remembering Allah the prophet says the similitude of a house where people remember Allah and a house where people do not remember Allah the similarity is like the death the dead person and a living person look at our homes today they're filled with music with movies the soap operas with social media with Tick Tock with Instagram rarely you will find people remembering Allah azzawajal making thicker reciting the Quran our Muslim homes when we enter we don't shout we don't demand we don't curse rather we give Salam Allah says but when you enter the houses greet one another with a greeting from Allah that is saying assalamu alaikum and it is a how where prayer instructed us Allah when he said make a portion of your prayer in your homes and don't make them as graveyards how many of us check on their household their children their wives those who live there if they pray or not our Muslim homes are filled with people loved by Allah azzawajal how do you know Sheikh well the prophet told us that when Allah Wills good for the people of a household he introduces kindness among them so if your home is a Muslim home all those living inside it must love one another but when they fight when they bicker when they have Envy when they have problems all the time you have a problem and this is why this kindness that Allah loves in our homes reflects on how we treat our servants and Maids and drivers the prophet says about slaves not about free men and women about slaves he says your slaves are your brothers whom Allah has put under your command so whoever has a brother under his command should feed him of what he eats and dress him of what he wears do not ask your slaves to do things beyond their capacity and if you do so then help them these are your slaves whom you buy and sell which we don't have at recent and modern times what about the free men and women whom we bring from their countries to work in our homes how do we treat them shouting scolding swearing cursing this is not a Muslim home the prophet was once asked oh prophet of Allah how many times should we forgive our servant our servants make mistakes so how many times should we forgive them the prophet said 70 times per day seventy times per day and we notice a fly when it flies around the house and blamed the maid or the driver for that in our Muslim homes you don't hear curse words you don't hear the vulgar and profanity because the prophet said the believer that you and me the believer does not slander curse or speak in an obscene or foul manner in our Muslim homes we should bring the children with love and compassion and not continuous reprimanding and blaming and criticizing you have to teach them in kindness because this is a long-term investment it's not something you just want to get out of your chest by shouting and scolding and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to teach your children by saying oh boy eat from in front of you and eat with your right hand this is how the prophet used to deal with children and those who live in Muslim homes are kind to their neighbors they don't harm them they don't blast the music they don't throw trash in front of them they don't let the water run into their homes because the prophet said no one from whose harm his neighbor is not safe will inter-paradise if your neighbor is not safe from your harm you will not enter Paradise and one of the main characteristics of those who live in a Muslim home is that they make Dua to Allah azzawajal throughout the day and night and they say and those who say our Lord bestow on us from our spouses and our of our Offspring who will be the comfort of our eyes and make us leaders of the muttakeen so they make constant Dua to Allah azzawajal because they know they're nothing without the help of Allah what about financial expenditures Muslim homes are based on halal so the earning of the people living in these homes are also from Halal there is no River there is no deceit there is no lying there's no bribery there is nothing that angers Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala because they know that the prophet said everybody that is nourished with Haram food the fire is more fitting for it and when they spend they spend wisely there's no extravagance but at the same time they're not Miser or stingy they give they make their children enjoy life but without extravagance Allah says and let not your hand be tied like a miser to your neck nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach like a spendthrift so that you become blames worthy and in severe poverty foreign [Music] foreign the people living in such Muslim homes are known to be bashful to be modest and to be chaste this is why they make it as a rule of thumb not to attend mixed gatherings mixed weddings there is no free mixing between the genders in or out of these homes because they are proper Muslims amen came to the prophet Allah and when he heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam say beware of entering upon women this is a clear directive from the prophet Allah so the man said o messenger of Allah what about the in-laws so you're telling us not to allow Nan mahram to enter upon my wife what about the in-laws my brother my uncle I trust them they're close to me my brother-in-law he's married to my sister I trust them so the prophet said in law is death full stop look at our homes today Muslim homes where we have joint families and you would see pure Injustice free mixing between the in-laws and hideous things happen but all under the carpet the parents choose their daughter-in-law not to marry their son but rather to become a maid the humiliator not all but I'm talking about the non-muslim homes the Muslim homes this does not take place they're humiliated they enslave her they tell their their son to abuse her don't take her to a restaurant don't take her to her family's house except once every six months for six hours and then send her back don't treat her like a wife like a woman do not treat her like a human being and I have cases like this every single day and it's heartbreaking to see those who claim to be Muslims treating their daughter-in-law like this they want their son to break her as if she's a wild horse these are not Muslims they're alone to be humans these are not Muslim homes where there is justice where it is where there is fairness where there is humanity in our Muslim homes you come you would never see a portrait of the family head let alone of the girls and their children and the extended family hanging on the walls in a Muslim home you will not find Idols of Buddha or an elephant or Dolphins made of crystals why these are artifacts these are beautiful souvenirs we bought when we traveled to foreign countries they don't have this simply because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the Angels do not enter a house where there's a statue or a portrait or a dog I've seen in Muslim countries youngsters with ponytails dragging dogs around the streets of the neighborhood don't they know that this is forbidden in Islam it is forbidden but it's cool Sheikh it's cool well this coolness is causing you and your parents a great deal of hasanat the prophet says Allah whoever keeps a dog in his house that is not a shepherd dog and is not a dog for hunting for game Allah would deduct from his hasanat every day the weight of Mount ushud who Among Us can afford Mount Hood of hasanat per day and this is happening every single day so a Muslim home does not have these things that go against Islam and it's not me who's saying it's Haram it's our Prophet Muhammad alaihissalam who we pray every single day that Allah would resurrect us under his flag we could go on and on talking about the characteristics of a Muslim home but this is a Friday hotba and the time is limited if we manage to scrutinize our homes when we go back and check is my home a Muslim home am I living an Islamic life as Allah wills it or am I Dr Jekyll in the Masjid Mr Hyde when I go to my home this is a very important point that each and every one of us should adhere to we have to walk the talk we have to implement what we know because this knowledge will backfire if we don't implement it and apply it Allah foreign"
