  "transcript": "under the layer of blood I mean was saw that was Sally Mally hot Amin Amin I'm nabina muhammad wada l he was savage my dear brothers and sisters assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh and welcome back to a brand new episode of contemporary filth issues we have with us again in the studio our special guest she Rossum the new friend Hakim Shah house and welcome Zach muhajirun thank you for having me Beckham awesome is one of the well-known callers and Diet was traveled extensively across the globe giving Dawa and lectures to both Muslims and non-muslims alike Shia Hassan in the last episode you were discussing with us and with the viewers the issue of insurance and the different types and what contract it falls into in terms of buying and selling and why it's impressive all because of the issues of chance and uncertainty and how it resembles gambling what about different types of insurance for example some people say well what about insurance for life I know I'm gonna die what about social insurance medical insurance are these also impermissible sui-lan handling salat wa salam are also dealing you know early he was our humanity Devi Hooda there is some similarity and some of what you've mentioned is permissible and some which is a majority is not and let's start with the majority life insurance is not permissible because there is a great deal of uncertainty there's also a great deal of riba in it as mentioned before and when you pay your monthly fees or your annual fees the chances that you may die instantly just after writing the policy hamdulillah yet hong kong law yeah they go aside and there is a possibility that the contract goes on until you're 80 years old and yourself paying money so the company made double or triple the profit they were hoping that you would give them therefore it falls under the same category of uncertainty and of gambling what about social medical same thing medical insurance is the same thing because you pay a thousand dollars you may end up by not you someone would end up by god forbid a cancer treatment that costs a hundred thousand or a bypass surgery or a kidney transplant or whatever and it's extremely expensive and there's a chance that the majority of people who are healthy people keep on living without any problem and the company is getting richer and richer and their money is down the drain and in a survey in Germany I believe they said that what is returned to the people from what they paid to insurance companies does not exceed 3% enola so the company is making ninety seven percent profit that's like we said in the last episode like like a casino the house always wins they wouldn't be doing this if they weren't collecting big sums of money this is the well-known fact and in the last economical cruncher or what they call it the recession the reason of the recession was the collaboration between insurance companies and the banks the banks sells houses to the people by mortgage which is complexed interest which is RIBA that is forbidden in Islam it's not allowed in Islam because of the harm it causes people and because it devours the wealth of the people unlawfully and and and the price is not fixed in Islam you cannot sell something like this and this is one of the beautiful aspects of transactions in Islam if I sell you a product the transaction is not valid until the final price is mentioned from the initial day before the contract is signed but for example I sell you my house for X of money no matter what happens I can never ever add a penny over that amount which we signed for whether the duration is one year or a hundred years because everything was stated in black and white elsewhere is not the same because they go on and saying that it depends on inflation it depends on the interest rate and it depends whether you were late if you're a month or two late in payment we will add more interest to you it's being complex interests it's kind of like like the Mafia in a way it's like it lacks that mercy and that human decency if you can't pay on time well you know what you're gonna pay even more and even more and every time you're late because you have trouble paying back what you owed initially we're gonna take even more from you and you know what if you can't pay after that we're gonna kick you out we're gonna seize your house seize your property and leave you with nothing this is the same act of and the Merchant of Venice they'll take a piece of you in return for the money that you did not pay off and this is what they had done they force people to for foreclosure they had to give and surrender their houses because they cannot pay for them the banks were happy at the very beginning and they started collecting these houses and but then the real estate prices went down and the banks were stuck with houses and all of their assets and money is out one of the reasons also is because the more people are getting kicked out of their house the more the value of the neighborhood's gonna go down and the insurance companies were related to the banks because also they were dealing in RIBA and investing in these banks and then the insurance companies fell as well because they don't have money to pay so it's a whole picture we're told a Gable and haram yeah they get richer and the poor get poorer and islamically this is not allowed this is concerning life insurance medical insurance property insurance it's all the same the concept is same educational insurance for example it's the same thing now when it comes to social insurance or the retirement benefits it's a little bit different and it depends from one country to the other if it's government-run then the social insurance or the retirement funds that they give to those who retire it's from the government and every citizen has right and what the government has in the sense that it's one country it's the collective wealth of the country yes it's not for an individual and that is why we call it the baton mal in Islam which is the Treasury yes the Treasury in Muslim countries is responsible for their welfare it's responsible for their medical treatment it's responsible for their education if one of them borrowed money and was unable to pay it back and it he was sincere in paying it back and we look into his case and he doesn't have money to pay back the Treasury is supposed to pay him up paid off not push him in the corner and ask more and more from him and this is Islamic way of treating your subjects mercy and compassion and if we have access money this would not be stored for the fortunate it would be distributed among the people so you focus on the infrastructure you focus on the country you focus on the welfare of the people this is what Roman hop-hop used to do may Allah be pleased with him we even find in some cases in the history of Islam that if they had an excess of money in the Treasury they would use it to help the youth get married definitely true and unfortunately this is not being practiced nowadays the richer gets rich and the poor get poor social insurance if being paid by the government and if it it is under the Islamic rules and laws this is permissible for you to benefit from why because again I'm taking it from the government it's your own money in a sense most company most countries do this Islamic countries that I know of they extract part of your income like let's say nine percent and they force the company that you work for it to pay a similar amount which is another nine percent or the government itself invests and pays nine percent and they all put this in the organization where they invest it the government does this investment so at the end of the day if the man retires or if the man dies daily gets breaks a leg or something happens that he could no longer work they give him compensation they take care of his treatment and they gave they give him a monthly salary or for his family after that after he dies and this is Islamic but it's not Islamic as in the case in countries like the stage the the Europe in Singapore etc where you work and you give this company money for your retirement its private company yes so you give them like ten fifteen twenty percent depending on what the salary you want to be after you retire and they invest the money whether they win or lose it's their problem they have a percentage that I'm giving them monthly and I don't care if they when good make good deals or lose or be bankrupt this is their problem I have to get what we have agreed upon this falls under forbidden insurance and forbidden transactions because it's is based on gambling it's a third party that has nothing to do with my welfare and they're basically profit oriented they're looking to make money yes that's true chuckle ah hi I'm Michele we'd like to continue the discussion but right after the break cinematic omar fly over a kettle you you [Music] we leave to strive to know the ruling of the Sharia on a particular incident why scholars had to put a lot of effort trying to figure out how to give the ruling on such topics and issues Islam tells you to look good to smell good the reason of the recession was the collaboration between insurance companies and the banks some scholars though stated that it is permissible for you to insure because you're compelled to do this by the government by law but you're not allowed to benefit from the insurance policy [Music] you Salam alaikum welcome to live our Kato and welcome back chef just before the break you were discussing with us the different types of insurance is and why it's a social evil that causes so much harm to the people at large Muslim and non-muslim alike you talked about different types of insurance which types would be permissible if it wasn't profit oriented for example some government institutions which protect the rights of people and look after them let's say if they get sick or if God forbid if they if they die prematurely leaving a family behind but what about people who say even if the contract is invalid even if the contract is Haram we both agreed I agree the insurance company agrees why can't we do it well this is a justifiable allegation sort of to speak but in Islam it's not only agreement because you can have to again to kill one another in a feud for example and that does not make it permissible you can have to agreeing on fornication a prostitute and a man who pays money for his his desire this would not make it permissible in Islam it's not even legal so the agreement between the two does not justify you can have someone selling a heroin for you for foreign for a junkie and both are in agreement and they love each other but this does not make it permissible we have to go back to the roots and we have to look at the fundamentals or an asana if this kind of transaction is approved then it's legitimate if not even if there is an agreement between the two it's still forbidden so even if the whole society agrees even if it's legal in the society your family agrees your mother agrees your father agrees you agree it's not it's not a condition that's true this is not admits to a lock you have to go back to the fundamentals balaclava Kamisha what about in cases laws we know and I'm not sure about in Muslim countries but in Western countries for example there's a lot of cases where institutionally with the government for example you're forced to have insurance for example when it comes to buying automobiles now an automobile might not necessarily be obligatory to own you're not harming yourself if you don't know anyone but it's become a necessity of life what about someone who can't get a car because they can't deal with insurance what what would be the solution in that case well scholars said that in cases of necessity you can have insurance if you're compelled if you it's mandatory by law to have insurance you can have insurance but they differ in the result so for example where I come from it's mandatory to have a third party insurance for your car so we pay this we pay like a hundred dollars annually and if I can an accident happens the company pays the third party so whoever had damages they'll pay him off but they'll not fix my car okay this is mandatory if you don't do it they'll find you and they'll not renew your driving license your car license etc so scholars came up with an opinion stating that this is permissible because you're forced it's like a person stranded in in the desert and is about to die he is starving to death and he finds a dead meat or a donkey's meat which is not permissible to eat but because of necessity it becomes halal what what's the proof though from the Quran or from the Sun of that in cases of necessity you can do these things for monitory laravel in when I had whoever is compelled by necessity and he is not going to extravagant he's not going over it so if he's thirsty and dying of thirst and he has this bottle of champagne from him he's not drinking at all he's just drinking just enough to survive yes and yet with the bottle of champagne chef ami Allah have mercy on his soul said that even though you're gonna die out of thirst it's not permissible to you to drink champagne or wine because it's gonna make you thirsty or it's gonna act your thirst because we have to look also medically if it's going to actually help might be dying of thirst in the desert for example he doesn't know that per specific ruling or the scientific evidence behind it he just thinks that he's gonna die of thirst and if he doesn't drink this he's gonna die but he wouldn't be sinful and drinking it's no but he would be sinful and having a feast over mm-hmm he's having like a toast and and finishing the whole bottle giving himself Cheers yeah this is not that not definitely not the case because it's only as part of the necessity and that is why some scholars though stated that it is permissible for you to ensure because you're compelled to do this by the government by law but you're not allowed to benefit from the insurance policies meaning that I paid $100 and then I had an accident and the company the insurer insurance company compensated me with $500 mm-hmm these scholars say that I'm allowed to take only 100 that are paid and the $400 I have to give to charity and would this be the more correct opinion in your in your this is one opinion the second opinion states that this is not logical though I did not agree on this contract but the companies are getting richer and richer and by law because I was compelled by government laws to ensure then if I was compensated for something that happened to me that this would only be fair because I was not in agreement with it and I'm compelled to pay so why wouldn't I be compelled to take and when you look at it from a logical way point of view I did not go into this transaction with my own will I'm forced to do it and the companies are getting richer and richer so if I say well listen I'm not gonna take the money I'm not getting a benefit of it it's coming without me asking it is exactly like medical insurance in most companies by law you have to have medical insurance so if I don't have medical insurance they're not gonna employ me and they employ me and I make medical insurance policies and then don't benefit of it I'm just spending money down the drain so what about a company for example that won't hire you unless you have your you have the credentials you're qualified for the job but they just won't hire you unless you have this one aspect of insurance which is how long as you discussed can you fake a paper and lie about it in order to avoid doing that hot on deed some scholars say that it is permissible to do such a thing I follow the opinion that says you cannot lie at all whether to Muslims or non-muslims alike you are a Muslim and one of the characteristics of a Muslim is being truthful now acknowledge the fact that they would not allow me to get the job without this insurance policy but faking such a paper is not the way out because I'll be lying to them but it's in lying a lesser sin than involved in yourself in gambling for example if there is no other way out if all companies deal in this fashion well I have to do it but if it's only a B or C companies Angola for another job yes so if it's it's the trend in the company it's if it's the government trend then I'm forced to do this and I go with the opinion that yes because I'm compelled I may benefit from the medical insurance or from the car insurance because it's compelled it's something that I did not do with my own will so there is no reason why to pay them and not to benefit from them I have to if this takes place but some people go to a little bit more extreme so if the company tells them that you're a B Class insurance they say okay if I'm compelled to pay I'll pay the big class but I'd like to get an upgrade into eight so I'll pay extra money to get our better an out or do it they're going beyond what they've been forced to do yes this is again becomes how llamas and it's not permissible that's all I'll finish it we mentioned then briefly like you can look for other jobs if you have the opportunity to look for another job then you're compelled to do so which brings us to the next point that a lot of Muslims now we deal with transactions we deal with import and export and for these issues specifically it's almost impossible to deal with these jobs which are widespread without involving yourself in insurance so what's the answer for this if everyone's doing it if it's so widespread can we involve ourselves in it okay that's a good question because Muslims should not be reactive shouldn't be sheep they should be proactive why wait until a problem happens you always have to give solutions ahead of time so those who say insurance is Haram they're right but when you tell the people the whole country the whole nation sit down don't work don't trade don't have any commerce don't import don't export because all of this needs insurance then you're actually hurdling the process of progress in the Ummah so what's the answer some say let's deal with conventional commercial insurance because you would like to progress this is not the way out the way out is to have an alternative and Islamic alternative and this is funny because every time someone comes up with the concept of Islamic solution you'll find that it is an Islamic but being sugar-coated presented as Islam yes well we have an Islamic solution which is which is called a cooperative insurance and the concept of it is cooperation donation not anticipation of something to come in return for you mm-hmm a person they collaborate they come and they say listen let's make a wallet and put into it X amount of money so everyone puts a thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars or whatever and they collect a huge amount of money and they agree upon themselves whoever had as a calamity a problem a crisis and needs to be compensated we will give him from this wallet this mean it's like a community is like a kind of a community charity to take care of who needs to be taken care of sort of it's not as a cat not as I care but okay and at the end of the day and this is a difference between it and the conventional way of dealing if the conventional insurance company was faced with a crisis where for example we have tremendous earthquakes and volcanoes and and and and and burnings and fires that consumed everything they're compelled to pay but they don't have the money to pay it's not my problem they would borrow from banks with interest and they would do this and that all had on things to given in the money and cooperative insurance it's not like this the minute the money runs out from the wallet we apologize to those who come and claims and listen we ran out of money so either the members inject more or tough luck this is it you have no right to say but I paid my share because this is cooperative you it's a form of donation the tricky thing is that you have to really be careful on what you call an Islamic cooperative insurance from the others because so many Islamic co-operative insurance companies claim to be Islamic and they're not there is they're taking advantage of the Muslims need for this how do they do they do this they take your money and they say this is cooperative insurance and they go to conventional insurance companies with a lesser 20% to 30% fees and they insure so they take the money they get richer they give bonuses to their managers if they're investing money the stock holders get richer and it is it becomes out of context it doesn't become cooperative anymore it becomes profit-making company exactly like the conventional one about Africa misshape so what we understand basically from this is that insurance in general because a deal with chance it deals with uncertainty it deals with whenever it deals with many things usury many things that are considered major sins gambling that the Muslims should avoid it at all costs unless in cases of necessity in such a case the Muslim is not responsible and they have the you have any alternative but we have to be careful when approaching that alternative that is in fact genuine that's true huckle hiding mushiya we'd love to continue but unfortunately we're just out of out of out of time join us again next week in sha allah said i ma take them welcome to la he will but okay you"
