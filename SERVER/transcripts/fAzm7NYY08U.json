  "transcript": "so Sonova says can we pray can we pay someone's loans through our zakat money this is a common question if the loan was taken for a necessity someone had to borrow to pay for his wives surgery which he did not have money for someone got into a business and lost his money and all the debtors want their money the business was legitimate it was first major the warehouse was burnt to the ground and he lost everything someone had to reconcile between two tribes who were going to fight and kill one another so he committed himself to give them this much and give that those this much and maybe cook some food for them all of these are classified in verse 60 chapter 9 as owari mean well very mean so they have that and we can pay their debts from the cat we don't not have to give it to them we can go immediately to the one who lent them and pay the loan off now not every loan we can give to the cat for example if I purchase a fancy car for five six hundred thousand reals in installments I can't come in Ramadan and say people I have a loan helped me pay it off if I'm building a big mansion worth of millions and I borrowed the money I can't come and ask for the cat to be paid off because this is not a legitimate source of borrowing in order to get the cat to pay it off in Allah knows best"
