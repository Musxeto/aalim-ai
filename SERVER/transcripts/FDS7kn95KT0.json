  "transcript": "we have two more questions question is asking if I'm asked to give money that corrup if I'm Tooney to money out as a [Music] of the Prophet saidat may Allah curse those who give bribes and take bribes say aan the [Music] people that's why you heard only two people say I mean but then what are you doing I didn't understand he said I mean I said I mean so this is a major sin however Allah had made life easy and when things get real tight Islam makes it wide and when it's too wide Islam restricts it and makes it tight meaning if I am forced to give a bribe to get what is lawfully mine or to protect myself from what is unlawfully being put on me it is halal meaning I bring a car from Japan and when it comes to the Customs all the paperwork is good everything is kosher according to the sh the official is sitting there smoking and they says uh papers are missing you have to pay a fine of 1 million Shillings or we have to take your car back to Japan and you have to pay the price of the fright and blah blah blah everything is legal said no it's not legal what are you going to do so you know definitely he's not going to release your car which is your car which is everything is legal and Hal until you give him something from underneath the table what should I do give him because I have to get my rights this is my right this is my Halal likewise I'm sitting in my office in my shop and the municipality inspector comes and looks the lights are broken you have to pay a fine of 100,000 Shillings good so no no I see it broken what are you going to do so what do you want give me 500 Shillings I will go away what should I do I give him 500 Shillings and a cookie send him away but when it comes to business transactions for a company and there are 10 companies coming and the purchasing agent and usually the purchasing officer is the most corrupt unfortunately and with all du respect don't no offense but this is what's happening because anyone they want to buy something from they have to give something had we call it and they say you have to give us this or we will not award you the contract although your prices are the cheapest and your quality is the best what should I do no don't give them a bribe but she my business will not be awarded well Allah did not make your risk with them go somewhere else because this is not your god-given right to take this is not your H unlike their car which is your H unlike defending your shop from a Haram fine because of a light this is different so I hope this answers your question"
