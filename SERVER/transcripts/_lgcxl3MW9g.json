  "transcript": "is there anyone that we can make for stopping us in a specific dua I do not know however if you sincere and wanting to stop your sin you should realize that Allah is watching you before you do your sin are you preparing for it a day or two before are you spending money are you taking an appointment you have to cancel all of these and make a new environment for yourself if you are unable to quit a particular sin this means that you have a lot of free time in your hand and that Shaitaan is controlling you you should try your level best to associate yourself yourself with people who would all the time be around you be with you support you practicing people so by this you would limit the control of Shaitaan and limit the time that is free for you to go and sin and again you have to when you prostrate when it is time between Iran and a comma when you finish your tisha hood before the Salam in your prayer you have to supplicate a lot to Allah that Allah relieve me of my sins that I have committed and I'm unable to quit the more you do the more you have sincerity to Allah so tell them all you will find Allah doing that for you"
