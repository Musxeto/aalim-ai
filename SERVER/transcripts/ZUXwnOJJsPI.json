  "transcript": "sheikh my question is if we perform the witcher prayer with the congregation then when the imam resets will we say amin in loudly or in a silent voice for examples when the imam says then should i say i mean loudly or silently you should say it you should say it in a voice that you can hear but the shouting that we hear in the haram and in other masjids and people say ah me and the whole masjid is shaking this is not part of the sun now you just say ami and that's it and allah knows best"
