  "transcript": "he says in mauritania they sit around the grave a group of people and they write lines and each one recites a verse of the quran usually fatiha the last three calls or whatever and they dedicate this to the deceased and make some dhikr this is something that is not related to islam regardless of the country now you ask yourself one did the prophet ever do such a thing allah the answer is no did his companions ever do such a thing the answer is no on the contrary the prophet used to teach his companions when they were burying one of the muslims ask seek forgiveness for your brother and ask allah to make him steadfast because now he's being questioned no fatiha no no he has seen nothing no writing lines to remember who said what and who said uh this or that so all of these are innovations because they're doing it as part of the religion it's not a microphone in a masjid to enhance the sound it's not air conditioners to fix the temperature they're doing it to get closer to allah and to benefit the deceased and all of this is not part of islam"
