  "title": "Is it sunnah to say the dhikr after salah in a loud voice? #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I read in Islam q that after Salah in a mild voice is except except what doing after Salah in voice except okay but when I apply in the after the problem is the whole mid hears only my voice because the mid is silent so how should I do it properly this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and the reason behind that is a Hadith that was narrated by may Allah be pleased with him and with his father the cousin of the Prophet Alam Abdullah Abbas he said we at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam who were not in the Masjid at the time knew that they finished Salat by their raising their voices with the now this Hadith caused a lot of confusion especially for those from the subcontinent who immediately after giving they sayb what are you doing said this is what abas said then they say this is wrong the Hadith was referring to what is known in Arabic as what is that he was referring to thear the whole by one single word which is like when the Arabs say here comes the two we have one Omar they're referring to Abu Bakr and Omar so instead of saying here comes Abu Bakr and Omar they say the two came and also mother said we did not lit light fire in the houses of the Prophet to cook for two months so when she was asked what was your foood she said the two blacksan what are they dates and water whoa dates are is black but water so this is called when you look at the Sun and the Moon you say alar the two moons so this is what the companion said meaning that they would raise their voices and so on but what to be said immediately after Salam is mentioned in the Hadith ofan the servant of the Prophet alai he used to say the prophet whenever he concluded his Salat he used to say immediately this is the first thing you say secondly raising their voices is problematic why because there are other hadiths that the prophet ordered them to lower their voices he once came out and saw them engaging in Dua and in in loud voice so he reprimanded them and said lower your voices because you're not calling someone who's deaf or far away you're calling someone who is all hearing all responding and close to you so they lowered their voices albani says to me it seems that in the beginning they were ordered to raise their voices with VI so that it would propagate The Message of Islam and show the enemies of Islam the strength and power of Islam but after people learned the AAR and it became part of their lives they were ordered to lower their voices so that they would not harm others and this is noticeable if you're sitting in the Masjid doing your AAR after the the conclusion of the prayer and another Jama starts and the IM recites the fa and another Surah in the second Jama you're totally distracted you can't even recite aat yourself because you're listening to him reading the fa and you're mixed up so my advice to you do not whisper and do not raise your voice with thear just simply say it in a tone that you only hear it by saying Subhan Allah Subhan Allah Subhan Allah rather than doing raising it and everybody's looking at you what is this guy doing some of the brothers do this in masjids and it's annoying I can do it louder than you do this it's not a competition and Allah Knows Best"
