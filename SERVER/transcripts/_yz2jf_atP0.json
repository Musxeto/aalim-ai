  "title": "Protests and Demonstrations for Muslims against Discrimination - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that the citizen amendment bill CA B has been passed in India which discriminates against Muslims and denies them citizenship and leaves them stateless every day we are having hundreds of demonstrations throughout India is it permissible to take part in a peaceful protest rallies against it first of all no matter how sad situations are in a country the Muslims must get together and must unite and must follow the Quran and the Sunna and this is not a choice this is an obligation now so many times our desires our feelings drive us somewhere where the Shariat drives us another and this is when a person's Eman is tested so many times we would like to do something but Islam prohibits it and this is a test from allah azza wajal at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam when prayer was mandated upon the muslims in mecca they used to pray in the direction of Jerusalem but because they were in Mecca they most of the time tried their best to leave the Kaaba between them and Jerusalem so they would be praying towards both when they migrated to Medina Mecca was to the south Jerusalem was to the north so there was no possibility of combining so they used to pray to Jerusalem for a period of time and then this was abrogated and Allah ordered them to face Mecca allah azzawajal revealed in the Quran how the ignorant the hypocrites the Jews started to object and complain say Oh Lucifer ha Mao Elohim and ability humility can Walia those people of ignorance would say why did they change direction of their prayer their Qibla Allah tells us that the east and the west belongs to him and he subhana WA Ta'ala orders whom he wishes to face wherever he wishes this is his will we are servants of Allah he tells us to do something we do it and Allah Azza WA JAL told us that this was simply a test a fitna to those so that it would be clear who has faith and believes and hence follows and who does not and hence would refrain or would have doubts in his heart so this is a test every incident we face in life is a test should I take a bribe or should I refrain and stick to what I believe in should I do this Haram or not and this happens on daily basis now oppression transgression Voland is being inflicted in so many places in so many countries protests demonstrations and the likes are not part of Islam none of the Salif had ever done such a thing this is something that the Muslims picked from the non-muslims and it doesn't make a difference whether it's a peaceful demonstration or a violent one because inevitably the peaceful demonstrations will end up violent and you can see that clearly in the news watch any country where the laymen protest and object publicly to what's happening whether it is inflation whether it is the rising of the fuel prices whether it is for democratic reasons or otherwise and you will see violence you will see looting you will see destruction of property and you will also see rape and this is that demonstrated so the concept of peaceful is not an option again some of the brothers and sisters object and they send me a lot of emails and they say that these demonstrations and protests are approved by the government and still as Muslims we do not seek our approvals from other than the Sharia and Islam tells us that this is not lawful the khan's far exceed the pros and we see that in any person with logic with intellect can find this out you can see what riot control police does to the protesters women and men alike bashing them and beating them with sticks if not with teargas if not with rubber bullets if not with live ammunition for what we have to protest we have to make our sound hurt we have who says you have to yes nobody approves of transgression and what is happening but at the same time we cannot take means because these means are not justifiable if they are against the Sharia if you go to the great scholars of Islam Sheikh Abdulaziz amoebas share happiness a mean sheikh al albani share Raja the permanent committee for iftar they all prohibit demonstrations and protests so what's the legitimate way of doing it well first of all it is true that not everyone is going to listen so I would be joking if I said oh and Hum Dil a demonstrations stopped they will not stop they'll continue and people will not listen to what I say or what other scholars may say because this is not what they want and this is the problem with most sense so our role those who follow the Sharia is to highlight their plight and what's happening there our role is to make their sound heard but through legal means through halal means so flooding the social media with what's happening with the transgressions with the volume with the lies claiming that they are a democracy showing the world their atrocities and their injustice and their racism for only selecting Islam and targeting the Muslims this is all legal no one says that this is hatred speech like the trend now is to use anything that you say as a Muslim and condemn it as hatred speech but when the non-muslims talk against us or say anything bad about Islam this is freedom of speech this is the right of expression so your role is to spread the word to make this public to make this dominating the media and if the TV and the newspapers and the likes would not air any of this you use the social media and we have 1.7 billion Muslims who can make this alive with this inshallah there will be a difference and allah azza wajal knows best"
