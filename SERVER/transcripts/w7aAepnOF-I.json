  "transcript": "um I'm the thoughts so it's like a really bad like I don't want to mention but it's a bad right so I begin thoughts like oh if you do this then you're making Dua um it's kind of like mesing my attention with it like if you say this you make a du this will happen stuff like that so I was wondering is Dua do you have to say it verbally and you say exactly what you want in Dua or can you like yeah this my question I don't understand your question but if I may yeah try to be a little bit ahead of your question if this is generated by your OCD and it's Satan messing up with your head telling you listen if you think about this coffee mug this means that your wife is divorced and this happens a lot with OCD patients so they try to block their heads from thinking about a coffee mug and then they fall weak and could not control themselves and think about it and use it and drink of it then they come weeping to me and say I think I divorced my wife because of this no you did not this is again pathetic stupid um irrational childish you call it whatever you want not anything that Satan inserts in your head happens so if if I uh uh look at this pen I'm G to fly okay I'm G to look at it am I gonna fly of course not so these are intrusive thoughts generated by Shan only to depress you to intimidate you to make you fall in despair of Allah's mercy and the likes the simple remedy is to ignore and to block I can't she I it's overwhelming well this is your problem this is something you have to deal with either you man up and put draw the line and and put a stop to it or keep on suffering to the rest of your life nobody's going to care so thinking about something and your mind telling you that oh if you think about something then the Dua is going to happen or you're going to make Dua or you have to make Dua all of this is not applicable or logical just ignore it and don't even think about it and I hope I understood your question correctly"
