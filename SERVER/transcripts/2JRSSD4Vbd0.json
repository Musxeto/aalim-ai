  "transcript": "we have been in saudi arabia with my wife doing for business plus uh umrah in mokka and also we have visited madina so it was very hot of course but we have successfully uh performed umrah to umrah and after doing this at the end we got sick and then we came back to germany again uh as as far as our schedule but i'm asking you a question that uh getting sick is a sign of anything wrong that we have performed or i mean because so many people say going to makkah madina people get how to say healthier than sick people i mean so what is the sign of getting sick after doing this uh nobel umrah and you know performing praying in makkah modina okay okay so animal hacks question is crystal clear they performed umrah and they visited medina and they were blessed with this holy journey if it's right to say however they fell sick when they came back to germany so does this mean anything does it mean that their umrah was not accepted that allah is punishing them allah is not happy with them no it doesn't mean a thing at all it has no relationship to um your umrah or to the validity of it or allah accepting it or not accepting it it is nothing to do with it this is something that allah predestined upon you so many people come from the umrah without any illness so many people even the locals sometimes we go to makkah or to medina the difference of the weather with the air conditioning with the sweating and then the air conditioning all of a sudden makes us get the flu and we with these recent vaccines the flu is much severe than before it is more vicious but alhamdulillah no complaints we're still alive we're still kicking so there is nothing related your umbra is accepted insha allah try and do it again and again and again and allah would forgive all our sins with the grace of allah you"
