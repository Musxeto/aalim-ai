  "title": "Destiny vs Free Will. If Allah has written down everything what we do then where is our Free Will?",
  "transcript": "um my question is that um I fear that my Islam is invalid because I can't understand the um the concept of like I believe that Allah is all wise all knowing and just and he created everything but I don't understand how can we have free will and at the same time Allah is it who decreed our actions or am I misunderstand misunderstanding something please um could you clear this topic okay predestiny is related to knowledge Allah's knowledge and Allah's ability is displayed in the predestiny now you say how could it be that Allah has written my destiny and I have free will so I ask you do you have free will yes or no the answer would be yes most likely because you can't say no you don't have free will otherwise I'll put you on top of the highest high uh building in Vienna and ask you to jump and you have no other choice but but to jump because you don't have free will definitely you say no I'm not going to jump if I bring you a burning Stone a burning Co piece of coal it's burning and I said grab it with your hand said I no I'm not going to burn myself you have free will the issue is do you know what Allah has predestined for you the answer is no do you know when Allah predestined that you will die the answer is no do you know what Allah predestined that you'll get as provision what will you make in your next uh exams how your career path would be who you will marry how many children you will have or maybe you not no children at all do you know any of this he said no in this case why not sit home and wait for it to happen so no Sheik I have to study in order to get a job and I have to work in order to earn and I have to earn in order to get married so you're doing it this is your free will but you don't know what Allah predestined for you therefore trusting Allah because Allah's knowledge is not like our knowledge our knowledge is limited to three dimension to what's in this studio I don't know what's out of the door outside of the door of the studio and no one knows but Allah knows what had happened and what is happening and what will happen in the future and what would not happen in the future if it were to happen how would things be so Allah's knowledge is unlike anyone in this un Universe because he's Allah subhana tala so feel the content in your heart and don't allow shatan to mess up with you you don't know what will happen in the future but thinking positively of Allah knowing that Allah is all wise all fair all just all knowledgeable and possesses everything that he will not be unfair to any of us at all"
