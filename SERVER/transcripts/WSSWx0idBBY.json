  "transcript": "Jabar says I work in a public sector and we have a cupboard full of office supplies such as stationary etc is it okay if I take some things home for personal use definitely not this is actually known as cheating and some may consider it as stealing if your CEO or your administration manager or your supervisor so you take something home with you would he be okay with that or with would he put you for interrogation and questioning this is a breach of confidence of Trust of whatever you can't you call it this is totally prohibited and even if you have guests in your home and you present them with fruit after food though the Sunnah is to eat the fruit before the food this is a second topic another topic so even if you present them with a fruit a platter of fruit and one of them takes a back and starts putting into it different types of fruit so that he can take away with him would you be fine with that of course not even if he's your guest and part of our Islamic heritage to be hospitable but this guy is a crook what are you doing so he's taking the whole thing and putting it in his back this is cheating and it's not permissible to do at workplaces"
