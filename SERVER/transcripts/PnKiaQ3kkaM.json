  "title": "Men & women who have tattoos are cursed by Allah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and this is unfortunate among the muslim women and also among those who are called men we see tattooing i've seen tattoos on some of my mahram women and they say it's for six months and it's been a year and a half now and it's still there no doubt they are cursed by allah azzawajal because the prophet said as in the hadith allah curses the one who does this and people nowadays don't care so what let allah curse them and this is a bad indication on how a person may end his life because such people even if they pray and fast when their death comes do you think they will be successful in saying if they've been living all of their lives cursed by allah azza not caring about halal and haram only interested in following their whims and desires who cares about sharia who cares about whether allah says we're going to do whatever everybody else is doing do you think that they'll be successful in saying to be their last word that's very doubtful a person dies according to what he had lived upon not according according to what he wishes and this is why this is the most scary moment in our lives the the hour and the moment of death because we don't know what our ending is going to be"
