  "transcript": "he says did the prophet sallallaahu sell them when he said to one of his companions trust Allah but tie the camel ya knee he wants more clarification should I just lock my door or lock the door have a security system alarm system have a guard have a dog have two gunmen and he goes on living in a bulletproof house and windows and trans moving in a car as such so he wants to know what's the meaning of tying a camel this is very easy Ali a man came to the prophet a little of Sturm and said I left my camel outside should I tie the camel or should I leave it untied and come in trusting allah azza wajal to preserve it for me the prophet told him trust Allah and tie your camel they go side by side so trust and tell what cool is always side by side with taking the necessary means because if you have trust on all in allah azza wajal and full dependence without taking the necessary means this is insane and if you take the necessary means and do your due diligence and do everything you have to do but without trusting allah this is a breach of the heat this raises question marks about your Islam so they have to go side by side trusting allah azza wajal without taking the necessary means is like sitting home and saying that o allah grant me a righteous child but I'm not going to get married and I'm not going to leave the home the house this is insane you trust Allah so gel you have to get married and taking the necessary means without trusting Allah is depending on yourself what eight hours of 10 hours a day not looking or relying on Allah so agile but it's it's my power it's my knowledge that I'm gaining my paycheck and making these profits this is a breach of toe heat because now you think that you are a god that you provide for yourself that you do this there it has to go side by side now the extreme measures he mentioned it depends for me just locking the door is sufficient for someone who's in a minister or a government official he has to take guards for someone who's a ruler he has to have an army and so on so it depends on the person and the means also depend on his telecoil on Allah the all"
