  "title": "Does touching the opposite gender break wudu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the things that do not invalidate wood are numbered in the textbook with you number one is touching a person of the opposite gender so if a man touches a woman or vice versa this does not impact the world if she's a mahram then this is no problem but if she's a stranger to him this is sinful but it doesn't break your wudu the ma the vast majority of scholars say that it doesn't break your woodland only imam shafiri the shafiri school say that it does break your wudu and why is that well simply because the imam shafiri went to the quran and he found that there is an ayah which talks about wudu and about russell in means to touch the vast majority of schools of thought said no no no this is not touching this deals with intercourse and this is what the sequence of ayat will do the sequence of this ayah indicates that there are two types of ritual impurity major and minor the minor is lifted by performing wudu and the major is uplifted by performing hustle in the case of inability to use either one using water for either one then you refer to dry evolution known as tayammum and this refers to having sexual intercourse and the other reason is that the prophet himself used to kiss one of his wives and he used to go to the uh salat without renewing his wudu zubair the nephew of uh mother aisha smiled and said i bet she is you're the one who he used to kiss and go to salat without renewing his wudu and she used to smile may allah be pleased with her and this is a clear indication it does not invalidate your wudu the shafi madhhab followers don't see it this way and this is why it brings a lot of hardship to your life when you are going round the kaaba in tawaf and by mistake it is so crowded you touch women right left and center of course without your intention this invalidates your wudu then what would i do no this hardship is not part of islam having said that yes touching a woman shaking hands with a woman who's not mahram to you is a sin the prophet said allah it is best for a man to be stabbed in his head with a needle of iron rather than touching woman that is not permissible for him so this is not something that anyone of us would desire or want once they know the consequences over that you"
