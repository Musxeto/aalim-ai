  "transcript": "la manera he hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa of the he wore a suit he nabina muhammad while he was happy he has my email i am may allah have mercy on his soul wrote a beautiful book by the name of de - sovereign weather here - Shakir in which roughly translates to the tools that the patients need and the reward and the things saved by those who are grateful and in this book he spoke about the beauty of patience and of showing your gratitude that is to a larger and which is most because the self used to say a man that is belief is two halves one is patience and the other is gratitude and being thankful having said that patience has a great role in Islam if you look into the Quran itself there are 90 + 9 0 90 plus versus talking about the virtues of being patient enduring enduring what see in the Quran you are either instructed to be patient on doing what is obligatory and mandatory of volume or and patient from refraining from doing sins and thirdly you have to be patient on what a large there was Gentiles upon you and whoever succeeds in this he will gain Jenna being patient on fulfilling Allah's commands the first type of being patient so in order for you to go to the Masjid early in the morning when it's cold perform Moodle and walk to the messaging and prefetcher this requires patience those who are impatient will not wake up they will remain in the comfort and warmth of their beds and hence they would fail the test and you can cascade this - fasting - giving charity to all recommended forms of worship or obligatory the second type of patience is to refrain from doing Haram our Williams and desires tempt us we feel that we should go and do something that is prohibited we have the liking the desire for it and hence before you do something Haram remember if you're patient and you refrain and you prevent yourself from doing it you are among the patient and al-ahzar would HIGHLY reward you and elevate your level in paradise and thirdly and finally the calamities that strike us that befall upon us tribulations tests from allah azza wajal a child is sick a loved one dies poverty debts career loss so many things and and many of them we don't have a say it's not our own doing it is something that Allah is testing us with we have two choices either we are patient tolerant and say alhamdulillah because we know that this is something that Allah has decreed fifty thousand years before creating the creation so it's not gonna change or we may complain whine and make a scene out of it and the calamity will remain not change but we would fail the exam we would fail the test so this is an advice for me and for you to try our level best to try our level best to be among the patient because those are the only category whom Allah gives reward without any accountability on the day of judgment assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
