  "title": "When a husband dies",
  "transcript": "May Allahel have mercy upon the sister's husband and may Allah open the gates of paradise for him and may Allah substitute him with a house better than his and with a life better than his and with a family better than his. And when we say with a family better than his, definitely we do not mention otherwise. We're mentioning his wife when she dies and goes to paradise she would be transformed and allahel would make her better physically, mentally in in all aspect than what she was in this parad. So this dua is when when you make a dua for a deceit that Allah may substitute him a family better than his family and a wife better than his wife in this life which means that his wife here would be transformed inshallah because she will be his wife in paradise and as we uh sympathize with the sister and we grief with her this is Allah's wisdom We are born, we live our lives and we pass away, we die and inshallah we will meet our good deeds that Allah would amplify and with the grace of Allah he would erase our bad deeds and he would conceal our shortcomings. What you can do sister for uh your husband is asking Allah for forgiveness for him and continuing his legacy through good deeds. If you were blessed with offspring from him, try to upraise them uh to upbringing them, try to raise them and upbringing them in an Islamic and proper way. The prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that when a person dies, all of his good deeds are cut off. They're suspended with the exception of three things. Knowledge that is beneficial. Um a continuous charity which means charity that is continuous that's generating or regenerating. And thirdly, a righteous offspring that would pray to Allah and seek forgiveness for his parent or for his father or uh uh for the deceive. So you as a wife try your best to bring your children in the proper way so that they would ask Allahel for forgiveness for their father. You can always in your prayers in the last third of the night and between the adan and the you can always raise your hands pray to Allah. Oh Allah forgive my husband. Oh Allah expand his grave and fill it with light. Fill it with fragrance from uh uh paradise. open a window from paradise overlooking his grave and fill his grave with with joy and with and allahel will answer your prayers with the grace of Allah bless you."
