peace and blessings be upon his prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam i welcome you dear viewers to this episode where we are joining our G issue to discuss the topic of death and funerals joining us in this episode we have chef assemble Hakim from Saudi Arabia chef bundle Mohammed from the USA chef Tom - Eddie from Canada and share Sally mohammadi from the UAE may Allah reward you all for joining us now in the previous episodes we've discussed all of the matters leading up to death now we've got to death someone in our community our family our friends has passed away now it may be for many communities or people that as soon as death comes they don't know what to do we know that there are things to do we know that as Muslims we bury our dead in a way we have certain rituals beforehand but if we're not aware of these it might come a sudden shock so we all of a sudden rush what do we do because we might not have learned about these Sooners about the commands of the burial so no doubt this shows that knowing these beforehand is going to benefit us just like with any act of worship if we were to go for Hajj we're going to spend months beforehand making sure that we know how to do the hedge it had his once-in-a-lifetime death we might encounter death many times in a lifetime I don't not for ourselves you die once but your family members could die many times this is something which no doubt most of us are going to see happening quite often so we're going to begin now once the person dies we've gone through some of the sundnes of closing the eyes all of these matters making jaw are but now we get through the physical aspects so I suppose we're probably going to begin with for example with washing the body so I'll start with you share Hassim could you tell us the steps that the believers will take at this point so now matter Haman hungry laughs sort of Sara Ellis Widow Sofia I'm a bad ooh before I start I find it ironic subhanAllah whenever humans need something allah azza wajal makes it easy and depending on their need so if humans need to breathe you find that air is everywhere you can breathe without paying money for that until now at hand Allah you don't have any royalties or taxations so it's easy because it is essentially needed if you go a step down you'd find that everyone needs to drink but not as their need to breathe so there is water but to get it is not as easy as when it comes to breathing likewise in Islam whatever you need something on social facilitation is for you and he makes it easy for you to do so everyone needs to get married and marriage in Islam is very easy no complications and chef Musa probably you know this best you go to propose to someone and the guardian says I give you my daughter in marriage you say I accept there are two witnesses or more that is it of course with the consent of the girl it's simple it's adoration it's not a pillar it is something that is a condition that it can be named if not named now maybe can be named afterwards even after consumed ating the marriage so it's not it doesn't have to do with the validity of the marriage when you come to death subhanAllah preparing a deceased person to his burial happens in less than 3 or 4 hours where I come from in Saudi its Allah described it as a Muslim back in the Quran it is a calamity it is a catastrophe or a disaster to the relatives but they have to get it over with and where I come from it takes 2 to 3 hours to get everything over and he's better than that's it so it is very easy in Islam to prepare a funeral and to do its rights simply you wash the body you shroud it you pray funeral prayer and you bury it now there are some details but this is the main principle and I wanna compare it to like if you're living in the West when somebody dies they have to take a loan I'll take a loan because it's so expensive and I was about to say that also inexpensive for Muslim the most expensive taxicab ride they say from the your home to the burial the draining of lives all the things that they have to do and feel like you're looking at ten thousand or more when disrepair this money they prepare this money before they die so yeah yeah was it you not for the Jena in the very oldest musical band coming processions and hamdullah Islam is way way way easy because this is a fact of life death is a fact of life so when we will discuss this just to give you a preview it is just washing shouting and praying and bedding oh these four things but the details are not that essential in the sense that no if you did not do this dig him out let's do it again yeah but you are educating the Muslims yes yes so now we're gonna go into detail so that they would know what is the perfect way of doing it okay when a person dies the first thing you do after everything is needed getting the permission for burying him etc you start to wash him and you cannot wash him with his clothes on so you have to strip him now the Prophet Isis Salam was an exception because the companions may allah be pleased with them did not take his clothes off they could not even think of doing that and they heard the voice saying to them that wash him with his clothes on we're talking about individuals so the scholars say that you have to take his clothes or her clothes off but we have to point out that those who wash the deceased must be from the same sex so you don't have my mother my sister coming washing me this is unacceptable another wife they will come to that and I cannot wash my daughter if she's reached the age of puberty or even if she is over six years or seven years of age I cannot see her body because she is our up even to me her father the exception is the spouses in Islam we believe that a Muslim a husband can see his wife and a wife can see her husband as they were born so when it comes to washing it is permissible for the husband or wife to wash the spouse and this was done best map into a maze may Allah be pleased with her when she washed Abu Bakr and this was done by ID premier toilet may Allah be pleased with him when he washed Fatima and this was gay and he wished for by Hashem ll be pleased with her when she said if it were to me no one would have washed the Prophet s time except his wives because they are the only one who can do this I'd like to add something here because it is some school of thoughts on the Hanafi school particular they say a husband cannot do this and their argument actually is that what makes it lawful for the husband is the wedlock and the wedlock is has been now terminated and ended so he's not allowed to see her so but this is now they are using the analogy the pious in the presence of the clear text okay so PS you resort to in the absence of the text and the prophets last enemy came of one of the battlefields and he had a headache and he found Asia also has a headache and he said oh I have a headache and she is saying the same thing he said Oh what do you think if you die before me this was the problem I said I'm saying he's gonna die before me then I will wash you and bury you Subhan Allah I sure hope he felt you up jealous I said oh you want to huh you go to the other woman otherwise Subhan Allah but here the prophesy Selim is telling us clearly that he can wash his and who can understand this Deen better than the Sahaba this is the sake of the Muslims Adi Imams hidden ally of the allahu anhu is washing fatima az-zahra we should not be fanatic when the truth comes we have to accept it and come back to the son of the professionals now when we come to the washing and I'll ask you chef menteur we say washing I mean what type of washing you can wash just with water with soap like a shower and when we say what the appeals and they will pass it to a key movie specialized and they send it always makes they're just leathery all-city well we've got you all has anyone actually done this process themselves with a real other than chef Assam yeah yes participated okay because it's of course I haven't come across this yet and it's something that's a little bit uncommon in the West before we just starting explaining the procedure the one who does it should be an honest person I mean that's worthy because sometimes you see good science sometimes you see bad science okay so if you see good science we can't mention them I shall allow some people when you are watching them you feel they are smiling they are smiling in reality they are smiling or they are raising their finger oh these are good sign and sometimes the opposite what if family you're washing the body and the family says did you see any good sign and you didn't just one of those cases when you can you should not make tough one okay so I will mentioning about the washing so first of all you have to take off the clothes but when you take off the clothes you have to make sure that the outer is covered and for the man the outer from the navel to the knees and for the woman we will come to discuss this later on a shower okay shall we're going to go to a very short break and after this we'll continue with the exact details of the Washington Charlotte so idea if you was to stay tuned inshallah we'll be back after a very short assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome back to your viewers we're here with our D issue discussing the topic of death and funerals now just before the break chef I asked him you were mentioning once the person dies we take their clothes off we address them but we cover the holder so now what happens after this taking the clothes off the best scenario is to actually take them off if you can because you can utilize these clothes and someone else can use them which is not unfortunately the case in a lot of the Muslim countries they believe that they become superstitious and this is no no this is the clothes of a dead person let's burn it let's get rid of it no these are proper clothes they should be used or given to the poor if you're unable to take them off you have to have scissors so scissors are one of the things that should be ready when you wash a dead person so you take it off but when you come to the area between the knees and the navel before taking the clothes off you should put a sheet that would ensure that this area is not visible after you strip a person from his or her knot you've definitely and do the sisters don't get weird IDs the sisters for example what is the outer for a sister the outer for a sister is from her aunt beneath the neck till her knees this is the area to be covered not like some people saying that oh she's like the man from the knees to the navel no this area should be concealed and unfortunately nowadays a lot of the Muslims the living they expose these parts thinking that it's okay to do this we hear about them when they go to weddings and we go to the parties and exposing their thighs and all of this is honestly macand those doing this are not related to being practicing Islam properly once we cover the hour ah suppose we prepared the Ottomans nakedness um kiss me nakedness guess on some yes all right is his nakedness or the area that is supposed to be concealed other than the wife or the spouse we prepare the material needed and what is the material first of all water we can't wash about water and we have to have sitter and Sid there is the seed or the plant called lute and it is widely spread in Arabia it has a nice scent to it but it acts like detergents like soap and that is why when you do it that there is a process of doing it or preparing it because you have to have a certain form so you start taking it until it has a foam with this foam we use it as a shampoo to wash the hair and the beard if a person has one inshallah once you get this amount of water buckets of water nowadays we don't need buckets you have these sprinklers or hoses or so this would keep it clean you have to have a proper drainage because once you wash the body things will come out of it and you don't want this stagnant you have to have a proper drainage to it what do we begin with we begin with giving the proper muscle for a deceased person how does a living person perform muscle if you have a janaba state of impurity how do you perform the actual rituals of a fossil you begin with washing your private parts then you perform voodoo proper voodoo then you wash your head till the water reaches the roots of your hair then you wash the right side then the left side then the feet so with the deceased we do the same first of all we have to ensure that his private parts and his stomach does not contain any impurities because he's human now he's unable to ask for a couple of minutes to go to the call of nature so what the scholars say you do is you make him sit half away not all the way now how would I make him said excuse me okay I have to make him sit so I make the deceased you know bent his back a little bit so that as if he is sitting halfway and I wash the waist down with a lot of water thoroughly washing him while pressing a little bit lightly on the stomach and of course this is from underneath the piece of cloth with my left hand nowadays we have gloves you have two hygienic Li wear these gloves and with a piece of cloth or cotton you start to clean his private parts and by pressing it if you see that there are things coming out you use water again and again and again until you feel that it has stopped there's nothing else in the stomach nothing else is coming out you get rid of this cloth in a proper secure place so that it would not harm people and make people eat test it in a sense then you start to give this man Woodill for that woman now model you're not gonna be able to turn the water in the mouth on the contrary this might be unadvisable and not good because you don't want the water to go and it stomach and then start the process all over again so you simply just rub the teeth with your finger with water in it and just put it like this on the nose without needing to go in deep and do this cleaning as some people do this is not the proper way of doing it and you wash the limbs of Woodill back you normally do then you wash the head and the beard with this foam though you're washing and cleaning washing and cleaning you can do this once three times as the Sunnah is I'm going to ask you mentioned it used the symptom yeah he said it's common in Arabia lot of sleeves yeah if you're somewhere else do you only use water if you don't have this or can you use shampoo and soap and scholars say that if the Sunnah is you use siddur because this is what the Prophet Azam advice and this is what was the doing of the Companions though they had ash nan which is also another form of soap but he indicated this however the cause for using this is to clean so we follow the Sunnah but if you're in a country that does not have this use shampoo you so use anything to clean the body if see scholars say that sitter has another effect that is not available in soap so does not happen that is sitter has the ability to stiffen the body so after you finish you don't want the body to be loose because you're gonna carry it and you're gonna put it in the grape you want it to be stiffened and sit there has this ability to make it cold the body to make it cold and to make it stiff okay giving word oh then we wash the hair and the beard now we come to washing the rest of the body so you wash the right sides of the body the man is lying on his back same goes with the woman so I'm not gonna make this differentiation everytime and then you want to wash the back right hand side of the person so what to do you have to flip the person and the best way of flipping the person is to put the right foot over the left foot off the disease to cross them because if they're like this the foot that is on the side you're gonna flip is loose and it's gonna make life difficult the minute you cross the deceased foot put one over the other you can easily flip the disease you wash the back the shoulders under pit and likewise the thighs without exposing the aura as we've stated before you put the disease on his back again you go to the left side you wash the front side and then you do the same with the leg and you flip the person over and you wash thoroughly this side do you mean to flip him on his face no on his side only that's it so it's on his shoulder because the shoulder when he was on his back I've already washed this side washed the front side so when I flip the person it is like being on the edge on the other shoulder so I wash that area and now you've washed the entire body yes now the last wash the last washed that to be used for purification and for cleanliness the Prophet told us to put in it Kafue Watzke for the Comfort okay comfort and comfort is a form of type of scent of perfume that also would add value to the disease that it repels the beasts the dogs the thing from coming in it has a strong scent that would send them away and also it would help the water to be intact and firm okay so now the body has been washed we've put everything on it that we need to do so what is next in line the funeral or burial process of course drying it definitely you have to dry it then should I would do yeah I'm talking about practical ways because if you are not used to it it's gonna be a mess a little bit not a lot a little bit so after you have done what you've done what to do first of all this cloth is engaged in so many things of perfume siderophore and the impurities that coming out so you have to change it now the body is clean first thing I bring another clean piece of cloth and I dry the deceased with towel and then I put the piece of cloth and take the wet dirty piece of cloth so now he's covered now what to do I cannot shroud him in the same place so I have to remove him to a dry place and before doing that you prepare the shout and how many shouts do I prepare in that dry place before I even start washing him so that he would not wait I would shroud him in three shrouds as the sooner being white and being made of cotton like the Prophet as I'm instructed and like the one he was shrouded in and for the woman she is shrouded in some scholars say the same and other schools of thought say no they should be shrouded in five when I put in place is it the same size of the deceased is the shroud the same size of the deceased it's much much more so if I'm six foot it should be at least a foot and a half from the head side more and a foot and a half from the legs side and it should be this big enough to cover the deceased not having exactly it's not a sandwich when I put the first layer I put a lot of perfume and then I put the second layer and I put a lot of perfume and I put the third layer and I put a lot of perfume now just in case anybody gets this wrong as we'll mentioning in another episode about how in some cultures they might imitate Islamic traditions and they would dress the person in a suit and everything so they're entirely undressed and then we're only putting shrouds true because dressing them goes completely against Islam okay so now we've put the shrouds and now we've wrapped them in the three or according to the minions five for the famous and now the body is ready for burial so that does bring us to the end of our episode may Allah reward you allowed the issue been very good having you discussing this topic and may Allah also reward you our dear viewers we hope insha'Allah that you've benefited greatly from this topic and we hope in chat a lot to see you in our coming episodes until then I agree to all salamati come what I
