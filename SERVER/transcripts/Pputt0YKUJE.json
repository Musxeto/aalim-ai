  "transcript": "yes is there any reference in the Quran that shows us that prophet ISA peace be upon him will return back to earth it is and if you look into Surat Annisa at the end of it you will find this mentioned and you'll find that Allah mentions that those who disbelieved will believe when they see him coming and this might not be crystal clear about this dissension to earth but the Sunnah is overwhelmed with it and it is an article of faith to the Muslims that ISA may Allah a peace and blessing be upon him will descend at the end of the time he's the one who's going to kill the Antichrist known as at the jail he's the one who's going to rule with our prophets Sharia law he will not bring any new law he will break the cross he will kill the the swine and he will cease to take the jizya the jizya money will not be taken anymore from the Christians or from the Jews they have no other alternative way to accept Islam so we believe in this there and the Sunnah is has talked about this a lot and a larger nose back"
