  "transcript": "remaining in the episode Che just want to go on the same point there because this is the whole uh foundation of the episode and this is why we we ask it because this is why Muslims ask because the the the non-muslims who are easy to deal with it's not a problem they can easily deal with one another but for the non-muslims who are hostile towards Islam as the brother gave us a few examples do we give a pope do we avoid them do we leave them how do we respond to their to their curses sometimes well it's it's difficult to answer this question because it differs now one way it says that you should leave them all together and the other way says that no you should try and try and try but if I do this I'm going to waste time I'd rather sit with 10 out the more who are accepting what I say who may like what I say and be convinced with it right rather than spending my time with this individual who does not show Anye or kind of hope now having said that remember that calling people to Islam is not lecturing them it's simply dealing with them in the Islamic fashion and like brother Sharif said MH if you go and give the greetings good morning good day have a good day and they don't reply to you you what is the right thing to do one says well we should not give them our greetings in the first place why is that because they're not replying and my answer to that would be would I teach them manners or would I learn from them Bad Manners so if I do not greet them I'm learning from them Bad Manners but if I keep on greeting meating them and trying to be the good person and to have the upper hand then I'm teaching them manners and this is how we should treat others if life is so easy and everybody is accepting our call and we don't have to strive and we don't have to struggle and we don't have to have any calamities or or bad situations to be in life would would be so easy but this is was not the life of the prophet nor his companions nor those who call others to Islam we have to strive we have to struggle we have to keep our focus on our Target and we have to coexist with those who are kind or at least with those who are not hostile to Islam I think you in that same statement if you made you have summarized what we exactly wanted to say on the episode for your time today on the straight path brother sh same to you and we hope to have both of you again inshallah sometime soon on the straight path if you have any comments for us you can write to us at straight paath H.T that's all we have time for today until next time after the"
