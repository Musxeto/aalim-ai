  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] uh welcome back to another episode of lives of dormance where we'll be talking about child rearing its virtues its trials and tribulations is benefits so we find in the quran an authentic tradition that there's a praiseworthy nature of raising children it has many benefits many things that make people uh joyous but also there's many trials and tribulations as much difficulty and as ways in which you can ease that and one of the easiest things to do is to have knowledge of these things from how allah has taught us in the quran and how the nibis allah sallam has taught us in the sunan we have our honored guest today sheikh asim luqman and hakeem who came all the way from saudia to share with us his immense knowledge and his wisdom and he is a teacher at zade academy and also a teacher at kiu and an imam and teacher for over 30 years it's always an honor and pleasure to have you the honor is all mine uh i would like to start by talking about tasmiyah the naming of the child uh something that all parents look forward to choosing a name order some sunan uh what is the proper way to go about picking a name for a childhood is something that is part of the sunnah to be done usually on the seventh day of the child's birth why do we say usually because it was proven from the authentic sunnah that the prophet alaihis salat was salam named his last son ibrahim on the night he was born so he did not wait until the seventh day so if a couple choose to name their child before even being born there's no problem in that if they decide to postpone the naming till the seventh day again this is okay inspired the sunnah alhamdulillah there is flexibility in it naming a child is an islamic concept because usually the name does not reflect on a person's life as some non-muslims think who depend on astrology and thinking that the zodiacs and the stars have an impact on a person's course of life muslims don't believe in this because this is shirk associating others with allah only allah does this however the names do reflect on a person's personality and this is why it is part of the rights of a child to be given a good name the prophet alaihissalatwa islam whenever he heard the bad name he would change it so a woman or a girl's name was asiya meaning sinful yeah so he changed it a woman's name was barra which means righteous and and this is self-praising so the prophet allah changed it as well so names that have bad meanings yes or names that praise a person being virtuous being pious being righteous these names it's recommended to be changed so may allah have mercy on your soul one of the imams of the tabi's one of the fukaha of medina he says that my father's name was al and his father was hasan hasan was a companion and hasan in arabic means rough tough not easy to deal with so a road is hazan when it's really rough you need a 4x4 to drive through so hazan came to the prophet he gave him the pledge of allegiance introduced himself my name is hasan meaning rough and tough so the prophet said assam no your name is so he changed it to the opposite which is easygoing so the man said o prophet of allah i'm not going to change a name my father gave to me so he rejected the proposal see it was not an instruction the prophet did not order him and this is something that muslims must be aware of when the prophet orders us to do something you have no choice but to comply or you would be sitting and this would be this would be just obeying allah who ordered you to obey the prophet but when the prophet gives a recommendation it's up to you and and this is a footnote i sometimes make big footnotes so excuse me if i divert a little bit barira was a concubine was a slave woman who was married to murieth who was a slave she managed to set herself free by asking mother aisha to help her buy herself off from her owners mother ayashi did so so she set herself free when a slave woman becomes free she has the option to remain married to a slave man or separate from him because now she is free and he's a slave so she chose her freedom and to separate from her husband muhit loved her so much so he went to the prophet and asked him to intervene to intercede so the prophet went to baria and said barira it would be best if you stay with your husband look at what this companion said because she is knowledgeable she said are you ordering me the prophet said no i'm just interceding now she knows that it's not an instruction rather a recommendation so she said oh prophet of allah i do not want him i do not need him so coming back again to hasan hasan name was changed by the prophet hassam as a recommendation and not an instruction because if it's an instruction then he would be disobeying the prophet and this is a major sin so the prophet salaam let it be what does the grandson say he says subhanallah since he refused to change the name this toughness and rudeness ran down through all of the generations of the family so all of us are known to be undiplomatic and apologetic tough and rough though they're not sinful but it's a character there so names do impact the personality of a person but not as the astrologists say rather because of the meaning of the name and this is why it is always best to give good names to a child in bukhari the prophet said alaihis the most beloved names to allah are abdullah and abdulrahman in other sources of hadith and the most truthful of names are al harith so abdullah these are the names of allah allah loves his names so if you call your son abdullah or abdulrahman you are calling them with the best names to allah but what about al-harif and al-ham the most truthful names what is meant by truthful scholars say harif is the one who works hard it's like the one plowing the ground but actually he's working so any tom dick or harry if you call him hadith this name would fit him as a glove because he's either working for this dunya or he's working for the he's working no one sits idle doing nothing imam is or means to intend to do and every single individual on earth intends to do good or intense to do bad no one sits idle without intending to do you intend to eat you intend to sleep you do something and you proceed with that so it's truthful in the sense that it fits like a glove any person you name him with that name so these are some of the etiquettes now a lot of the muslims have problems with naming in the sense in the subcontinent india pakistan bangladesh and also in egypt in countries like syria the 11 countries they give the child two names so his name is arif they call him muhammad arif they add muhammad as a form of blessing so the prophet is named muhammad ali so we always quote a person muhammad muhammad muhammad and everybody knows them as tariq so why confuse the people by giving him names for barakah this is an innovation all the companions used to give only one first name and this would confuse people because when i hear someone's name muhammad i would say his name is muhammad and his father's name is tarak and if his father's name is muhammad sadiq then i would say that these are four names for four different people when it's actually two people muhammad uh uh tariq and muhammad but isn't that a matter of a person naming someone i would not say it's haram yeah but i would say it is inappropriate especially when it becomes an innovation thinking that this is a blessing a lot of the girls call fatima bigum or fatima [Music] so they put fatima for the love of the daughter of the prophet islam with another female's name and this is again confusing people and one should not do it we spoke i think before that the naming process is the right of the father but if someone else gives a name and he approves of it then this is good so the prophet islam called al-hasan and hussein his grandsons and it was approved by ali may allah be pleased with him the mother may call her son or daughter with a name and if her husband approves of it then this is okay but at the end of the day it is his god-given right okay uh what would you say about the name for giving an example that you gave fatima like things of this nature and are you also saying that to name your son like say muhammad with the intention of barakah yes this is not see there is a hadith circulating among the muslims which translates to the best of names that has before the name of allah or muhammad ahmed hamid anything that has the praising meaning of it in the name and this hadith is not at all authentic so one should not uh apply it insha'allah we're gonna stop here and we're gonna have a break but after the break we will continue about the sunnin of child naming the sunnin of uh shaving the head when a child is born inshaallah ta'ala so stay tuned and we'll be right back [Music] [Music] welcome back to our episode of life's adornments this is our second segment and we're talking about naming there's so many issues that comes up when it comes to choosing a good name what names are best what names should we stay away from so alhamdulillah we have asked them to clarify some of these matters check awesome we would like to know many times particularly in the west people are born with western names christian names many times you have michael these uh biblical names and then they become muslim so is it best for a person to keep their name or should they change their name is there anything fabbits from the sunnah that says a person should choose a name from the mba or the sahaba things of this nature sabbath meaning meaning like islam you have to do it or is there some flexibility so that the viewers would not say thabit this is a good name yeah that was a good name yeah see uh generally speaking it's an issue of dispute among scholars but as anything that's disputable we go back to the early times of the shri of legislation which is the time of the prophet isam the best of times ever witnessed on this earth so those who came into islam they had arab names and some of their father's names would be abd and these are names which are not part of allah's names so how can we call the servant of yoda for example if someone is interested in star wars or the uh the servant of ram or krishna or whatever so the prophet did not change these names he only changed the names that had a bad meaning so if someone's name is a dog he would change it if someone's name is shaytaan he would change it if someone's name is so aggressive and offensive he would change it other names he kept so now it's up to the individual a man's name is michael a girl's name is jeanette or tracy and she accepts islam she says well people around her say you're now fatima you're now zainab she was born with this name and she's now in her 30s or 40s everybody knows her with this name why change she says part of the identity no it's not it's even easier for you as a muslim to live and communicate with others by keeping your name but when you come and say my name is so-and-so and it's different than your passport than your id then your diploma in in high school in your uh bachelor degrees your phds and all the social security number why are you putting so much pressure on yourself for no islamic reason so i personally see that keep your name your name is john john is a good name keep it because this is what your father called you i don't see any reason it's not even if it's a biblical name it's not something that is worshipping other than allah but if you come and tell me okay my name is noah should i call myself my name is abraham should i call myself ibrahim my name is isaac should i call myself ishaq the arabic islamic wording this is acceptable because these are prophet's names and calling them by the islamic name is better but if it's going to confuse others if it's going to cause an issue for you keep your old name as it is now having said that i live in the west me and my wife we're muslims we're blessed with a child should i call my child john or david no here it's a different issue now the the child is a muslim so i should give him a muslim name unlike a lot of the muslims they feel this inferiority complex so if the boy's name is muhammad in the states you know this i'm sure what's your name said mo moa as in or what what he said no no moa as in short of muhammad you should not shorten that maw is not of an appropriate name your name is muhammad you should be proud of that and we should give our children a name to look up for so if i call my daughter diana different than if i call her uh arwa or i call her salma or i call her asthma these are names with a history so when the child grows up they always at the back of their mind yes my name is muhammad muhammad was the messenger of allah and he is the messenger of peace i should be something like that other than calling him with a name that may negatively reflect on his upbringing interesting uh so you mentioned about the hickam of a person going years with having a particular name and then becoming muslim and not wanting the upset that that uh strain of time as long as it's a name a good name not even a good name yeah it's it's a normal name a nominee it hasn't it does not have something uh to be called after a god for example of of the idol worshippers no this is something you have to change if it's your first name excellent okay so moving forward now what about the shaving of the head of the child is this something that's just for boys or for boys and girls alike is there a significant period of time that it has to be done in and if it is okay for a person to leave it to not do it as well okay but before we move to shaving the head ah there are some i think that also a lot of the times the muslims ask about giving names that are known to be allah's names so we know that allah has 99 names whoever counts them whoever understands them will enter jannah and allah's names are not limited to 99 they're far more than that but this is what the hadith stated so a lot of the people ask is it permissible to call your son kareem and kareem means generous or your name sheikh is awesome and hakeem is one of allah's names so how can this be we always explain it to the people that the names of allah azzawajal are divided into two categories names that are sort of mutual can be used to call allah with and it also can be used to call humans with and this is mentioned in the quran for example in surat yusuf what was the title given to yusuf and to the king before him it was al-aziz and we all know that al-aziz is one of allah's names but in the surah itself they're calling a kafir king and they're also calling yusuf who is the prophet of allah and he never told them stop doing that likewise allah azza described prophet muhammad and these are two also names of allah azzawajal and you can go on and on and on so such names that are mutual in use can be used to call a sun with it so you can call your son rahim you can call your son hakeem rasheed rasheed though it's an issue of dispute whether it's one of allah's names or not some uh uh authenticated some say it's not and and so on there are other names that cannot be used except with allah such as the creator you can't call someone what's happening yeah this is for allah azzawajal the provider you can't say to someone okay he's my razak he's my boss at work no this is only for allah al-rahman allah these are only used with allah azzawajal and no one else and so on okay what about with regards to uh the names of the malaika okay the names of the angels is again an issue of dispute and a lot of the scholars prohibit this and some scholars say that this is permissible and the most authentic opinion is that it is permissible only when used with male children why because it is the tendency of the idol worshippers to call the angels as females and allah azzawajal mentioned this in the quran and when he says that they made the angels of allah to be females did they notice their creation nay their testimony would be noted down and they will be questioned about it on the day of judgment so scholars say it is totally prohibited it's totally prohibited to give the name of an angel like jibril mikhail israel to a baby girl not only that even the name of malak or malak it cannot be given to a female because this would be imitating and mimicking the ways of the idol worshipers who label them and you may ask okay what's the gender of angels they don't have a gender but in arabic in all other languages the prominence is always to the male gender in pronouns and in description so yes we they don't have a gender they're not we don't say they're male or females they are genderless allah created them like this but when we talk about them we say the archangel jibril he came to the prophet we don't say shi or we don't say it because this is inappropriate so we give the archangel gibril the prominent uh gender or the prominent pronoun which is the masculine pronoun okay are there any other things that we should look forward to or look away from when it comes to naming children you again you should not name your children in a bad way that would impact them in the future in arabia we it's a tendency among the locals that when a child is born for their fear of evil eye they gave they give him a bad name such as peasant beggar poor man so whenever you ask what's the boy's name says oh he's peasant nobody thinks of giving him an evil eye so oh what's a good name they would just look down at him but imagine that a person with such a name grows to be a general in the army so general peasant people would be confused would look down at him would mock him so giving bad names is not a good thing giving weird names in arabia nowadays if you say to someone call your son ali call him omar said no no these are two old names i'm gonna call him a new name and he brings a name that is uh maybe archaic maybe old but nowadays it's what is this so you should fear allah azzawajal choose a good name that has a a nice sound to it for your child so that your child does not grow up hating you or thinking why did my father give me such a name that would not impact him uh uh negatively okay and uh lastly what about giving children a cuny okay that's that's a good question um this is part of the sunnah the prophet was used to give kunia to youngsters so for example there was she's a very young sahabi companion girl she's like seven years of age and he used to call her umhadit the brother of anasabni malik he's used to be nicknamed as abba umair the prophet he was like four or five years of age the prophet used to say about we have abu hurairah and he did not have a son by the name of we have abu bakr and he did not have a son by the name of bakker abu hafs the name of umar and he did not have a son by the name of house so this is part of the sunnah each individual has to have a nickname because it's a an act of respect to call someone instead of calling you yusuf what's happening instead of calling you yusuf what's happening i would call you abu najashi what is happening this is sign of respect for thank you as always for your missed knowledge and wisdom we're going to end the episode here today insha'allah viewers thank you for tuning in with us stay tuned for another episode of life's adornments we appreciate your viewership inshaallah you benefited much until next time assalaamu alaikum [Music] uh
