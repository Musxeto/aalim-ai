  "title": "Is following one's desires considered as shirk? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um I just wanted to ask about um a verse from the Quran um it says in so the one who has taken his desires as God and Allah also says inah so Allah does not forgive so the one who obeys his desires Allah states that it is like he has taken his desires as God so does this constitute actual sh that Allah will not forgive if someone follows his own desires if someone shaves his beard is he following his desires yes or no yes okay is he a mushrik no by your analogy he is so how to reconcile we reconcile by going to the definition of taking your desires as a god God where your desires makes Halal things Haram and Haram things Halal and you neglect Quran and Sunnah and put them behind you and only follow what your desires dictate upon you as your God now this is kufur and shik but sinning is following your desires partially but no one takes it as an no one takes this sin as a God and Embraces having trust in it in the Sin having uh uh uh fear and hope having uh uh reverence for it this is worshiping your desires and believing in them so I hope this makes some sense"
