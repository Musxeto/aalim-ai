  "transcript": "cd from germany he says there are letters that i can't pronounce correctly from the very beginning but if i repeat it i may succeed in that so should i if you're a non-arab and the word that you pronounced is acceptable to the arabs it does not alter the meaning it does not change it so if you say al-mustakhim you don't have to no no no i have to almost this is the best you could have done and it would cause a lot of hardship to repeat it again and over and over in the salat in different locations so because it didn't change in the meaning and because you did your level best this is all what you need to do you don't have to repeat it"
