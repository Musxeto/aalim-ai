  "transcript": "well first of all the intention is quite good but I do not at all recommend a sister to approach a a practicing brother or any other brother first of all do not be deceived now if you see someone who's giving DAW and he's righteous M he's got a long beard and he comes on TV screens and does this and that blah blah blah this doesn't mean he's a good practicing Muslim you have not seen him deal with his wives you have not seen him deal with his kids you have not had any transaction financially with him and you cannot judge people by the way they look well someone says but aren't we supposed to judge people by the way they appear yes but not only that you have to ask as well about their conduct that is why the prophet said Alam who whenever someone who you accept their religion and their conduct or their behaviors and ethics then you should give him in marriage well these are the conditions it's not only the religion the way it looks and likewise for the man when he goes he says well I found the sister mashallah she's wearing the hij she's wearing the gloves I cannot see even her fingernails and masallah she's perfect well do you know how she behaves do you know about her temper do you know about uh uh how she treats people does she look down upon them is she active in in helping people or she's just looking to be practicing this is something you should check this is point number one point number two you do not propose to any brother because this is part of humilating yourself and also it is degrading Yourself by going and proposing yourself to a brother you coming to me and say you're a good can you marry me i' look down at you don't you have a family don't you have uh brothers who can approach in a different way or just see if this man is interested in getting married or not if you fit what he wants or not so this is a woman for a sister to throw herself upon people thirdly and F finally it is actually un Islamic this is tempting whenever someone is approached by a woman even if she's the ugliest woman on earth when she tells him that she interested in him shaan moves and and he beautifies this woman and he makes this man fantasize fantasize and and think here and there and goes in every Valley and on on top of Every Mountain this is UN Islamic the proper way is that if I am a father of a woman and she's interested in a man and the man is righteous and he's practicing and I've checked on him he's Mah okay I go and propose to him and not even that maybe this would be humiliating for myself but om did this in marriage toan who refused he offered her to Abu Bakr who refused and then the prophet Alam proposed to her and Bakr said that the only reason I refused is that I've heard the prophet mention her name so I did not want to uh uh uh you know cut uh um in front of the prophet otherwise I would have accepted her for myself so this is the proper way of doing it is that you go to someone I would go to someone and tell him listen that man is mAh a good Muslim prac Muslim and I have a daughter in marriage how about you talking to him and tell him why don't you marry the daughter of Sheik so and so and maybe you know so if he rejects nothing comes to me directly and my dignity is preserved and if he accepts alhamdulillah a win-win situation but you do not go and talk to anyone at all and I hope this answers the question"
