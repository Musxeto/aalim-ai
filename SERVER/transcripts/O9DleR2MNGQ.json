  "transcript": "Abdullah from India Florida can we invest in a company that does halal work but takes interest based loans okay so again this is an issue of dispute among Scholars contemporary Scholars have come with a percentage saying that if the financing of a Halal company that works in daily products or manufacturer manufactures things like Furniture Etc which is halal 100 but they finance their projects with interest-based loans they say these contemporary some contemporary Scholars that if it's below 30 percent then it's halal and I don't know where they got this percentage from but it's surely not based on clear-cut evidences from the Quran the Sunnah and my opinion is that once I buy shares in a particular company that produces pens totally halal the moment I buy these shares I'm a shareholder so I have five percent of this company if the company management goes and finances their projects with interest-based riba I am sharing in that sin because I'm a shareholder and I would say that investing in such company is not permissible because investing in such companies to begin with is not mandatory so why would I put myself In Harm's Way by investing in in a company that deals with with Haram financing alhamdulillah I'm not obliged buy a car and give it to a driver and let him become an Uber driver or or invest in a grocery shop or whatever there's so many ways of investing not the safest which is investing in shares of of companies that deal with in Haram financing and Allah Knows Best"
