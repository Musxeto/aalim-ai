  "transcript": "foreign she says many people keep asking me to make Dua for them during my pregnancy and during my delivery they tell me that a pregnant woman's Dua is accepted during pregnancy and delivery is this authentic the answer is the times of accepting Dua are listed and are well known to the Muslims through the authentic a Hadith mentioned by the prophet alaihissalam such as in the case of between Adam and ekama such as in sujud such as in the last third of the night such as when a rooster makes a sound in the early morning such as in sujud such as when traveling such as when the rain is falling such as when the fighting armies the Muslims and the non-muslims fight in war in the cause of Allah take place these are times where we know that the Dua is accepted now what is known among the Layman the normal folks when they state that Dua is accepted during pregnancy and delivery thinking that this is a Calamity and hence it may be a cause of answering Dua is baseless had we have any evidence supporting it from the Quran or the Sunnah we would have been more than happy to include it but it is not"
