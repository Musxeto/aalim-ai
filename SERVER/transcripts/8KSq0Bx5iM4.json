  "transcript": "from India there is a Dua called Dua of N and this is a long Dua but I am telling you in short the Dua is Allah so my question is is this Dua authentic and if it's authentic then what is the proper way of reading it and if I read this Dua will I get n on my face and body I will answer inshallah from India says the Dua this is reported in Muslim from that the prophet after night prayer and after taking a nap and then when he went to F he used to say this in his prayer or is in all of this so is this authentic it's Muslim definitely it's authentic what does it mean well it means that grant me guidance because no is light and light is guidance so place in my heart light light of what do you want it to be illuminated no you want the light of guidance the Quran is light you want light in your vision to see what's right and wrong you want to hear what's right and stay away from from what's strong it is to Etc so this is what is meant and Allah Knows Best"
