  "title": "What is the minimum number of ayahs we should recite after fateha in salah? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "zuha says minimum of how many ayahs should we recite in salah after recite whatever possible for you from the quran and we know that salat is divided into pillars mandatory acts and voluntary acts and reciting verses of the quran after the fatiha is a recommended sunnah act which means that if i were to pray which is a fart for raka's only reciting fatiha in all four raka's my prayer is valid there's no problem in that but we know that the sunnah of the prophet is more worthy of being followed which means that i pray the fatih and asura afterwards afterwards the third and fourth fatiha would do so how many ayahs should i recite after the fatih in the first and second raka's as minimum as one if you wish and the sky is the limit so there's no minimum if you recite one ayah such as ayat al-kursiy that would suffice you and if you recite a cluster of ayahs that's good if you recite a whole surah even a short one that is even better and allah knows best"
