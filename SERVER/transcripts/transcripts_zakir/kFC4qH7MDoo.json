  "transcript": "the next question regards the history of fasting actually um was the time period for the observing uh of a fast and abstaining from the things which break the fast which you've already mentioned always the same since the beginning of time or for the Muslims I thought the musl Muslims are concerned when the first time it was mentioned in the Quran in Surah Bak CH 2 ver 183 which I mentioned earlier that fasting was F at that time the Muslims used to fast three days in a month later on when the verse of the Quran was revealed of Surah bakar chapter number 2 verse number 185 which I quoted the second time that Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed and in it is guidance for the humankind and in it ass signs for guidance and judgment right and wrong so the Muslim when they witness this month they should fast so then it became f for the Muslim to fast the complete month of Ramadan first it was only three days every month then it became one full month only the month of Ramadan as far as the things that break the fast are concerned one of the things that break the fast it is sexual intercourse even with your wife so previously when this verse of Surah bakar chapter 2 verse number 185 was revealed it was not mentioned in detail so the Muslim at that time they used to abstain from sexual intercourse approaching their wives for the full month of Ramadan even during the day and night and it was very difficult for many of the Muslims many of the sahabas and that reminds me of a quotation or incidence which is mentioned in one of the commentaries of the Quran if read the commentary of the Quran volume number two page number 210 it mentions there that omab may Allah be pleased with him once after speaking with the prophet late in the night he comes back home and he has the urge to sleep with his wife and he spends the time with his wife and he has sexual intercourse with his wife in the morning when he gets up he feels very bad he's ashamed he immediately goes to the prophet and he says that I ask pardon from Allah and his messenger for what I've have done and my soul was attracted towards my wife and I had a relationship with my wife in the night is there any way that I can be pardoned or is there any way that I can escape so the prophet said Is it true that you actually did this he said yes Prophet Prophet was shocked how could may Allah be pleased with him could do a thing at that time it was prohibited he said yes Allah messenger I did it is any way I can be pardoned so the prophet said no one beses Allah can give the command and alhamdulillah alhamdulillah immediately after this the ver of Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 187 was revealed it says that permitted to you during the n of the fast is approaching your wives and then it says that they are your garments and you are the garments that means your wives are your garments and you are the garments of your wife and Allah says that we know what you do secretly in the night but Allah forgive you and from now onwards you can approach your wives during the nights of The Fast and you can eat and drink till the white thread of dawn is differentiated from the black thread so when this verse was revealed later on Sur bakar CH 2 verse number 87 then the rules were bit more relaxed that they could have sexual relationship with their wife during the nights but during the day they have to abstain furthermore as far as eating was concerned previously before Surah bakar CH 2 verse number 187 was revealed the Muslims could eat and drink after the sunsets but the moment they sleep after that they can't eat then they can eat only the next day after sunsets so there incident one of the sahabas be pleas with him he worked very hard and he was fasting and when it was time to break the fast he comes home and he tells his wife that I want to have some food so wife says that there's no food in the house and just get it from outside and she goes out to get food now because he was tired working the full day by the time the wife comes back he goes to sleep when the wife comes back to the house she sees the husband has gone to sleep so now she says finish once he's gone to sleep he can't eat so that night he could not eat the next day he had to fast and by evening the next day he faints and the people go to the prophet that this is what happen because once you sleep you can't eat later on this verse was which I said earlier Sur bakar 2 verse number 87 which says besides approaching your wives at night you can eat and drink till the white thread of dawn is differentiated from the black thread so then the rules that we follow today that fasting means that you have to abstain from food and drink and nourishment as well as from sexual intercourse right from Dawn unto Sunset and having the intention that we have to bre Allah subhana tala it's an act of worship so this is the history how we finally got this"
