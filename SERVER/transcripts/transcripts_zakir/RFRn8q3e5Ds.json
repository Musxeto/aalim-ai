  "transcript": "Sardar Tosh mov it is from the YouTube a few minutes back assalam alaykum dear Dr zakum could we pray in suud in our language as far as suud is concerned if you know Arabic as a language it's the best but if you don't know Arabic as a language you can very well pray in the language you know the best but for example if you know a Dua in Arabic and then you don't read the translation oh Lord give me the best in this world and no then if you know the DU in Arabic it is preferable to recite in Arabic so whatever duas the Mason duas you know and if you want to recite in suud of course in Arabic is the best because that has been said in the Quran or it has been said by the prophet it's authentic it's the best but if you want to ask for something and you don't know Arabic language you can surely ask in English you can ask in Chinese you can ask in Punjabi in Udu no problem at all but those duas which are M duas which you know in the Quran or the Hadith then of course say it in Arabic but what do you want to say something of your own like maybe you want to ask Allah subhana tala may you do very well in the examination or may you do very well in the business and if you don't know Arab if you don't know Arabic as language you can do Dua in the language you know the best and it is permissible hope the answer the question"
