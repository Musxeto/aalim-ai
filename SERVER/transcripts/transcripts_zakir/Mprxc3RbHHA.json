  "title": "Logical Grounds for Growing a Beard and Covering the Head - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "so can you give us any logical reasons why we should um cover the head and grow the beard as far as covering the head is concerned growing the beard as I said growing the beard it's commandment of the Prophet so we have to do it covering the head is of the Prophet you do it that's of the main reason but if people want logical reason why they should do it there is a saying that if the label shows your intent ver it and I've given a talk on this complete topic for with the question more than three hour which I don't intend doing I'll just say in a nutshell they're saying that if the label shows a intent V it like if you go to a conference you know everyone wears the label they wear the name Dr so and so Dr it's a informal introduction if you go to a conference with a specialist of doctors then it may say you're a cardiologist or a neurologist or a nephologist you know so it gives an informal introduction so similarly wearing a cap or covering the head and sporting a beard is an informal introduction that you are a Muslim Allah says in the Quran in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 54 that when you meet those people who believe in our signs then sayam Alum peace be on you so how will I recognize when I walk in the streets especially in India and other countries and I go to the Western countries that he's a Muslim so this is a good sign of being a Muslim you know we don't require another label the label which the prophet has given us the best that covering your head and sporting a beard and it does wonders I give an example that once in Bombay there was a young lad who was selling fruits his name was Sultan an elderly Muslim who was a very P Muslim used to offer fight time Salah used to give zakat used to fast in the month of Ramadan had gone for he comes to buy fruit from this haer and he tells to this young boy Sultan why didn't you wish me salams so he said Uncle I thought you were a Hindu imagine a Muslim calling this elderly man a mush it's the biggest abuse you can give to this person this person was a very P person but didn't have a beard didn't cover his said who's to blame is the elderly gentleman to blame or the young lad for calling him a mush who's to blame but naturally the gentleman he could not recognize him therefore if the label shows her intent you should wear it and you can give several such examples for example it has various benefits if you're traveling the bus or traveling train and if there is a Muslim sisters doing hijab there are times in a non-muslim country where somebody May tease her but if there are 10 Muslims who don't know each other each of them wearing a cap kofy or sporting a beard and they're sitting in the bus the non-muslim will think 10 times before teasing the Muslim girl oh if I tease Muslim girl these 10 Muslim will Pace on me even those 10 Muslims may be very feeble may be old but yet he gets scared that's the reason it is good that he should wear the label because it shows your intent for example if there's a doctor he's proud to put the name doctor before his name because he's proud to be a doctor in his car there is a sign of a cross a Red Cross indicating that he's a doctor in emergency if you have any problem on the street you stop the car similarly if any human being has a problem in ones and if you see a Muslim who has a label a cap and a beard he will ask him for help he'll guide him to the TRU and I remember my grandparents telling that in Bombay when any people wanted to hire a cab even the non-muslims they preferred hiring a cab whose taxi driver was sporting a beard and keeping a cap because they knew he would be honest they preferred going to a shop whose shopkeeper was sporting a beard and wearing a cap unfortunately nowadays the whole label has changed we find Muslims wearing cap just to boss around you know and unfortunately the media the portray anyone who has a beard and wears a cap he's a terrorist and I've given this reply in my talk so keeping a beard and wearing a cap or covering the head is a very recommended Sunnah and keeping a beard is f so Muslims should stick to it and should be proud to identify themselves as Muslims"
