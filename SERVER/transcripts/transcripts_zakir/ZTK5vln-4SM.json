  "transcript": "the next question from muhammad saud lucknow india i am a student sir you are a great muslim influencer for the ummah so my hindu tutor asked me that if i had only one bread and a hungry man comes and asks me for the food and we both are dying of hunger what does islam say in such a situation should i eat or should i give him it's a very tricky question asked by the teacher of muhammad saud that if you are hungry and you're dying of hunger and another hungry man comes and he too is dying of hunger and you have only one piece of bread so would you eat it yourself or would you give it to the hungry man what does islam teach you regarding the reply for such a situation is depending upon the situation if there is a hungry man who comes and i realize that he is dying of hunger and i am dying of hunger too and if we both can survive by having half loaf of the bread then i will make that bread into half give him one half and eat the other half there may be a situation that the hungry man may be a non-muslim he may not be used to hunger i'm a muslim i'm used to fasting and i know that maybe though i'm hungry i can survive more for a couple of days and that hungry non-muslim man he is not used to staying hungry and if he doesn't get food maybe in the next few hours he will die so what i will do i will give the complete loaf of bread to that non-muslim man knowing very well that i am used to fasting and i can maybe survive for the next few days and i'll pray to allah that me he provide me food as soon as possible you may ask me that what is the logic behind this the logic behind this is that allah says in the quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 32 that if anyone kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity this was says if any muslim kills any other innocent human being whether it be a muslim or non-muslim it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and there was continues if you save any human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity this verse i do not find in any other scripture except the glorious quran that if you kill one innocent human being you have killed the whole of humanity that means killing any innocent human being is prohibited it is haram it is the second major sin in islam and the voice continues that if you save one innocent human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity so here knowing very well that i am used to fasting i can stay hungry for a longer time i have an opportunity an easy opportunity of saving one human life so if that non-muslim who's not used to staying hungry and is dying of hunger i will give my loaf of bread to him and pray to allah may he save me and even god forbid if i die because i've saved one human being it is as though i've saved the whole of humanity insha allah inshallah allah will put me in jannah hope that answers the question"
