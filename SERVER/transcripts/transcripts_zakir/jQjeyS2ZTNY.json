  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaykum and Namaste Dr zakin N I recently watched your lecture on the similarities of Islam and Hinduism it was so beautiful and I'm so impressed with your knowledge on both religions and the scriptures I have one question if you could please answer in the lecture time 2 hours 32 minutes and 9 seconds an individual asked you that you have said that there are so many similarities between Islam and Hinduism does that mean that according to Islam a person can be a Hindu in response you have said that if you mean by the term Hindu a person who follows the religious scriptures of Hinduism then I have got no objection as long as that Hindu strictly follows the established truths of the scriptures of Hinduism established truths means those truths mentioned in the Hindu scripture which have been confirmed by the last and final revelation of God that is the Glorious Quran and I'm referring to vas and the Quran which are mentioned in my lectures both of them they believe that there is one God they believe in The Messengers they believe the last messenger is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him they believe in the Hereafter if they believe in all these established facts I have got no objection mashallah the rort has repeat man in detail Mah if this is exactly about a Hindu beliefs then what makes them different from a Muslim is the word religion just a term at the point at this point can a Muslim and Hindu get married if not then why not I would really appreciate your answer on this thank you in the end in the question as ped that if she follows the truth or if that Hindu follows the truth in the Hindu scripture which is established by the Quran and the meaning if you follow those Hindu scriptures which are established by the teachings of Quran and say Hadith then what's the difference correct you're right if the person follows the established teachings in the Hindu scriptures which is mentioned the Quran in say then he become the Muslim he has to become a Muslim he has to believe there one God he has to believe Prophet Muhammad the last and final messenger of God and this men in the Hindu scriptures and I've proven in my lecture that even the Hindus believe in one true God who has no image Etc and they believe also that in the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad pece paper and these two are the most important criteria for anyone to accept Islam so answer was very clearcut that if they really a true practicing Muslim based on the teachings of the Hindu scriptures which match with the Quran and they are Muslims what is the difference the difference is that Hindu as I mentioned my talk is a geographical definition those people living in the land of the indust valley civilization or those people living in India they are called as Hindu it's a geographical definition it is not a religious definition the right word should be vant this according to Swami Swami a person who follows the vas should be called a vedantist and not a Hindu Hindu is a ml so in that context I am from India and I live in India I'm a Hindu by geographical definition but the real Muslim is a person who submits to Allah subhana tala so if a person who believes in the Hindu scriptures with made the Quran and they believe that there is one God and they believe that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of what they are Muslims so they become Muslims and the right word is Muslim so inshallah we pray to Allah subhana wa taala that may your father and your mother and your brothers and sisters inshallah they become Muslims they they follow Allah and his they worship only one God and though there are many facility that is there but if you believe in one God and believe in the last and final revelation of Allah tala then you are a Muslim you enter the fold of Islam and according to me you should not delay because you don't know how long a person will live whe to see tomorrow or not we don't know so my request to you would be do it and see to it that you follow the Quran and the hope that answer the question"
