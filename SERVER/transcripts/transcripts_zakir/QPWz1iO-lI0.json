  "transcript": "on the topic generally about repentance and supplication there's such a small difference between the two but it's a world in itself but Dr zakya if I could just pose the first question today why is Ramadan referred to Often by many people as being the month of supplications alhamdulillah before I answer a question I would like to First Define what is the meaning of the word supplication supplication means to call upon Allah subhah wa taala the almighty and glorious with devotion with sincerity and solemnity and with complete submission and our beloved Prophet m said it's mentioned in of Hadith number 2616 I beloved Prophet mallam said that there are three gates of goodness the first is fasting which is a shield from the Hellfire second is a satka that is Charity that charity extinguishes sin same as water extinguishes fire and the third is standing in prayer in the late hours in the night so here we realize there is a relationship between supplication prayer and fasting and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 186 Allah says that if my servants ask thee concerning me tell them I am indeed close to them and I listen to the prayer of every supplicant and tell them that if they listen to my call willingly and if they believe in me I will take them to the straight path here we realize the closeness of Allah subhana wa ta'ala along with his Believers his servants and slaves and he says if my slaves if my servants my servants means the closeness that the human beings have with Allah subhana tala if they ask me concerning me tell them I am indeed close to them which shows the closeness between the Believers and Allah subhana tala and he says I will respond to them and Allah further says in the Quran inaha chapter number four verse number 32 but ask from the Bounty of Allah subhana tala and our beloved Prophet mallam said it's mentioned inkari volume number8 Hadith number 6502 the Beloved Prophet said that Allah says ask me and I will give it to you ask me your protection and I will protect you and as far as Ramadan being called as the month of Supplication a beloved Prophet said it's mentioned in a of Al Hadith number 6393 where the Beloved Prophet said that Allah subhana wa ta'ala does not reject the prayer of three kinds of people one is the father who prays for his child his son or daughter the second is a fasting person especially when he breaks his fast and the third is a traveler and our beloved proph wasallam he further said it's mentioned in of ma Hadith number 1643 the prophet said that Allah subhana wa ta'ala emancipates the slaves from the Hellfire during every hour when the fast is broken and does this every every night and ab Prophet also said it's mentioned of Hadith number 988 Allah subhana wa ta'ala ransoms the Muslims from the Hellfire every day and night in the month of Ramadan and he answers the prayer of every Muslim every day and night in the month of Ramadan so because Allah subhana wa ta'ala he listens to the supplication of the person who fasts and he gives a special status that's the reason Ramadan is called as the month of Supplication"
