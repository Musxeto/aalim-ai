  "transcript": "I welcome you to a talk on the first 10 days of zah I've divided this talk into four sections the first is importance of the first 10 days of zah the second is the important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days of zah the third is the virtue of arafa and the fourth is or first we'll discuss the importance of the first 10 days of theah this is a forgotten Sunnah of our beloved Prophet wasallam you may have sinned all year you may have missed doing good deeds in the month of Ramadan you may have missed the last 10 nights of Ramadan you may have missed doing good deeds doing this is your opportunity make the best of it the first 10 days of Z even if you have not sinned the whole year maybe you did some minor sins maybe you did I in the month of Ramadan even you might have got the last 10 nights of Ramadan even you might have prayed the full night of yet you cannot afford as a Muslim the opportunity during the first 10 days of the most of us Muslims we are normally aware of the importance of Ramadan and we prepare ourselves and I remember when I was a kid more than 30 years back when I was in school about 45 years back we used to prepare ourselves for Ramadan and we knew the importance of Ramadan even of the last 10 nights of Ramadan but we never heard about the importance of the first 10 days of the alhamdulillah now since social media has started this is being discussed by the speakers my time when I was a kid when I was in school when at just entered College we never heard the speaker speaking about the importance of 10 days of I remember the first time I heard was maybe about 15 years back in the social media when we got involved in the field of dawa more than 25 30 years back that's the time we came to know about the importance of the first 10 days of theah and it was about 15 years back that the first time I heard in the social media a speaker speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of D and alhamdulillah year by year it's increasing and more and more people are speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of that is the reason I thought I will dedicate the major portion of this session today to the first 10 days of Z Allah subhah wa ta'ala takes an oath in Surah fa chapter number 89 verse number one to2 Allah says by by Dawn by the 10 nights and the MU they say these 10 nights that Allah Subhan tala is taking oath of refers to the first 10 days of theah and in many languages when you speak about the days it includes the night when you speak about the night it includes the day for example if I say in English I spent 10 days in London but natural it includes I spent 10 days and 10 nights in London depending upon the context include the full day it may include part of the day it may include the night it may not include similarly when in Arabic the nights are referred to it may refer to the night only it may refer to the night and they put together or it may refer to the day only in this Surah Al Surah number 89 verse number 1 to2 when Allah says by Dawn by the 10 nights the MU say and it's also mentioned in volume number eight page number 413 and if we refer to the sumarized version the English translation printed Byam it is volume number 10 page number 468 and many say that these 10 nights refer to the first 10 days of D and they agree that these first 10 days ofah are better than all the other days of the year it's even better than the last 10 days of Ramadan but it's mentioned volume number five page number 412 that though the first 10 days of zah are the best days of the full year the last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights of the year the scholars differ some Scholars few do say that the first 10 days of zah are better than the last 10 nights of Ramadan there are few Scholars who say the last 10 nights are better than the first tenders of but the right opinion and the correct opinion is by Islam may Allah have mercy on him and he rightly said that the first 10 days of zah are the best days in the full year it is even better than the last 10 days of Ramadan but the last 10 nights of Ramadan they are the best nights in the full year because it has the it's the best night in the full year so the last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights because it and amongst the days in the full year the first 10 days of Z are the best days in the year because it has the Y the day OFA"
