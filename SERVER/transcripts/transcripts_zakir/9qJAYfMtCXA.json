  "transcript": "omit I'm a Hindu from India how old is Islam and what was before Islam if only Islam is the truth then how come there are Hindu evidences four to seven thousand years old where the Amit I know that most of the non-muslims have a misconception and some of the Muslims also that Islam came into existence after the birth of Prophet Amos Allah Allah and Islam is about 1400 years old this is a misconception Islam is there since time immemorial and the first prophet of islam was not Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him it was Prophet Adam peace be upon him and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final messenger and Quran is not the first revelation of Islam it is the last and final revelation of Islam so question when how old in Islam Islam is they since time immemorial since time immemorial since man set foot on the earth the first human being was Adam peace be upon him since that time Islam is there so a second part of the question how come there is evidence of Hinduism four to seven thousand years before I agree there are some evidences of Hindu scriptures and there are some evidences but that doesn't mean that Hinduism is older than Islam Islam is much older anyhow a religion becoming old does not give more thin disappea so tensity is on the scripture itself it is not based on if it is newer to the more attentive of its old it's more authentic nor sensitive depending upon the truth so if we analyze the Quran as as Quran says there were several revelation sent on the face of the earth by name only four I mentioned the Torah the sabor the injeel and the quran and there were 124 thousand messengers and on the face of the earth by name only twenty-five are mentioned in the Quran Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus Mohammed peace be upon them all so what we have to realize that if we study the scripture and you do comparative study which you can see my talks on it similarity but Islam or Christianity similary summon hinduism and if you put the test of time when we put the test of time that Quran is the miracle of miracles previously it was the age of miracles and Quran is the miracle of miracle then came the age of literature and poetry when the Quran was revealed it was the age of literature and poetry and Arabic was at its pinnacle what I did best and when the Arabs when they heard the Quran being cited when the render on they said this cannot be a human hand even though human men can write such beautiful Arabic and many accept Islam so Arab Quran is the best Arabic literature on the face of the earth so that time was the age of rich and poetry Quran proved itself today if a religious book phase in a very poetic fashion the world is flat with a modern man believe in it and answer is No today is the age of science and technology so today if you put the test of science to the religious scriptures available only a hum Danella for and passes the test if you put the test of science to Quran I have given a talk on Quran and modern science compatible and compatible and there you come to know that there is not a single verse in the glorious quran which is against established science and there are more than 6,000 verses in the quran out of which would then a thousand speak about science so if you put this test we will come to know that quran is the most authentic scripture and if you do analysis then you come to know which religion is most authentic all the other scriptures that was sent before the quran by the passage of time they changed and since they were not to be followed to be followed till eternity all the messengers that came before prophet muhammad peace be upon him they were sent only for their people and that time all the scripture that were revealed before the quran only meant for those people in that time that there is in allah subhanaw taala didn't feel it a requirement to preserve it in the authentic form but the Quran in the last and final revelation and Allah says in the Quran surah Heejun chap number 15 was the man named that we have revealed the Quran and we shall guard it from corruption"
