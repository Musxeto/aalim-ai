  "title": "All Religions Teach that you should not Rape but Islam Shows a Way where People will not Rape",
  "transcript": "let me give one more example most of the religions say that you should not molest a woman you should not rape a woman hinduism says that judaism says that christianity says that islam says the same so what's the difference between islam and the other religions islam besides telling you not to molest a woman not to rape a woman it shows you a way how to achieve a state in which people will not molest will not tease will not rape any woman islam has the system of hijab many times people talk about hijab for the woman hijab for women in islam but allah subhanahu wa in the quran first speaks about the hijab for the man and then for the woman allah says in the quran in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and guard his modesty whenever a man looks at a woman if any brazen thought comes he should lower his case when there was a muslim was staring at a girl for a long time brother what are you doing it's not allowed he said a beloved prophet said the first glance is forgiven the second is prohibited i have not completed half my glands what did the prophet mean when he said that the first glance is forgiven the second is prohibited what the prophet meant that unintentionally if you look at a woman it will be forgiven but don't intentionally look at her to feast on a beauty that does not mean you can look at a woman for 10 minutes without blinking and saying i have not completed my glance the next verse speaks about the hijab for the woman allah says in the quran in surah nur chapter 24 verse number 31 say to the believing woman that she should lower the gaze and guard a modesty and display not a beauty accept what appears ordinarily off and to draw a head covering over the bosom over the chest and this spin on a beauty except in front of a husband her father her son and a big list of maram the close relatives who she can't marry is given basically there are six criteria of hijab given in the quran and the say hadith the first is the extent which differs between the man and the woman for the man it from the navel to the knee for the woman the complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and hands up to the rest these are the only parts that can be seen otherwise the complete body should be covered the remaining five criteria are the same for the man and the woman the second is that the clothes they wear it should not be tight fitting so that it reads the figure third it should not be transparent or translucent so that you can see through fourth it should not be so glamorous so that attracts the opposite six fifth it should not resemble that of the opposite sex and six it should not resemble that of the unbelievers this in short is the hijab which is mentioned quran say hadith furthermore allah says in surah azab chapter number 33 verse number 59 o prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the believing woman that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak they should put on the jilbab so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested so quran says hijab has been prescribed for the woman so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested let me ask you a question suppose the two twin sisters who are very beautiful equally beautiful and if they're walking down the streets of chennai and one sister she's wearing the islamic hijab complete body covered except the face and hands up to the list and the other twin sister she's wearing the western clothes the mini skirts and short and if they're walking down the streets of chennai and around the corner there's a hooligan there's a ruffian who's waiting for a catch who's reigning he's a girl i'm asking the question which girl will it is will it is the girl wearing the islamic hijab or will it is the girl wearing the mini skirts for shots which girl will it is the girl the girl wearing the western clothes mini skirts and shorts easy answer easy question easy answer you don't have to be a intelligent person to answer this so quran rightly says that hijab had been prescribed for the woman so that they shall be recognized and prevent them from being molested after this the islamic sharia says any man rapes a woman capital punishment death penalty many non-muslims say death penalty in this 21st century islam is a barbaric religion it's a ruthless law but when i ask the question and i've asked this question to thousands of non-muslims that suppose god forbid someone rapes your wife or someone rapes your mother and if you are made the judge and if the rapist is born in front of you what punishment will you give believe me all of them said we'll put him to death some went to the extent of saying we will torture him to death so why do you have the double standard someone rapes your mother your wife you want to put him with that somebody raped somebody else's mother as his wife you said death penalty the barbaric law why these double standards and do in america usa which we look upon to be one of the most advanced countries in the world do you know it has one of the highest rates of rape in the world according to the 1990 statistics of fbi in the year 1990 alone 100 and hundred and fifty 255 cases of rape took place and the fbi statistics said only sixteen percent were reported to get the exact figure we have to multiply by six point two five and you get a total of six hundred and forty thousand and 968 rapes took place in 1919 u.s airline that means every day 1756 rape took place and out of those reported only 10 percent were arrested that means only 1.6 percent of the rapists were arrested out of those arrested 50 percent were let free before the trial that means only 0.8 of the rapist underwent a trial that means 125 rapes you commit and the chances will be caught and undergoing a trial is one it's a very good bargain 125 rapes you do and chances you'll get caught and go for the trial is only one and majority of the case though the american law says seven years rigorous imprisonment most of the time oh it's the first time you die so give him a lesser punishment if you read the statistics of 1996 u.s department of justice it says that in 1996 on average 2713 cases of rape took place every day in usa that means every 32 second one rape is taking place in america we are here for more than an hour already more than 100 trips may have taken place in america since the time i am giving this lecture i am asking you the question that if you implement the islamic sharia in usa that whenever a man looks at a woman if any brazen any unashamed thought comes in his mind he should lower his gaze after that every woman should wear the islamic hijab complete body covered the only part that can be seen are the face and hands of the list and after that if any man rapes a woman capital punishment death penalty i'm asking the question will the rate of rape in usa will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease it will decrease it's a practical law you implement the sharia and you get results that's the reason i say islam besides doing good things it shows you a way how to achieve a state in which these good things can be practiced and today the least rate of rape in any country in the world it's in saudi arabia not that the police is very intelligent the law is so strict you implement the sharia you get results and if saudi arabia relaxes this law even in saudi arabia the rape will increase and even threat will increase it is the law which is important the islamic sharia you implement the sharia you get results that's the reason i say islam besides speaking good things shows you a way how to achieve the state of goodness therefore i say islam is a religion which shows you how to lead life it's a way of life it caters to both the body as well as the soul"
