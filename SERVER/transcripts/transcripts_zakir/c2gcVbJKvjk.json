  "title": "Stop Forced Cremations in Sri Lanka for Covid 19 Victims â€” Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "we'll take the first question from the what's up i am umir from sri lanka i am a student the government of sri lanka has not given the permission for the burial of muslims who die due to covert 19. what should we muslims do for this unjustified case till now more than 100 muslims were cremated that is burned a similar question is asked assalamualaikum my name is hussein mahmoud i am a student studying in a local university after march the sri lankan government decided to cremate the coveted 19 victims body regardless of the consent from the family our politicians are trying to amend the decision but we cannot we want to raise this issue internationally we want sheikh to speak about this issue the question posed by both the questioners were regarding the decision taken by the sri lankan government several months earlier in the month of march and april 2020 that all those who die because of covert 19 or they die after testing positive covert 19 all of them should be cremated should be burnt irrespective of the religion irrespective of the consent of the family and this decision was mainly taken by the government according to me was mainly to act against the muslims and as you will be aware that the population of the muslims in sri lanka it is approximately 2.2 to 2.5 million according to the 2012 census 9.7 percent of the population of sri lanka were muslims now they'll somewhere close to 11 percent in the population in sri lanka about 11 percent would be muslims and christians were 7.4 percent in the 2012 census they'll be close to 7.5 percent now both put together would be 18.5 percent of the population of sri lanka they normally bury after they die because of the religious teachings whether it be the muslims or whether it be the christians the majority of the sri lankans they are buddhist 70.2 percent of the population of sri lanka buddhist and 12.6 percent are hindus and both of these communities they cremate after they die i personally feel that this decision taken by the sri lankan government was mainly to harass the minorities that is the muslims and the christians and though the muslim politicians they tried the level best and they approached the government and they tried to convince them but the government said that it is not our decision we are not interfering it has been taken by the health authorities they have told that the best to do after the person dies after being tested positive for corvette 19 the safest is to cremate them to burn them so we aren't interfering with the decision it is not our decision it is the decision of the health authorities and we cannot do anything about it later on there were many muslim lawyers who got together and they even filed a petition in the supreme court in the highest authority of law in sri lanka but unfortunately it was rejected now when we analyze sri lanka is the only country in the world amongst more than 200 countries which has got this unique rule that anyone who dies because of covert 19 should be cremated nowhere else in the world and when we check the who requirement they say once a person dies because of corporate 19 it doesn't make a difference whether you bury them or whether you cremate them both are safe so from where do the health authorities of sri lanka get this idea that cremating or burning the dead body after they have been tested positive covenant 19 is safer and better i feel it is just a harassment of the minority there is no medical or scientific proof at all that a dead body after being positive of covert 19 and the dying because of covert 19 they should be cremated it is not at all a scientific fact there is no medical proof at all for it in fact scientifically if we compare the difference between cremation and burial and let me tell you that majority of the people in the world after dying they are being buried because the christians are approximately 2.5 billion in the world the muslims are more than 2 billion the christians approximately 31 in the world and the muslims are more than 25 percent both put together only the christians and muslims they are more than 56 percent of the world population and many others are also buried so approximately two-thirds of the world population they are buried if you compare the pros and cons between the burial of a dead body and a cremation of a dead body point number one when we cremate or burn the body after the person has died there is a lot of pollution so cremation and burning the dead body causes multiple times more pollution it pollutes the area there is pollution as compared to burial there is no pollution alhamdulillah number two when a dead body is cremated for burning the red body a lot of wood has to be burned because of which millions of trees have to be chopped in india alone there are millions of trees every year they are killed and they are chopped only because they require wood for burning the dead bodies so the forest it destroyed because of cremation because the burning that it bodies whereas in burial the forest is retained the more greenery is retained as compared to cremation point number three when a dead body is buried the bones that disintegrate the body gets disintegrated and scientifically today science tells us that whatever is present in the human body the components to a lesser or greater extent the same components also present in the earth so as it said in islam from earth become and to the earth will return so the thing is that it is more scientific to bury your body as compared to cremation point number four when we bury a body the body disintegrates the bulge disintegrate and it makes that land where the dead body is buried more fertile which is not the case when a body is burnt it turns into ashes when we bury the body it gives more manure the earth gets more fertile there's more greenery there's more forest it's much better for the environment point number five the land where you bury the same land can be recycled once you burn the wood in bearing a dead body that would cannot be used it turns into ashes so in burial it can be recycled and point number six it is very cheap there is no cost required once you buy the land and most of the graveyard they are big they are present hundreds of years the same land can be used after few years whereas in cremation in burning it's very expensive you have to buy wood it's more expensive to burn a body as compared to burying a body so scientifically i've just mentioned six benefits of bearing as compared to cremation coming back to the question that what the sri lankan government has done just to harass the minorities especially the muslims and the christians what action should be taken number one what the muslims of sri lanka have done they have approached the political party is one of the good things they should do but unfortunately because the muslim land minority they are not as a very good force in terms of convincing the government of being at the word bank point number two we should go to the legal authorities of the country and that's what the muslims in sri lanka have done and according to me though the sri lankan muslims are minority compared to other countries they are quite united alhamdulillah so they got together and they filed the case in the supreme court but what happens that when the government is in majority and if it's against the muslims and minority many a time the law supports the government in most of the countries and here as i mentioned that the buddhists they are 70.2 percent along with the hindus the 12.6 percent both put together they are about 83 percent so because of this the supreme court they declined the petition third thing that should be done is there should be more awareness that should be made throughout not only in sri lanka but throughout the world because if the world comes to know surely they can be pressure from outside seeing the situation now what i believe the best that can be done is there should be pressure from the muslim countries and alhamdulillah there are some muslim countries which have got active and i've been in touch with some of the religious people in sri lanka i've been touched with some of the politicians also in sri lanka and alhamdulillah also in some of the ngos in uk and there are muslims who are trying to see to it that the muslims unite and this issue also inshallah will be brought very soon to the oic that is the organization of islamic corporation but the negative factor is that the muslims unfortunately throughout the world we aren't united the muslims today about 57 countries in the world the population is majority they're muslims more than 50 percent of the population of 57 countries in the world about 27 percent of the countries in the world they have a muslim majority and the muslim population in the world is more than 2 billion more than 25 of the world population today are muslims but unfortunately today the muslims are united many of the muslim countries they're fighting among themselves a neighboring muslim country fighting with the other neighboring muslim country for their personal benefits because of which the ummah is not united if the muslim ummah was united like it was there in the past we had one leadership then the situation would have been different now because the muslim ummah is not united and some of the muslim countries don't want to interfere they say okay it's not concerning ourselves it's regarding some others it is totally against the islamic principles as the beloved prophet muslim said that the muslims are like one body and if one body feels pain then everyone rushes to see to it that they take care so we muslims should be like one body parts of different body and we should help each other and as the quran says in surah maidah chapter number five verse number two that help one another in biran taqwa in righteousness and in good deeds in virtue we muslims should stand up together and internationally if all the muslims get together and object to the injustice that's being done in sri lanka against the minorities against the muslims and against the christians then inshallah there are high chances that the sri lankan government would change the law because there is no scientific evidence at all what they are saying that because the health authorities are saying that the reason they want to burn the bodies of all the corporate 19 people who have been tested positive and but natural in islam and christianity a body after death should be buried and we hope that even the christian countries all over the world they unite together and they take action or they put pressure on sri lanka to change this unjustified law another thing that can be done is that we muslim should use the social media to make this thing known throughout the world and inshallah very shortly tomorrow day after tomorrow i myself would be leaving facebook post because my daughter she had exams my youngest daughter rajda she's very good with the pen most of the time i tell her to draft post on such issues so she just finished her examination of the second last year where she is studying islamic studies in bachelors so inshallah in the next couple of days you'll find a series of posts talking about this issue so that there is more awareness in the muslim ummah and i request the muslim all over the world that to see to it that they make it aware to the people all across the world the injustice that has been done by the sri lankan government if the muslims get together and they make it aware so inshallah we pray to allah that may the sri lankan government change the unjustified stance and allow the people who have died because of corbett 19 to choose whether they want to be married or whether they want to be cremated"
