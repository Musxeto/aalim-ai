  "title": "Four Madhabs and why do they Differ? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question posed by abdul kareem from lahore pakistan if all the muslims believe in the same quran and the same hadith then why are there four madhabs and why do they differ this is a very important question and a very sensitive question the principle is the question that if the muslims believe in the same quran and believe in the same hadith then why are they four madhabs and why do they differ i do agree that as far as the alison novel jamaat is concerned major chunk of the muslims all of us believe in the same quran we believe in the same hadith we believe after the quran is the bukhari the most important then say muslim is there then you're following that these four are the main collection of the quotable and there's unanimous agreement between this the quran and the quran number one after the quran is bukhari then muslim and then the other four books of regarding the question that why are there four madhabs and why do they differ as far as the four popular madab that we have today and we follow the four emmas that is mostly on them all i love all these foie masks i respect them all and i really pray for all of them may allah grant their mercy and may allah put all of them in general let me correct you first that these four madahib they came to explain to the muslim ummah islam in detail let me tell you that they don't differ always they differ rarely more than 90 to 95 percent all the formative are the same they may differ in some issues maybe minor issues as far as the major issues are concerned about salah we have to pray five times regarding zakat recounting hajj all these four mother they are same in the minute aspects of salah or if hajj they may differ here and there but there are minor differences it's not a major difference at all it is not worth fighting over it so let me tell you that 90 to 95 percent of all these four months are the same exactly they may differ in small issues and very few all these four imas they said that if you find any of my father any of my verdict which goes against allah and israel which goes against quran and say hadith then you throw my father on the wall so all these four i am mars they were great scholars and they came to explain the deen to us regarding why do they differ if we follow the same quran and the same hadith is a very important question and this question troubled me for many years alhamdulillah has blessed me that i have met many scholars from all this for motherhood and i interacted with many of them many years and i spent time with them and i posed the same question why do they differ and the reply they gave was there some less satisfying some more satisfying but there's no convincing replies for the masses and alhamdulillah the laughter meeting these scholars from all this for madhab my vision of islam and the differences alhamdulillah expanded a lot allah clearly mentioned in the quran in surah imran chapter 3 verse 103. hold to the rope of allah strongly and be not divided we muslims are supposed to hold to the rope of allah that the glorious quran and the sahad and all its all the alistair novel jamaat muslims we believe in the quran and say hadith then why are the differences to explain to a common man i will give you some examples and always believe in explaining people by giving examples which they understand i would like to ask a simple question to the people who know english what is the spelling of the word color can you guess give the reply you can give the reply what's up you can give the reply on the facebook you can give the reply on the youtube what is the spelling of color i'm not getting any reply what is the spelling of color what is the spelling of color some may say the spelling of color is c-o-l-o-u-r some may say the spelling of color is c-o-l-o-r which is correct a person who is well-versed with english will tell you that the first spelling is the spelling of british english c-o-l-o-u-r is the british spelling for the word color c-o-l-o-r is the american spelling for the word color i'm asking the question which is correct c-o-l-o-u-r or c-o-l-o-r and again you'll have different opinion some will say c-o-l-o-u-r is correct if he's the british some will say c-o-l-o-r if he's an american some may say both are correct but even if they differ you never find them fighting over this issue the mediever a britisher will say c-o-l-o-u-r is correct i am an indian we were ruled by the britishers and quite a large portion of the world was ruled by the britishers so all those who were ruled by the britishers and we were british colonies we will follow british english and we will say the spelling of kara c-o-l-o-u-r the american will say c-o-l-o-r we agree to both a britisher would prefer c-o-l-o-u-r but if someone says c-o-l-o-r fine we agree to differ same with american he will say c-o-l-o-r but he agrees he believes that is better but he agrees with c-o-l-o-u-r also similarly this is just an example i've given you how do you pronounce o-f-t-e-n how do you pronounce o f t e n some will say often some will say often previously it was often then it became often now new people are saying of 10 is correct t is not silent it should be pronounced some say t sign and then the big debate for that but we realize that both are correct in their own ways similarly these schools of thought four that we have actually there were many tens and hundreds of imams and scholars these four imam abu hanifah imam malik imam shafi imam ahmad humble may allah have mercy on them all mella grant them jonathan fridos to all they were more popular or maybe their students made them popular there were many other imams many other shaykhs many other scholars but these four their teachings became more popular maybe the students made it more popular and that's how we have these four major mother hypes but all these four great scholars and four amas they never came to bring a division in the muslim ummah they explained their point of view because if it's very clear-cut in the quran there is no problem at all if it's taken another the different comes when there is a difference opinion now why is there a difference of opinion i will discuss that previously has to think okay fine you know maybe the difference is in the hadith some people say say hadith some people say that's the difference that is not the real answer that may be in some cases after meeting so many focus and scholars of the different motherhood i have come with this example of the spelling or the example of pronunciation so similarly these motherhood differ what is the major reason according to my study there is usually that in areas where it is not very clear-cut quran says alcohol is haram there is no fick in it allah says it's sarah so no one will differ allowed or not allah every so that's come where there is difference in understanding the quran or the hadith et cetera then they fixed that so as far as usual effect is concerned there are different criteria for giving your ruling on fake some may have five criteria some may have six some may have seven some may have nine some may have even ten i will not discuss in detail time does not permit and difficult for common men to understand i'll give a few examples for a better understanding number one difference is difference in the criteria as far as the first two criteria are concerned it is the same number one criteria in all madhav all schools of thought it is quran number one there's no difference in it number two is the motavater hadith all the schools of thought believe that number two criteria for fish is the mutavatara what is the muta there are various different classifications of hadith one of the classifications depending upon the narrators the chain of narrators mutavat hadees means a hadith in which there are various chains of narrators in every generation that means that hadith has been narrated by various many sahabas who heard the prophet say that then the next generation turbine there were many tabans who repeated that hadith then the tabetaba and many zabataban repeated the hadith so in every generation there are various many narrators so in one of the classification of hadith it is based on narrators it is maybe a single chain of hadith then this one narrator is there at any one stage only one narrator for example the very famous hadid the first hadith of say bukhari um he said that the prophet said in albania your actions are based on your intention all you find this hadith in bukhari in muslim in various books but there's only one sabbah narrated it so if any of the stages where the stage of sabbah or the tab or any of the stages of narration if any of the stages have only one narrator coming in all the hadith it becomes a hadadity so there are various chain of narrators but all the narrators end to omar radhila one and then umar de lava narrated what the prophet said so it becomes it may be a mashup hadith if there may be two or three narrators and it keeps on various category the highest category is muthavatir that means several narrators at every stage that means every stage have many narrators number is not has to be more than four or five every stage some are 20 some are 30 at every stage so number one is the quran number two is the muthavat all the schools of thought agree that the number two highest category of evidence after the quran is the muthavatirati third category onwards the third criteria of evidence differs in different schools of thought some five criteria some are six summer seven some have ten criteria in some schools of thought the third criteria highest criteria of evidence is even as long it's a say hadith even i had no problem it can be a mashup it is the third house and some school of said no no no the third after the muthavatha hadees is the orf is the custom that if the people of madina did this act it is the custom it is the third hat higher than even which is some will say no it is chaos analogy so different schools of thought have different criteria in order first two is the same the third may be some may say no the custom some may say class analogy other group the fourth becomes the fourth becomes custom in some sorts of thought so from the third onward it differs so based on this difference some may prefer custom as a higher so if it is not there in the quran if it's not their mutabata it is in so i will not believe i will give more importance custom more importance so the differences arise in what you give more importance to do you give importance more to or for the custom do you give more importance to chaos analogy or do you give more importance to others from third level it keeps on differing in different source of thought so because of that what you give more importance to differs that's how the ruling differs but all these rulings are minor what we have to understand that we have to respect the ruling of all the four schools of thought because all the four schools of thought are based on quran they are based on hadith but the level of importance may differ some schools of thought say they may have a criteria if you are talking about salah it should be because salah the prophet prayed in public almost all the sabbaths saw him so if you give about salah hadith though it is sahih i will not follow if it is allah it has to be evidence for other than not follow that is their thinking you may agree may not agree you may say no it's one sabbah reported it it is sufficient for me it says hadith fulfills the criteria of sahih it is sufficient for me other school also say no if it's other matter i will believe in but sallah such important thing profit paid every day five times a day it should be a mutawatara difference opinion so how do you differ so the third and the fourth and the fifth level of criteria after the first two differs this is the reason why the major difference is there in the four schools of thought it may be difficult for people to understand number two the difference may also be that you may differ that whether it's a say hadith or not some may say it's asanadis hasan addis is the lowest level of say hadith some will say no it is so therefore this is not a is not an evidence for saying something is fair or something is haram it may have other values so the scene may differ and when they differ the different mind with some messages hassan some may say life hassan is the lowest category of sahih classifying hadith on the basis of whether this is a for mozu is another classification say hadith itself there are ten types of sahaja then comes if then comes time will not probably go into details so the second type of difference of opinion in fick besides the criteria is whether the hadith is if you third may be different in understanding the hadith for example the hadith of the prophet muslim that after ruku the prophet stood and he kept his hands where they were so some schools of thought i am not mentioning the names purposely some schools of thought say the prophet kept his hand on his chest before he went to ruku the hand won the chest so after ruku when they get up they keep the hand on the chest the other i must say no before starting the salah where was the hand the hands were at the side so when they get up from roku they keep the hands on the sides so here you understand that the difference is because understanding the hadith all of them agree that but one fukaha agrees this hadith refers to where were the hands before going to ruku the other focus agree that it was before starting salah so difference in interpreting the hadith so one is because of criteria which is the major difference number two is that difference in whether it's a psyosis number three in understanding the hadith similarly there can be a difference in understanding the quranic verse also for example the verse of the quran says that when a woman touches your urdu breaks so one focal agrees the physical touch breaks the urdu the arabic word is masa coming from the word lamasa lamasa has got two meaning arabic one means the sexual touch one means a physical touch so one focar takes it as a physical touch and this physical touch breaks the other focus says no it means sexual touch so physical touch does not become so the difference is that they're in understanding the meaning of the verse of the quran so because of these differences where there'll be difference in criteria whether it be difference in whether they had whether it's a difference in understanding the hadith whether the difference in understanding the verse of the quran because of this the differences are there and these differences are minor we should not fight over it what we find today that because of these issues there are some people who just study for a few months or few years and they start saying that okay my freak is the best and is the only right one which is wrong all these are great focus we love them all we respect them all even they among themselves when they deferred they respected they agreed with the view what they said my view i think is absurd it is better that doesn't mean you are wrong but today most of them you are wrong i'm right what i say even i am right to say i am only right is a big problem or you can say i think this is observed this is better that you can say but today what we have no i am only right you are wrong because of that there is tension and there is fighting we muslims should be united these are pet issues the differences are going to be there there were differences in the sabbath we should not fight over it and we should agree that we agree to disagree we should not fight over it and all these issues are not on the major issues they are minor issues so i require the muslim ummah that we should be united and we should respect the immaas and we should respect the scholars and see to it that we follow the quran and say hadith as close as possible hope to answer the question"
