  "transcript": "from Muhammad Usman Pakistan can we say that Hindu Muslim bye-bye bye-bye although or Hindi word which means brother brother so the question is asking can we say Hindu Muslim bhai Hindu Muslim brother brother as far as Brotherhood is concerned there are various different types of result one type of brotherhood that all of us know it is the blood brother if we have common parents common mother and father only common father only common mother we are called as blunt brother then the other Brotherhood in the Brotherhood of Iman if we belong to the same faith to the same religion we are called brothers in faith as Allah says in the Quran read surah Tauba chapter number nine was the most 71 well Nyna wilmot minute bathroom olia bod the believing men and women they are awliya they are supporters they are protectors they help us of one another that means the Muslims are brothers and sisters to one another and the very that the Brotherhood brother of Rey is brother of country but the widest and the largest Brotherhood is the Brotherhood of humanity that all human beings are brother Allah says in the Quran in surah hujrat chapter 49 verse number 13 yeah ayyuhan a so in Kakuma doctrine one Sabadell knock'em Obama Kaabah ill elite are a few in natural movement Elias common illallah Muhammad or humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honoured in the sight of allah subhanaw taala is the person was taqwa your ally thing in the Quran that all the human beings have come from a single pair of male and female Adam and Eve may peace be upon them that we have common great late great Father Adam and Eve and we are children of the same pair Allah says he had divided you into nations and tribes media of different color different languages so that you may recognize each other not that he may despise each other not that it be hate each other and the highest in the sight of Allah the criteria for judgment in the sight of Allah it is not sex it is not wealth it is not color it is not cast but it is taqwa it is got consciousness it is piety it is righteousness only way one human being can be more superior to the other human being is my God consciousness is by piety if baricza sness amongst the various brotherhood when asked this question which Ben the hood is the most important and the answer almost all of them give is the Brotherhood of blood that if you are a blood brother that is the closest result and then all the other widowed are below that but what does Allah say in the Quran if you read the story of nooh alehsalaam mentioned the Quran in surah hood we find that know Allah Salam was instructed by Allah subhana Allah to make an arc to make a big boat and he makes it and he takes a promise from Allah subhana Allah that Allah please save my family members and Allah promises that okay he will save the family members and when begins to rain his measurements for a hood verse number 40 42 43 onwards begins to rain his son says oh I will go to the tallest mountain and the water will never reach there and the water rises and it says in verse number 45 46 of surah hood chap number 11 when the water rises then his son his cry not save me save me so no alehsalaam reminded Allah subhana Allah that did you not promise that you will save my family member so Allah replied in surah hood chapter 11 verse 46 that your son is not amongst your family imagine Allah is telling to his prophet nooh alehsalaam that your son is not amongst your family so here Allah is talking about the Brotherhood of Iman the Brotherhood of faith so in Islam the Brotherhood of faith is far superior than the Brotherhood of planning the process Bedard is the Brotherhood of Iman as far as the basic question is concerned can you say into Muslim hi by Mary well you can when we are talking about the Brotherhood and humanity that the largest Brotherhood and when during question answer time we give first preference in the life question answer session to a non-muslim and I always say that the brother asked a very good question he may be a Hindu he may be a Christian no problem here I'm referring to the brother of humanity and there are many mashallah who during my talk after my talk mashallah they accept Islam then from whether of humanity they get converted to bread the hood of faith hope this answers question"
