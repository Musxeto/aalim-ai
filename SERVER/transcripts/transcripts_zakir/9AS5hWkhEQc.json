330 million but if you ask a learned Hindu who well versed with the scriptures he will tell you that the Hindus should believe and worship only one God but the common Hindu he believes in a philosophy known as pantheism pantheism means that everything is God the sun is God the Moon is God the tree is God the human being is God the snake is God what we Muslims believe that everything belongs to God everything is God's g o d with an apostrophe yes everything belongs to God the sun belongs to God the moon belongs to God the tree belongs to God the human being belongs to God this thing belongs to God so the major difference between the common Hindu and the common Muslim is the Hindu says everything is God we Muslims say everything is gods g o d with an apostrophe s if we can solve this difference of apostrophes the Hindu and the Muslims we'll be United now when we read the sacred scripture of the Hindus it's mentioned in the upanishad the upanishad are one of the higher category of Sacred Scriptures of the Hindus it's mentioned in ch chapter number six section number two verse number one God is only one without a second it's mentioned in the chapter number six verse number n of

Vedas the most important most sacred is R it's mentioned in r book number one himm number one 164 verse number 46 truth is one God is one sages and Saints call him by different names the same message repeated in r book number 10 him number 114 verse number five that God is one but Saints call him by a variety of names and there are no less than 33 attributes given to almighty God in rigd book number to him number one alone one of these attributes is in r book number two himm number one verse number three is Brahma Brahma is called as the Creator God if you translate Creator into Arabic it means khik we Muslims have got no objection if someone calls almighty God as khik or Creator or Brahma but if someone says Brahma is almighty God who has got four heads and on each head is a crown we mus Muslims take strong exception to it because you're going against chapter number four verse number 19 which says of that God there is no pratima there is no image there is no Idol there is no picture there is no painting there is no portrait there is no statue there is no sculpture the other attribute given to almighty God in r book number two him number one verse number three is Vishnu

or cherisher or sustainer or Vishnu but if someone says Vishnu is almighty God who's traveling on a sea on a bed of snakes who has got four hands on one hand is the chakra and flying on the bird by the name of guda we Muslims take strong objection to it and you're going against J chapter number 32 verse number three which says of that God there is no pratima there is no image there's no Idol there is no picture there's no portrait there is no painting there is no sculpture there's no statue it's further mentioned in r book number eight himm number one was number one Mar the do not worship him except the one and only praise him alone it's mentioned in r book number six himym number 45 verse number 16 it says praise him alone one God only Praise Him and the Brahma Sutra of Hinduism the fundamental Creed of Hinduism is there's only one God not a second one not at all not at all not in the least bit so if you read the Hindu scriptures you'll understand the concept of God in Hinduism M and understand Hinduism in the right perspective and that will help to increase the Brotherhood between the Hindus and the Muslims"
