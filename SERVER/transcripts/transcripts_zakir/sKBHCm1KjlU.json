  "transcript": "what's your thoughts on children fasting the month of Ramadan before they get to the age of puberty as I mentioned earlier it is not compulsory for a child who has not reached the age of puberty to fast it's not compulsory they're Exempted as the Beloved Prophet mallam said there Hadith in Hadith number 1423 our beloved Prophet said that the pen has been lifted up from three categories of people a child until he reaches puberty a sleeping person until he wakes up and a person who's insane until he becomes of sound mind so these three categories of people the Beloved Prophet said that the pen has been lifted that means it's not obligatory on them to fast same as prayer also they aren obliged but it's good to encourage our children to fast as early as possible though it's not compulsory and there's a Hadith which is mentioned in say bukari number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1 1960 where the Beloved prophet wasallam he tells the people of ansar he sends a messenger and tells them to inform that those who are fasting they should continue fasting those who are not fasting should fast till the end of the day and after that the people the sah they said we fasted and we even asked a children to fast and we took them to the mass and if they cried we gave them toys of wol so that keep themselves busy till the time ofar that means this is how the sahabas they encourage the children to fast at an early age though it was not compulsory and this is a good habit but many a time that we see nowadays that many of the parents they discourage the children from fasting even if the child is enthusiastic and says I to fast many parents say at this young age it's not required don't fast they fail to realize that fasting at a young age will not cause them any harm in fact it will give them a training to fast when they reach puberty and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 66 verse number six oh you believe save yourself and your families from the torment of Hellfire whose fuel is men and Stones Allah is reminding the people that don't only save yourself even your children from the Hellfire whose fuel is men and Stones so it is good to encourage our children to fast at an early age and that's what we do in the school that we are running the Islamic International School we encourage them to fast at an early ag even when they are in junior kg or in senior kg at the age of four 5 six we encourage them and at this age the age of four five six we say that the person who fasts the maximum in the class will get a gift will get a reward and that encourages them and and when they reach standard first that is approximately age of six alhamdulillah most of the children fast the full month and by the time they reach standard third that's about 7 eight years almost all of them fast the full month of Ramadan though it's not compulsory so alhamdulillah And when they see other children fasting imagine most of the parents they tell them that oh it's not required but the children they force that we want to fast because of competition MH because of seeing their friends all of them fasting so if they don't F they feel ashamed though it's not F than them but the atmosphere you create we don't tell them it is far too fast but the atmosphere of competition the atmosphere of loving each other and loving the religion loving Allah and hiso so in this way alhamdulillah like it is said in a Hadi mamam said mentioned in tii that when a child reaches the age of seven we should teach him to off for Salah and at the age of 10 you can even use Force so that means scholar say you can do the same thing even for fasting but we start at a much earlier age but it is not force that we use we use love affection and gifts and rewards and alhamdulillah it has a tremendous effect on the children"
