  "transcript": "i welcome all the viewers of the peace tv network the phd of english the phd urdu the peace tv bangla and the peach tv chinese as well as my four social media platforms which are the facebook the youtube the instagram and twitter i welcome all the viewers with islamic greetings mercy and blessings of allah be on all of you i welcome you to this program ask dr zakir and his son farik season 2 session 1 you were just hearing my son farik naik who was handling the question answer session live from riyadh saudi arabia and i'm sorry for the interruption because the network was very bad inshallah i will continue the session and here you're most welcome to ask any questions on islam and comparative religion any question which a non-muslim or an atheist may have asked you and you are unable to reply any question that you find in the media attacking islam or you require a logical reply or a scientific reply this is the opportunity you can ask your questions on any of my social media platforms but the best is texting the question in brief on the whatsapp mentioning your name your profession and the city and country of residence two the whatsapp number plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five i repeat plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five now we will take the first question the first question is from hitab west bengal india is it permissible to convert a church or a temple into a mosque after that area is conquered by the muslims and a similar question of the same categories asked by munir from london uk what are your views regarding uruguayan the president of turkey converting the hagia sofia from the status of a museum to that of a mosque there are two questions asked by the brothers the first question is that is it permissible in islam to convert a church or a temple or house of worship of a non-muslim to a mosque after that land is conquered by the muslims the reply to this is yes there are several hadith and there are several references that it is permissible to convert the house of worship of the non-muslims to a mosque if the muslim wants to after they conquer the land but regarding those places of worship where there is a contract with the non-muslims for example if a non-muslim has a contract with muslims and they have a treaty that accept you as our rulers or if the non-muslim they surrender and they agree to be under the rulership of the muslims then these non-muslims are called as dimi so as far as non-muslims who are the me who are protected by the muslim rulers in this there's a special condition and a treaty that their lives will be protected by the muslim rulers the house will be protected their place of worship will be protected so in such a case where there's a contract between the muslim ruler or they have surrendered to the muslim ruler or they have invited them to take over from the ruler which is unjust and if there is a contract and there is no war in these cases they are called as me and the non-muslim they have to pay ajayi for protection under these conditions the muslims are supposed to protect the lives of the non-muslims their homes as well as their house of worship but they cannot build new house of worship which belong to non-muslims they cannot expand it but they can keep it and here the muslims will not touch the house of worship of the non-muslims but if the muslims conquer the land in this case it is perfectly permissible for the muslims to convert it into a mosque as far as the second question is concerned that what are my views regarding the issue that has taken place today and we know that the court has given the verdict and nardogan the president of turkey has said that the sofia which was a museum would be reverted back to a mosque let me first give you a brief regarding the history of hagia sofia so that people are unaware will know about it and then i will give my views as far as i thank you for sophia's concern it's a monument which is there for about 1500 years it was built by emperor justine one in 537 ce it took about few years for him to build and it was a cathedral of the greek orthodox and it remained a cathedral for several centuries in 1204 during the fourth crusaders they converted the greek arthros cathedral into a roman catholic church until 1261. so initially for 667 years it was a greek orthodox cathedral then after that for 57 years from 1204 to 1261 for 57 years it was the roman catholic church again later on when the christian byzantines came to power it was again converted back into a greek authors cathedral until the ottoman rulers until sultan muhammad he conquered constantinople in 1453 then it was converted into a mosque so since 537 up to 1453 for more than 900 years it remained a greek authorized cathedral then for a few years it was the roman catholic church then went back to become a greek orthodox cathedral and it was the largest church in the world where it was built the biggest in-house covering and the dome was the largest it remained larger for a thousand years until 1500 when a new church was made in 1453 sultan muhammad he conquers constantinople and then there are documents available that he purchases the hegel sofia and after purchasing it he converts it into a mosque it remains a mosque till 1931 until mustafa kamal took he takes over turkey and it declares it as a secular state for four years it was closed and he passes the verdict in 1934 that the mosque should be converted into a museum and since 1935 till today 2020 july that's the 11th of july it remained a museum until today and all these years for about 85 years there were many cases saying that why is the gear sofia a museum declared it that this is a sign of secularism that we want to make it into a museum it will not be a church will not be a mosque and since that there were many cases that have been filed that it is wrong that it was converted into a museum and recently the council in turkey the highest administrative court it passed a resolution that it was illegal for mustafa kamal atar turk to convert into a museum and today mashaallah the court of turkey has given a verdict and i said that it was illegal for ataturk to convert it into a museum and alhamdulillah after the court verdict we signed a resolution that this structure hagia sofia which was earlier a church then became a mosque then a museum it will be transferred from the department of tourism and it will go to the department of religious authority of turkey now this has created a lot of controversy and today if you read the newspapers and the media they are disagreeing with the decision taken by turkey by the turkish government by ardhran and you find right from usa trump russia greece all of them condemning it is wrong unesco many non-muslim organizations and you find the media that they disagreed they have been threatened and said it is wrong but the saddest part what i read in the media that there were many muslim countries and many so-called muslim daes and muslim scholars from the western countries said what turkey did and what erdogan did is wrong and to support their claim they said that we know in history that allah be pleased with him he was asked to pray in jerusalem he did not pray he said if he prays there people make a mosque and then he paid somewhere else and the musliks was made and all this is about how we encourage and have a relationship and they quoted the verse of the quran chapter 22 verse number 40 saying it is not permitted to destroy synagogues or the church and quran is against it and i was shocked to read the views of many of the muslim died from the western countries and from the arab world saying it is wrong what are my views regarding what turkey did is correct or not or what other gun did is right or wrong as far as my views are concerned the hadith quoted and the incidents quoted by the muslims regarding hazard allah be pleased with him that he did not pray and he paid somewhere else and there were treaties between muslims and others that your lives are saved and your places of worship are safe and muslim will not enter your places of worship all these references are when there is the treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims as i mentioned in the first answer to the first question that can a holy place a church or a temple be converted to a mosque after it is conquered the answer is yes only if there is a treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims or if the non-muslims surrender or they are demis non-muslim living under the law of the muslim rule islamic rule that is the only condition where the muslims give them security and they are paying a jaziah as far as when the utman rulers when they conquered constantinople it was a conquest it was a war so it is wrong to give examples of a treaty between the muslims and non-muslims and say that same way turkey should manage it it's totally wrong so if there is a conquest if there is a war and the muslims rule and this is a common law all over the world we find so many non-muslim rulers when they conquer the land they occupy the mosque many of them demolish the mosque you have example of the crusaders the best example is spain there were hundreds of mosques and most of them were either converted to churches or they were made into museums or they were destroyed hardly you find there was not a muslim who could openly give the azan why don't people object to that so this was the normal law that once you conquer that becomes your land so once it becomes the land you have a right to do what you want to do later on after world war one world war ii then the geneva convention all that is later on so before that the rule was once you conquer a land it becomes part of your land and you can do what you feel is right so based on that this was the conquest done by sultan muhammad fateh and in the conquest they have a right to keep the house of worship to convert into a mosque it is right and you find several examples in fact if you read the hadith of the prophet muslim i'll give you one incidence which i don't want to give it but to reply to these muslims who are attacking turkey and attacking that if we read the seer of the prophet we know in the fear of the prophet when muhammad sallallahu migrated to madina and later on he came back to makkah during fateh makkah what did he do when he came back with about 10 000 sahabas and it was a victory the first thing he did was he went to kaaba which was the house of worship of the non-muslims there were 360 idols in kaaba he went in the kaaba and recited the verse of the quran from surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 81 which says that when truth is in falsehood falsehood perishes for falsehood is by its need to perish and he destroyed all the idols imagine today if the non-muslims object and say what they did is wrong will the muslims agree to them it was a house of worship of the non-muslims right or wrong yes but it was a conquest though it was a bloodless conquest it was the easi once they ruled the land they destroyed the idols and that is in islamic history so do you mean to say what prophet muhammad is wrong and many may not be aware that makkah is also mentioned in the bible if you read the bible in the book of psalms chapter number 84 verse number 5-7 it says blessed are those people who traveled to the valley of bakka and the same bakka the word is also mentioned in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 96 which says the first place of worship the first house of worship of allah was bakka same word what the quran mentioned from is also mentioned in the christian bible imagine today the christians say that makta belongs to the christian and the muslim should give it to them will the muslims believe will the muslims agree and answer is no imagine someone comes with the bright idea that let us convert the haram into a museum will the muslims believe will the muslims agree and the answer is no so what you have to realize at that time this was the law and at that time you see the theory of the prophet what did he do what happened today many of the muslims are being influenced by the western culture because they're staying in western countries they want to change the islamic history they want to give a ruling they quote verses from the quran and the verse of the quran that was quoted of surah chapter number 22 verse number 40 we say that quran says that house of worship should not be destroyed there is no verse in the quran saying that it is a misunderstanding if you want to know the real context start from verse number one before surah chapter number 24 verse number 39 says that you are permitted to fight against those non-muslims who have done wrong and allah will aid you and protect you this is the first verse of the quran giving permission for the muslims when they migrate from makkah to madina to fight against the non-muslims first first then verse number that and those who leave their homes because they say that our lord is one allah is one and it continues that if allah wouldn't have checked one force with the other then the churches and the synagogues and the mosque where the name of allah is taken would have been destroyed it doesn't say that it is not permitted to destroy it's telling that allah it is giving permission for the muslims to fight against the non-muslims who have done wrong who have done transgression and then it says that those muslims who leave their home because they believe in tahit believe in one god allah is there to protect you and then it says if allah wouldn't have checked one group against the other then the places of worship like the synagogue like the church like the mosque that would have been destroyed giving indication doesn't say that you cannot destroy for knowing the real meaning go to the tahasi and if you read kurubi kurtubi says very clearly that what i said in the reply to the first answer that if there is a treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims if the non-muslims become dimi under the rule of the muslim rulers if they agree that the muslims are the rulers or if they surrender and there's no conquest and if they are paying jaziah if they're paying attacks for protection it becomes the duty of the muslims to protect the lives of the non-muslim the demi to protect their homes and protect the house of worship but again kurumi says you cannot build a new house of worship for the non-muslim because it is sin but what is there it can remain they cannot expand it also so if there is a treaty or if the non-muslims are surrendered in this case yes you cannot occupy it you protect the house of worship but cannot build a new one cannot expand it but in conquest if there is a war and if the conqueror is there then it is the right of the muslim ruler to do what he wants because that becomes part of his land so please don't quote some hadees which is out of context and there are several hadith of the beloved part of muslim where he stole the sabbath that go and destroy the idols several he has told khalid bin walid malabi please with him go and destroy the idols there are several he has allah be pleased with him go and destroy the idols there are several several hadith in bukhari in muslim muhammad salla himself destroyed the idols in makkah so please i would like to request the muslims that by giving answers a general comment muslim who may not be aware of the context will agree with the views given by such scholars which is totally wrong is there any scholar islamic scholar who can deny that the prophet broke the idols is there an islamic scholar who can deny that the prophet told us the fourth caliph of islam told khalid bin walid will not be prisoners and many of the sabbath then go and deface the idols there is one more hadith in bukhari and muslim it's mentioned in say bihari hadith number 3020 as well as a muslim hadith number 2476 where jared ibn abdullah may allah be pleased with him one of the sabas he says that the prophet peace be upon him he called me and he told me that will you relieve for me the dul khalsa what is guru khasa thulkhasa was the place of worship of the non-muslims in yemen it was also called the kaaba yamanya kaabatul yaminya means the kaaba of the yemen and in it there were idols he said will you do a favor for me will you destroy it for me then jared ibn abdullah allah be pleased with him he takes with him 150 horsemen and he burns down that house of worship it's a hadith in bukhari and muslim i don't want to tell this but it is there that means the prophet commanded not only to destroy the idols he even asked them to destroy the place of worship so when the muslims are conquering and when they rule that land it is permitted even to destroy the place of worship now this if you say quran says you should not destroy churches and synagogues do you think the prophet went against the quran the context is wrong that is when there is the treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims when they are dimi when they are under the rule of the muslim but generally it is affard to destroy the idols if the muslim conquers the land and if there are ideas it becomes the first and you have several examples of saba doing that it is umpteen number of hades are there so to try and misguide telling that it is not permissible is totally wrong but destroying the temples or the house of worship is not a firm but if required if it's causing a problem for the muslim ummah the prophet has commanded that so how can you say it's not permitted so what i would like to say that many times muslims living in the western country or even some of the muslims in the arab land you know trying to be soft to the non-muslims and trying that they are the one who will support them they are the one who are going to fund them etc they are going to protect them many a time they give verdict which is against the quran and the sunnah be careful if you are going to go against our muslim brother erdogan the president of turkey or against a muslim country there are hardly few people today muslim leaders who can really try and revive the sunnah and as i said in my earlier answer that i don't know of any muslim leader which is any way close to muhammad sallallahu sallam or anybody claims to the whole farashadin the way they ruled or how they were political leaders nowhere close not even one person now if one muslim brother is doing something which is there it just permitted why are the muslims against him so as far as my view is concerned alhamdulillah what turkey did is completely correct and if you agree that muhammad sultan he purchased the mosque today we know there are hundreds and thousands of churches in different parts of the world in the western countries in uk in europe and america which have been purchased by the muslim organizations if you say that after you purchase you can't make it into the mosque that means the muslim living in the western country will have to give up all these mosques to the church if few centuries back emperor sultan muhammad purchases buys with his own money and that was one of the reasons so here we're not talking about conquest it is purchased we're not talking about war it's permitted after war you can convert it here he purchased it there are documents so the court in turkey said seeing at the documents if there was a case filed that what right does kamala turk have to convert into museum the highest authority in turkey it's a legal verdict said what is done by that is wrong now what is bothering usa or russia or greece how can the object how can they interfere in the personal affairs of turkey a muslim country and why are the other muslims supporting the non-muslims it is totally wrong as far as i am concerned whatever turkey did is correct it is permitted in islam it is mustaf alhamdulillah it was a mosque for several years it was purchased if i don't support them now i'll have to tell all the thousands of mosque in the european country and in usa and in canada which have been purchased from the church authorities even they have to give them up so please allah clearly says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 135 that yeah you allah or you believe stand out for justice as truth to allah even if you be against yourself against your parents against relative whether rich or poor allah protects both so please if a muslim has the guts to do something which is close to quran sunnah it's the duty as muslims that we should support him and we should encourage him hope to answer the question the second question from dr ahmadine pakistan is it permissible for a muslim state muslim government to build temple or church from government expenses a similar question asked by aamir waseem from islamabad pakistan we have a controversy here over the construction of hindu temple in islamabad with the taxpayers money by the government muslim clerics are posing it here can a temple be billed with muslim taxpayers money in an islamic state and this is another controversy that is this in the past couple of weeks regarding the government of pakistan funding in the construction of a hindu temple in islamabad and this controversy there for the last couple of weeks is it permissible or not it is unanimous amongst all the foreigners imam abu hanifah imam malik imam shafi imam that a muslim cannot donate his money for the construction of a house of worship of the non-muslim cannot donate cannot build cannot support several fatwas you see the fatwa from classical scholars from the medieval scholars that it is not permitted for a muslim to build a church or a temple or give donation to build a church or a temple or any place of worship of the non-muslims based on the verse of the quran of surah maidah chapter number five verse number two he says that you have to cooperate with one another in birari you have to help one another for righteousness and piety and this is the common verse which most of the muslims know but the verse continues and says that but you should do not cooperate you should not help one another in sin and transgression you cannot help anyone whether muslim or non-muslim in doing a sin and the biggest sin in islam is shirk is associating partners with allah so how can a muslim donate or support in building house of worship of the non-muslims regarding the question can a muslim government contribute a pay from the tax payers money and the answer is no if it's a muslim country and if it is according to the rules of the sharia of the quran and say hadith it is haram for any muslim or a muslim government to pay or donate to a house of worship of the non-muslim in fact when a fatwa was asked to imam abu hanifah and to the other imams that if a muslim bequeaths in his inheritance that let part of my wealth or one third of my wealth be donated to make a temple it is not permitted at all or a church even if you bequeath you write in your will that let one third of my wealth be donated to build a house of worship with a non-muslim it is haram it should not be followed even if a non-muslim living in a muslim country bequeaths that let my wealth be used for the building of a temple or a building of a church it should not be followed and this is unanimous amongst all the fukahas even you cannot use the non-muslims money to build a temple in a muslim land so where is the question of using muslim money or taxpayers money even if the non-muslim wills give a vasya as i mentioned earlier that if a muslim has a treaty with a non-muslim and the non-muslim agrees that he comes under the rulership of the muslim ruler and he signs the contract then he becomes a demi he becomes a non-muslim under the rule of a muslim law and then he pays ajasiya in that condition only the muslim ruler protects that house of worship whether it be a temple or a church but he cannot spend money even in innovation on it he cannot spend money even in expanding it and if a muslim ruler expands place of house of worship of non-muslim there is full right to destroy that part which is expanded even though he's in me there is no permission for him to build a new temple or a new church for the non-muslims only what exists he can protect it that's all so if pakistan calls itself to be a country which is following the quran as the constitution and if the muslim alamas and the shukes whether it be ban whether it be they have objected of course they're right i'm completely with them i'm completely with the scholars in objecting that how can pakistan spend the government money in making a temple the maximum they can do is whatever temple existed they can keep them that's it they cannot contribute and that's the reason you know there are muslim countries like saudi arabia where it's not permitted to build any house of worship of the non-muslim and this is islam you cannot if it's there existing there it is there okay in some muslim countries knows bella they are donating land for building temples some muslim countries they are funding tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars millions of dollars in building house of worship of non-muslim this is totally against islam against the teaching of quran and sunnah so what the muslim ulamas and the shooks in pakistan are doing objecting to the act done by the pakistan government i'm with them i completely support them and this should be stopped hope that answers the question we have on the facebook page ahmad atif nazir sarya muhammad arif khan sadiya rahman all this on the facebook and most of them are saying assalamu alaikum walaikum assalamu alaikum that it was for me and i do the words for you too we have on the youtube kaiser muhammad state race mustafa mahanov all of you the third question is from abdul jabbar from hyderabad india i completely agree with your reply given in the previous session that muslims must not migrate from muslim countries to non-muslim countries for a better living i also agree with most part of a reply regarding muslim living in non-muslim countries especially western countries should mostly migrate to a muslim country what are your views regarding muslims living in india since india was previously ruled by muslims and i would like to thank brother abdul-jabbar in this question he's referring to the reply i gave in my last session where a person asked that is it permissible for a muslim to migrate from muslim country to a non-muslim country for a better living and i will just repeat in short and i said it is not permissible for a muslim to migrate from a muslim country to a non-muslim country for a better living unless it is for education he can do for that couple of years of education and come back or if he wants to do dawah and he wants to become a full-time die going as a dai and giving dawa in a non-muslim country permissible but for no other reason for a better living or so that you can get more money or you can have a luxurious life besides these two reasons for a better living or anything else it is not permittable for muslims to leave a muslim country and go to a non-muslim country especially referring to the western country and then i went further to say that the verse of the quran that the angel comes to take the life of the person who has died in sin that how was your state and he said that we were weak and oppressed then the angel replies that the earth of allah subhanahu ta'ala is vast so why didn't you migrate and those who do not do that allah says they will go to hell and their refuge will be even so based on this there are three options for a muslim living in a non-muslim country and i gave the reply that muslim living non-muslim countries especially referring to the western countries that if they cannot live openly declaring themselves to be muslims or cannot practice some of the islamic aspects or they cannot practice most of it or some of it it becomes further for them to migrate to muslim land the second category those muslims living in a non-muslim country where they can freely practice islam and they have no problem at all and they can call themselves muslims they can do all their farah there's no restriction at all i don't know any such country there may be parts of some country but as a whole i don't know some countries may be better than the others but if such a situation is there then it is not compulsory for them to migrate to a muslim country it is mustahab that means they can stay but yet better is to migrate and the third condition is if the muslim is oppressed or they are weak or they cannot migrate then allah will forgive them this was my answer of three category but now the brothers pose the question what about india the muslims live in india because india was ruled by the muslims for more than a thousand years so does india also come in the same category as a muslim country and that's a very important question and jazakallah for asking this question there are some countries and one of the good example is india that india was ruled for a thousand years and the population of india approximately more than one third about 40 percent of them were muslims then the british has come and they come saying that their own business but they want to control india they started ruling india and then when they left they created a division among the indians who were living very peacefully even though the muslims ruled india for about a thousand years the mughal if the muslim rulers would have forced the non-muslim to accept islam there would not have been any non-muslims alive in india many accepted islam because they liked islam many people remained as non-muslims and there was no problem but the britishers they had a policy of divide and rule so when they left the divided india into three parts and they divided the muslims especially and one-third of the muslims went to pakistan one third in india one third went to bangladesh they didn't give one country they gave two countries and mongalization pakistan which was known best pakistanis pakistan they split so no muslims are divided into three in india little bit more than one third remained maybe about 37 38 39 percent remain in india one third went to pakistan about 33 percent less than one third went to bangladesh about 29 30 percent but if you add altogether muslims 40 now when partition took place india declared itself to be a secular country it didn't declare itself to be a hindu country and when the constitution was laid down it had a special rule it was a secular country and it said that any citizen of india following any religion that law of that religion will apply as far as several cases are concerned so if muslims are living in india they had a separate law and today also they have known as the muslim personal law the christian have their christian law the hindus they have the hindu law so when this was drafted it gave permission for all the religions to practice their religion freely all the citizens of india india was not at all a hindu country and even today it is not it is a secular country it is a democratic country and it said that any citizen of india whichever religion it belongs to can live here peacefully so based on that india is a unique case in the world a muslim ruled for a thousand years and today also according to me the majority of muslims in any country in the world number one is india though statistic advice it says number one is indonesia about 220 230 million muslims number two is india some about 200 million some people say that it is pakistan about 202 million and third is pakistan some say second is pakistan third is india and then fourth is bangladesh according to me the indian government doesn't declare the correct number of muslims they don't count many millions of muslims in assam et cetera i feel according to minimum muslims would be 250 to 300 million today so according to me the country which has maximum number of muslims living in any part of the world number one is india then in indonesia then is pakistan the number of muslims in india would be minimum 250 million can even go up to 300 million now when the partition took place the government that was formed into the constitution says that every citizen of india has the right to preach practice and propagate his religion and it is just about four years back that i left my country and for more than 20 years mashallah for about 25 years i did dave openly large audiences and india has been a very safe place for the muslims it is recently when the bjp government came to power just hardly six years back in 2014 that the problem started previously the problems were minor and the muslim could live peacefully there was no major problems at all the politician hindu politician many of the bjp which is a part of the rss these are fanatics and faces and they started promoting hindutva and trying to misguide the people and now there are problems made for the muslims but generally for the muslims living in india it is very close to living in a muslim country they have their full rights so muslims living in india it is perfectly permissible for them to live such close example is for example singapore singapore first was part of malaysia where two third of the citizens of malaysia they were muslims previously for everything later on the non-muslims came and then singapore became separate and today singapore has about 18 or 20 muslims so there also they have a muslim personal law for the muslims so singapore is also somewhere close to india but natural the freedom in india is much more than freedom in singapore so there are certain few more countries like that maybe mauritius or some which may have a muslim person in law so in such countries india is one of the best amongst these countries in this country where there's a muslim person in law where you can follow i don't know of any western country where a muslim can follow muslim person law only the criminal law is common in india in these countries but in the western countries certain things the muslims are permitted for example they are allowed to have all the worship but they cannot marry according to the islamic law they cannot have more than one wife the nikkei is not valid the divorce is not according to the islamic sharia inert is not according to islamic sharia you can will it that's a different case and neither can you openly practice your deen as you can do in india yes there are some non-muslim countries which are better than the other non-muslim countries so my answer was basically talking about non-muslim country mainly the western countries and the other non-muslim country so india will come close to a muslim country not fully like a muslim country it's not required for the muslims in india to migrate they can live and you have a lot of history of muslims and if you see the structure that i have created and the rich source of islamic knowledge is there in india so but nature jazakallah asking the question this is a different case altogether like in india and other few countries of the world hope that answers the question the fourth question is from sir please debate with david woods or say something to him as he says lot of rubbish things about you and other islamic scholars this person suhar gehma then few other muslim brothers have been continuously asking this question that oh why dr zakir naik not debating with david woodson and they keep on asking this question several times and i didn't think it was important but now finally i've taken the question to give them the reason first you have to understand that anyone that challenges the person it's not required that you should accept the challenge as far as you realize there are many non-muslims who are becoming famous just by trying to criticize a popular person generally it's a general rule whether muslim or non-muslim if he criticizes a popular personality or a celebrity that person becomes famous this is a common thing it's nothing new so because of that david woods one of the christians who has spoken against me and spoken against some of the other muslim scholars and tries to challenge them why i have not accepted such challenges the reason is that first of all we should not give publicity to such people that's the reason i didn't want to answer this question then i thought of answering the question without taking the name of david woods if you go to david wood's youtube you find that he has spoken against me and those videos that made against me get views more than a million or close to a million so we're giving him free publicity there was a time when i was involved in the dawah in my initial stages in the early 90s and the internet was new in the midline the internet were new and when i went to america in the mid 90s one of the first sites that was against muslims was answering islam and the person who used to run the site was joshin katz and that time we were new in the field of dawah and when anyone wrote against islam i stood out of the way and replied to them anyone wrote against me has to reply to them and then i realize the moment we reply to them we have another 10 counter questions so what we realized that my positive work is being stopped if really that question is a logical question or a question that deserves a reply should be replied but these frivolous arguments at that time when i was new i told josh and cats that okay do you want to debate with me you're writing against islam he said do you think i'm a fool to debate for dr zakir naik that was his reply so if you see in the initial stages of my dhawa in the late 90s in the early 2000s i had many debates and then i realized that debating is not the best it should be done when required but better is to talk about give lectures on similarities between sam and christianity similarity between islam and hinduism but when required yes and one of the best debaters in the world you know washington but then we realized that there were people who started challenging me and one such person was from usa again i'll tell you his name sam shamoon samsham and when i went to chicago i wanted to meet with you i said send your guru and then i had a debate with his guru dr william campbell and when i accepted this debate i was called by the students of usa that dr william campbell wrote a book quran and bible in the light of science and it took out about 30 scientific errors in the quran and for eight years no muslim replied so this book was doing a great damage for the tawa of the muslims and no one replied so i took up the challenge i read the book and i went and debated with and al hamdulillah in chicago there were two groups among the muslims one group was against the debate what is this no one replied and now the zakir who is this young man coming from india how will he reply so have the muslims against the debate and have the muslim word for alhamdulillah the debate took place in chicago and allah's help was there allah's mercy was there and for the very successful debate so much so that after that alhamdulillah william campbell who got a doctorate in writing a book against islam mashallah it lost its popularity later on then i made a policy that after my video started becoming popular then i had ruled i will only debate with those people who are popular then we realize that those people who are not popular started challenging to become popular and i'll give you a very good example you know sheikh ahmed he debated with jimmy sagat and jamie swaggart that time was one of the most popular televangelists he was multiple times more popular than sheikh hadid many people told him don't go he will chew you and spit you but alhamdulillah had the help of allah and he gave a knockout to jimmy's forget we have another example he debated with ani surosh and his suraj wasn't known at all but when ani suro debated with sheikh hamadi that ahmad did that alhamdulillah won him lost clock in battle but anis became popular so what we realized that when you debate with someone who's popular and an unpopular person debates with the popular person the unpopular person becomes famous overnight so why should we make the unpopular christian missionary that's popular so then i had a policy that anyone wants to debate with me should minimum have at least two percent of the audience that i have in my largest gathering and earlier i said that anyone who can gather 10 000 people individually for lecture i will debate him after that there was a middle person who requested him to debate with sri sri ravi shankar and you know srishirav shankar is one of the most famous hindu preachers in the world one of the most it comes in number one two and three and he has a large following he has addressed audiences of twenty thousand fifty thousand alumni i accepted the challenge and we had a debate in year 2006 in january in his hometown bangalore and allah's help was that a very successful debate the topic was concept of god in hinduism and islam in the light of sacred scriptures since 2006 there are many people who challenge me for a debate and when anyone challenges me i say that i don't waste my time there are hundreds of people who address large audiences they're very popular and my largest gathering that i've given a lecture is previously was in kerala then it was in christian ganji bihar where more than a million people had ended so two percent of a million is 20 000. so my criteria was i would not mind debating any non-muslim on any topic of comparative religion as long as he can gather minimum 20 000 people for his live lecture not a conference in conferences there are 20 30 speakers they might not have come for him particularly so if a person gives a solo lecture and if they can get audience of 20 000 people live not on the youtube not on the facebook 20 000 live sitting then i don't mind debating and what i'm asking is not something which is difficult there are hundreds of hindu preachers in india who have audiences more than 20 000 there are hundreds of christian missionaries who have audiences more than 20 000 so i tell if people like sam shamoon or people like david woods want to have a debate let them become popular why do they want to ride on my bandwagon and if you can't get that gathering only thing you have to do is convince with your material any other christian preacher there are many franklin graham is there billy graham is there morris cerullo is there there are many there are 100 speakers that i know in christianity who have given live lectures to more than 20 000 people what you have to do is catch one of them and convince them that your material against me is logical and give it to them i will have a debate with them why should i make you famous overnight i heard one or two of his videos that zakin like is a joke it is what he's talking is rubbish but the moment i reply to him he becomes famous that's the reason i was avoiding handling this question because now the moment i take the name of david woods most of the people hearing me tonight may not be aware of david woods a small percentage maybe they will go and check he will become famous and let me tell you there are many other people my students who can debate there was adai by the name of muhammad hijab and he came to meet me malaysia last year and he's a fan of man he's a good guy he personally had a debate with david woods i have not seen the video i was supposed to watch but some of my colleagues saw it and they told that brother muhammad hijab he gave david woods a knockout so when others can do the job why should i waste my time that's the reason previously we used to reply on the internet now we don't because the moment you reply they'll give a counter reply and your work of positive dawah suffers so that's the reason anyone who wants to debate me this criteria is there give it to a celebrity give it to a famous personality he will not be able to debate with me today if someone gives the million dollar to shishir vishankar he will never agree to a debate with me again he knows that even if you give two million dollars to him he will not because he's a celebrity he will lose his following and you already lost many many people in that debate who were his followers who called him god they accepted islam so that's the reason i require david to convince any of these hundred christian missionaries who are popular who can have audience of more than 25 convince them if we cannot convince them that he wants to have a debate with him when he cannot convince his own christian brother that the material office is enough to answer my lectures why is he wasting his time these people are only riding on the popularity of other people otherwise he is and i request the muslim brothers please don't waste your time please don't waste your time the person who asked me this question should have in fact known that brother muhammad hijab he had a debate with him and i already answered him so why should you make david wood popular so hope this answers the question and because i made this criteria that since 2006 in the last 14 years no one has ever wanted to debate me one of the fans of sad guru told the popular person is not as popular as she shiravishankar but is popular i don't okay i accept it i know he's popular okay if he wants to debate with me i'm not interested in debating he wants to debate he wants to speak against islam wants to challenge me i'll accept it because if he challenges me and if allah's help is there and we present the truth and answer to all his illogical arguments but naturally he will lose his following so if people like sad guru or someone who's popular want to challenge on any topic of islam and comparative religion which i deal with i accept the challenge hope that answers the question you have on the facebook mohammed khan talal saudi hashmi muhammad abdullah said so foreign allah bless all of you on the youtube you have gajinder book some comments from muhammad suman islamic superhero money lyrical love you antaya bordogan muhammad samoan you are the real hero of islam hassan vardul i am from india you are really amazing the next question is from abdul qadir khabib from nigeria the quran mentioned that it's allah who guides whom he wills and leads astray whom he wills if allah is the one who guides then how can he punish the ones who are led astray and that's a very good question asked by abdul qader what is referring to is the verse of the quran from sorry ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number four that it's allah who guides who he wishes and he leads astray who he wishes so based on the verse of the quran the question is posing then how can allah punish those people who have gone straight if allah the one who leads history before i give the answer i would like to give an example that if there is a teacher who is teaching the class and telling the students that this is the portion of the examination and the teachers the complete portion of a particular subject gives the textbook the rules and regulations and there's one student who's very intelligent who comes and asks the teacher questions that the teacher clarifies gives the student more time there's another student who bunks the classes who keeps on teasing the teacher in the classroom doesn't obey the teacher criticizes the teacher doesn't ask any question but now the teacher realizes that that student who's intelligent and asking questions and the teacher has guided him is bound to score good marks in the examination and the student who plays hooky and who criticizes the teacher doesn't listen to the teacher is bound to fail after a year the examination takes place and the teacher gives first class first to the first student and fails the student who was playing hooky who was not interested in studies who criticized the teacher can a third student say that the teacher is not just first student the teacher supported answered the question and passed him and gave him first class first the second student didn't help him and failed him it is illogical because the first student went out of his way to ask questions and clarify whatever we didn't understand the teacher answered which is even the second student could have done that the second student neither asked any question criticized went against the commandments of the teacher his bound to fail so how can you blame the teacher that why did the teacher fail him similarly allah says in the quran in surah chapter 67 verse number two it's allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good indeed so this life is the test for the hereafter allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has laid down the rules and regulation for human beings in the glorious quran the rules and regulation how a human being should follow the commandments of allah he has sent several revelations but the last and final revelation which is available in the authentic form in the original form is the glorious quran and for details you have to refer to the hadith of the beloved prophet muslim allah further says in the quran in surah and kabut chapter number 29 verse number 69 that all those who strive do jihad strive and struggle in the path of allah subhana wa allah will open up his pathways allah says in surah verse number 28 but allah will not guide those who do transgression and those who tell lies so allah is very clear because those who strive in the way of allah subhanahu wa with allah allah will open up his pathways and put them in jannah all those who do transgression and do sin and who lie allah will not guide them so those people who are misguided are not following the rules of allah given in the quran similarly the example of the teacher that the student who wants to learn more ask questions and strives to know more knowledge is the example of surah and kabut chapter 29 verse 69 that those who strive in the way of allah allah will open up the passage and put them in jannah so those people who are not obeying the commandment why should allah guide them so allah is right he will lead a strip some people who he wishes and he will guide some people who he wishes allah got arabid okay fine you look handsome i will guide you you don't look handsome i will not guide you no there are rules and regulations that if you follow the commandments of allah subhanahu wa i will guide you if you don't follow the commandments of allah if you do translation if you do sin if you do allah will not guide you so what is illogical so why are you blaming the teacher when she or he fails the student so you hear also allah subhanahu wa is not guiding him because he's doing sin and a person who does sin and strives and asks for forgiveness allah takes him out from darkness to light versus the quran allah takes a person from darkness tonight those who have the desire to follow the commandment of allah even if they sin if they ask for forgiveness allah forgive them allah will lead them to the straight part but those people who abuse allah who do shirk who don't follow his commandments surely he will lead them astray leading astray means they will go to jail so this is totally logical allah is the most just as allah says in the quran in surah chapter 4 number 40 allah is never unjust in the least degree hope that answers the question the next question from ansari from india my hindu friend considers both islam and hinduism to be true legions will he go to paradise the question posed by the brother was that my hindu friend considers islam and hinduism both to be true religions will you go to paradise allah subhanahu ta'ala is very clear-cut he clearly gives the message in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 19 in nadine islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah is islam is submitting over to allah allah says in the quran in surah imran chapter 3 verse number 85 that if anyone desires any other religion besides islam it will never be accepted of him and he will be amongst the losers in the akhirah so as far as religion allah subhanahu ta'ala sent only one religion for humankind during the passage of time when he sent a revelation he sent a messenger the revelation got corrupted people disobeyed the messenger allah sent a new revelation allah sent a new messenger again people deviated allah sent a new messenger there were 124 000 messengers sent on the face of the earth allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 13 verse number 38 in every age has he sent a revelation there are many revelations by name four are mentioned in the quran and the quran torah is the revelation that was given to moses peace be upon him zaboor is the revelation given to david peace be upon him angel is the wahi the revelation given to prophet jesus peace be upon him and quran is the last and final revelation given to prophet muhammad peace be upon him what we realize that religion is only one even though the scriptures have changed there are remnants of taheed and about coming up for muslim what i do i talk about the similarity between islam and hinduism islam and christianity when i talk about similarity doesn't mean that hinduism is totally right i am telling that if you believe the vedas to be the word of god i believe the quran to be the word of god let us agree to follow what is common so when we do a comparative study based on the verse of the quran of surah ibrahim chapter 3 verse number 64 he says which is the first term allah that worship none but allah here we come to know that all the religions the scriptures evidently talk about the oneness of allah monotheism talks about the coming of whom so i tell them that if you believe that the word of god why don't you believe in one god why don't you worship him alone why do you make idols of that god why don't you believe in the last and final messenger so telling you partly believe in some teachings of hinduism because it matches with islam no problem at all but you say i completely believe in hinduism i can give a longer lecture on differences between hinduism and islam but that's not my purpose so anyone who says i believe both in hinduism and islam completely it can't be possible he believes that allah is almighty god and he believes in the false teaching of christianity that jesus is god even if you believe allah is god and with it believe jesus christ peace be upon him with almighty god it is shirk you have to worship allah and allah alone the moment you worship with allah someone else like jesus christ or say with allah i believe rama is god i believe krishna is god it a shirt so you have to believe in allah alone and no one else and worship him alone and no one else so if someone says i believe in hinduism and islam can i go to general the answer is no you have to believe in islam only and believe those parts of hinduism which match with the quran and say hadith no problem but which is against quran and say hadith you cannot follow if you follow that you cannot go to paradise hope that answer the question next question from hilal ahmad from noida india can muslims go and visit the places of worship of non-muslims depends upon what is your purpose to visit the places of worship of the non-muslims if you are going to know what the religion says so that you can do more dawah to them it's perfectly permitted i have visited various places of worship i've gone to various temples many i've gone to various churches i've had discussion with the priests but the pundits my main purpose was dhawa if you go for sightseeing thinking it will benefit you in understanding islam better and knowing the wrong thing what the non-muslims are doing it is permitted but if you go to a house of worship of a non-muslim like many muslim politicians do in india and in other parts of the world that they want to show that they believe in other religions so if they go for the inauguration of a temple that's totally prohibited you cannot go to inauguration of a temple and many muslim policies go to show that okay we are secular it is haram you cannot endorse a place of worship of the non-muslim you cannot endorse a temple or a church so if you are going to show to the people that you believe that the other religion is also correct and you visit that place it is forbidden but if you are going to understand the religion better so that you can do dawah it's perfectly all right if you go for sightseeing as long as that sightseeing doesn't take you away from islam and your islam is strong and you understand the non-muslim religion so that you can to dhawa to them it is perfectly fine to visit the places of worship of the non-muslims next question from muhammad anas from south africa what should a non-muslim do if his or her parents do not allow him or her to accept islam assuming that the non-muslim is an adult and in different countries the law for taking decisions on your own but differ some countries it is 18 years some it is 16 some it is 19. if the non-muslim is adult and if we read the islam and accept islam and if the non-muslims parent or the non-muslim father or mother is disagreeing doesn't agree that his son or his daughter should accept islam what should he do allah is very clear-cut in the quran allah says in surah luqman chapter 31 verse number 14 we have enjoined on the human beings to be kind to their parents in travel upon travel the mother both them and years to win was the meaning that means it is compulsory for the muslims to respect their parents but the next verse luqman chapter 31 verse number 15 says but if your parents do jihad struggle and strive to make you worship somebody else besides allah then do not obey them but yet live with them with love and companionship allah repeats the message in surah chapter 29 was numbered they've enjoined on the human beings to be kind to their parents but if their parents strive and struggle to jihad and force you to worship somebody else besides allah of whom you have no knowledge they do not obey them so here allah goes out of the way to say that you have to respect your parents obey them but if they tell something against the teaching of the quran against the teaching of beloved prophet muslim you should not follow them so for non-muslims children they realize that islam is the true religion and if they want to accept islam and if that non-muslim parent is preventing the best thing the son of the daughter can do is explain to the father and the mother what is the true concept of islam what is the concept of tahit about the teaching and try and make them understand that islam is a logical religion it's the best way of life if they get convinced that they don't get convinced as a last resort you have to leave the house you can surely contact some of your muslim friends and leave the house so that you can practice islam freely you can leave the house and but not once you accept islam you have to pray five times you have to give zakah they have to fast so all these things would not be possible for you to live under the same group with your parents who objecting if they agree you can stay in the same house and continue if the object at the last resort you try level best to convince them so that even they accept islam or at least convince them that what you're doing is right so they follow their religion and you follow islam but if you cannot and if they give you the ultimatum even you have to leave you leave the house and follow islam outside the house inshallah allah says in the quran that the land of allah is spacious you will find many a refuge in sura nisa chapter number 400 so if you have to leave your house leave your land leave the country for sake of allah and the muslim allah will protect you the next question if islam is the best religion then why christians are more in number than us mirza vasiv from dhaka bangladesh without the question of islam is the best religion then why oppression by number point number one those who are in the maximum number those who are majority are not always right this is the wrong concept that those who are majority always right and that which is the line numbers i can give you several examples if you ask someone which is the best car available in the world some may say rolls royce some may say bentley but you know that the number of rolls-royce in the world are very few the number of bentley are very few the number of maybach are very few the largest company of car that is sold is toyota and toyota is not the best it may be it may not be for knowing what is the best you have to analyze the specifications if you want to know which is the best car you have to know what is average of the car what is the safety measures what is the look of the car what is it made of what is the pickup what is the horsepower all these things then you can decide not just who's using it maximum and even a person using a toyota will agree that roosevelt is better but he would not want to spend that much money he may not have the money or he may not want to spend the money he may have the money let me tell you i do agree with you people who fill the census form today in the world maximum aggression they are close to two and a half 2.75 billion and muslims are about more than two billion in the world so i do agree with you but the people who practice religion number one is islam out of the two billion people majority practices now at least the main pillars alhamdulillah maybe 75 percent may be closed but in christianity there is a small minute percentage maybe five percent ten percent who may be following the religion they may fill the form how many people go to church how many people attend the services in the church if you ask them most of the christians don't believe also jesus is god most of the people don't believe in the teachings of the bible but yet they fill the form and they say that christians because i have to mention religion so as far as following the religion is concerned today in the world the maximum religion that is followed is islam and the muslims surely more than a billion but those people who claim are christian then according to survey in the next maybe 50 years islam will also overtake christianity even in numbers in filling of census form so the number which is maximum is not the best the best is that which you have to see the criteria so if you compare the quran and if you compare the bible there is no doubt at all that if you compare it with the test of science or with logic or with reason surely quran will pass the test and the other scriptures of other religions will fail the test so if you see which religion is practiced most in the world it is islam and alhamdulillah islam is the best religion and allah clearly says al-imran chapter 3 verse number 19 in nadine in the islam the only reason acceptable in the sight of allah is islam next question from anush from kashmir india can a muslim girl become an ias officer in india with the intention of serving the ummah i would like to ask the sister that why does she want to become an ias officer in india to serve dhumma there are multiple things better that a woman can do why should a woman go out of the way to become an ias officer and will she be able to maintain the rules of the quran and sunnah so if you want to serve the ummah number one is you have to follow the rules and regulation of allah and israel the best act of a muslim of the muslim woman is to be a good mother there's nothing better than that the status that a muslim gets because she's the mother is phenomenal our beloved prophet muslim said that paradise lies beneath the feet of the mother and the child even if you give mountain of gold to the mother he cannot compensate what the mother has done by keeping that child in her womb for nine months the very hadith now how can you overlook all these hadith you want to become ias officer now do you think becoming an ias officer as a woman will you be able to maintain the hijab will you be able to maintain the rules and regulations that have been prescribed in the quran and say hadith and the answer is no and then is office so you have to work closely with the mail which is not permitted you will not be able to maintain the hijab your dress code will be different so but natural the best profession if you want to do a profession after being a mother if you want to do something for them number one is the profession of a diet allah says in the quran in surah facility chapter 41 verse number 33 who is better in spirit than one who invites to the way of thy lord walks righteousness and says that i'm a muslim the best profession for a muslim is a die so even for the muslima this is for the muslim male yes even for the muslim the best profession is the father and that's the reason that when i wanted to marry someone i want to marry adaya because the sabbath that a woman will get but naturally she is supposed to dhawa with a woman a woman doing dawa to a woman is far more serving the ummah and doing islam to the muslim who may not be knowing the teachings of islam so if you are doing the award to non-muslims the nomination woman and doing dawah to the muslim woman getting them closer to quran sunnah that's a million times better service than you becoming an as officer being an ass officer there are high chances that you may go away from the deen you may not be able to follow the rules and regulations so number one best profession after becoming a mother is becoming number two you can become a teacher you can teach an islamic school or islamic college treat them deen give them education number three you can become a counselor you can be a child counselor you can counsel the muslim the children get them closer to islam if you want to serve the ummah you can become a doctor you can become a gynecologist if you become a gynecologist you are preventing hijab being broken by a muslim sisters becoming a doctor it's a noble profession a gynecologist or become a pediatrician you can do speciality there are various other options why should you become an is officer first is officer is not a job to be done by a woman and that too by a muslim woman you will not be able to maintain your hijab will not be able to maintain all the principles so my advice is it is not at all permissible for a muslim to become an is officer in india you will not be serving dhuma you will be in fact going away from the deen and live aside dhumma you will be paving your pathway not to heaven but away from the heaven so inshallah i hope that you become a good mother become adayah or become a teacher or a giant counselor or a doctor hope that answers the question the next question is from friday kerala india can a muslim become an ias officer or an ips officer in a democratic country like india first question was from muslima a muslim sister this question is from a muslim male a similar question asked by shahil ahmad from kolkata india i recently completed my b tech in computer science and got job offers from many multinational companies but i haven't joined yet because i want to become an ias officer to serve my country but there are a few things that are discouraging me from becoming one number one the current political situation which increases hatred against muslims number two after meeting a few bureaucrats they say civil servants are bound to get corrupted because they can't overrule the orders of the corrupt political masters number three constitutionally politicians can harass you because they have power to transfer and remove any civil servant from important posts and give less important posts since i'm a practicing muslim what is advice both these questions are related the first question posed by the muslim brother that can you become an is officer or an ips office in a democratic country like india and the answer depending upon whether can you follow the dean after becoming an ass officer or ips officer if you can it is permissible if you cannot it's not permissible it will depend upon each individual and the question posed by the second brother that he wants to become an is officer but there are few queries and all these three queries are very important and need to be added separately the first thing he said is that seeing the hatred towards the muslims being increased in india will he be able to do the job of an ass officer and the answer is it will be difficult it's not impossible it's possible but difficult now when your colleagues start attacking you attacking islam or attacking the prophet attacking you as a muslim do you have the khmer to reply do you have the courage to reply to them is important if you're a timid person and you cannot reply and you're shy so my advice is that don't take such job if you think you can answer them you're good in replying you're bold you can take it then go ahead with it whether you become an ips officer whether you become an is officer and the second point pose was that because when you take this post there is bound to be that you may be tempted to do wrong things you may be tempted for bribery you will be tempted to do things which illegal around the country which haram activity of islam and i agree with the person totally that when you're in high position like an ips officer and it's common that if not all the majority of the ips officers not all but the majority for sure they are corrupted and if an honest officer goes there he either becomes corrupt or he has to leave the so job this situation you are the muslim bribing is haram how can you take bribe how can you become corrupt it's a challenge for you because the setup is such of this government whether it is officer or with an ips officer that if you don't agree with them they make life difficult for you and the third part is that the political bosses if you don't follow them they will transfer you yes they can transfer you so my advice to you is that if you are strong if you know that you have the correct not to involve in bribery you will not do corruption you will do justice you will follow the quran in sunnah and if the political bosses tell you something one thing you are sure that if you are honest they cannot remove you they can transfer you yes they put you to a place which is isolated but when they transfer you if there is no evidence of yours which is against the law what they will do they cannot demote you they can transfer you and when they transfer very often they may have to give you a higher position i know some officers muslim officers which were very honest because they were honest they kept on being transferred and because they were transferred they kept on getting raised very fast so at a young age they read the top position very fast alhamdulillah so it's a blessing in disguise so if you're such a person who's a muslim who's strong who can face the criticism of the non-muslim who can face the attack of the non-muslims against islam and we're going to be honest who will accept the challenge and say that i will not involve in bribery i will not do corruption i will give justice even if it goes against myself i will protect the muslims then go ahead with the job whether it's an ips officer whether it's an is officer it's going to be a challenge it's going to be difficult i know many muslims have taken this job and have deviated away from islam there are few that i know who have stuck to the straight path if you know that you are bold if you can take the challenge if you have that metal within you then go ahead alhamdulillah otherwise it is safer for you not to take up such a job time is short we'll just take one last question before we end the session from al hassan from ghana i work for a non-muslim company the company does not allow me to pray during working as should i work in such a company i mentioned my earlier session that praying salah five times is the first for every muslim there is no option irrespective wherever he works even is sick for a man he has to work if he cannot stand he has to sit and pray if he cannot sit he has to lie and pray even while doing jihad in the battlefield he has to pray one group prays the other keeps watch then the second group page and the first group keeps a watch there is no excuse unless you're unconscious that's the only condition or you are a minor it is accepted that you do not pray if you're an adult and if you're conscious whether you're sick it is compulsory to pray if you are working in a company which does not allow you to pray i request you go to the boss and tell okay please give me ten minutes break to pray normally there are two prayers that come when you work zohar and sir it's very common that zohar salah comes during the time of your lunch break so surely you don't have to take permission while lunch break when you're having a break for half an hour 45 minutes you have your lunch fast and then pray salah or pray salah and have your lunch fast so surely one of your salah absorb in any profession is easily solved and no one can prevent you from praying during your break regarding the other parasite time there are high chances that you'll be during your working hours there may be a tea break may not be a tea break if it is coinciding with the working house go to your boss and say that please give me ten minutes i want to pray go to a nearby mosque pray and come back if not in the mosque make a jamaat if there are a few muslims in that koto go to a small room pray together and tell the boss okay give me 10 minutes break i will work 20 minutes extra who would say no according to me most of them even the non-muslim will agree they may be if you will object if your boss or if your company objects say no you cannot offer salah there is no option you have to leave the job search for another job you may get a job with a better salary even if you get a job with a lesser salary don't worry it will benefit you in the dunya also if you are not allowed to pray in any activity whether it be a job or whether it be anyway sport or any other activity what you are doing praying fight time is the first you have to pray if you cannot pray in that particular job leave the job change your job where you can pray this was the last question and i would like to thank the viewers inshallah we'll meet again next time and as i said that in this season mashallah my son farik has joined me may allah give him allah give him the courage may allah give him the
