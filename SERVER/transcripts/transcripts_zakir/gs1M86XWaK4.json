  "transcript": "the next question is from ELISA Fatima she study MB B's from Pakistan when a corrupt leader is elected we are also responsible for the sins he commits as a leader what should be our priorities while electing a leader in today's circumstances when we cannot find a loyal and honest leader what should we do should we give a vote or waste our right to elect a similar question is posed by Majid Khan from Hyderabad India what are the qualities we should look for in today's age for selecting a leader for the Muslims according to me dr. Zakir Naik would be my best choice to lead the Muslim Ummah today basically the question posed here is that in today's world most of the Muslim leaders are dishonest they are corrupt so who should we choose or should we let our vote go in waste and the second question is that what are the qualities that a Muslim leader should have and the suggested that I should be the leader which will come to it later on which Allanson shala as far as what should the qualities of a Muslim leader be is the best exemplary Muslim leader in the world is a beloved prophet muscle son that is the reason my college heart he places him number one in the list of 100 most influential human beings in the history of humankind imagine he being a non-muslim places no masala of solemn as number one and he says that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was not only successful as the religious leader he was even successful as a social and a political leader because of that he placed him number one that he was not only a successful Regius leader he was also a successful social and quality leader so the best example of a political leader in the world today we have this Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him after that we have the example of the whole ferrocene as abu bakr umar others Muhammad Ali they are best examples for us after the Prophet and that is a reason Michael a chart he places oh ma al-kitab of allah and mel abuses him as number 51 because he was a very successful leader so if today I am unfortunately I don't know of any one slim leader who is anywhere close to the quality of leadership of rovno salah salem not even point zero zero one percent lemur says that not even close to her tomorrow day lon Mabini kitab mashallah he was he was so successful that he expanded the muslim empire mashallah and if you read his fira you will find the example how a Muslim Allah should be unfortunately unfortunately today none of the Muslim leaders we have about 56 to 57 countries in which majority of the people are Muslims in some country hundred-person some more than 95 some more than 90 some more than 50% there are about 57 countries in the world out of little bit more than 200 countries that me more than 27% of the countries in the world there are countries in which Muslims and majority unfortunately none of these leaders are anywhere close to Omar al khattab resulallah no weakness and if you read the cedar of firmly I believe him he told the family that if any of my family members break any of the rules they will get double punishment because the family of four caliphs should be following the rules much more than others if they break any rule there double punishment and you have several example unfortunately we find today that most of the Muslim leaders they're more as as the sister rightly as a question that most of them are corrupt most of them are dishonest they are involved more in making money for themselves unfortunately let let me give you an example of a summer of Dalaran that when you are the Khalifa he had two of his sons Abdullah and obey Allah may Allah be pleased with them both when they went to the governor of Basra when they're passing Basra and the governor called them and he was very happy to meet them he said what can I do for you then he said why don't you give this amana to amirul mumineen to your father then on October 11 but I give you permission that on your way you can utilize the money for business and when you get the principal amount back keep the profit and you can give the principal amount back kilometer a moment so both the sons of Omar Adela one they take the money and on the way they do business and they get a Jewish prophet and they go and give the principal amount to their father a middle nominee and they said this is what the governor of Basara said and this is the Amana so how's the Oman was angry and he asked his sons that did the government to give this money to somebody else they said no so how come they how come he had given it to you so Omar Adela one commanded to his sons that give the principal amount as well as the complete profit give everything to by thermal then the people who were close brothers mozilla won the other Sabhas they told that this is the business deal and the permission was given by the governor so what is the fault and if it's the business deal be allowed to do that so finally after a lot of discussion when they said that you know he should change his ruling then have a kumara there and said okay fine give 50% of the profit to the metal man so we see he was so strict and he made it a law that any was his governor before they appointed he checks their wealth and one they relieve the post he checks the wall again and he allows only a small percentage of increase anything more than that he said give it to my third man not that he accused them of corruption no he said that me even if you spend more time in the worldly affairs you're not fit to be a governor if you want to be a governor and the my rule you have to give your PR time to your duty even if you make money honestly that is not your purpose unfortunately we see today in the Muslim Ummah most of the Muslim leaders they are far away from the theme if we just take the basic concept of Salah I believe within 50% of the Muslim leaders they may not be over if I dream sala in congregation there may be a handful just a small percentage you may be offering five times another also in the congregation so unfortunately the state of the Muslim Ummah today we have gone far away from the Quran and Sunnah that very thing we have today that the situation that the Ummah is in today because we have gone far away from the Quran and the Sunnah we have gone far away from the teachings of allah subhanaw taala and the teaching of beloved prophet muscle assalam and i do agree with the sister that today unfortunately the choice that we have is so limited and unfortunately most of them would not fit the criteria of our Muslim leader should be as per the Quran and Sunnah so what should we do in this situation what we have to do if that we have to select the best of the worst and if we analyze as I mentioned that almost all the leaders they don't have the qualities that a true Muslim leader should have neither tomorrow the Lama or or even a small percentage not even 2% of the quality of others more than a 1 so what we have to do we have to select the best of the worst and I know agree with the sister that almost all of the Muslim politicians they are corrupt whether it be financially with Iman they are almost all there may be one or two or three exceptions to the rule so what should we do in this situation as I mentioned we should select the best of the worst number one according to me is that select that Muslim leader who is becoming a leader on the Islamic card that he's proud to be a Muslim and he says that I will I'm proud to be a Muslim and I will upheld the Islamic law when they they were not a secondary because in today's world the basic rule for a politician today unfortunately is that he has to maintain his chair by hook or by crook it may go against a set of rules it may go against his Deen it may go against a family as long as he is sitting on the chair in happy so he will do anything to maintain his chair because of this reason my first advice is that if two - Muslim leaders are standing select that Muslim leader who openly says that he thought to be a Muslim and he is coming on the Islamic card he may or may not be a practicing Muslim that a secondary I will go to the extent of saying that if there is one Muslim leader who's practicing Islam 20 percent but it's coming on the secular card he's not saying that I will protect the Muslims I will follow Islam and there's no custom leader who's following ten percent of Islam but it's coming with a schlomit card you're openly saying that I will I will protect the religion of Islam I will I will protect the Muslims better select the person who's following 10% Islam is coming with Islamic card rather than the other Muslim leaders falling 20% and is not coming on the Islamic art because the person who's not coming on the Islamic card will not go out of his way to follow the Islamic principles because that is not that was not his Tomcat to win the election whereas the other Muslim leader who may not be following Islam as much as the other person both are below average but at least because he's come with Islamic card he will see to it that he make more massages he may not Priscilla what you see today will make mo masajid mo musk he will protect the law of Islam he will help the Muslim because his trump card to win the election was the Islamic card this is a very key point unfortunately and we know either sister rightly said that majority almost all are corrupt so but if we have a corrupt leader who's coming with Islamic card is better than a corrupt leader who's coming without this lawmakers there are maybe one two or three if research in the Muslim Ummah who may be following majority of the Frye's in Islam but they may not be having the acumen to be a good leader we have on the other example some Muslim leader who have praised in my speech they may be bold they may stand for justice they will not be following Islam to the D there may not be offering five times Allah may be offering maybe a few times in a week but they may openly produce some because because that is the principle but they are not doing it for this lamb because they are doing because that they were they feel is right they are more for the cause of humanity but Islam is far above humanity so because of that they may bring a voice in the international media but the practice may not be selamat so such leaders may benefit in one particular aspect of Islam to the Muslim Ummah but on the other hand they may be a danger so that is a reason I personally prefer that you select those Muslim leaders who number one approach to be Muslims unfortunately when you look at the Muslim leaders most of them they are not following the Sunnah I'm doing a small example of keeping a beard it's not a big thing to keep a mere doesn t any effort but a beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said as mentioned say Buhari in 1 number 7 hadith number 5 8 9 to that the Prophet said they do the opposite of what the do what the unbelievers do growing a bit and tritium status according to all four schools of thought all the 4mm mass keeping a beer deferred it lets us more effort but yet unfortunately majority more than 70 vapor one of the Muslim leaders who are men they don't have a beard why let me we're not proud to be Muslims that doesn't mean if you keep up we're here fulfill all the requirements no please don't get me wrong in requirements you have to follow the 7 D major sin then fie how good the person is so what we have to realize my basic point here is that select those Muslim leaders who are proud to be Muslims even though they may be less in practice a person was proud to be a Muslim and a practicing Muslim it is the best who's practicing and keeping doing all the fries I don't think so if you search you may find one or two but they may not be good leaders but they may be following the fries so here seated that you like those who are coming position on my card and those who are proud to be Muslims and present themselves at Muslims I'm not shy when they meet the non-muslim leaders they are not shy to present themselves as Muslims coming to the to the second part of the question that these criterias the best is reading the Thira of the Prophet and see reformer of the Llewyn other Democritus man have a belly and you see the examples in their life how how honest and none of these leaders they wanted to become leaders that is of the for anyone who wants to be an Amir want to be a leader is not that person here we find that most of the leaders one do leaders in the Islamic teachings a person who himself wants to be a leader should not be media leader the other people who make him and all the Caliph us they were made by us and you have these examples as far as the question posed by the brother Majid that he feels that not a zakir naik is the best choice I am sorry I disagree with you totally I don't have the qualities to be a leader at all and I don't consider myself and what I've seen in my life and my personal life I've seen that many religious people when they enter into politics almost all of them went away from the theme I know several schools or very good practicing Muslims who offer refight m Salah who are very honest and they give friends beautiful lectures but the moment entered politics they got corrupt they were influenced because unfortunately the OMA that we have today they are not like the Sabbath at the time of the prophet of Allah ferocity machine first they would take decision thinking what would Allah want me to do there were no scab of disappointing Allah today our politicians are more interesting how will benefit them personally they don't they don't want to disappoint the World Bank the qualifier she Dean they did not want disappoint Allah they would take a decision which would be completely against them as long as we please allah as allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 135 that yeah you live in Amman oh you believe standard for justice as witness to a las manos Allah even if it against yourself against your parents against okay talking against the rich or poor Allah protects on there were many times the question was asked to me and in the other why I don't know into politics and I said that I mean why do you want to become enemy I'm gonna have to don't need ill him because in today's world if you enter politics there are high chances that you will spoil your health very high chances because the way the oh man the society is made that if you want to live and remain in that seat you will have to compromise on your principles and the best example I can give you is about a ceramic notice very much you know that masha'Allah he was a very great died and he gave the sphere of the Quran he was very knowledgeable he was popular and he stood for election anyone election after he won the election Member of Parliament he was made and he has given some polls and after human citizen he said asking me how what should be the width of the road that's not what I'm made for when I'm giving them Islamic solution they don't want to listen him in Italy design so good person with following the Dean he will either have to give up his D or give up his position and whatever dr. Solomon did was the best there may be few people like dr. Easter imma do maybe Islamic and may have got into politics but I don't know anyone who the leader may have come on a lower position not as the head of state and maybe following the Dean but the way the society is made today oh ma you will either have to give up the push that you iron or give up the Dean so first of all I am not fit to be in that position neither do I want to spoil my O'Hara I would I'm very happy in being a day and I am very satisfied with our last Muhammad Allah whatever name I have given"
