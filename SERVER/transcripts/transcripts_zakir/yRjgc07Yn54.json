  "transcript": "dr. Naik Sahib I hope you are doing well inshallah this is Moinuddin evening acerola from Ahmedabad Gujarat the state which has given Prime Minister of India I am a law student Zahra Waseem was a young Kashmiri actor in Bollywood launched through a blockbuster but soon she left the industry writing a long post on Islam yesterday when she posted the ayah about locust and the punishment of Allah and the right-winger stroll her badly after which she deactivated and deleted her Instagram and Twitter handles but she has recently again a couple of hours back come back on the Twitter at the sister in faith she should be supported as Co far are targeting her because she left her arm and started practicing Islam and she should be supported now and the Twitter post is given weight mentioned Zahra Waseem on a Twitter so we went upon them the flood and the locusts and lies and frogs and blood sign was openly self explained but they were steeped in arrogance of people given to sin a similar question is posed by Mohammed arsal arsalan Calcutta India recently we witnessed a cyclone and there was a massive flood and destruction there and also there was a locust attack in East Side of India I want to ask whether we can compare this calamity with ayah 133 from surah al-araf regarding the pharaoh and his people and the verse of surah Araf chapter 7 verse 33 faith so we sent on them the flood the locust the lice the frogs and the blood are the succession of manifest signs yet they remained arrogant and they were of those people who were who are mujrimun regarding the first part of the question there's a sister by the name of Zeta Waseem who according to the questioner she became very famous on the Bollywood and and and she was the bollywood actress and last year she left acting because she realized that acting is not according to the Islamic principles and for that alhamdulillah I personally really congratulate her and I support her for taking the decision for leaving the Bollywood because according to me most of the part of the Bollywood is not appropriate for a practicing Muslim and it really takes a lot of courage and sacrifice for a person who's famous in the Bollywood to quit Bollywood so I really and I really appreciate her a tanker and a patrol Osman o Allah that me he guide her and give her more hidaya inshallah and may he reward a multiple times and as I mentioned that a beloved port masala Salim said that anyone who leaves a sin and comes to the straight path allah rewards him and the bigger the sin that a person leaves the bigger of the reward and for a person who was famous in the Bollywood and I received many awards it is really difficult and requires courage and guts which he has done so insha'Allah Allah will reward her multiple times more than the film that she was doing and I am not too much aware of all of the actors and actresses and even my family doesn't watch the move bollywood movies but last year I remember that my daughters they told me about about the sisters era of seeing and how she quit quit Bollywood and she mentioned a very long lengthy post on the Twitter and they forward it to me and my daughter that my family they are not they are not aware of off of the Bollywood actors and actresses but this particular muslimah they forwarded the message to me and I read it and a hamdulillah I really pray to Allah so Allah that me me he reward her and according to the question she had posted an ayah of surah Araf chapter 7 was from 133 on her Twitter account and she did not mention anything and this is common that the media which is which is right-wing media are mainly supports this present in just government the BJP and RSS what they do they take a quote and they add own information and they try and malign and what they did is that in the media reports they took this verse of the Quran here quoted and they infinite it that she is talking about India if you read her Twitter account the word India has not mentioned it's only quoting a verse of the Quran and they went on to allege that she is saying that Allah has brought the punishment into India by sending the locust now this is the interpretation and this is common if you read the news you come to know that this locust is there it's prevalent it has recently started mainly in the African countries in the east part of Africa it's also permanent parts of Pakistan also in parts of India so when she did not mention any country she did not mention any place these people go out of the way to put their own information and malign her and this is exactly what did it to me when about three and a half years back on the 3rd of July 2016 when that tariff era when a terrorist attack took place in Dhaka and about six or seven terrorists they killed about owing to foreigners in Dhaka and one person Rohan he had to be he happened to be a fan of mind on the Facebook but they give the report saying that he was inspired by dr. Zakir Naik to do the terrorist attack he was just a fan of my and alhamdulillah today I have got 22 5 million followers on my Facebook and my responsible for the activity but the way they gave the report as though he was inspired to do the terrorist like because of me for that they have to show a post of mine which say that you should kill innocent human beings which they cannot so what they do they take a post they add their own misinformation to it and malign the person and this is exactly what they did to Zahra of a shame and i pray to allah subhanaw taala that may he reward her this post is very much relevant and me he encouraged her and i am telling that she should continue to study the Quran she should continue mentioning verses of the Quran on the Twitter and the social media and she should not be bothered about these people who are a problem to the society these people are there to create a fitna and a beloved if you read the Quran Allah says in the Quran in surah 4 kind chapter 24 verse number 30 that for every prophet he has kept enemy and after the Prophet it is the dies who continue spreading the message of Islam and for for a die who's successful they are bound to be enemies so we should not be discouraged or disheartened when the enemy attacked her when enemies attack us and you be reassured that if you speak the truth the enemies of Islam have to attacked you have to attack you and if you are successful the more successful you are the more larger number of enemies will you have and the more bigger enemies will you have and the most successful human being and the most influential human being on the face of the earth was a beloved prophet masala Salam and unfortunately he also has the maximum number of enemies in the world the maximum were people who are take him if the maximum number a person is attacked in the world today is partial masala Salam so we should not be certain in fact we should be reassured that we on the straight path and if you realize regarding the voice of the Quran of surah Araf chapter number 7 verse than 133 it faith that Allah subhana allah the word used here is to fan in arabic it's translated as flood in some of the translation to fun actually means it means a total debt it can be due to a flood it can be due to an earthquake it can be true and it can be due to an epidemic it can be due to a pandemic so basically to fun means total death a large number of that caused by any calamity whether it be flood whether it be earthquake whether it be epidemic may be Panda me so here it can mean flooded can't even even with the carbon 19 it say the last Muhammad Allah sent to fan maybe a flood maybe an epidemic a pandemic or maybe covered nineteen coronavirus or an offend locusts and lice and frogs and blood and they the list of raw to which Allah sent on the people of Pharaoh and the next words you read it says it was a warning to to Pharaoh and his people and they prayed to Moses peace be upon him that let this calamity ask your God your Lord to remove this calamity and when this calamity was removed they did not come to the straight path when they promised that they will release the children of Israel the Jews they did not do that and Allah sent and in the calamity and again the promise that please remove it and this is the statement either the words in the Quran talking about firaon and how Allah brought his wrath upon the people of Iran so this was of course in 11 today there are calamity is taking place today and any calamity that befall on a particular area it can be limited to one area it can be to many areas in that area they may be good people and bad people so any calamity that comes if it comes on the people who have sinned then this is a punishment from Allah subhanAllah and if it comes on the people on the straight path it's a test on them so it is wrong to thing that in a calamity hundred percent of the people are sinners and we know that when the plague came during the time of the sahabas and at at that time 25,000 sahabas died in the plane and i beloved for mosul assalam said when the plague comes I just mentioned a sigh hadith when the plague comes it comes as a punishment to the unbelievers but for the believers it's a blessing what we have to realized here that if the people on whom the calamity comes if they on the straight path it's attached eyelash testing them that yet do they have faith in allah subhanaw taala yet do they worship allah subhanaw taala or not and was to increase the reward on those people who were sinners into the punishment so but naturally this ayah is very up-to-date especially when coronavirus is prevalent in almost all parts of the world more than 90% of the countries in the world more than 185 countries in the world infected with corner virus that is covered 19 it's become a pandemic so this was is very 11 nowadays and after coronavirus we realized that even the locusts came mainly in the countries of africa even in parts of Pakistan in parts of India so what is wrong in this was these people who are adding their own information and maligning the Muslims this is their job to create fitna we should not be disheartened we should continue most strongly and what I believe there should be an organization a Muslim organization which should be well-versed with the social media and any time when the enemy of Islam they start spreading misconception about Islam or trolling a Muslim because of the popularity the reason they are against the era our theme is only because she left Bollywood she she went from darkness to light she left the industry which is not appropriate for practice Muslim the church because of that they pooling her and they are going against her they should be an organization a Muslim organization we should be special social media and see to it that they counter these misconception all Islam they counter such people who are trolling the Muslims on the straight path so hope this in short gives about the worse of the droids Quran and furthermore if you read in surah qamar' chapter number 54 verse number 7 it speaks about the Day of Resurrection on the day of comma you will find human means coming out like locusts the same word locust is used your why today science tells us that locust it emerges from the ground and they gathered together and they can in one square kilometer the number can be 40 to 80 million they gather very fast and they can move in forms covering 120 square kilometer imagine 120 square kilometer each square kilometer they are approximately 40 to 80 million so in 1200 square kilometer if they can move together that's equal to 48 billion two hundred billion locusts so this is giving an example that on the day of resurrection all the human beings will come from the earth together all right from Adam peace be upon him till the last day of judgment till the last day all will gather together in billions in tens of billions so this is an example that Allah gives off locust giving an example this would be at the time of the day of judgment how will we again emerge image from the dead so this is reminding of a sawara the signs of Ashura so all the signs that Allah gives us makes a believer from soldier to allah subhanaw taala and has more faith in the quran and we pray to allah so allah that may he give Zehra of a theme more courage and more Hidayah to study the Quran to study Islam and may she be able to take her former colleagues out of this industry to the straight path of Islam"
