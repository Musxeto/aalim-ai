  "transcript": "And a beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it's hadith in Sai Muslim had number 1631 the prophet said that when a person dies after he dies only three things continue when he comes back only three things continue as saw number one is the wealth that you have spent in the way of Allah subhana wa t'ala number Two is the beneficial knowledge. The knowledge which is beneficial for humanity and number three your pious children praying for you. So if you want saw jar from your children if your children are not pious and if they pray for you no benefit for you. So if you want your children to be sabara for you, first you have to make them pious and then they should pray for you. So it is the duty of every Muslim to see to it that they give their children the right knowledge the right education for both the worlds this world and the our beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it's hadith of Bkari had number 893 the prophet said every man is the shepherd. The imam is the shepherd of the congregation. The father is the shepherd of the family. The mother is the shepherd of the children. That means each one is responsible for his flock. And we have several examples. We have several examples how the parents how the mother saw to it that they gave the right education for the children. We have the example of the mother of Allah Akbal. Allah Mbal, he was a great scholar and a poet and one of the pillars in the foundation of the formation of Pakistan. And if you hear his poetry, the way he explained the Quran and the hadith is par excellence. his mother when the child is born because a small portion of the earning of her husband was haram. She did not want to breastfeed the child. She said because I'm meeting on haram of my husband, I will not breastfeed the child. In Islam, it's permitted. But she wants to take extra care. She does not want any haram to go into the body of the child. So what she does? She sells the jewelry which is a halal earning and she buys a goat and the milk of the goat is fed to the child. And then you have Allahbal the person who created a revolution. You have the example of the mother of Shik Abdul Kadalani. You know Abdul Rajlani was a excellent person on mashallah. His mother tells him that son never in your life should you lie. Even if you go in loss even if your life goes you should not lie. So once when he's going on a travel being a young lad the mother puts some gold coins into the hemming of the cloth so that you know he does not lose it and hiding it in the hemming stitches it in the cloth so no one will know that he's carrying gold coins. when he's traveling, there are some bandits who catch him and they search him and they don't find any money. So they ask him, \"Don't you have any money?\" He says, \"Yes, I have money. Where is it?\" So he shows it's stitched in the clothes. So the bandits ask him, \"Why did you tell us? We searched it. We did not find it. If you wouldn't have told us, you would have gone away. Nothing would have done. Why did you tell us? So he tells and replies, \"My mother told me, I should never lie. Even if I go in loss, I should never lie.\" So the bandits were so impressed that they gave up robbing and stealing."
