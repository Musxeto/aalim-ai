  "transcript": "next question sir I am a student of BC final year I am from Andra Pradesh India I am from a Hindu family alhamdulillah I recently reverted into a Muslim my question is how one can know whether his Iman is strong or weak and what steps should be taken in improving my Iman and if one who listen about the punishment of Hellfire and not feeling afraid of it but worries about other things what is the strength of his Iman the question poses that how will a person this question POS by re and he's asking that how will a person come to know whether his IM is strong or weak and what steps should be taken to improve the Iman and the last part is that if a person hears and knows about the punishment Hellfire and yet he's not worried about that and worried about the worldly things then what is his status regarding the first part of the question that how does one come to know that his Iman is strong a person when he keeps on following the teachings of Quran and say had the more he follows he realizes that man is strong for example when he goes out a Muslim knows that she with the hijab the outside world may not be doing hijab she's doing hijab you know that the IM is strong that we know that people do wrong things they cheat you're not cheating people tell lies you don't lie you're honest and the more you follow the Quran and say you come to know IM is strong how do you increase your Iman one of the best way to increase your Iman is to read the translation of the the Quran read the translation of the Hadith of the Beloved Prophet wasallam read the the of the Prophet Muhammad wasallam read the of the rash of the sahabas when you look at the lifestyle you are empowered you realize that how strong they were in Iman and how weak we are in Iman so if you read the stories of the sahabas your IM increases i' like to give you one incidence that once you the person who comes and tells the prophet that the neighbor that is there is not allowing to build the boundary wall of the house because the trees in between so the prophet tells the neighbor that if you give that one tree and allow him to build his boundary wall I will give you a tree in Jenna and refuses he doesn't agree so when one of the sahaba Abu D he hear about this he goes and ask the prophet that if I get that tree and see to it give it to him will I get a tree in Jenna the prophet said yes why not so he goes and tells that neighbor that do you know who I am he said no he says I am Abu who owns the biggest and the most precious Garden of of dates in Madina of course who does not know you then he says that will you give me this tree which is coming in between your neighbor boundry wall and for that in exchange of that tree I will give you my complete Garden of dates which is the best in Madina the man says are you crazy for my one tree you'll give me the full Garden which is the best in Madina he says yes and the person agrees Abu d comes back home and tells his wife that today I have done a great deal an excellent deal the wife asks what did you do so he narrates the story about the tree and he tells his wife that I bought that tree that will give us the tree in Jenna in exchange for the full Garden that we have in Madina so the wife says Ah what excellent deal in today's world if suppose you have such a big garden and you want to buy the tree today's wife will tell you you're a fool why did you give the full Garden you would have given 25% of the Garden or you should have given 50% of the garden and surely that man would have agreed even if you give 25% of the garden you given that one tree but look at the Iman the wife says Ah what a deal that means both of them the husband and wife they didn't want even out of doubt that the person will refuse because they wanted Jenna and and Hadi tells us that for the rest of their life they lived a poor life but they lived a very happy life because they know that the prophet had promised them Paradise so if you hear the stories of the saas how they lived how they sacrificed how they helped each other your IM increases and it gives us a feeling that what we are doing is nothing nothing and we know that at the time of jihad when the prophet told the sahah that what you want to contribute and Omar Allah be pleased with him comes and he give the large wealth to the prophet and the prophet asks him that what have you left home so he say I've left half my wealth at home and half I'm giving charity for Jihad after that later on Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him he comes and he gives his wealth to the prophet and the prophet asks him what have you left home so he said I have given all my wealth and I've left Allah and hiso at home to take care of us imagine what Iman imagine giving his complete wealth in the way of Allah subhana tala when you hear these stories it it increases our IM it makes us feel so small that we can't even contribute to the cause of Allah subhana tala we can't even give charity if you read the lifestyle the of the sah of of the prophets we are no way so if you read the stories your IM increases if you read the Quran the translation of IM increases and you come closer to Allah subhana wa T ta'ala your I increases your Salah increases your s increases your fasting your charity your zakat all these things is these are signs and when do you realize that IM is in you have peace of mind wealth cannot buy peace of mind when you have peace of mind that mallah inshallah we are following Allah and his and inshallah we will be raised in jna with Allah and his rasool you know as the prophet said that you will be raised with the people who you love so that time the sahabas were so happy they said we may not be good indeed they were the best after theas the people who are the most blessed and the closest to Allah subhana tala among the number one among the with him he's number one then if you hear these stories and the lifestyle of the prophet and the sahabas you'll realize that we are living in an air condition we have all the all the facility and yet we crib yet we don't follow the Sunnah yet we don't follow the thing that we're supposed to do and if you read how did the the Anar the people of Madina the saas of Madina helped the saas the the muhaj who migrated from Makkah to Madina and the stories it's phenomenal so the more you read the S and of the prophet of the sahabas your Iman will increase your practice will increase and inshallah your peace of mind will increase so that you're more secured that Allah will give you the best in this world as well as hope the question regarding the last part of the question that what if you hear the punishment in the Hellfire and yet you're bothered about the worldly things what is the state of Fe even after hearing about the punishments of the Hellfire if you do not follow the Quran and theth and yet if you continue worrying about the worldly things that means your IM is weak that IM is weak I told you how IM is strong but if you hear if the two things that makes your Iman strong is when you you hear about the punishment you fear it so that's the reason when you fear the punishment of the of the yearafter of the Hellfire the present life for you the difficulties are nothing they're peanuts so if after hearing the punishments of the Hellfire or after hearing the rewards of Jenna yet you continue and disobey the teachs of Quran and Sunnah that your IM is very weak so that's the reason you should be in touch with the Quran and say Hadith and these things will get you closer to Allah and his hope to answer the question"
