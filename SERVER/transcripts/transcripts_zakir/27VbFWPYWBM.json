  "transcript": "in terms of a person who has a debt and wants to pay the debt back can they apply for zakat to pay that debt i fire the person who's a debtor as mentioned in the quran the sixth category is those who are undead so those who are in debt they can surely ask for zakat money they can apply they can ask for zakat money because normally a person may not be aware that a person is in debt so he can ask he can even beg and there's a hadith in say muslim number three hadith number 3777 where a person comes and begs to the prophet a lot of loss that is taking place he buys some fruits and there's a loss in his business and he's in great debt so he goes to the prophet and begs him to help him so the prophet says that give him out of charity give him sakat money but even after money was given it wasn't sufficient to pay his debt back so the person who he owed the debt to the prophet says take what you get and write off the rest of the debt and there's a hadith which is mentioned in say muslim volume number two in the book of zakat hadith number 2271 where a person who is in debt he comes to the prophet and he begs the prophet for help the prophet says wait till we get the sadka and insha allah will give the sat command the prophet tells them that it's not permitted for a person to beg unless he falls in three categories number one is unless he's in debt he can keep on begging till he has given back his debt category 2 is a person who has been struck by a calamity and doesn't have the basic requirements of sustainance so you can beg till he gets his sustenance the third is a person who has been smitten by poverty and he is very poor and he comes in the category then also he can beg till the time he gets his basic necessity so for a person who's in debt according to islamic sharia he can apply he can ask and he can receive this account"
