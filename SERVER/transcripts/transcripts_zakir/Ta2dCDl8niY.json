  "title": "Explaining Concept of Jihaad in Islam in a Non Muslim Society - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "i'll just tell you how to reply to the top of the charts that is jihad as far as this word jihad is concerned there is not only a misconception among the non-muslims there is even a misconception among the muslims most of the people think that any war fought by any muslim for any reason whether it be personal gain whether it be for power whether it be for money it is called as jihad jihad does not mean any war fought by any muslim for any reason whether it be first personal gain for personal money for power jihad comes from the arabic word jahada which means to strive which means to struggle in islamic context it means to strive and struggle against one's own evil inclination jihad also means to strive and struggle to make the society better jihad also means to strive and struggle in the battlefield in self-defense jihad also means to strive and struggle against operation so jihad basically means to strive and struggle many non-muslims men is orientalists they translate the arabic word jihad as holy war and unfortunately many so-called muslim scholars and inverted commas even they translate jihad the holy war in arabic if you translate holy one to arabic it would be harbor mukha and if you read the quran nowhere is the word mukaddasa mentioned in the quran neither it is mentioned in the hadith so jihad does not mean holy war holy verb was first used to describe the crusades with the christians they killed tens and thousands of human beings in the name of religion that holy war was used to describe the crusade unfortunately today it is used to describe jihad which is totally a mistranslation basically means to strive and means to struggle one type of jihad can be kitaal that is fighting which is kital sri sabillah fighting in the way of allah but that too has got various rules and regulations which you can refer to my video cassette jihad and terrorism and islamic perspective which i have dealt in detail about this and i'll just give an example how to do dhawa last year i had gone to states last year before last i had gone to states in los angeles and traveling alhamdulillah martial different parts of the world in various countries including the western countries several times usa canada australia and other parts i was prepared the way i'm dressed up with the cap with the beard with the coat i was sure that in the u.s custom they'll be asked for interrogation so as i went to the immigration they asked me the question then why have you come here i said that i've come to receive an award ask me what a word i said award in service of humanity because what do you do i said i spread truth jesus christ peace be upon to the truth and through shall free you and after asking many questions i see to it that i pick up every appointment to da'wah while going to the customs i purposely mentioned that i've come for a convention like i came this time and i've come to receive an award so that's okay go and open your bag when they opened my bag they saw a tape of mine a video tape that time videotape by taking java then terrorism so the custom officer you asked me that do you believe in jazz i said yes i believe in jihad jaz means to strive and struggle jesus christ peace be upon believe ninja he said no no i'm talking about do you believe in fighting i said yes even jesus christ peace be upon believed in fighting if you read the bible in the old testament book of exodus chapter number 22 he speaks about fighting book of exodus chapter number three speaks about fighting book of numbers chapter number 31 speaks about fighting jesus christ peace be upon mention the gospel of luke chapter number 22 he said that take the sword and go and fight so they said but that was fighting against evil i said yes that's what the quran says to we have to fight against the evil and in this way when i started doing dawah the customers all gathered together and there was a small mini lecture i only told my host that don't worry i'm just doing dhawa in the immigration and the customs and sir can we ask you one more question sir can we ask one more question and look at the story shot you should grab every opportunity and you should try and turn the tables over give the answer which he expects the least but i don't want everyone to do that otherwise they may get into problems as far as dealing on the higher level where to turn the table is over you have to be careful otherwise we get a problem then you say okay dr zakin i told me that depending upon the situation you can prove from the bible that what they attack about the quran the same thing is mentioned in the bible when i'm in india i use a different strategy the master key is the same but i speak about bhagavad-gita i speak about mahabharata when the hindus say that the quran is wrong it speaks about fighting i tell them that there are more verses of fighting in mahabharata than the quran but then they tell me no but this is a war between truth and falsehood i said same is what the quran says it is a war between the truth and falsehood then the hindus tell me we have got no problem with the quran and if you read bhagavad-gita which is the most popular scripture of the hindus in chapter number 1 verse number 40-46 arjun there's a fight between the cousins the pandavas and the cowards part of the five brothers kauravas ah total hundred brothers so arjun one of the pandas in the battlefield he puts his weapons on the battlefield on the ground and he says to shri krishna who is god of the hindus he tells to shri krishna i would prefer being killed unarmed rather than to fight against my cousin immediately next few words step number two verse number two and three shri christian who's supposed to be the god he tells arjuna how could such impurities come in your heart how could you be so important he calls him important and further bhagavad-gita chapter 2 verse number 31 onwards he says it is the duty of the shattrath to fight if you don't fight you will not go to the heavenly planet will take you away from the heavenly planet and blessed are those satrias who get an opportunity to fight and most of the critics of islam they point out a common hadith of allah in the book of jihad hadith 46 where prophet muhammad said that if a mujahid goes to the battlefield if he's killed he will get jannah he'll go to heaven if he comes back alive he will get the booty of this world he'll get the wealth of this world and many critics where the christian hindus they point the hadith and say what kind of religion is this is talking about jihad fighting and you go to heaven what kind of religion is this i tell the hindus that if read bhagavad-gita chapter number two verse number 37 shri krishna tells arjuna that oh arjuna rise and fight if you are killed you will go to swark heavenly planets if you come back alive you would get the wealth of this world it is the verbatim translation of say bukhari volume 4 hadith 46. so when these critics of islam especially the hindus like arun shuri i wonder that they haven't read their own scriptures and appointing called in the quran the moment you give the context and speak to them the complete misconception is washed away come to common terms as we assign you"
