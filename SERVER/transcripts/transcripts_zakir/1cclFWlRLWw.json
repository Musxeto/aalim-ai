  "title": "What does it take to be a True Muslim? If Muslims Pray 5 Times a Day then why do the Christians...",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum uh my name is leon john and firstly i'd like to thank my friend nurullah for bringing me here and giving me this opportunity to hear some wonderful teachings from you now i've got two questions to ask first is what does it take to be a true muslim and the second question is muslims pray five times a day why don't we catholics and other religions pray five times a day is there any explanation for this brother i have two questions first is that what does it take to be a muslim what is the requirement and second is why do muslims pray five times catholics pay less what's the reason as far as what does it take to be a muslim as i mentioned earlier muslim means a person who submits evil to god so if you submit your will to god and follow the commandments of god you're a muslim the number one thing is that you bear witness that there's no god but allah no god but one true almighty god and you bear witness that prophet muhammed is the servant and the messenger of this god this is the basic faith it is a fundamental creed known as jahada so once you say this you enter into the basic fundamental creed and to be a good muslim you should submit your will to almighty god so if you follow the commandments given almighty god in the quran and the teachings of the prophet muhammad peace be upon him authentic hadith then you'll be a good practicing muslim as far as the second question is concerned why do muslims pray five times and we christians we pray less the reason is we muslims salah is a sort of programming towards righteousness see normally people they say pray pray is not the right translation of salah pray means to ask for help in oxford dictionary pray means beseech in salah we don't merely ask for help besides asking for help we are getting guidance from allah another religion is only asked for help in islam besides asking for help we are getting guidance from allah for example if the imam after surah fatiha he recites the verse of the quran also maida chapter number 5 verse number 19. oh you believe most certainly in toxins and gambling dedication of stone divination of arrows rich submin shaitaan these are satan's anniversary first fluent abstain from this handbag that you may prosper here we are getting guidance from allah in our salah that don't have intoxicants don't gamble don't do fortune telling don't do idle worship these are certain handiwork abstain from it that you may prosper so besides asking for help besides asking we are getting guidance from allah and we are thanking allah so i prefer calling salah as programming towards righteousness and if we analyze today the amount of evil we see around us you know bad things happening evil thing obscenity cheating there are high chances that we can get deprogrammed how a doctor tells you for a healthy body three meals a day so our creator almighty god knows that we have to be programmed five times a day so that we will be on the straight track so he's our creator he knows that so if you are a true christian even you should offer five times you know why because if you read your scriptures the book of acts like how we do ablution so remind the chapter five verse number five that you have to wash your hands wash your face rub the head with water and wash the feet up to angle similarly is mentioned in the book of acts similar in the book of exodus that aaron and moses they washed their face and hands before they appear in front of the lord same thing the basic part of siddha the sujood if you're genesis chapter number 17 verse number 3 it says that abraham fell on his face and prayed to god in numbers chapter number 20 verse number six aaron and moses they fell on their face and prayed to god joshua chapter number five verse number 14 joshua fell on his face and prayed to god he read the gospel of matthew chapter number 26 that jesus christ peace be upon him in the garden of gethsemane he took a few steps forward and fell on his face and prayed to god can an acrobat fall on his face and pray to god better than the way we muslims do when you do sujud we put the highest power of the body the forehead on the lowest part of the ground and say glory be to allah the most high glory be to allah the most high thrice so all the prophets of the bible they prayed the same way as muslims pray and jesus christ peace be upon him said in the gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 i have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak he shall glorify me now jesus christ peace be upon him said that wait for the spirit of truth talking about muhammad's peace be upon him and there are various references of prophet muhammad peace be upon him in the old testament as well as the new testament if you read the new testament in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 in the book of deuteronomy chapter 18 verse number 19 in the book of isaiah chapter 29 and verse number 12. in the song of solomon chapter number five verse number 16. all of these references speak about the coming of the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him even in the new testament gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 16 gospel of john chapter number 15 verse number 26 gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 7 gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 all of these references speak about the last and final messenger prophet muhammad's peace be upon him so if you're a true christian if christian means a person who follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him we muslims are more christian than the christian themselves if you're a true christian you have to follow the teachings of prophet muhammad peace be upon him and do ablution before salah you should do sujud and you should pray five times a day hope that answers the question thank you i appreciate that [Applause] you"
