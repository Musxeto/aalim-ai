  "transcript": "ismail ahmad naks from somalia my question is how does a person go out buy a home in the west without interest raba as far as if you don't have the money to buy the house completely then but natural you should not take loan from the conventional bank which is that is haram but many of the western countries have islamic alternatives you can go to an islamic bank whether it be in uk whether it be in america there are islamic banks which work on the sharia principles you can take a loan from the islamic bank which is not based on ripa it is based on a particular system called ajara and various options are there or it can be cost plus in this system very well you can take from islamic bank and pay an installment this is not dealing with rubber this is one of the ways that you can do or or there are many muslim organization which have a pool of money where they internally help members among themselves where they give a loan to the member of the organization who pays in installments so as long as it is not ripper based it is as per the sharia it is sharia compliant very well you can use the system in purchasing the house but taking from a conventional bank which is rebar based is totally haram"
