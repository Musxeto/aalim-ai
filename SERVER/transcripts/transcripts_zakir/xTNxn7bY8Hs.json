  "transcript": "let's first analyze the concept of god in hinduism if you ask a common hindu who's a layman that how many gods are there some may say three some may say hundred some may say thousand while others may say 33 crores 330 million but if you ask a learned person who's well versed with the hindu scriptures he will tell you that the hindus should actually worship only one god and they should believe only in one god but the common hindu he believes in a philosophy known as pantheism what the common hindu says that everything is god the tree is god the sun is god the moon is god the monkey is god the meaning is god the snake is god what we muslims say that everything is god's g o d with a positive yes everything belongs to god the tree belongs to god the sun belongs to god the moon belongs to god the monkey belongs to god the human being belongs to god the snake belongs to god so the major difference between the hindus and the muslims is that the common hindu says everything is god we muslims say everything is god's god with apostrophes the only difference is apostrophes if we can solve this difference of apostrophe yes the hindus and the muslims will be united how do we do it quran says that come to come in terms ask in us and you which is the first term allah that we worship none but allah"
