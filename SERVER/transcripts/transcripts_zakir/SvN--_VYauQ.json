  "title": "Pooja Asks Dr Zakir, “Qur’an is Corrupted as it says Sperm is Produced between Backbones”",
  "transcript": "the first question that we have is from Puja pradeep Quran faith sperm is produced in between backbones how is it possible that means the Quran is corrupted the sister asked a question that the Quran says that you will be the Creator from sperm which is emitted from the backbones and this is not possibility what the sister is referring to if a worse from Surah Tariq let man think from what he's created he's created from a dog which is emitted from a space between the backbone and the lips what the system may not be aware that she may not be aware of the medical knowledge and if you refer to any book on embryology or human development these scientific books will tell you that a human being in the embryonic stages while the development takes place in the womb of the mother when the human being is a fetus originally the the organs the reporter organs in the middle the test is they originate from a space which is same as that of the kidney between the backbone and the 11th and 12th rib so this is the origin of the gonads of the ovaries and the testes which are the reproductive organs and later on these these reproductive organs the descend in the female it descends to the true pelvis and in the male why the inguinal Canal it goes into the scrotum but even in the adult life after the reproductive organs have descended to the position yet they receive the blood supply from the space from the same space where the kidney is present between the backbone and the 11th and 12th rep and even the vein is returned goes back to the same space even the nerves come from the same space so alhamdulillah at a time when Medical Science was in advanced and the human did not know that 1400 years ago the Quran mentions about the scientific fact which we came to know now and yet most of the human beings who don't know about Medicals and don't know so it was the ignorance of sister Puja that because she's unaware of the Medical Science she thinks that the Quran is corrupted alhamdulillah the Glorious Quran is the last and final word message of almighty God Allah which was revealed to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him it was revealed 49 years ago so imagine what science came to know yesterday 40 years back 50 years back 100 years back the Quran mentioned 49 years ago so this is one of the proofs that there is not a single scientific mistake in the Quran and there are so many things what the Quran mentioned and fans have come to know about it today so this is one of the proofs and signs that Quran is from our creator almighty God Allah hope that answers the question"
