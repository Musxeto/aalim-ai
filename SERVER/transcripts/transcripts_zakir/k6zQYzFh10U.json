  "transcript": "we'll have the next question from the mic of the sisters on the right hand sides so the sister at the mic you may go ahead with your question good evening to uh everybody uh this is prashanthi dasri i'm from india and i'm actually a born christian and i migrated to dubai recently august 2011 and i happened to you know i came to know about islam and my brother also here is in dubai and he keeps telling us about allah i'm really convinced and you know with all the whatever knowledge that he shared with me i'm totally convinced and that you know islam is the straightforward religion and allah is alpha his omega is the beginning and his last we cannot see sun more than 10 minutes so how can we see a creator so i'm totally convinced but there's some questions uh you know that we have doubts because since i'm a born christian i have four questions total four questions to uh brother zakir naik uh the first question is brother i've been uh listening to your videos you know in youtube that you were talking about the holy spirit and you specifically mentioned that holy spirit exists so i just wanted to know is holy spirit there in islam according to quran and also there is a verse in old testament bible that the spirit of god is hovering over the waters spirit of god so is holy spirit a separate from allah this is my question sisters ask two questions question number one is that there is holy spirit what is the meaning and who is this holy spirit asked for the quran as per islam as compared to christianity and the bible does say that the spirit of god hovers above the water what does it mean is the holy spirit separate then god sister has two questions if i answer these two questions will you accept islam i have totally four questions so uh okay so you want so you want me to answer the first two and then you'll ask the next two questions no no yeah absolutely i'm 70 percent i'm convinced you know whatever knowledge that my brother shared with me and i've been watching your videos i'm i'm 70 percent convinced i'm being very honest and uh very transparent so inshallah the four questions answered yes if you are convinced hundred percent will accept islam inshallah i will accept this one the sister asks two questions and after she'll have the other two questions that the bible does mention about holy spirit what is the reference of holy spirit in the quran what the definition of holy spirit it is not the same as mission islam because when the christians when they talk about the holy spirit they assume it is part of the trinity the triune god though the word trinity doesn't exist in the bible no way the father the son and the holy spirit when they say father they think about almighty god like a santa claus sitting in the heavens with the earth at the footstool when they talk about the sun the thing about jesus christ peace be upon him like jeffrey hunter in the movie the king of kings with blue eyes and good nose not a polyp no like a jew when they talk about the holy spirit they think about dove that came in pentecost oh when jesus christ was being baptized what is the spirit that's mentioned in the quran what i believe is quran talks about archangel gabriel you are one of the angels senator and one of his roles was to get the revelation to mohammed salla and many other roles he has got so we believe in the archangel so like that if you say that there is a spirit we have no problem but he's not part of the triune god and both are separate the angels the archangel gabriel is separated and the spirit even mentioned in the bible is separated in allah they aren't joined this is the teaching of the church because the word trinity doesn't exist anywhere in the bible but if you read the quran the trinity is mentioned twice in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 171 where it says and the same message is repeated in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 73 those who say that god is three in one so the word trinity appears in the quran twice and both the places it says it is wrong to use the vertility and in the quran it is mentioned that don't say unity but the word trinity doesn't exist in the bible the closest first to trinity in the bible is the first epistle of john chapter number five verse number seven which says for there are three that bear accord in heaven the father the son and the holy spirit and these three are one so this verse if you read the revised stand version of the bible revised by thyroid scholars of the highest eminence christian scholars they say that this verse or first epistle of john chapter number five verse number seven is interpolation it's a fabrication it's a concoction and they've thrown this verse out of the bible so the verse in the bible that was not talking directly about trinity but the closest to trinity is thrown out by the scholars of christianity as a fabrication as a concoction so but nature is the spirit and almighty god they're two different entities they're not the same and in the quran it talks about archangel gabriel he's the angel of allah hope to answer the question sister yes brother i would like to know your other two questions yeah my third question is um which is related to holy spirit only uh all the prophets all the man of god like uh prophet abraham prophet isaac and prophet moses peace be upon them uh all the prophets they used to intercede with allah they used to interact with allah so to interact with allah because they are all the chosen ones they must be gifted by some strength it might be the grace of god so it is a power there is that some power so that they are able to interact with allah so what is that power so what is my understanding i mean what was my understanding all these days was with the help of holy spirit all the prophets were interceding with allah is that true sister has the question that the messengers of allah intercede with almighty god then he said interaction with almighty god sister the english word intercede and interaction are two different things so is there a question intercede or interaction intercedes intercede means that someone intercedes on somebody else's behalf someone intercedes on somebody else's behalf now this you have to realize that when you speak to allah allah subhanahu ta'ala does not need anyone to intercede the quran says in surah ghafir chapter number 40 verse 60 you ask me and i will answer your prayer allah does not require anyone to intercede with him why and people give the example that you know when you go in a court of law when you're presenting your case to the judge you hire lawyers so like that the messengers of god are our lawyers this is okay and logical for a judge who's a human being because the judge does not know who is the criminal who is the robber so the lawyer helps the judge to understand who is a criminal who is a robber who is not but allah subhanahu wa he does not require anyone to prove to him who is good who is bad so it is wrong to say intercede yes someone can pray a messenger can pray for other human beings and allah says in the quran that allah does not require any intercession except who he wills on the day of judgment so on the day of judgment allah says he will give permission to certain people to intercede and this is saying that this special favor will be given to prophet muhammad peace be upon him so what we know from the history of all the other scriptures as well as the quran as well as the hadith that the messengers of god they interacted with allah they prayed for others but if we use the prophet to intercede that means if i pray that if i go through this prophet following the commandments of prophet is good but if i pray to somebody else besides allah that's what many of the human beings do they pray to human beings saying they are closer to almighty god so if we pray through him god will accept our prayer faster and better this is wrong we have to pray to allah directly these prophets of god they are messengers yes they have special powers their special powers they can speak to allah and allah chooses certain men amongst men chooses certain men to communicate his message to the other human beings these chosen people of almighty god we call as prophets or we call as messengers of god so allah selects certain human beings in the world to communicate his message to the other human beings these are called as messengers of god so there is communication between the messenger and allah but that does not mean that human beings can use these messengers to intercede that if they pray to these messengers almighty god will listen to us this is the teaching of the church that you believe in jesus christ peace be upon him and all your sins will be forgiven this concept doesn't exist in islam and doesn't exist even in true christianity it is the teaching of the church sister hope that answers the question yeah my final question is a new testament i mean in one book book of acts paul mentioned about tongues what do you say about tongues in new testament i mean according to islam is that it's totally eliminated it's not there or or the gift of tongues existed at that time just asked the question that paul said about tongues if you give me the reference i've been a better position there are many things mentioned in the bible about tongues there are many verses in the quran which speaks about tongue if you give me the reference what you're talking about i'll be in a better position to reply to you but generally there are many statements in the bible talking about tongues and also says if you read the gospel if read the gospel of mark it says that anyone who is a believer he will be able to understand foreign tongues and speak foreign tongues that means if you are a believer in god then you can understand foreign languages and you can speak foreign languages so that's what i did when i had a debate with dr william campbell i gave him 100 rupee note and the indian hundred rupee note as you may be aware since we have got 22 official languages i read in english 100 rupees hindi says rupiah i asked him to read the other 20 languages if he's a believer and he could not there are many references in the quran talking about tongues if you read the quran the quran says in surah chapter number 30 verse number 22 that allah has created the human beings in different colors and tongues so that you should recognize each other so that the men of understanding will understand furthermore the quran says that on the day of judgment your tongues your organs your hands they will be witness for you what you did right what you did wrong there are various hadith of the prophet talking about the tongue so there are many references in the quran talking about the tongue there are many references in the bible that talk about tongue and how to test a believer hope that answers the question sister thank you and my final question okay uh i have a muslim friend and he suggested me to read bible old testament okay he specifically mentioned to follow go through the old testament in bible and then he said read quran but as you mentioned specifically you know that uh quran is the final revelation given by allah so as a muslim what do you suggest me because my friend is being a muslim he said follow bible old testament and then read quran so sister as the question one of her friends told her that firstly the old testament then read the quran sister it's not the must if there is something like the old testament and the new testament then there's something like the last testament the quran so when the christians say old and new testament this is the last and final test of allah now i am asking you the question suppose you have different versions and editions of a book for example you have gone to a medical college i was in a medical college you know professor keith moore wrote some books and his book at first edition second edition third edition so would you read the first edition of the latest edition of course i'll go for the latest correct yes if you really love the first edition you know i'm a fan of the first edition then i said no problem read the first edition then read the last edition so if you are so much hooked on to the old testament and you know your old testament is close to your heart then the quran says imran chapter 3 verse 64 come to common terms has been us in you then i would say that if you are so much hooked on to the old testament no problem read the old testament then read the quran at least agree what is common and when you read the old testament new testament and the quran we come to know that the thing that is common in these scriptures is that there is one god and he deserves to be worshipped he has got no image he is not begotten it further says that jesus christ peace is not god and both these scriptures say that the last and final messengers prophet muhammad peace be upon him so sister now are you prepared to accept islam of course yes [Applause] sister do you believe that there's one god yes i believe there is only one god do you believe that jesus is not god but he's a messenger of god yes i believe jesus is a messenger do you believe prophet muhammad is the last and final messenger yes i believe prophet muhammad is the last and the final messenger sister is there anyone forcing you to accept islam sorry is there anyone forcing you to accept islam no nobody is forcing are you accepting out of your free will yes because in islam to force anyone to accept islam is haram it's haram in the religion and it's haram it's prohibited in most of the countries i believe even in dubai to force anyone to accept the religion is forbidden so you're accepting out of a free will sister yes but that's the reason i asked you many questions mashaallah hope i hope no one is bribing you no no because in india when after many people accept islam the cid the police go and ask how much dollars doctors can i give you i tell them i have given them currency of the akhirah currency of the akhira and that's accepted so inshallah sister i will say in arabic and you can repeat it okay allah i bear witness that that there is no god that there is no god but allah but allah and i bear witness and i bear witness that that prophet muhammad prophet muhammad is the messenger is the messenger and servant of allah and servant of allah my sister you're a muslim and may allah that to guide you further and inshallah give you the best in this world as well as grant your place in paradise inshallah sister thank you"
