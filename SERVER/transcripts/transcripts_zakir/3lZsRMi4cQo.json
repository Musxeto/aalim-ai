  "title": "Making Constitutions above Sharia - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "alayum good day Dr Zakir n my name is Abdul ha from Nigeria I'm a student today Muslims and non-muslims all follow what is known as Constitution and we all know that Constitution is a book written by human beings Muslims non-muslims alike indicating that the constitution is not from Allah the almighty and all countries Rule and judge people with the Constitution and they say it is the supreme law of the land instead of sharia and that any law against the Constitution is null and wide including Sharia and Allah subhana tala says in the Quran in Surah MAA chapter 5 verse 45 and whosoever does not judge by that which Allah has revealed such as Z such a wrongdoers so I would like to hear Dr zakin ni's point of view regarding Muslims fall in Constitution and also I want to know if it's against chapter 5:45 may Allah make our de Prevail over all of the religions the question posed is that today Muslims and non-muslims alike they follow the Constitution and we know that the constitution is written by human beings whether they Muslims or non-muslims and they consider the Constitution to be something on the top and all the countries they follow the Constitution even if it goes against the Sharia and and the Quran clearly states in Sur chapter 5 verse number 44 that you have to judge by what Allah has commanded and anyone who doesn't follow the Commandment of Allah and does not judge according to the ruling of Allah subhana tala they are the wrongdoers so what is my comment on the Constitution according to me the Glorious Quran is the future world Constitution it is a proclamation to humanity it is the most positive book in the world world it is a fountain of mercy and wisdom it's a warning to the Headless it's a guide to the aing it's an assurance to those in doubt it's a hope to those in Despair and a Solace to the suffering now I do agree with the question that every country has a constitution and if you analyze the constitution of almost all the non-muslim countries they may not allow you to follow Sharia completely there are few exceptions to the rule like India I'll come to it later on as far as the Muslim countries are concerned many Muslim countries claim not all some they claim that they follow Quran and Quran is a constitution but practically I don't know of any country in the world which follow Quran completely some may follow a small percentage some may follow a larger percentage and there are many Muslim countries who claim to be secular they claim to be Democratic Etc now let us first deal with the non-muslim countries Allah says in the Glorious Quran in Surah 4 verse number 97 that when the angel of death comes to take the soul and he asks how were you in the land and when the replies that we were subjugated and we were persecuted so the angel replies isn't the world of Allah big enough for you to migrate so here Allah subhah wa ta'ala in Surah n 4: 97 if you know know Quran this was revealed in Makkah when the majority of the people are Makkah they were mush giving them guidance for the Muslim to and the verse continues that all those is in the world big enough for you vast enough for you to migrate and all those who do not so the Quran continues they will be going to hell and the verse continues verse number 98 of except those who are weak women men and children and who do not have the means to migrate so Allah says if you're living amongst the kufar amongst the non-muslims Allah tells you to migrate except if you are weak among the men women and children and you cannot migrate Allah will forgive you so the ruling is you have to migrate you cannot stay in a country where majority are non-muslims and the verse then continues and verse number 100 says that as for those who leave their home for sake of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and if they die in a land away from their home for sake of Allah subhana waala Allah will give them a Felicity a greater World they'll get jna and there are various such verses so according to the ruling of the Sharia a Muslim is supposed to stay in a majority Muslim countries there may be exceptions and such exception one is India because India earlier was ruled by Muslims for about thousand years later on the britishers came and they made partition of the United India they made Pakistan Bangladesh India about one3 Muslim into Pakistan 13 to Bangladesh one3 remain remain in India approximately if you were United you know one-third of the Muslim population lives in the Indian subcontinent so the britishes came and divided and unfortunately weakened the Muslim but one thing good mallah that India is one of the few non-muslim countries in the world which has a Muslim personal law that means every Muslim living in India has as far as the personal law is concerned whether it be inheritance whether it be marriage Etc they are allowed to follow the Shar allowed to follow Quran and the criminal law is is common the most important is the personal law so India is one of the few countries in the world which allows a Muslim even though it's a majority non-muslim country it was first ruled by Muslims we have a Muslim person law so I wouldn't put India in this category of non-muslim countries that a Muslim should migrate from because you know the Indian Muslims they about 210 million according to the government actually the numbers may be much more 250 or 300 million where will they go so the ruling here I feel it doesn't apply and I've given this answer in my earlier and India was one of the best or the best non-muslim country live before Modi came before 2014 and Modi came and ruled and9 W in the first then second relation 2019 so for 10 years he had absolute majority you know so because of that he tried to change many things but alhamdulillah in the recent election that took place a couple of months earlier in the results are declared in June 2024 Modi didn't win with majority he came back with the Coalition so we pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that the situation of Muslims in India becomes better but even at that time of course we find that if you lived in those states which weren't controlled by BJP and RSS like Kerala like Hyderabad like West Bengal of course Muslim were following very well they were living very peacefully and it's mentioned in the constitution of India that it every citizen of India can preach propagate and practice his religion later on when Modi came he tried to interfere with the Constitution is trying but alhamdulillah now that he's no longer in the absolute majority we pray that complete the whole of India goes back to normal but coming back to the other non-muslim countries whether be the Western countries whether it be USA European countries Etc where Muslim land majority so the ruling of the Quran I told you so I'm not in favor of Muslims living in non-muslim countries and basically coming to the question the Constitution there are things in the Constitution like in India there is not a single point in the Constitution or a single rule in the Constitution that forces any Muslim to do something which is Haram or prevents him from doing something which is f but in most of the other non-muslim country of course there are things that you may be doing Haram or you may be forced to do Haram and one common thing now in most of the western country is that they are forcing LGBT lesbian uh gay bisexual transexual and plus and queer they're forcing now our children are being forced to learn about sex education to know that okay there's no problem if you have two mothers there no problem if you have two fathers we are being forced this is Haram so if you live in a non-muslim country I do agree that many things of the Constitution people are living in the Western Country they are paying tax and from the tax money many innocent Muslims are being killed with that tax money America for example if you pay tax money to America with that tax money America is spending billions of dollars and giving Aid to Israel to kill tens of of thousands of Palestinian and this is happening since decades even many European country whether it be UK whether it be France they are giving Aid to Israel to kill innocent Muslims imagine with your tax money if you're a citizen part of your money is going in killing a Muslim brothers and sisters and there are many things which either it's impossible or whether it's very difficult for Muslim to practice I know I mean I've got many friends you know many of M friends Etc when we speak to them one to one most of them agree that Dr Zakir you are right it's not right for Muslims but maybe asked in public they may not be that vocal yes there are some who yet consider a Western Country to be a very good home for them but the percentage is small majority agree that's the reason many of the D that I know of they want to migrate many want to come to Malaysia and they say Malaysia is one of the best countries for a Muslim to live or the best of the worst or best available Muslim country to live and you can see my answer on that I've given that a couple of times before I don't want to repeat it so as far as following the Constitution is concerned in the Muslim count as I said that some Muslim countries claim that Quran is a constitution of course they will not force you do something are har but the government may do Haram I think there is no country that I know of in the world where there are no riba banks yes I just heard that in Afghanistan they want to close riba bank I don't know if any country in the world whether Muslim or non-muslim which doesn't have riba Banks riba is the 12th major sin in Islam interest is the 12th major sin and our Prophet said there are various levels of RBA and the lowest level is like doing Z with your mother imagine such a major sin IMI labels it as 12th major sin after the the five pillars of that after shik and murder and black magic and the four pillars of Salah zakat Ramadan Hajj then obedience to your parents and take care of the orphans Etc then number 12 sin is dealing with RAB taking or giving RAB according to so unfortunately unfortunately even the Muslim countes I don't know of any country which is following Sharia totally some are following to a better extent some medium some very limited but at least in the Muslim country people will not force you to do something which is Haram so living in a Muslim country is much better than a non-muslim country they may tell you options of doing Haram they not for Haram they'll not prevent you for doing something which is f so I don't know in any Muslim country where they will prevent you certain things okay like dawa is difficult you know many of the Muslim countries they prevent you from doing dawa but as a whole living in a Muslim country is better now coming to the question that if the Constitution is not based on the Quran and the Hadith so what should we follow the answer is very clearcut whether living in a non-muslim country or a Muslim country if the constitution of the country tells you to do something which is against the Quran and say had no muslim should follow it because for us Allah and his rasool is far superior to the constitution of any country and if they force you to do something Haram you should not do it or if they prevent you to do something which is f then you should do it so if the constitution of the country contradicts with the Sharia the Quran and say had you should follow the Quran the and not the Constitution but if there are certain things which are optional in Islam and makes you compulsory by the Constitution then no problem in doing it or something the Constitution prevents you from doing which is allowed in Islam mu optional no problem as long as it do not break the rule of the Shar so for us Muslims our constitution is the Shar the Glorious Quran and the say so we should follow the Constitution and agree with the verse of the Quran of Sur MAA chapter 5 verse number 45 we say that those who do not judge by the ruling of Allah subhana wa ta'ala they will be amongst the zimon they'll be amongst the wrongdoers and we pray to Allah subhana tala that may he not make us amongst the salon and may he make a stand for the truth for the h and may he make us follow the Quran and so that all the Muslims enter inshallah J hope that answer the question"
