  "title": "Fasting is Compulsory only for Adult, Sane and Healthy Muslims During Ramadhaan - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "from what you've said then my understanding is that fasting is a muslim only prerogative is that correct that's right it is compulsory only for a muslim to fast it is not a requirement for a non-muslim or unbeliever to fast and the reason is that allah says in the quran allah says in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 39 that the deeds of a non-believer a person who is non-muslim the deeds of an unbeliever is like a mirage in a desert and the thirsty person thinks that there is water but when he reaches there he does not find anything else but he finds allah and allah will pay him for his deeds and allah is swift in taking of accounts that means in the year after the unbeliever for his deeds he will get nothing and allah is swift in taking of accounts so for unbeliever all the deeds they are useless in the hereafter because all the deeds have to be accompanied with the intention and as we discussed yesterday that one of the criteria an important criterion for a person fast to be accepted is the niyah it is intention and the intention is that the fast should only be for allah so if a non-muslim if unbeliever who does not believe in allah subhanahu wa allah where is the question of him doing the niyyah doing the intention of fasting for raspberry so that's the reason it is not required for unbelievable to fast if he fast without the intention it will just be like anything else it will not be an act of worship it not be a fast as is considered in islam so therefore the near the intention is very important so for unbeliever any act of worship until he has faith until he believes until he believes that there is only one allah subhana wa unless he says that there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the messenger of allah all acts of worship they are useless for the hereafter but the moment a non-believer a person who is not a muslim he accepts islam for him it becomes obligatory if he accepts islam in the middle of the month of ramadan from that moment onwards fasting becomes compulsory for him but the past allah will not take into account allah says in the quran allah says in surah chapter number 8 verse number 38 that say to the unbelievers that if they start believing the past will be forgiven that means the moment a non-muslim accepts islam all its parcels will be forgiven but the moment accepts islam from that time it becomes obligated on him to fast well i myself fasted half of ramadan without being muslim so now i know the answer now i'd like to come to the age of maturity the coming of age as we say in the west in some places the coming of age is noted as being 18 and others 14 as young as 14. what does islam specify as being the coming of age as far as the rules of the different countries are concerned in india the age of adulthood or maturity is 18 indonesia it is 19 in uk to 16 years of age every country the age of maturity what the government or that people of the country the law it is different depending upon their own understanding but in islam fasting becomes compulsory salah becomes compulsory the acts of worship becomes compulsory once a person reaches the age of puberty and there are basically three criteria if any one of these three criteria are fulfilled then the person is said to have reached the age of puberty number one is that growth of course pubic hair around the private parts number two the person reaches the age of 15 or there is emission of semen in a wet dream or otherwise or if it's a female then she starts her menstrual cycles the day the girl starts her menstrual cycle she's supposed to have reached the age of puberty irrespective she may be below the age of ten but the moment she reaches the day she starts her menstrual cycle she's considered to be a person who has reached the age of puberty that's interesting as well because you mentioned that it could be as young as 10 that a girl would reach puberty and often said in the west and even now it's quite common now recently an article came a couple of months back that in delhi it is not uncommon for a girl of the age of 10 to start a menstrual cycles only if it is before the age of nine there is a point to be worried about same in the western world previously it wasn't there when i did my medical college the age was said that in the western world about 12 to 13 india it was 13 to 14 but now because of the engine diet and the change of climate etc all this has an effect on the age of puberty but now it's quite common that girls of the age of 10 even before 10 at the age of 9 many of them they start the menstrual period right and they seem to be maturing quicker than the boys as well that's another question that's right"
