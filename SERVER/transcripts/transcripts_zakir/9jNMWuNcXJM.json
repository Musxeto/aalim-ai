  "transcript": "sven bensler you mentioned a lot of references of the bible what about john 10 30 the father and me are one the brother quota verse of the bible gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 30 the father and me are one it is not the father and me are one it is i and my father are one it's not the father and me are one now this quotation i and my father are one to know what it is you have to know the context you have to understand the context that i and my father are one to know this you have to go a few verses earlier if you read gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 23 it speaks about the context that the jews they entered the temple in solomon's porch verse number 23 verse number 24 says that the jews came upon jesus christ peace be upon him and they asked them how long does thou make us doubt if thou art the christ tell us plainly verse number 25 says i have told you but you believe not in me the work that i do they bear witness of my father verse number 26 says you do not believe in me because you are not my sheep verse number 27 says my sheep they hear me and they follow me verse number 28 i give them eternal life no man can pluck them out of my hand verse number 29 says my father that give it to me is greater than all no man can pluck them out of my father's hand i and my father are one so in context it means in purpose verse number 28 says that no man can pluck them out of my hand verse 129 says my father is greater than all no man can pluck them out of my father's hand verse number 30 i and my father are one so it means they are one in purpose if i say my father is a medical doctor and he's a doctor i'm a medical doctor and my father are one it means we have one in profession it does not be one in person but the christians say no no it means one in person and my father one indicates that jesus christ peace be upon his god if i agree for sake of argument further if you read in the gospel of john chapter number 17 verse number 21 jesus christ peace be upon him says my father is in me and i in thee he tells the apostles to his twelve apostles my father is in me i and thee and we are one the same one is used here so do you mean to say there are fourteen gods now father is in jesus christ jesus christ peace be upon him within the apostles so there will be fourteen gods so we have to coin a new words in term of trinity you have to coin a word for 14 gods here what jesus christ peace be upon him and the same one was used that one and purpose and further it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 17 verse number 23 that jesus christ peace be upon him it is the apostles that i am in you and you and me we are one that means one in purpose and immediately you read further gospel of john chapter 10 verse number 31 the jews they pick up stones to stone jesus christ peace be upon him verse number three to jesus christ peace be upon him says many of good works have done for which of my good works do you stone me verse number 33 all this is from my head any christian who has a bible can open and check up all the references i'm giving gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 33 says that we don't stone you for good works you being a man you blaspheme is saying i am god verse number 34 says that isn't it mentioned in your scriptures that we are gods and the one to whom the word of god comes is called as god your scripture is not broken so here if you read in context that i and my father are one is in purpose it doesn't mean that they are one in unity and it doesn't claim at all that jesus christ peace be upon him is god otherwise it would mean that there are 14 gods so what it means is that the purpose of almighty god and jesus christ the messenger of god is one and the same hope answers the question [Applause]"
