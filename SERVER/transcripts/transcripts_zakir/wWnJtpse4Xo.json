  "transcript": "as far as Ramadan being called as the month of Supplication I beloved Prophet said it's mentioned in a say had of Al Hadith number 6393 where the Beloved Prophet said that Allah subhana wa tala does not reject the prayer of three kinds of people one is the father who prays for his child his son or daughter the second is a fasting person especially when he breaks his fast and the third is a traveler and I beloved wasallam he further said it's mentioned in say had of ma Hadith number 1643 the prophet said that Allah subhana tala emancipates the slaves from the Hellfire during every hour when the fast is broken and does this every night and ab beloved Prophet also said it's mentioned of Hadith number 988 Allah subhana wa ta'ala ransoms the Muslims from the Hellfire every day and night in the month of Ramadan and he answers the prayer of every Muslim every day and night in the month of Ramadan so because Allah subhana wa ta'ala he listens to the supplication of the person who fasts and he gives a special status that's the reason Ramadan is called as the month of Supplication"
