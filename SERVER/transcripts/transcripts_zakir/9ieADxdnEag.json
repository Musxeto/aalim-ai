  "transcript": "another thing which is been bothering me for some time is the fact that fasting is one of the pillars of Islam correct now but is there anything which differentiates the act of worship fasting the pillar from the other four pillars perhaps as I mentioned earlier that there are five pillars of Islam and all of them are important but the differentiation between psalm fasting as compared to other pillars is that the other pillars of Islam whether it be Salah whether it be zakat whether bihaji it can be done by a person to show to the others for yeah to be seen or to be heard you know maybe I want to show myself an I'm a very past person so I'm offering Salah to show to the people you know I'm going for Hajj to make a show of it can be possible can be possible to give child eats that people will say I'm a charitable person for sure but fasting cannot be done for you cannot be done to show other people why a person can easily fast and when no one is watching he can have food he can have drink they have a person who truly fast and abstains from things that break the fast he's doing it only for Allah and Oneness so that's the difference between Psalm and the other pillars of Islam and I beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in say buhari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1904 Allah says that all the Deeds Done by the sons of Adam they are for themselves only he doesn't find himself but first thing is for me and I will reward him and fasting is a shield a person fasting he abstains from obscene things he abstains from lying and abstain from yelling and if a person gets angry at him and abuses him he says I'm fasting I'm fasting and then the Hadith further goes on says that I swear by Allah in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad that the breadth of a person who fasts is sweeter to Allah than the scent of Musk and a person who fast he feels happy twice once while making the fast and once when he meets his creator his Lord there are various aspects mentioned first is that fasting is it's not for you secondly fasting is The Shield it's a production it keeps you away from wrong things from obscenity from vulgarity and if someone is angry it says that you have to calm him down say I'm fasting I'm fasting because number three Hadith number two zero three eight that the Satan runs in the circulatory system of the human being like the blood so when we first we feel hungry when we are hungry you know the energy level goes down and the thing which required for doing things because when we eat food it goes into the blood when we restrict food the Restriction of the pathway of the Satan is there so that is the reason when we fast our takawa level increases"
