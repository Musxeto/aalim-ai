  "title": "Why do people commit sins if all the devils are chained in Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "if all the devils are chained during the month of Ramadan how come people continue to commit sins and I do agree with you this is a common question and I remember several years back when I was in school and when I heard this Hadith that the devils are changing the month of Ramadan immediately the question that came to my mind and the question that comes to many Muslims mind and Main non-muslims is that if the devils are chained then how do people how do human beings that commit sins this question is based on the Hadith which I mentioned earlier of musnad Ahmed volume number two page number 230 Hadith number 7148 which is also repeated in Sunnah nisai tip number five Hadith number 2106 where the Beloved Prophet said that away people the Blessed month of Ramadan is approaching and Allah is ordained for you that you fast in this month and the Gates of Heaven will be open in this month and the Gates of Hell will be closed and the Devils will be chained in this month is a night which is better than a thousand months and a person who's deprived of the blessing in this month is truly a deprived person now when we give the Hadith it clearly mentions that in this month of Ramadan the Devils will be changed anthological question if devils are chained then how do human beings that commit sins to make the people understand we have to realize that when the devils are chained it does not mean that the devils are slain they have been killed they are present but they are chained they are not killed the power isn't there but it is diminished for a better understanding I'd like to give you an example that when there is a line or a tiger who is free there are high chances that he may kill you your life with Ninja but the moment that tiger or that line is Chained you are safe you are safe as long as you maintain a safe distance after the Tiger has been chained if you come too close to him there are chances yet you can be killed so as long as you maintain the distance from the tiger who is Chained you are safe similarly in the month of Ramadan if you maintain a safe distance from the Satan you will be saved of the footsteps of the devil for he is to you and about enemy many places Allah says in the Quran that be careful of the footsteps of the devil a lot of them say that be careful of the devil because a normal Muslim an average Muslim who has average Iman many sees the devil in front of him he will be careful for example suppose they are young girl who comes to an average Muslim a young boy who has average Iman if a young girl comes and tells him that let's spend the night together that Muslim will say spending the night together with a girl it's Haram it is he will immediately object but that same girl if that girl phones that young boy and speaks to him on the phone the boy will say speaking to a girl on the phone there is no problem so he speaks to the girl for a few times on the phone for a few minutes later on the girl says let's go and have some snacks in McDonald's on Kentucky Fried Chicken having snacks for a few minutes for half an hour with a girl in McDonald's no problem she goes and has snacks with a girl in McDonald's later on the girl says why not have dinner in a restaurant having dinner with a girl in restaurant for a couple of hours no problem then the girl says why not spend the night together and then the boy says spending the night together with a girl no problem so this is footsteps of the devil this is not Mission the Quran this is just my own example so what Allah warns us is that be careful the footsteps of the devil if the Devil comes directly in front of an average Muslim who has Iman he will abstain he will run away from it are the things which are dangerous so what we have to realize when the devil is Chained his footsteps are restricted so many of the sins are prevented but if we go close to him then the chances that will be overtaken by the devil and commit a sin not very high so what we have to be careful that in Ramadan if we keep the distance then the chance of committing sin is less but if we go close to the Satan even though his chain like our tiger can walk even after his chain same the devil so this is my understanding and the Beloved Prophet said the devils are chained the devil cannot move but left distance so if we keep the distance we'll be safe the second reason that I feel is that in the month of Ramadan though the devils are changed we fail to realize that the balance 11 months they are free and the impact that the devil has on the human beings for these 11 months it leaves those impact that impression in the month of Ramadan to give a better understanding always give the example that there are drug Peddlers which try and get customers the youngsters from the colleges from the universities so what they do initially they give the drug free and the entice the youngsters for having drugs later on after some time they charge a nominal amount for the drug later on they charge an exorbitant amount but by the time the youngster is already hooked onto the drug so even if the drug dealer is not there they will try and find where the drug deal is they'll go out of the way to find them and get the truck and many of them even if the drug Peddler the drug dealer is imprisoned by the law they will go out of the way to find someone else they may go in a chemist shop and buy mandrix whatever it is they are so much hooked on to it so these people who have become addicts Two drugs or rather say addicted to the Satan even though the Satan is imprisoned the effect is yet there so in this thing we understand as a drug dealer as a drug Peddler even after he goes the drug addict gets accustomed to that drug through we human beings we are accustomed to the sin and even though the Satan is imprisoned we keep on committing these mistakes but mainly those people who have become addicts fall in this category so those who do major sin for this category but the normal Muslims the average Muslims who haven't become addicted it's easy for them to stay away from sin and the third reason that I give is that though there are some Scholars who say that in this month of Ramadan the strong Devils the marriage they imprisoned the smaller ones are free so they keep on coming mistakes but one of my understanding the third reason is that though the devils are chained by Allah they can yet whisper and one of the ways the Devils try and get the human beings close to them is by whispering and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 114 verse number one to six means whisper in the hearts of the human beings and they withdraw amongst them and Men is talking about the Satanist talking about the Devils who whispering to the hearts of the human being and the withdraw and among these devils are the Jinn and the human beings so maybe Allah has imprisoned the Devils who are the Jinn but the human beings we are yet free so one category of devils that the jinns have been in prison but the satanus are even amongst the men therefore Allah says why it free and yet we have to be careful of The Whisper of the devil mainly is thing that attracts towards the sin so since they had committed but the chances are less and furthermore it's clearly mentioned before Hadith that Allah has ordained for you in this month of Ramadan that you should fast only if you fast according to me will the Devils be imprisoned that's talking about the Devils that are going to attract you so Allah says if you fast Allah has ordained for your fasting and the Devils will be put in Chains so the Devils thereafter you if you fast surely they'll be restricted the criteria for us to be away from the Devil is to fast if you fast with the propaneer surely the devil will not be able to entice you and the best logical way to prove this is if we check the crime rate of the Muslim countries during Ramadan it goes down but if you check the crime rate of the non-muslim countries in Ramadan it is the same the reason is that because they are not fasting they're not Muslims this devil yet has an effect on them because the Muslims are fasting if not all properly at least majority or at least quite a large number so because of that the crime rate in the Muslim country within the month of Ramadan is low as compared to the other months but the crime rate in the non-muslim country is approximately the same indicating otherwise even the non-muslims they will not commit any sins but the criteria is that you have to fast properly for the sake of Allah"
