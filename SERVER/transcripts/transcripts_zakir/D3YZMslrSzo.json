  "transcript": "why do some Muslims abstain from sins only during the month of Ramadan you know whilst they're fasting and after the month of Ramadan in the other 11 months we see them lying cheating stealing and men doing many of the other terrible sins unfortunately may Allah protect us from those sins I mean why is it so why do those be what possesses these people to do those acts during the 11 months and not this one the reason is the same as I mentioned earlier that we should know the objective of fasting if you know the objective of fasting inshallah even after ramnan is over the person will yet Beyond The Straight Path as I mentioned in my example that you should know the method of the Act and the objective so people may know the method how to eat food they make a morsel of the food put it in the mouth masticate it to it and put it on the throat so the act the method they know very well that's what they do in the month of Ramadan but after that if someone puts a finger in his throat and vomits out so that food will not become healthy so that's what is happening the main purpose the objective they don't know objective is to increase the taqwa to make a person come closer to Allah so if that is there in the mind so even after the month of fasting if it's gone yet the person will be on the straight path because they don't remember the objective and wants us in the forgiven if you repent truly one of the criteria of repentance is that besides seeing the what you have done is wrong ask your forgiveness stopping it also saying that you will not do it again for forgiveness in the right way they will not go back to the old bad habits so they follow all this inshallah even after Ramadan goes away they will be on the straight path for the full year like how we have to pray five times it will be on the straight path ramnan once a month is overhauling of the full body the mind and the Soul also so once a year is sufficient if you know how to do it correctly very good answer and let's hope we can get much closer to Allah in this month inshallah"
