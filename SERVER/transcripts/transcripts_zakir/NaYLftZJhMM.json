  "title": "Why do Muslim men keep a beard? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign foreign foreign foreign the rather has a question that like people are fighting in Kashmir and they're doing Jihad similarly in Manipur the people are fighting and he had to leave the city and come here and because of the terrorists he's 15 days here he's happy to learn about Islam he wants to know that wise in peace channel in Manipur yeah and he wants to know that why do Muslims keep up here these are two basic questions brother in Kashmir as I mentioned I can't say everyone is doing they are struggling they are striving you are thinking me as a room I says you you are the right I perfectly understood a question brother okay I never said that you are wrong and your question is also very good brother but I'm trying to clarify that everyone fighting in Kashmir they may not be doing that some people for the ulterior motive may be doing wrong thing those who are truly following the Commandment of the Quran and fighting then you can say that they are doing Jihad Pizza I cannot put a blanket rule that everyone in Kashmir is now coming to your question of Manipur I know that there is a lot of fighting going in Manipur and because of them you are here maybe it is Allah's planning almighty God has planned that because of fighting your hair leave us at peace in this world maybe you'll get peace in the year after also correct now you have heard such a good lecture about peace this world peace is a temporary peace where you should strive but the best peace is the peace in the hereafter not seen in Manipur you can easily take the frequency if you put a dish maybe the cable orbital may not be putting it but if you put a dish which costs just a few thousand rupees and face it in the direction of 68 degrees east towards inters at 10. in Charlotte with the peace Channel you can try and tell the cable operator to see it we cannot go to Manipur and try and force them but if they put the dish and face it to 68 degrees east and tune into the frequency in shall I'll get it coming to your question why do Muslims keep a beard what I say that if the label shows your intent to wear it and give them the talk that if the label shows your intent where it for example if you go to a conference of intellectuals the people wear a label I'm a doctor I'm an engineer I'm a scientist it gives an informal introduction when you go to a gathering conference only of doctors then the Specialties mentioned says Dr swanzo he's a cardiologist neurologist nephrologist if you have a heart problem you go to cardiologist if you want to know about kidney the nephrologist if you have brain problem neurologist informal introduction the Quran says in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 54. the Quran says that is that when you meet those who believe in our signs you say salaam alaikum you wish them Islam pay stress on saying assalamu alaikum it's the religion of peace no minimum in a day every Muslim at least has to pray five times a day now when he prays five times a day even if he praise only the father Salah the company Salah five times into two when we end the Salah we say may peace and mercy and the blessings of Allah be on all the people on my right May the peace and mercy and blessings of almighty God be all the people on my left every cell I say twice I have to read minimum five fella minimum 10 times I'm wishing salaam to all the people on my right the bees Beyond people on the left if I read this that is another 10 times so minimum 20 times I wish Salaam to the people on my right and people on my left if I read the normal Sunnah it may be more anytime I meet a Muslim I have to wish him assalamualaikum may peace be on you it's also mentioned in the Quran Instagram chapter number four verse number 86 it says when anyone gives you a greeting give your Curtis greeting wish back more courteously or at least the same so anyone wishes me assalamu alaikum I have to say if anyone says peace Beyond you I have to see my peace and mercy Beyond you if someone says I have to wish back better if someone says I have to wish back at least the same Islam words are the same but coming from the bottom of the heart even that is better so Allah says in the Quran wish back more courtesy now when I'm traveling I mean I meet Muslims How will I know that he's a Muslim so we have identity beard but today in the media if you are a beard you're a terrorist yeah but look at this brother please let me complete the answer if the six keeper beard and wear a turbine they are called as staunch followers if Muslims keep a bird they're called a terrorist if the Christian none they cover the head they are called as religious if Muslim women are covered they call it subjugated media media media see this beard this beard can't even harm a fly in this cap of mind it can't even harm a fly if you read the Quran the Quran does not say you should keep a beard there's only one verse in the Quran in Surah chapter number 20 verse number 94 where be upon him he catches the beard of peace be upon him and he says that o son of my mother why do you catch me by my beard that is the only place where the beard has come but our beloved Prophet says number seven number seven eight ten 781 a beloved Prophet said do the opposite of what the pagans do trim your mustache is a shot and grow the beard no because it is the Commandment of the prophet and we obey and it is a good way for me to identify many people when I go to anywhere on the streets I go to foreign country they see a cabin up here it's an informal introduction I am spreading peace so what we realize that it is an informal introduction and like for example if you go in a car if you're the doctor he puts a cross why to identify that that car belongs to a doctor if you ask some emergency you can stop the car now when you see a person having a beard address covering the head you know he's a Muslim I remember and if you ask your grandparents you ask your grandparents 50 years back 100 years back they will tell you that the non-muslims when they wanted to hire a taxi a cab they looked for a driver who wore a cap and wear a beard Muslim diver he won't take me for a ride when they wanted to buy from a grocery they wanted to buy from a person whose owner had a beard Muslim he would not cheat but today if you are a cap or a beard it means that a terrorist so if the name is maligned we have to reinstate That Glory to this beard fine and it is only a label it's a commander of the prophet he said it therefore we do it it cannot even harm a fly but it gives an informal introduction that they're Muslims we can wish each other and if you have any problem if we require help it's the duty of Muslim to help the neighbor you stop a man with a beard and a cap inshallah I'll help you hope that answers the question [Applause]"
