  "transcript": "good evening I am Dr Matthew and I'm also involved with creation.com which is part of creation Ministries International being a medical doctor I came here because I was very much interested in peace and as you mentioned peace is both internal and external now personally when I and millions of other people have found after being convicted of our sin and repenting of it that and having accepted and believed that Jesus Christ the sinless man paid the full price for my sins he took my shame and guilt on the cross and died for me because of which I have peace and that peace is something which passes understanding I want to know would you like to take away that peace which I have which is a peace which passes understanding and can you answer that thank you brother that's a very good question here's Dr Matthew he's got a website an organization called creation he said that he found peace he came here to attend peace he said he got peace in Jesus Christ peace be upon him who died for a sins on the cross he died for his sins on the cross so he's asking me that would I like to take away your peace brother I would never like to take over your peace I would like to take away your false peace and make you get the true peace I love Jesus Christ peace be upon him I respect him and I Revere him I want to know that do you also love Jesus Christ or not I am asking you yes do you agree yeah do you believe that Jesus is God yes yes brother now either you get true peace or I will come to your peace correct if you are this true peace I will leave my peace and I will join you yes now you told me Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is God I challenge you to point out a single verse in the Bible a single unique verse from the Bible a single unambiguous verse in which Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he says worship me and I am ready to accept Christianity you said Jesus Is God as far as Muslims are concerned Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messenger of almighty God we believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ We Believe believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christians do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe he healed those born blind and lepers with God's permission the Muslims the Christians are all together but The Parting of ways is as you said that most of the Christians they believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Divinity there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God already said worship me if you can point out I am ready to accept Christianity so if you had not said that why do you believe he's God and where did Jesus Christ peace be upon him say that he died on the cross for your sins that is the teaching of Paul are you following Paul are you following Jesus Christ peace be upon Him nowhere in the Bible so my question is when Jesus Christ never said he was God if you love him you have to respect him he said when he was asked which is the first of The Commandments it's mentioned in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 he said Shema Israel the God our Lord is one God he repeated Verbatim what was said by Moses earlier peace be upon him so what I am asking you if you know the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him if you say Christian is a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him it is mentioned in the book of Ephesians chapter number five verse number 18 that do not be drunk with wine it's mentioned in the Book of Proverbs chapter number 20 verse number one that wine is a mocker Whoever deceives has it we Muslims we don't have alcohol but many of the Christians have alcohol furthermore we Muslims don't have poke it's mentioned the Bible in The Book of Leviticus chapter number 11 verse number seven and eight in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number eight in the book of Isaiah chapter number 65 verse number two to five that you should not have spoke we Muslims don't have folk but Christians have poke most of them furthermore Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was circumcised on the Eighth Day according to Gospel of Luke chapter number two verse number 21 we Muslim the circumcise most of the Christians are not if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him I am proud to say we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves so where do you follow the teaching of Jesus Christ and you say that you worship him so brother point out a single verse in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him said unequivocally that I am God or worship me yes brother my question was on peace and I have that peace I don't have to memorize memory purposes to prove or disagree with you what I am sharing is that the peace which I have because of the belief because we are all sinners and we need a sacrifice to pay for our sins it is not by our works that we are saved correct by believing in faith that Jesus Christ has paid the price for my sins fine so you agree that Jesus Christ has paid for the sins of all Humanity do you agree with that yes okay all who believe in him okay fine so suppose the Christian comes like you who believe in Jesus Christ and he rapes your wife will he go to heaven or hell if a Christian comes and rapes your wife he believes Jesus Christ died for his sins so whatever sin he does it is paid for it so if Jesus Christ had died for a sin it will give permission for all the Christian to rape the woman never ever why never you said whether you told your work will not take you to heaven it is your belief so if you believe Jesus Christ died for your sin and if you commit rape if you Rob if you oppress other people will you go to heaven he is not a Christian if he does that simple but he believes in Jesus Christ there are many Christians who I know that means it's a wrong belief in the Bible also it is written that even the Devils believe in Jesus Christ they don't do you follow Jesus Christ peace be upon him are you circumcised yes are you circumcised no I am not circumcised so why don't you follow Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Jesus Christ yes you know that circumcision is beneficial medically so you can do it now also no problem if you want and help you Point number one point number two do you have poke brother no you're gonna put away it's mentioned in the Old Testament God has mentioned do you have intoxicant do you have alcohol no fine do you believe Jesus is God Jesus Christ is God came on the earth as a human being where it is mentioned which verse of the Bible tell me which was of the Bible yeah which verse of the Bible someone tells you our God will you believe your God someone says I am God will I believe point to be noted is that Jesus Christ never claimed Divinity in fact if you go to the gospel of Matthew chapter number 19 verse number 16 and 17 there's a person who comes to Jesus and says good Master what good things should I do so that the entire eternal life so Jesus Christ peace be upon himself why thou collest be good leave us at God why thou calleth me good there's only one good and that is a God in heaven and if you want to enter eternal life you keep the Commandment he never said that if you want to go to paradise you believe I'm God he never said that you believe that I died on the cross for your sins he said if you want to go to paradise you keep the Commandments and the Commandments of what you should not drop you should not have alcohol you should not covet your neighbor's wife Commandments the Deeds the deeds will take you to Paradise Jesus Christ never said he was God so why are you saying that Jesus is God peace be upon him you are not following his teachings also he didn't say that Jesus Christ is God for this argument I just said that I have the peace in my heart and that peace I want to share whether there are many people you know there's a Satan worshiping culture you know that are you always Satan worshiping correct so they get Peace by worshiping Satan but that is false peace therefore I want to take you out from false peace and make you enter true peace what you are saying is peace is actually not peace you are worshiping a false god Jesus Christ peace be upon him never said he was God so because they are worshiping a false god and you are in the false peace like people worship Satan and yet they think that they are on the right track I want to get you out of the first piece and get you into true peace because I consider myself to be a true Christian if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him then I'm more Christian than the Christian themselves do you know Jesus Christ peace be upon himself in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for even the spirit of shall come he shall guide you unto all truth he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me no which man which prophet after Jesus has ever glorified Islam Jesus Christ it is Prophet Mama peace be upon him so this prophecy of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is mentioned in your Bible there are several quotations I am asking you why don't you follow the instruction of Jesus Christ peace be upon him and why don't you follow Prophet Mama peace be upon him what kind of a Christian are you do you mean to say that I don't follow the following teachings of Christians not at all I'm giving you quotations with reference you go back home and how much it's easy to judge brother [Music] [Applause] quotation what you are saying you have not given a single quotation I I challenge your doctors of the community of Christian dumb anyone get your doctors of divinity if you say you don't have the knowledge get your doctors of divinity who's the best in the world but the person should be powerful not just a roadside person a person who can attract people a person who has a following you get the best one that you have in India best one that you have in the world and will have a dialogue yes and you can ask him and you ask him all the questions I've asked that where is it mentioned in the bible any unequivocal statement where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God always says worship me I doctors I am immediately accepting if you can point out from any version of the Bible any unequivocal statement any unamming statement where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or worship me I am ready to accept him to be God but there's no statement so what you are doing is you are not following the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him it is the teachings of the church not of Jesus Christ peace be upon him so therefore I request you brother that please leave the false peace and enter into two peace the true peace is submitting your will to God God who created Jesus Christ peace be upon him not a false god Jesus Christ peace be upon him was a messenger of God but he was not God how to answer the question [Applause]"
