  "title": "Concept of Jihad in Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "engineering College here sir your lecture after hearing a lecture our disbelief about Islam and Muslims when is today [Applause] sir I have been to Jammu and Kashmir and have seen the trauma and pain that the people are suffering there because of the so-called Jihad of some Muslims sir my question is that does Islam support such activities if no then what actually the word Jihad means is it in accordance with the 56th verse of the seventh chapter of Quran which says do not Mischief or the 14th verse of 42nd chapter which say forgiveness is better than retaliation or the 32nd verse of the fifth chapter which states if anyone killed a person he kills the mankind sir I have one more question in the same context and it is that does Islam teaches to give priority to the religion that is before the country or motherland that in matrimi or Kong thanks a lot [Applause] the first question is regarding concept of jihad he says that why are people fighting he's been to Kashmir about Jihad does Islam encourage this fighting what is the meaning of jihad does it not disagree with the quotations he gave also remind the chapter 5 or 32 brother as far as the word Jihad is concerned there's a misconception not only amongst the non-muslims but even among the Muslims what most of the people think that any War fought by any Muslim for any reason whether it be for his personal gain whether it be for politics whether it be for language whether it be for color it is called as Jihad Jihad does not mean any word fought by any Muslim Jihad comes from the Arabic word jahada which means to strife which means to struggle like so Jihad basically means to strive to struggle and in the Islamic context it means to strive against one's own evil inclination it also means to strive to make the society better it even includes to strive in the battlefield to fight himself defense Jihad also means to fight against operation and irony Jihad basically means to strive or struggle many people have misconception that Jihad means Hollywood and many people translate the Arabic word for holy war is if you read the Quran nowhere in the Quran not a single verse know when the authentic is this word mentioned anywhere there's no harm the translation of jihad is not holivo at all this about holy war was first used by the historians to describe the Crusades of the Christian who spread Christianity and who killed thousands of people in the name of Christianity Unfortunately today many people including so-called Muslim Scholars inverted commas they translate they are the holy war it's a mistranslation yes Jihad means to strive to struggle one of the striving can include fighting fighting also should be in the way of Allah that is not regarding a question then why does Islam encourage fighting and killing and there are many critics of Islam who normally says religion it always says that we should kill the non-muslim where you find them many critics including the critic of India Arun shuri and he writes in his book The World of fatwa he quotes Surah by chapter number nine verse number five and says that the Quran says wherever you find a kafir into bracket Hindu that you kill them and if you open the Quran chapter 9 verse number five and if you read it does say whether you find a coffee to kill but this is a quotation out of context for the context if you read the first few verses it speaks about a peace treaty between the mushriks of Makkah and the Muslims the fields chapter 9 first few verses it speaks about a peace treaty between the Muslims of Makkah now this peace treaty was relatively broken by the Muslims of Makkah by the time Allah reaches verse number five he gives them ultimatum to the mushriks and he tells them put things straight in four months time otherwise the declaration of war and in the battlefield Allah says that when the enemies come to attack you you kill the enemies so this verse is revealed in the battlefield that when the enemies come to kill you don't get scared fight them but natural any army General today to boost up the morale of his soldiers he will say that when the enemies come kill them he will not say that just be quiet and Arun Suri after coding verse number five he jumps to verse number seven because verse number six has the reply Surah chapter 9 verse number six says that if the if the enemies seek Asylum if they want peace don't just give it to them escort them to a place of security if the enemy wants peace Asylum has caught them to place of secure today the most merciful Army General maximum will tell his soldiers that let the enemy go yeah Allah says don't just let them go escort them to place of security so whenever these verses are there of killing including the verse of Surah and far chapter 8 verse number 60 when they say that prepare your Steed and be prepared attack the enemy the next person but if the enemy is inclined towards peace you give it to them so almost all the verses you talk about fighting after that it says that if they want peace peace is better now regarding your question what about the vessel of Surah chapter 5 verse 32 surrender chapter 4 verse 40 that if anyone kills any human being it's killed the whole of humanity this is the basic rule of Islam that if anyone kills any human being whether it be a Muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for creating Mischief in the land spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone says then human being it is as though he has shared role of humanity now if you read if you read bhagavad-gita number 50. it says Christian tells Arjun to do Jihad strive if you read Mahabharata Mahabharata talks about thousands of verses of fighting thousands of verses many number of 10 more than what the Quran speaks it talks about a feud a fight between the pandas and the cows the five brothers pandas and hundred Brothers fight and bhagavad-gita is a part of Mahabharata 18 chapters in which Shri Krishna Lord he gives advice to Arjun Arjun says Arjun says in bhagavad-gita chapter number one verse 40 to 46 that I would prefer getting killed unarmed rather than fighting my cousins how can I fight my cousins the coward was my cousins I would prefer getting killed Annam rather than fight immediately Lord Krishna you know what does he say in chapter number two verse number two and three says that how could such impure thought come in your mind it is sinful how could you become so important How could a heart become so weak so Lord Christian says first thoughts are important they are sinful it will prevent you from going to the Heavenly planets going to Jannah after that bhagavad-gita chapter number two verse number 31 33 says he says Lord Christian he says to Arjun that it is the duty of ashatriya to fight if he does not fight he shall not go to heaven and if you do not fight you are doing a sin so if you analyze in bhagavad-gita Krishna says that you have to fight imagine if I take Versa of bhagavad-gita and say that Lord Krishna tells Arjun that you have to kill your relatives if I quote out of context it'll be devilish but in context it is Lord Krishna says that if you have to fight against falsehood for the truth you can fight against anyone even if you're like this so now in context it makes sense that if we have to fight for justice even if it be against your real sins there's no problem so that is the message of bhagavad-gita and Mahabharata fighting truth again falsehood the moment I tell a Hindu about mahabharatan bhagavad-gita he has the knowledge he says is a fight between truth and falsehood that is the same thing was mentioned in the Quran better and furthermore many people say oh this Quran talking about Jihadi if you do Jihad if you die you go to Jannah many critics including anushuli code and they quote the even Hadith bukhari volume number four in the book of jihad chapter number two Hadith 46 it says that the mujahid is a person who strives in the way of Allah and Allah alone knows whose strife and further a prophet said that if dies in the battlefield he'll shall go to Jannah he'll get Paradise but if he returns back if he does not die he will turn back with the booty of War this Hadith and server was the Quran are quoted by the critics of Islam I wonder how could the Hindu critics quote these things haven't read the bhagavad-gita haven't they read the Mahabharata even Shri Krishna he mentioned bhagavad-gita chapter number two verse number 37 o Arjun o son of kunti rise up and fight even if you're killed no problem you will go to heaven and if you return back successfully you will get the good Riches of this Earthly world same thing as hadees so when Christian says to Arjun that fight if you're killed no problem you will go to heaven if you return back successful you will get the riches of the world that is the same thing what he says what the Quran says so therefore you should understand each other better by reading the scripture so Islam allows fighting as a last resort in self-defense or to fight against operation otherwise no and Jihad means to strive to struggle now come into your second question which is more important which is more important following the rules of the country of following the mass of the Deen it is that you asking me who do I belong to First do I belong to my father or my mother first brother as far as following the rule of the country and following the rules of Deen almighty God is concerned almighty God is our creator he is more Superior to us following the rules of Deen is more important for us than any other rule laid down by father or mother or any country but but I am an Indian I know there is not a single law in the Indian constitution which prevents any Muslim in India to follow Islam [Applause] in fact India is one of the few countries which is mentioned in the Constitution that it is the right it's the birthright of every citizen of India to preach practice his religion that's what I'm doing there is not a single law in India which prevents me from doing something which is first or compel me for doing something which is Haram there is not a single law in the Indian constitution which prevents me from becoming a good Muslim therefore as far as I'm concerned I am a very practicing Muslim alhamdulillah and also practicing Indian and is by definition by geographical definition an Indian geographically is called Hindu so if Hindu means a geographical definition I am a Hindu living in India and I'm a practicing Muslim foreign [Applause]"
