  "transcript": "the importance of Muharram and fasting on the day of ashora our beloved Prophet Muhammad it's mentioned inside buhari oil number four Hadith number 3197 that our beloved Prophet Muslim said that the year if 12 months and of them four are sacred three ah in consecutive numbers that is and the fourth is Raja a similar message is given by Allah in the Glorious Quran in Surah chapter number nine verse number 36 where Allah says that the number of months in the sight of Allah are 12 in a year so you ordained the creation of the Earth and from them for a secret and but naturally four second months are mentioned inside as I mentioned earlier that is so do not do wrong doings in them that in these four sacred months do not do any wrongdoings that means if a person does any sin the sins are more Graver in these four second months they are more heavier in these four second months and the Good Deeds that you do they will be more rewarding so the Muslims should see to it that during the four sacred months they should be more careful they should obtain from all the sins especially the major sins as well as almost all the minor sins too and we should do as many Good Deeds as possible time will not permit me to repeat all the good deeds and I've done that earlier when I spoke about the virtues of dulija I had mentioned 45 Good Deeds the Farah is Etc it is further mentioned inside Muslim world number three Hadith number two seven five five beloved Prophet Muslim said that the most important fast after the fast of Ramadan is in the month of Allah in maharan referring to the day of Ashura and the most important Salah after the first Salah is the night prayers that is underwater it further mentioned inside Muslim volume number three Hadith number 2746 a beloved Prophet Muslim said that fasting on the day of Ashura the tenth of moram I will pray to Allah that may he forgive the sins of the previous year that means if a person farts on the 10th of Muharram on the day of Ashura all your films of the previous year will be washed away but natural these sins are referring to the minor Sins not counting the major sins that means the most important fast after the for the first of Ramadan is the fasting of ashora but Scholars differ Focus most other Focus says that the most important fast is the fasting on the day of arafah because on the day of arafah besides the sins of the previous years being washed away even the sins of the future of one year is washed away that means if you fast on the day of arafah two years of sins are washed away the previous year and the following that is the next year if you fast on the day of Ashura only one year that the previous fear of sins are washed away therefore I'll defer most of them say the most important fast is arafah few say the most important fast is fasting on the day of Ashura but unanimously all agree that these two fast fasting on the day of arafah and fasting on the day of Ashura are the most too importantly fast after the fund the first performance it is mentioned inside bukhari world number five Hadith number 3943 that pass may Allah repeat with him he narrates that when the prophet reached Madina he found that the Jews were fasting on the 10th of Marram and he asked them that why do you fast during this day they said this day Allah gave Victory to Moses and the people of an Israel Over Faron so the prophet replied that we Muslims are more closer to Musa Salaam than the Jews and he ordered the Muslims to fast on Ashura the tenth of Muharram it further mentioned in say bukhari volume number three Hadith number two zero zero six with him he narrates that he never found the prophet wanting to fast on any day more than the day of Ashura and this month that is the month of Ramadan it is further mentioned in Abu dhab volume number three Hadith number 2445 that the prophet peace be upon him the people approached him and they told him that the Jews and the Christians they fast on the 10th of moram on the ref Ashura so the prophet said next year we will also fast on the ninth of tomorrow it's mentioned in mustad Ahmed world number two Hadith number 2154 that the prophet said do the opposite of what the Jews and the Christians do besides fasting on the 10th of moram also fast on the 9th or the 11th of Muharram because of this when you read the shalah of say buhari hafez he says that fasting of Ashura is of three levels the lowest is fasting on the 10th of moram the day of ashora the second is fasting on the ninth and the tenth of and the highest is fasting on 9th 10th and 11th of modern that means we Muslims we learn from all the hadees that moram is the month of Allah it's one of the four sacred months in the sacred month we should do good deeds abstain from doing bad Deeds and the best is that we fast on all three days the ninth the 10th and the 11th of Mormon that is the best if you cannot fast for three days at least fast for two days ninth and 10th of modern or tenth eleventh of  if you cannot fast for two days and you can only do for one day then the list of the least you can do is fast at least on the 10th of modern on the day of Ashura this was the short message on the importance of maharam and fasting on the river"
