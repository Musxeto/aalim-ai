  "title": "Are the Genetic Diseases a Realisation of the Original Sin Concept - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "so any sisters have any questions while conversing with one of the Christians regarding the scientific facts in the Quran and the Bible They Came Upon that since Christianity believes in the original sin they said that in the Bible is mentioned that if a person does something evil the seventh generation is going to Bear the burden and now there are diseases which are there like diabetes and all which are genetically spread so this established their a concept of original sin how to refute this the sister has put forth an argument that one of a Christian friends arguing and saying that there mentioned in the Bible that if you do a sin Seven Generations you'll get the sin and today is established that if you have diabetes you know it is genetic so maybe the great great great grandfather or grandmother may have done a sin so that's the punishment sister if you read the Bible I don't know which verse you're quoting about seven generations Etc but the Bible clearly mentions in the Book of Ezekiel chapter number 18 verse number 20 the soul that sinth shall die the father shall not be the inity of the son neither shall the son bear the iniquity of the Father the Son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the of the son the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him and the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him but if the wicked turns away and comes to the part he shall not die so the Bible says the soul that sin shall die the person who does a sin shall be responsible same thing as the Quran Quran says no bearer of Burden can bear the burdens of others no bearer of Burden can bear the burden of others same thing the Bible says the soul that sin shall die the father shall not beity of the son neither shall the son bear the iniquity of the father means the son shall not bear iniquity means the sin the son shall not bear the sin of the father neither shall the father bear the sin of the son the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him and the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him but if the wicked turns means if the wicked repents he shall not not die that means he will get his reward So based on this verse of the Bible I don't know which verse you're quoting that seven generation anyway this I'm giving with reference fine so according to the Bible there's nothing like original sin it is the concept of church not of the Bible it's not the concept of the Bible imagine as most of the Christian not the Bible the Christians say that Adam and Eve m be pleased with them they was as not to eat the forbidden fruit and Eve tempted Adam to eat the forbidden fruit so Eve is a great Sinner and Adam ate the fruit so did Adam peace be upon him ask me before eating if you'd have asked me and if God held me responsible fine logical if Adam he's my great great great great very very very first great grandfather he didn't ask me imagine if my father leave my grand father if he commits a murder Can the police catch me no original sin so in Christian countries if the father commits a murder the son should be put to Gallows right or wrong right or wrong right sun should be put is there any country so the country that professes Christianity and follows the Christian law the sun should be put to The Gallows and nowhere do you find this do you find in any law it's illogical so if my father committed a mistake he should be responsible fine if I help my father in committing the murder then the police catches me it's fine so my great great first great grandfather Adam peace be upon him he ate the apple he didn't ask me if he has asked your friend then your friend is responsible surely you didn't ask me and then going ahead to prove about disease that's why she says that here if he Analyze That diabetes is genetic yes I'm a medical doctor I've given up my practice and now I speak about the truth spreading the message of Truth we do know medically that diabetes is genetic it comes in the genes so that's the reason she says that you know we have come to know that so and so person did a sin and therefore it's come first of all it's not proofed from the Bible at all and this thing which is genetic so that means we have to agree in everything we know that many of the people who are Smugglers who are rapist rapists their children intellig so do you mean to say because the father raped the father smuggled therefore the child became intelligent is it so is it so no if great grandfather does a sin he gets punished if the great grandfather does a good thing even he should get a reward right so we find that many of times the father is absolutely inhuman merciless yet the children are very good so surely it is different medical disease and one more thing in Islam whether a person has diabetes or not it makes no difference for him to go to Jenna or not a person having diabetes can go to heaven can go to hell also a person not having diabetes can go to hell can go to heaven the criteria to go to heaven is not diabetes this world is a test Allah says in the Quran in chapter number 67 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you good in Deeds so this is a test and Allah is testing Allah says in the Quran we test some people with fear some with Hunger some with loss of life some with disease some with wealth Allah says in the Quran this is the test now the test may come either genetically without genetic AIDS there's a new research saying that homosexuality is genetic so is homosexual genetic who's to blame God not us homosexuality the sin then it was found out that the research was false and the person who propounded that Theory himself was homosexual see homosexuality is a sin diabetes is not a sin so if homosexuality is proved to be genetic then there's a problem right because homosexuality is a sin diabetes is not a sin telling lies cannot be genetic if it proed robbing is genetic then it came in my genes who's to blame my father none of the sins are genetic disease is not a sin disease is one type of test Allah is testing you God is testing you that now you have a disease yet do you believe in God or not so what is this diabetes what is this God all nonsense non Allah is testing you with difficulties with reward with punishment testing you and depending upon the test he gives you marks and on the day of judgment he Malik he's the master of day of judgment depending on that he'll put whether he pass or fail heaven or hell hope the answer the question s"
