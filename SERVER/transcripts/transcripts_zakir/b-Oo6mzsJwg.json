  "transcript": "the most Grievous amongst the errors in the first category that is errors committed regarding the obligatory rules and regulations of fasting is the most common is that Muslims many of times they don't do the Nia for fasting intention is very important without Nia without intention the fasting is not accepted so making intention is obligatory the second error is that many many times Muslims even after the fud aan has started yet they continue eating and they think that the end of suur time is only at the end of the F aan in fact the moment the FJ aan starts the moment the beginning of dawn starts the time ends so this is error which normally nullifies or invalidates the fast"
