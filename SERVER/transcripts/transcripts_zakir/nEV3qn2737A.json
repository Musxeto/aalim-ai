  "transcript": "the first real issue and the question that I need to pose to you is can you enunciate or list the things which invalidate the actions which invalidate the faster Ramadan alhamdulillah as far as acts which invalid the fast they are listed in the Quran as well as in the Hadith Allah says in the Quran chapter number two verse number 187 associate with them that's your wife and take whatever Allah gives you from them that is The Offspring and eat and drink till the white thread of dawn appears different than the black thread and then you fast and complete your fast till the Nightfall so here we get the three categories eating drinking and sexual intercourse and there are various other categories which are prohibited broadly if you list the things that break the fast there are approximately 10 different things which break the fast and you can categorize them into two categories the first category is that which breaks the fast when we take it inside the body in them there are four things the first is eating and drinking second is anything that falls in the same category as eating or drinking third is taking medicines Opals or injections which are in the form of nourishment or somewhat similar to eating and drinking including blood transfusion the fourth is somewhat similar to kidney dialysis where the blood is taken out it's purified and some nutrients are put into it and put back the second category that which comes out from the body there are six things in them number one is sexual intercourse number two is masturbation number three is menstruation number four is postnatal bleeding number five is deliberate vomiting and number six is letting our blood somewhat similar to cupping or something similar to that so in all there are 10 things which invalidate the fast"
