  "transcript": "my name is JP kharge my question is short relating to the earlier question pertaining to the non-wage food what are the effects on the mind of the human being we're asking the question what are the effects on the mind of a human being by having non-veg food yes and there are various researchers done scientifically it's healthy effect on the body good muscles good body healthy can be longer many you can see my debate on is non-veg food permitted a private for a human being as far as the question I think you may be trying to hint that there's a research which says that what food you have have an effect on your behavior so if you eat animals then you start behaving like animals is that what you mean no no I am asking what are the effects on the thinking of the human being that's what I'm trying to tell you that there's one research which says that if you eat animals you start behaving like animals means the effective of animals there is a research which says what you eat as an effect on a behavior so that's the reason we Muslims we are allowed to eat only peace loving animals like cow goat sheep because we are peace loving human beings we are not permitted to have the ferocious animals like tiger lion leopard because we don't want to be violent so even if I agree with this research I would like to say that Muslims are peace loving as far as health is concerned it is very healthy if a person has a medical problem having certain non-veg food is problematic like that even veg food is problematic the food the food that causes maximum death in the world it is alcohol brother alcohol is veg or non veg yes veg pattern I have called it veg or non veg I am preparing vegetarian food alcohol is veg or non-veg brother alcohol is vegetarian or non-vegetarian food veg food the maximum death in the world by any food it is by vegetarian food alcohol number two death s is because of smoking smoking tobacco veg or non-veg veg vegetarian correct so maximum that's that take place in the world is because of alcohol number one vegetarian tobacco number two vegetarian so there's no problem in vegetarian food in the world than non-veg food if you have certain problems medical there may be certain non veg food which may be harmful but more harm in the world is because of vegetarian food so what is harmful Quran safe band Quran doesn't Bend all vegetables Quran bans alcohol so remember chapter 5 verse number 90 and even smoking chapter 2 195 because it is slow poisoning so whatever is wrong should be banned Quran does not Bend all vegetables for more details refer to my video cassette is non-veg food permitted or prohibited for a human being hope that answers the question"
