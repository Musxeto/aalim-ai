  "transcript": "many people they translate the Arabic word Salah into prayer prayer is not the appropriate translation of the Arabic word Salah because to pray means to besiege to ask for help like how you besiege like how you ask for help in a court of law Dua is a supplication and in Salah besides asking help from Allah subhana wa ta'ala we praise subhana wa taala we glorify him we are receiving guidance from him therefore Salah is simultaneously called as a programming towards righteousness or conditioning or a Layman's terminology as brainwashing but if you're going for Salah and if anyone asks you that where are you going and if you tell them that I am going for brainwashing or for conditioning or for programming it it may sound a bit odd therefore I would not have any problem if anyone uses the English word prayer for the Arabic word Salah but I would like to remind them that it's not the appropriate translation and the moment you hear the word programming you start thinking of a computer if you allow me to call the human being a machine I would call it the most complicated machine on the face of the Earth much more advanced advanced than the most advanced computer and we human beings we are the the best of the Creations Allah subh say in number 95 verse number four well we have created human beings in the best of forms in the best of moldes and the psychologist they tell us that the mind it is not directly under our control but our body it is directly under our control if I want to raise my hand I can raise my hand if I want to take a step forward I can take a step forward but the mind it is not directly under our control our body is directly under our control that's the reason many of us might have experienced that while we are offering Salah our mind wonders and for example if a student ask after appearing for an examination he offers Salah he will start reviewing the examination paper in his mind he may think that question number two I should have written this instead of writing that if a businessman offer Salah he may think that how much profit have I made how much Goods have I sold if a housewife is offering Salah she may think that what should I cook for my husband should I cook biryani or should I cook p if a teenager is offering Salah he may think that what should I text to my friend when should I call my friend therefore there are high chances that while we are offering Salah our mind will wander and why does our mind wander because our mind is empty and a human mind it cannot remain empty that's the reason it wanders and we know the basic things that you decide in Salah Sur F and other short Surah of the Glorious Quran it's mechanical and the Muslims know it so well that even if you wake up a Muslim from the middle of his sleep and ask him to recite Surah faat he'll be able to R 100 miles per houran it's mechanical because only a minute portion of your mind is used in recalling it this is the case with Surah fat and other short Surah of the Glorious Quran"
