  "transcript": "my name is fahad i work as a computer programmer my question is related to islamic banking what is meant when a certain islamic bank says that they're going to offer a loan at an x percent apr is that not interest that's a question that he wants to know about islamic banking islamic banks offer loan and they add a x percent they call it service or whatever is it not interest see basically interest is haram in islam the knowledge in eight different places of allah allah clearly says in surah chapter number 2 verse number 278 to 79 that if you give up not your demands for interest take notice of a war from allah and his result interest is haram now as far as banking is concerned as you mentioned many islam banks which give loan point to be noted that most of the islamic banks that are there i don't know if any islamic bank which is 100 islamic i don't know maybe i don't know in fact one of my interested islamic banking but there are many which are masha'allah quite a lot islamic there are many which are frauds also fine only namesake islamic what we have to note that we are saying if we can check up checkup if you analyze there is islamic system of musharika prophet allah sharing which is the best safest musharika means we become a partner in it now other aspects are there mudariba is there that is cost plus in cost plus many a time people falter and many a time it's nothing but catching the nose in long cut you know you say that it is nothing but trying to make a gimmick so we have to analyze and many fatwas are given on this is allowed that is the lord which many which i don't agree with also so when islamic bank comes we have to scrutinize who is on the sharia board just by name please don't go that's not important what they do etc so many of the islamic banks i wouldn't call them islamic they'll be very small percentage islamic now in the islamic bank most of them do mudaraba in mudaraba there's a problem cost plus which comes sometimes it's possible hijara is there that is higher purchases there which is islamic musharika is safe safe means if they're following islamic precipice now in other parts we have to check up and what we analyze that most of the banks they falter and because they compete with the normal conventional bank they keep the same interest and the name is different namka faraka label is different but the same so we have to be careful while taking loan but as a layman if suppose you think it islamic and you take it and if they are doing something wrong out of ignorance you have gone so the blame will come on them not on you if you know the aram and then you go then the blame will come on you so it is owners of the people running islamic banks to check up whether they're following what happened there are many fatwas in this and fatwa shopping is very easy you know what fatwa you want to get so they go and when gg gate or pakistan or india so they take fatwa which is convenient for them and then they sanction it so you have to be careful while islamic banking is there not that it's not possible possible very difficult there are some banks i know which are mashallah good yet not hundred percent and they know it because unless you don't have the central system of islamic you can't be 100 so the thing that there are many islamic banks coming up we have to check up whether islamic or if it's there but there is a system which you can do so if you check up the functioning how they do and then you have to decide with the right or wrong hope you"
