  "title": "Why donâ€™t the Muslims Follow the Teachings of Jesus (pbuh)? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "in the surah al-imran verse 50 it says to follow the teachings of jesus why doesn't anyone do this can you mention your name sister please chasity sisters ask the question that the quran says in surah imran chapter 3 verse number 50 that we have to follow the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him and there are many verses which say that we have to believe in jesus peace be upon him sister let me clarify that islam is the only non-christian faith which makes it an article of faith to believe in jesus christ peace be upon him no muslim is a muslim if he does not believe in jesus christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of allah we believe that he was the messiah translated to christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male intervention which many modern christians today do not believe we believe that he gave life to the dead with god's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers has got permission the christian and the muslim sister we are going together but one may ask where is the parting of ways the parting of ways is sister that many christians they say that jesus christ peace be upon him he claimed divinity he said that he was almighty god if you read the bible sister there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that i am god always says worship me if any christian can point out a single unequivocal statement a single unambiguous statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that i am god or where he says worship me i am ready to accept christianity today i am not speaking on behalf of my other muslim brothers in fact if you read the bible it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 28 jesus christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than i gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 i cast out devil with the spirit of god gospel of luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 i cast out devil with the finger of god gospel of john chapter number five verse number 30 i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will or the will of almighty god [Applause] but the will of my father anyone who says that i followed not my will but the will of almighty god he's a muslim jesus christ peace be upon you as a muslim he never claimed divinity and it's clearly mentioned in the book of acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 eman of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles and signs which god did by him and your witness to it jesus of nazareth a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles which god did and you witness to it so we believe that jesus christ peace be upon him he was one of the mightiest messengers of god but he was not god so here we differ as far as the teachings are concerned your basic question was that quran says we have to follow the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him when jesus christ peace be upon him came in this world he was only sent for the jews only for an israel the quran says clearly in surah chapter number 61 verse number 6 that jesus christ peace be upon him came as a messenger to the bani israel it's mentioned solar imran chapter number 3 verse 49 that jesus christ peace be upon him was sent only for the israel it's mentioned in the gospel of matthew chapter number 10 verse number 5 and 6 jesus christ peace be upon him he says go not into the way of the gentiles who are the gentiles non-jews hindus muslims going not in the way of the gentiles entering not into the city of the samaritans but rather go to the house of the lordship of israel and a similar message repeated in the gospel of matthew chapter number 15 verse number 24 he says to the apostles that i have been sent not but to the lost ship of the house of israel so jesus christ peace be upon him was sent only for the bani israel and his message was supposed to be followed only for a particular time period that's what the bible says that's what the quran says in spite of this sister if you read the bible what jesus christ peace be upon him says if you analyze it's mentioned in the gospel of luke that jesus christ peace be upon him he was circumcised on the eighth day we muslim masha'allah we are circumcised majority of the christians aren't circumcised so if you say that following the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him makes you a christian then i like to say that i am more christian than the christian themselves it is mentioned in the bible in the book of ephesians chapter number 5 verse number 18 that be not drunk it's mentioned book of proverbs chapter number 20 verse number one that wine is a mocker we muslims we don't drink alcohol quran says in surah maidah chapter number five of samaranti i'll call it we don't touch it we don't touch it as a whole the muslims are the biggest community of teetotalers so according to the bible you should not have alcohol it's mentioned in the bible that you should not have pork in several places it's mentioned in the book of leviticus chapter number 11 verse number seven and eight it's mentioned the book of deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number eight in the book of isaiah chapter number 65 verse number two to five no less than five places that you should not have poke we muslims we don't have poke but majority of the christians they are poor so if christian means a person who follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him we muslims are more christian than the christians themselves i can go on and on when jesus christ peace be upon him was asked that which is the first of the commandments he mentioned in the gospel of mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 he said so it's a hebrew quotation which means euro israel the lord our god is one lord we muslim masha allah we believe in none but one god majority of the christian they believe in trinity father son and holy ghost so if you say christian means the person who follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him the muslims are more christian than the christian themselves and you can refer to my video cassette similarities between islam and christianity which will give you more details that we are following more of the bibles the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him than the christians themselves hope that answers the question sister [Applause] you"
