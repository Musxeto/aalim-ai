  "title": "Why is a Man allowed to Marry 4 Wives in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Lakshmi I'm a journalist now the second question is Muslim men are allowed to marry four or five times I think and they don't require their wife's permission you know the first wife's permission to marry I mean correct me if I'm wrong to marry more number of times so I actually don't see any logic in this because I believe it's one man one woman that's the institution of marriage so please clarify thank you now come into your second question in Islam men marry four times five times and they don't ask permission from the first five why as far as polyginny is concerned a man having more than one wife Islam is the only religion and Quran is the only religious scripture on the face of the Earth which says marry only one there is no religious scripture besides the Quran I'm a student of comparative religion which says marry only one there's no verse in the Bible no verse in the bhagavad-gita no was in the Veda we still married only one except the Quran if you read the Hindu scriptures in ramayana the father of sriram how many wife did he have how many wives more than one more than one three wives fine Shri Krishna according to Mahabharata Unlimited not unlimited you don't know a scripture well no do they have four wives no I have no idea not four not hundred not thousand sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives yeah sixteen thousand one hundred so why can't we Muslim therefore what's the problem Krishna can have 16 108 wise why can't we have four further if you read the Vishnu purana chapter number 24 verse number one it says a Brahman can have up to four wives if you read the Jewish Scriptures it gives you permission to have as many wives as you wish if you're the Christian Bible it gives you permission to as many wives As You Wish if you read the Bible Abraham had three wives Solomon how many wives he had 700 wives it is later on the church has put a band that Christians should marry only one not the Bible it is the Jewish Community married more than one wife it was in 1950 that Chief Rabbi passed a cyanoid that Jew should marry only one so it is the rabbi not the Jewish scriptures and according to Hindu scriptures you can marry as many as you wish it is the Indian government in 1954 passed a law called the Hindu special Marriage Act Hindu special Marriage Act which says Hindu should marry only one it is not the religious scripture it is not bhagavad-gita it is not ramayana it is not Mahabharata it is not Veda it is the Indian penal code the Indian government which has passed a law in 1954 that Hindus should marry only one but according to the statistics of the status of the woman in Islam if you read the government documents on page number 667 it says that Muslims do polygamist marriages you know what is the percentage in India 4.3 percent how much in India 4.3 percent of the Muslim men do polygamous marriages a statistic between 1951 to 1961 Hindus how many 5.06 point seven percent more than the Muslims in India according to the Indian government even though it is prohibited according to Indian law yet they do more polygamous marriages than the than the Muslims why now let's analyze what does the Quran say Quran says in Surah chapter 4 verse number three married women of a choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one this statement marry only one is only given in the Quran and no other is a scripture it says married woman of a choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one so if you want to marry more than one woman one of the criteria of the Quran is you should do justice if you can't do justice you should marry only one now what are the reasons logical reasons a person can think that why has Islam permitted certain men to have more than one wife many non-muslims think it is further it is compulsory for a Muslim man to have more than one woman to have more than one wife it's not compulsory it's optional it's not further it's not compulsory how many Muslim men do you know who have more than one wife how many do you know sister how many do you know a few how many a few again you mean one two three how many yeah at least about three about three have you heard of Dharmendra yeah how many wife yes two Muslim or non-muslim non-muslim non-muslim your previous chief minister what's the name yes Hindu or Muslim Hindu fine now these are famous personalities fine how many famous personalities you know in India who have got more than one wife but three you know maybe locality fine yeah local maybe friend you know neighborhood maybe your colleague in India there are more non-muslims having more than one wife than the Muslims now let us understand what are the logical reasons come back to logic now no by Nature if you ask any medical doctor he will tell you male and female are born in equal proportion girls and boys are born equal proportion but any medical doctor any pediatrician any children doctor will tell you that the female sex the female child is stronger than the male child that's the reason there are more deaths in the male children as compared to female children so in children's age itself the female children are much more than the male children as life grows on there are people dying due to accidents due to alcoholism due to war there are more males dying as compared to females today if you analyze in the world there are more females in the world as compared to males there are few third world countries like India where the male population is more than the female population and do you know why the reason is because of female feticide and female infanticide according to an article a program which came on BBC by the name let or Die the program of assignment there was a British reporter by the name of Emily beckoning she comes to India and she says that every year in India more than one million fetuses are being aborted after the identified that they're females she says more than 3 000 every day you multiply more than a million every year according to the Tamil Nadu government Hospital report she gives the statistics out of 10 female born alive do you know how many are put to death four sister did you know that Tamil Nadu your state your beloved State according to the government statistics out of 10 females born alive in the government Hospital four are put to death there are Billboards put in Rajasthan and here which says that spend 500 rupees and save 500 000 rupees you know what does it indicate spend 500 rupees do ultrasonography do have new sentences and fight the child you're carrying the female a water and say five lakh rupees 500 000 rupees maybe a couple of hundred thousand upbringing and the remaining hundred thousand in Dowry if you stop this evil practice in India a Beloved Country stop the female infanticide stop the female feet aside even in India the population of female will be more than the male population if you see the rest of the world if you see New York alone there are 1 million females more than males in USA alone there are 7.8 million females more than males in UK alone there are four million females more than males in Germany alone there are 5 million females more than males and Russia alone there are 9 million females more than males and God Alone knows how many millions of females are more than males throughout the world suppose I agree with your philosophy sister who said one man one woman if I agree with you sister with your philosophy one man one woman and suppose my sister happens to be in America are your sister happens to live in America and suppose the market is saturated one man one woman saturated yet there will be 7.8 million females who will not find life partners one man one woman now the option for these 7.8 million females is either marry a man who already has a wife or become public property public property such a harsh word sister it is the most sophisticated word I can use I cannot use a more sophisticated word than public property according to the studies of America do you know on an average a man before he settles down with a wife he has eight different sexual partners do you know that on average eight some have one some may have 10 some may have 28. sexual partners before he settles down with one so the only option remaining so if my sister happens to live in America or if your sister happened to live in America and the option is given to her and suppose the market is saturated every man has found a woman for himself and unfortunately my sister or if your sister happens to be one of the women who has not found a life partner the only option for them is either marry a man who already has a wife or become public property any modest woman would opt for the first sister what do you have for your sister marrying a man already as a wife or become public property my sister is too young to be married when she grows up and if she happens to go to America or if you happen to be in America her choice what would you prefer for her you're the elder sister would you prefer becoming public property or marry a man who already has a wife and get equal rights in Islam if you have a second wife you give equal rights in America the public property has got no rights she's degraded she's Dishonored in Islam she has equal right she gets honor what would you prefer for a younger sister when she grows up sometimes it's difficult to speak the third sister especially in front of such a large audience anyway I've got the answer sister thank you and your silence speak for that so that the reason in Islam sister men have been allowed to marry more than one wife is to protect the woman not to degrade her regarding a question is it compulsory that the husband should take the permission of the wife it's not compulsory because if she wants to protect if that man wants to protect and the woman a normal woman I agree with you sister no woman under normal circumstances would like to share the husband you have to agree this is human nature but if the woman is a good Muslim is a good Muslim woman what she says let us more loss take place to prevent a big loss she will say I know sharing my husband is a lot for me but I would prefer letting a small loss take place for me to prevent my sister becoming public property she's a good human being so she would surely give permission to the husband to marry a second woman if she is a good Muslim woman but taking permission is not further it is preferable but at least informing is a requirement so that he does Justice between the two wives hope to answer the question sister thank you [Applause]"
