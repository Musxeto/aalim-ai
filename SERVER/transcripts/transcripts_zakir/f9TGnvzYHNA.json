  "transcript": "in the field of hydrology we learn about the watt cycle in the school the water cycle what we learn in the school was first described in 1580 by sir bernard palace and we learned in school that the water evaporates from the ocean it forms into clouds the clouds move they rise they condense and the water falls and flows back into the ocean and the water cycle is completed previously in seventh century bc thales of militis he said it was the spray of the ocean which was picked up by the winds which fell into the interior as rain people did not know how did the rain fall in seventh century theories of baletis he said it was the spirit of the ocean which was picked up by the winds and fell into the interior as rain people did not know from where did the underground water come and people believed even in the time of plateau that when the water fell this water flowed by a secret passage into the ocean called as tartarus people did not know from where did the underground water come so they thought it was the pressure of the winds on the water which forced the water into the interior and even till as late as 17th century people and great thinkers like descartes believed in this theory even in 19th century people believed in the aristotle's theory that the water evaporated from the earth and cooled in mountain caverns which fed the springs today we know that the underground water is due to the seepage of the rainwater and allah says in the quran from the sky and causes it to soak in the ground causes springs in the ground and then causes sown field of various colors to grow quran mentions in surah chapter number 30 verse number 24 it is allah who sent his own water from the sky and then gives life to the earth after it is dead the quran says chapter number 23 verse number 18. it is we would send down water from the sky and we can store it and we can even drain it easily the quran says in surah chapter number 15 verse number 22 that we cause fican dating winds the arabic word used is zlavaki which is the plural of lakkah coming from lucky which means to fakundate which means to impregnate we cause secundating winds we cause winds to impregnate and then the water falls from the sky and today we know that science tells us that the pollen is picked up by the winds and it impregnates the clouds and the second type is the clouds they join together then there's lightning and waterfalls from the sky a similar message of hydrology and watercycle is mentioned in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 43. it is allah who makes the clouds to move gently and then causes them to join then make them into a heap and then water emerges from the sky quran says chapter number 30 verse number 48. that it is allah subhanahu wa ta'ala who makes the clouds to rise then makes it into fragments and then water falls from the sky the quran speaks about the what cycle in great detail the quran says in surah tariq chapter number 86 verse number 11. which means by the capacity of the heavens to return besides the sky or the heavens acting like a protected ceiling besides reflecting all the unwanted dangerous rays back into the space it also returns back the water evaporation what the water happened from the ocean the sky it sends it back onto the earth and the quran says in surah nur chapter 24 verse 43 that we cause water to fall from the sky from mountains of clouds and when we're traveling the aeroplane aeroplane wasn't there for 10 years back and when we look at the clouds below we see it is like mountain of wool the clouds they appear as mountains imagine quran mentioned that 14 years ago quran describes the water cycle in great detail in several verses besides the several verses are quoted there are many other umpteen number of verses which speak about the what cycle it's mentioned in surah araf chapter number seven verse number 57 in surah chapter number 13 verse number 17 in surah furqan chapter number 25 verse 14 and 49 in surah chapter number 35 verse number nine in surah yaseen chapter number 36 verse number 34 it's mentioned surah jasya chapter number 45 verse number five in foreign chapter number fifty verse number nine nine ten it's mentioned in surah chapter number 56 verse number 67 to 17. it's mentioned suramul chapter number 16 verse number 30 you can go on only quoting the several verses of the quran which speak about the water cycle you can only give a talk on hydrology and what cycle in the quran you"
