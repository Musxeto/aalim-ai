  "title": "Is Repentance Accepted If Hadd Punishment is not Implemented on the Person? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya next question is is repentance accepted if the had punishment is not carried out on a person as I menion earlier that a person should realize that the Bounty of Allah subhana wa ta'ala his mercy and Grace is in abundance and if you commit a crime if it involves some other people people then you have to restore their property back like if you have Rob then give the wealth back if you're taking something from someone give it back but if it is between you and Allah subhana tala a person should never be dissatisfied he should never think that Allah will not forgive whatever his sin he may commit let it be the biggest sin if he repents sincerely as we mentioned the last episode Allah will forgive any sin but if he has done some harm to some other human being then he should try and undo it and Allah says the Quran in Surah fan chapter number 25 verse number 68 and as for those who do not invoke with Allah any other God or do not take any life of any other human being unless for a just cause or do not indulge in adultery and for those who do it for them there is a punishment and Allah continues in the next verses in Sur fan 25 verse number 17 as for those who believe and repent and do righteous Deeds Allah subhana wa ta'ala will change the evil thing that he has done the evil deed he has done to good so that's the mercy of Allah subhana tala so as far as the had penalty is concerned if it is a person who himself knows that he has done a sin for example if he has in adultery so he should repent for Allah subhana tala and ask for forgiveness it is between him and Allah subhana tala and it's not required that he should tell to the others because if it's told then the punishment would be there and as I mentioned earlier about the case of the woman from joha who told Allah's messenger she had an adultery and she was pregnant and the prophet said that come later on and she came later on after she gave birth to a child and she was Throne to death the other example I gave of ma Malik Hadith of say Muslim volume number three Hadith number 4205 which m may Allah pleas with him he tells Allah's messenger that oh Prophet Purify Me Allah messenger says go and and ask forgiveness he again comes back and says oh Allah messenger please Purify Me says go away Allah messenger please Purify Me Again goes away fourth time he come and he say what is your purify from what then he say adultery then Allah messenger asked him that are you mad are you drunk and then after that verifying that he was not mad he was not drunk he had to pass pass the penalty but Allah messenger said that both these two people they had asked for forgiveness and they repented so may Allah accept the repentance but further it's mentioned Hadi of M number two book of punishment Hadith number 12 the Beloved Prophet mmam said that stop committing sins major sins Etc and if you commit then you have to conceal it and ask for forgiveness from Allah subhana you repent and if you disclose it then we will have to pass the H penalty that means if the sin is known to the sulan or the ruler or to a or to a judge then it becomes compulsory for that person that he has to pass the penalty that is storing to death if you had an adultery or any other sin which requires the death penalty but if it's not known and the person who has sinned if it involves some other human being he should try and undo it if it is involvement between him and Allah subhana wa tala then he should ask for forgiveness and ask for repentance and it should conceal it's not a requirement that the punishment of had should be given to the person for repentance but we have the examples of ma Malik who repented and did not mind being killed for sake of Allah subhana Allah forgiv them and the prophet said that even if you distribute it in the people of Madina it would be sufficient for them forgiveness but as a general rule it's not a requirement that you have to pass the penalty for repentance if you exposed then the penalty is there if you Expos conceal it and ask for forgiveness from Allah subhana tala and you repent and inshallah Allah will forgive you"
