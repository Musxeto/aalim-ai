  "title": "Scientific Proof for an Atheist on Existence of God - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "engineer student i would like to ask you a question that how can you prove to an atheist scientifically the existence of god the brothers pose the question how can you scientifically prove the existence of god almighty the existence of allah to especially to an atheist who does not believe in god the first thing i will do is that i will congratulate that atheist i congratulate him you know why if you look around us he's a hindu because father is hindu he's a christian because father is a christian some muslims are muslims because their fathers are muslim this person though he may be coming from a religious background he does not believe in the false god which his parents attribute to so he does not believe in god i am congratulating him because he's accepted the first part of the shahadah the first part of the islamic creed there is no god now my job is to prove in allah but allah which i shall do inshallah to the other people i have to first remove the wrong concept of god and then prove the right concept of my job is done he has already said there's no god no i have to prove in allah but allah which i shall do inshallah you ask this atheist that suppose there is an object an unidentified maybe a flying object which no one in the world has seen no human being in the world knows about this object if it's brought in front of you and if you're asked that who will be the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of this unidentified object you have to ask me the question who is the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of this new object which no one in the world has seen after thinking for a while he'll give the answer the person will be able to tell you the mechanism the first person is the creator of that object some may say manufacturer some may say producer whatever they say don't grapple with the word accept it it will be somewhat similar either creator or producer or manufacturer but remember what he has told you keep it in your mind then ask him the next question how did the universe come into existence how is it formed he will tell you by the big bang theory tell him the quran mentions in surah ambia chapter 21 verse number 30 about the big bang theory who could have mentioned this in the quran 400 years ago so he will tell you maybe it's a fluke don't argue with him next part of the question we did not know the light of the moon is reflected light we came to know recently you're asking yes yes the light of the moon is reflected light it's not its own light when we discovered he will tell you recently yesterday 50 years back hundred years back yesterday in science you tell him the quran mentioned that the light of the moon is reflected light 1400 years ago who could have mentioned that maybe somebody had a wild guess don't argue with them continue we thought the sun was stationary you ask him is it stationary you say no it's rotating and revolving when you learn this he will tell you yesterday 50 years back hundred years back quran mentioned this 400 years ago he will hesitate but may say maybe some intelligent person wrote it don't argue with him continue how was the universe initially what a suggestion matter he will tell you it was smoke how did he come to know we have got proof we have got evidence you tell him quran mentioned this 14 years ago who could have mentioned that he will hesitate don't wait for response continue keep on posing question after question walls that i give in the lecture keep on posing one question after the other that water cycle how do we come to know about it quran mentioned 14 years ago about every living thing made from water who could i mention that quran speaks about botany the male and female who could have mentioned that pose one after the other and ask the question who could have written that then you tell him that there is a theory known as theory of probability that if you have two choice out of which one is right the chances that you will make the correct choice just at random is one in two for example if i toss a coin it can either be heads or tails the chances that i'll be right will be one and two if i toss it twice the chances that i'll be right both the times will be one upon two multiplied by one upon two that is one upon four twenty five percent chance if i toss it thrive chances i'll be right all three times one upon two multiplier one upon two multiply one upon two it's one upon eight twelve and a half percent a dice has got six sides if i throw a dice the chances that at random i'll be correct is one upon six if i throw it twice the chances that both the time i'll be right will be one upon six by one upon six one upon thirty six this is called as theory of probability if i throw the dice twice and then toss a coin all three being right will be one upon six by one upon six by one upon two is one upon seventy two so you ask him the chances maybe if you ask what is the shape of the earth there are various types some may say it is flat somebody said it's triangular some may say it is hexagonal some may say pentagonal some may say heptagonal some may say square say they can be ten shapes some may say it is round it is spherical the chance is that if anyone makes a wild guess it being correct is one upon 10. the light of the moon it can either be its own light or it can be reflected light the chances that you make a wild guess and it being correct will be one upon two the chance is that both shape of the earth and light of the moon being reflected light both being correct if you make a wild guess it will be one upon 10 months by one upon two it is one upon 20. what can the living creatures be made of some may say sand some may say stone some may say aluminium some may say gold say a thousand materials you can name some may say water some may say silver a thousand material the chances that you make a wild guess and one of them being right according to mathematics is one upon a thousand the chances that all three being correct the earth is spherical light of the moon is reflected light and every living creature created from water is correct will be one upon ten multiplied by one upon two multiplied by one upon thousand answer comes to one upon twenty thousand or point zero zero five percent quran speaks about scientific signs more than a thousand verses in three verses the answer comes to point zero five percent if you apply probability theory to all this being at random chance it will come to zero negligible and in math anything one in ten raised to fifty it's equal to zero so you ask your atheist friend who could have written this the only answer he can give you is his first answer the creator the manufacturer the person who has produced it that's the only answer there's no answer what science is saying today is they are not eliminating god they are eliminating models of god they are not eliminating god but models of god i hope to answer the question"
