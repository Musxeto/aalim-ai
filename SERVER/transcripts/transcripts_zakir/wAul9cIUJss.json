  "transcript": "the 13th point is Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them both of them besides being prophets of God they were Statesmen or they were like kings Jesus Christ peace be upon him was only a prophet of God Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them both of them besides being the prophets of God they were head of state they head the full state which was not the case with Jesus peace be upon Him Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them both of them were like kings a king means a person who could give the punishment of life and death which was not the case with Jesus peace be upon Him Jesus peace be upon Him says in the Gospel of John chapter number 18 verse number 36 my kingdom is not of this world so Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Moses peace be upon him and Jesus peace be upon Him is unlike Moses peace be upon him only on this prophecy I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee only this one point of the prophecy that the prophet should be like Moses peace be upon him I've given no less than 13 similarities between prophet Muhammad and Prophet Moses peace be upon him and 13 dissimilarities between Jesus peace be upon him and Moses peace be upon him this prophecy does not befit anyone except the last and and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the prophecy continues I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee and I shall put my words into his mouth and he shall speak all that I command him allmighty God says I shall put words into the mouth of this prophet and he shall say all that I command him the revelations were given to Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was an unlettered and whatever way he got he repeated verbi him as though words were put in his mouth for example the first five verses of the Quran to be revealed were read recite in the name of thy Lord who has created who has created men from something which clings a Lee like substance read thy Lord is most Bountiful [Music] read in the name of thy Lord who most bful who taught men the use of the P who taught men what he knew not so whatever he got whatever Revelation he got from almighty God he repeated verbit as though words were put in his mouth this was not the case with Jesus peace be upon him so this prophecy of dutron omy chapter number 18 verse number 18 does not befit anyone but the last and and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him only from this one verse of the Bible book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 it is sufficient to prove that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is a prophet of almighty God the prophecy continues book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 19 that whosoever does not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name I will require it from him some versions of the Bible say I will take revenge almighty God is saying that verily I say unto you whosoever does not hearken unto his words whosoever will not follow the words of this Prophet who will speak in my name I will require of him I will take revenge that means if you do not follow the teachings of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him almighty God is telling you in the Bible I will take revenge any Christian who does not follow the teachings of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him almighty God is telling in the Bible he will take revenge from [Applause] you the prophecy says and whosoever will not hearken unto The Words which he shall speak in my name almighty God is saying if you do not heed the words of this Prophet who will speak speak in my name and we know in the last and final Revelation the Quran which was revealed to Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him every chapter of the Quran except for Surah chapter number nine begins with the formula in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful it is fulfillment of the prophecy whosoever will not hearken unto his words which he shall speak in my name saying is far so Superior to saying in the name of God because God is General in the name of Allah it's a proper noun and whosoever shall not hearken unto his words which he shall speak in my name the name of almighty God and the proper name of almighty God is Allah not only in the Quran also in the Bible that's the reason when Jesus Christ peace be upon him when he was put on the cross it's mentioned in the gospel of Mark chapter number 15 verse number 34 and gospel of Matthew chapter number 27 verse number 46 when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was put on the cross on the 11th say so as to say oh God oh God why has Thou forsaken me alhamdulillah in all the translations of the Bible in all the versions of the Bible irrespective whatever language is translated into English Hindi French German Portuguese the original words of Jesus Christ peace be upon him has been m so as to say then the translation says oh God oh God why thou foren me I'm asking you a question does sound like oh God oh God forsaken me does it sound like me Hebrew and Arabic are sister languages if you translate into Arabic it is Allah Allah it sounds similar and if you read the Scofield's Bible it says Allah means a l a h Allah the name of God even Jesus Christ peace be upon him he called almighty God by Allah not by God the prophecy says whosoever will not hearken unto his words which he shall speak in my name almighty God is saying my name that is Allah and every chapter of the Glorious Quran except for Surah Toba chapter 9 begins with the beautiful formula in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful"
