  "transcript": "the next question is from akhil hussain from lahore pakistan is court marriage legal or illegal according to the islamic point of view if court marriage legal or illegal account islamic point of view depending upon which court you're talking about if it is an islamic court it's legal if it's not islamic court it did not begin in islamic sharia that is the reason it's very important that most of the muslims are not aware about the court marriages if you're living in islamic country which is ruled or governed by the islamic sharia then no problem in marrying in the court of that country for example it may be malaysia it has sharia law you can follow it or it can be saudi arabia or it can many of the gulf countries where islam is followed no problem at all there are three types of countries one in which islam is the state religion and they follow the sharia like the countries i mentioned second can be a non-muslim country but that non-muslim country gives you a permission to follow the personal law of each particular citizen for example india in india every citizen of india can follow his or her law as far as religion is concerned as far as religious laws are concerned talking about civil law the criminal law is common india the secular country it's a democratic country the citizen of india respected whether he is muslim or a christian or a hindu he can follow his personal law it's called as the personal law as far as civil rights are concerned in the criminal law you have common then you have a third type of country like most of the western countries usa canada uk there an individual citizen is not allowed to follow the personal law based on the religion he has to follow the common civil law as i mentioned earlier if islamic country following the islamic sharia doing a court marriage is permissible it follows the islamic sharia no problem at all or you do nikah at home and you register as per the laws of the country in countries like india where an individual citizen is allowed to follow his own personal law as far as religion is concerned like in india we have a muslim person personal law in this case it is very important that a muslim should not do court marriage if you do court marriage in india the rule of the indian government common law will apply not the islamic law so in india a muslim should do nikah as per the sharia and then register his nikka with the indian government saying that these two people man and woman their husband and wife but if you go and do a marriage in the civil court of india then the law of indian court will apply then that person cannot have more than one wife if the person dies the inheritance would be according to the indian law not according to the law of the sharia everything marriage divorce inheritance all the personal law would be according to the court to the indian government so for a muslim in a non-muslim country to do a court marriage in haram and islam especially if you are living in a country like india which permits you to have a personal law in this case if you go out of the way and do a court marriage it's totally a haram it's as good as scoffer because you're rejecting the law of islam which the country has given you permission to follow the law of quran and they say hadith and you're following the law of that country in civil matters it's totally wrong as far as living in the country where the personal law is not allowed to be followed that place also is better you do nikah even though the islamic sharia law you will not be able to follow better do anika as per the islamic sharia and then you can may be registered or tell to the government that your husband and wife that is sufficient so in islamic country where islamic laws followed marrying in court is permissible but in a non-muslim country court marriage is prohibited hope that answers the question"
