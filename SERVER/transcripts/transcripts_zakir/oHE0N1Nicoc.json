  "transcript": "the next question dr nabil from kashmir he asks why are some people born with congenital defects if this is a test for the parents then why are non-muslim and atheist parents tested especially the non-muslim parents allah subhana with allah says in the glorious quran 67 verse number 2 it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you are good in deeds so this life it is a test for the hereafter and based upon our deeds based upon our actions we will be rewarded or punished in the hereafter so certain people are tested allah subhana wa tala test different people in different ways and allah says in surah baqarah chapter number and we shall surely test you with something of fear and hunger and some loss of lives and wealth but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere so allah subhana tala he tests the believers allah subhana tala test different people in different ways and even if the children they have certain diseases it is a test for the parents will they yet be grateful and thankful to allah are they content with the decree of allah or not even the non-muslim parents it is a test for them will they believe in one god alone will they embrace islam will they be content with the decree of allah subhanahu ta'ala and if they embrace islam if they are content with the decree of allah their reward will be greater in the hereafter because the greater the test the greater the reward and just because a person has a disease maybe a congenital heart disease or any other disease that does not make him a lesser human being that does not mean that he is a less righteous person even if a person has a disease he can yet enter paradise and it is better for a person to enter paradise with a disease rather than entering hellfire without having a disease so it is all based upon how you look at it because for us believers the prime goal it is the hereafter this life it is temporary sixty years seventy years eight years as allah says chapter number three verse number one eighty five kulun cinder every soul shall have a taste of death so every person he will eventually die this worldly life it is going to end the home of the year after it is everlasting and it is eternal so we should prepare for the home of the hereafter and the criterion for judgment in the sight of allah it is taqwa it is god consciousness even if a person he has a disease he may not have a leg he may not have a limb etc but in the sight of allah subhanallah he can be greater if he is a righteous person if he has iman if he has taqwa and it reminds me of an incident of a person who did not have his hands and legs and he was blind and he was continuously reciting the other car that is he was remembering allah subhana wa continuously reciting it and he was thanking allah so some people they passed by him and they asked him that you do not have your legs you do not have your hands you are blind yet you are thanking allah yet you are remembering allah subhana wa so he says that at least allah subhanahu ta'ala alhamdulillah allah subhana wa has given me a tongue wherein i can praise him i can do adkar i can recite the praises of allah subhana look at the iman of this person even though he has lost his limbs he is blind but yet he is content with the decree of allah because we all know and we all should strive for the afterlife this life it is only temporary and the home of the hereafter it is everlasting and it is eternal"
