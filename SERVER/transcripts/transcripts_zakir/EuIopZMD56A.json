  "transcript": "we should see to it that we are bringing our children close to the quran and the sahadi it is a duty that we give our children proper education that's the reason i say that your children are your amana see to it you give them proper education for both the worlds and this was a dilemma that i faced maybe eight years back and though alhamdulillah i used to give talks on education and i did take time to choose my life partner because i wanted a right life partner and finally allah gave me alhamdulillah and when the children are born my eldest son is 12 years old and i always had that thing that we should have a proper school which has a striking balance between the islamic education and the formal education i don't call mathematics science as secular education because secular by definition means nothing to do with god i believe science believes in god mathematics is islamic subject so therefore when i talk about the other conventional subjects i call them formal education mathematics science history geography english we call it as formal subjects so i always had that dream that to have a school which has the striking balance between the islamic subjects islamic education and the formal education because mathematics science history according to me are part of islam and that made me tour the world and i did a survey alhamdulillah of most of the islamic schools at that time that was about six to eight years back in a span of two three years masha'allah i went to most of the best schools of the world in america in canada in uk in south africa in australia in malaysia and i visited hundreds of schools and when i observed that in the western countries most of the islamic schools almost all they were more of a muslim many school muslim many school means the management was muslim but i would not call them as islam schools because we realized that in the western world there is a fear of alcoholism of drug addiction about obscenity so in these schools we found that the dress code that the students wore they were islamic hijab masha'allah they had a time for prayer for salah alhamdulillah there was no alcohol there was no dark alhamdulillah so that was what was called the islamic school where back in india most of the muslim many schools they have the islamic discord you can offer salah there's no alcohol there's no drug so i did not find something new but alhamdulillah considering the western country where drug addiction is common alcoholism is common obscenities come in it is an achievement which i was happy but what i came to search for that when our children go to school they should get the best of knowledge i could not find any of the schools what we wanted that we have now the muslim ummah rather divide into two types of education one type of education when we have secular education they acquire the so-called secular education which are called formal education they acquire knowledge of mathematics science is to geography but they are far away from the deen on the other hand when we go to our madrasas we teach about quran hadees shariafic alhamdulillah may allah give them reward but they are unaware of mathematics science history geography so we wanted a balance between the two"
