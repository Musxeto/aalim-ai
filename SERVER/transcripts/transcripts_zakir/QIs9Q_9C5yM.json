  "title": "Will Allah Forgive the Non Muslims who do Great Service for Humanity and Orphanage? â€“ Fariq Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question what will happen to the non-believers who do huge service for the society and orphanage and also good by heart will allah forgive them allah says in the glorious quran so nissa chapter number 4 verse 148 answer nissa chapter number four was 116. [Music] that if allah pleases he may forgive any sin but he will not forgive the sin of shirk so if a person dies in the state of shirk disbelief allah will not forgive him and there are many non-muslims who are involved in good things for example kindness charity helping their neighbors helping others but all these things they are important but the most important thing is recognizing your creator allah who has created you allah he has given the human being so many facilities the shelter the house the food the water if you do not get food for a few days you will die if you do not get water for a few days you will die how many of us have thanked allah subhana wa ta'ala for all these blessings if we do not get air for a few hours we will die how many of us have thanked allah for the air allah has given all of these things to us the food the air the water and he is requesting us to worship him alone allah he is the only one who is worthy and deserving of worship i would like to give you a simple example if there is a boss of a company and one of his employees he does not come to work he misses the training sessions and he only comes to collect the salary and what he does is he works for some other company will the boss be pleased with him but natural no he is not fulfilling his duty he misses training sessions he does not come to work and whatever salary he gets he gives about 30 percent of that in charity will the boss be pleased with him but naturally no his first duty is to come on time his first duty is to be obedient to his boss allah subhanahu wa ta'ala he has created us he has given us so much in this life he is the only one who is worthy and deserving of worship so the first and the most important thing is recognizing your creator what is the point of doing good to the creation when you cannot recognize the creator the first and the most important thing is recognizing allah who has created you and i would like to give you an example when you appear for an examination for example the 10th grade there are five compulsory subjects that you need to pass if you fail in one of these subjects so you will not pass the tenth grade for example maths science english history and geography if you get in four subjects in four out of these five compulsory subjects 99 marks out of 100 and in one subject you fail yet you will fail the 10th grade similarly for a person to enter jannah he has to believe in one god alone without associating partners with him and believe in the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him this is the minimum requirement for a person to enter jannah so even if the non-muslims they do good things they will get their reward and their share in this world they will not have anything in the year after"
