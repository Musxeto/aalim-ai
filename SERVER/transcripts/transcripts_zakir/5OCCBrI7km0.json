  "transcript": "the next question is from Abdul kader khabir from Nigeria the Quran mentioned that it's Allah who guide whom he wills and leads astray whom heels if Allah is the one who guide then how can he punish the ones who are LED astray and that's a very good question asked by Abdul qadir what is referring to is the verse of the Quran from Surah Ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number four that it's Allah who guides who he wishes and he leads the Stray who he wishes So based on the verse of the Quran the question is posing then how can Allah punish those people who have gone straight if Allah before I give the answer I'd like to give an example that if there is a teacher who is teaching the class and telling the students that this is the portion of the examination and the teachers the complete portion of a particular subject give the textbook the rules and regulation and there's one student who's very intelligent who comes and asks the teacher questions the teacher clarifies give the student more time there's another student who bunks the classes who keeps on teasing the teacher in the classroom doesn't obey the teacher criticizes the teacher doesn't ask any question but as the teacher realizes that that student who's intelligent and asking questions and which teacher has guided him is bound to score good marks in the examination and the student who plays hooky and who criticize the teacher doesn't listen to the teacher is bound to fail after the year the examination takes place and the teacher give first class first to the first student and fails the student who was playing hooky who was not interested in studies who criticize the teacher can the thrift today that the teacher teacher the teacher supported answer the question and passed him and gave him first class first the second student didn't help him and failed him it is illogical because the first student went out of his way to ask questions and clarify whatever he didn't understand the teacher answered which is even the second student that the second student neither asked any question criticized went against the Commandments of the teacher he's bound to fail so how can you blame the teacher that what did the teacher fail him similarly Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 67 verse number two it's Allah who has created death and life to test which of his good indeeds so this life is a test for the Hereafter Allah had laid down the rules and regulation for the human beings in the Glorious Quran the rules and regulations how a human being should follow the Commandments of Allah he has sent several Revelations but the last and final Revelation which is available in the authentic form in the original form is Quran and for details you have to refer to the Hadith of the Beloved Prophet Muslim Allah says in the Quran in Surah and kabut chapter number 29 verse number 69 that all those who strive to Jihad strive and struggle in the path of Allah Allah will open up his pathways foreign but Allah will not guide those who do transgression and those who tell lies so Allah is very clear because those who strive in the way of Allah Allah all those who do transgression and do sin and who lie Allah will not guide them so those people who are misguided are not following the rules of Allah given in the Quran similarly the example of the teacher that the student who wants to learn more ask question and strives to know more knowledge is the example of Surah and kaboot chapter 29 verse 69 that those who strive in the way of Allah Allah so those people who are not obeying the Commandment why should Allah guide them so Allah is right he will lead a strip some people who he wishes and he will guide some people who he wishes Allah is okay fine you look handsome I will guide you you don't look handsome I will not guide you no there are rules and regulation that if you follow the Commandments of Allah I will guide you if you don't follow the Commandments of Allah if you do transgression if you do sin if you do shirk Allah will not guide you so what is illogical so why are you blaming the teacher when she or he fails the student is not guiding him because he's doing sin and a person who does sin and strives and asks for forgiveness Allah takes him out from Darkness tonight those who have the desire to follow the Commandment of Allah even if they sin if they ask for forgiveness Allah forgive them Allah will lead them to the state part but those people who abuse Allah who do Sheikh who don't follow his Commandments surely he will lead the mystery leading astray means they will go to jail so this is totally logical Allah is the most just as Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 4 number 40 Allah is never unjust in the least degree hope to answer the question"
