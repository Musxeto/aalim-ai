  "transcript": "could you explain to us what is sunnah what does it mean and how many types of sunnah are there alhamdulillah the word sunnah literally means the way or the custom and the sunnah of the prophet means the way of the prophet or the prophet's tradition the word sunnah it indicates and means the sayings the deeds and the approval of the prophet in the span of 23 years during his prophethood it means what the prophet said what the prophet did and what the prophet approved in the span of 23 years during his prophethood and the sunnah of the prophet can be divided into three types the first is that means the sayings of the prophet the second is sunnutify that means the actions of the prophet and the third is which means the approval of the prophet so basically these three types of sunnah are there in three different categories okay that seems very straightforward but could you perhaps for the benefit of the viewers and myself give cite some examples of each of the different categories you've mentioned the example of the first type of sunnah that's sunita kali the sayings of the prophet for example muslim said inside buhari volume number one in the book of aadhaan hadith number 631 the prophet said pray as you see me praying so this is the command of the prophet it's a saying of the prophet and it is the duty of a muslim that we should follow it the example of the second type of sunnah fairly that is the deeds of the prophet is mentioned in for example say buhari number one book whenever i saw the prophet of salah used to raise his hand up to the shoulders and then when he said the takbir he again did the same action raised the hand up to the shoulders and then he bowed down when he came up he said allah that allah hears those who praise allah and again it is the same action that is raised his hands put the shoulders but he did not do the action taking the hand up to the shoulders between the two frustrations when he said the tag beat so this is the action of the prophet saba sees the action and narrates it this becomes surnate the third type of sunnat is the sunnah takridhi that is the approval of the prophet and the example is given in sunan abu dhabi volume number one in the book of salah hadith number 1262 where one is the prophet he played the faja salah he leads the salah in the congregation and after the salah is over he sees a man after salah he gets up and he offers to rakaat salah so the prophet says the father salah is only of indicating why did you offer to rakhat again so he said that i did not offer the two sunnah salah before fajr first that's the reason i'm offering it now and the prophet kept silent now because the prophet was silent it gives indication that he approved it because if something is wrong it's the duty of the prophet to correct it so because he kept silent it gives an approval so this comes the third category of sunnah the qri approval of the prophet in these three types of sunnah if all the hadith authentic all the hadith say the sunnah that carries the maximum weight is sunnatekali that is the saying of the prophet because that is the general ruling whether for prophet says something or if the prophet commands something it means he has done it intentionally and with the purpose that is the highest degree amongst the three the next is the fairly that is action of the prophet so what the prophet did maybe a sahaba saw it and narrates it but there can be occasions where a prophet did certain things out of necessity which may not be the normal norm therefore the action of the prophet carries less weight than the saying of the prophet saying is that consciousness and that's the general ruling and if there's a difference between the saying and the action of the prophet the saying of the prophet carries more weight because maybe the action was done out of some reason or out of some purpose with the person who's seeing it he may not be aware of it and we'll have such examples i'll give some examples in future in challenge episode and the third among the three is the sunnate approval of the prophet that means he kept silent that means it is approved it is permissible"
