  "title": "Arabic is the Fifth Largest Spoken Language in the World - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there are certain Muslim using internet to protest and they're using Arabic as a language why don't they use a local language or HOSA why do they use Arabic language which is making a misconception in the mind of the non-muslims brother there are many people in the world who only understand Arabic and nothing else today Arabic is the fifth largest spoken language in the world so if they have to convey to the Arab they have to speak in Arabic Arabic is spoken more than HOSA do you know that HOSA doesn't come in the top 10 languages of the world Arabic is the fifth largest language so these people want to convey to a larger audience I do agree with you that if it's a local organization Nigeria should convey a message they should convey it more in the local language I agree with you but if they use Arabic for their support there is no wrong at all why should the non-muslim have a misconception if the non-muslim cannot understand Arabic they should not go on that site suppose I speak in Hindi and if you don't understand Hindi and if you have a misconception problem is you because I want to convey to the Hindi speaking public I cannot the Muslims don't use Arabic so what I do agree that in the locality if they want to convey to the local Muslims the language which the local Muslims understand more should be used I do agree that the local Nigerian Muslims speak more HOSA than Arabic then they should use HOSA but if they do it in Arabic it's not wrong it's their choice so I cannot say that if they're using Arabic it's wrong because Arabic today is the fifth largest spoken language in the world hope to answer the question"
