  "title": "Is the Repentance Accepted if Hadd Punishment is not Implemented on the Person? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "dr. zakir next question is is repentance accepted if the had punishment is not carried out on a person Domitian earlier that a person should realize that the bounty of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala His mercy and grace is in abundance and if you commit a crime if it involves some other people then you have to restore the property back if you have robbed and give the wealth back if you taking something from someone give it back but if it is between you and last man o Allah a person should never be dissatisfied you should never think that Allah will not forgive whatever I seen him I commit let it be the biggest sin if you depend sincerely as we mention last episode Allah will forgive anything but if he had done some harm to some other human being then he should turn undo it and Allah says in the Quran in surah Furqan chapter number 25 verse number 68 and as for those who do not invoke with Allah any other God or do not take any life of any human being unless for a just cause or do not indulge in adultery and for those who do it for them there is a punishment and Allah continues in the next verses instead of for current chapter 25 verse number 70 I for those who believe and repent and do righteous deeds Allah subhana WA Ta'ala will change the evil thing that he has done the evil did here then - good so that's the most philosopher note Allah so as far as the HUD penalty is concerned if it is the person who himself knows that he has done a sin for example if he has an adultery so it should depend to Allah subhanAllah and ask for forgiveness it is between him and allah subhanaw taala and it's not required that he should tell to the others because if it's told then the HUD punishment would be there and as I mention earlier about the case of the men from Gehenna who told a love messenger she had an adulterous pregnant and the Prophet said that come later on and came later on after she gave birth to a child and just on to that that example I gave of my Ximena Malik or in the hadith of say Muslim world number three read it number four to 0-5 which my Ximena Malik Mela I plead with him he just relax messenger that o prophet purify me a lot of senior says go and repent a forgiveness again comes like it says all loud messenger please purify me she's go V I love messenger please purify me again goes away for time he comes in this is what is in your purify from what did you say adultery then I love message ask him that are you mad I'm drunk and then after that very fine that he was not mad you're not drunk he had to pass that penalty but they say they both these two people that asked for forgiveness and they repented so may Allah accept the repentance but furthers mention had it off Monta one number two book of punishment hadith number 12 the beloved partial merciless on himself that stop committing sins major sins etc and if you commit then you have to conceal it and ask for forgiveness from Allah subhanAllah you repent and if you disclose it then we will have to pass the Hat penalty that means if the sin is known to the Sultana or the ruler or to Akkad the Ottawa judge then it becomes simplicity for that person that he has to pass that penalty that is turning to death if you had an adultery or any other sin which requires the death penalty but if it's not known and the person who has sinned if it involves some of the human being is you try and undo it if it is involvement between him and Allah so Allah then he should ask for forgiveness and ask for repentance and should concede it's not a requirement that the punishment of HUD should be given to the person for repentance but if we have the example of my Zegna Malik who repented and did not mind being killed for second last panel Allah forgive them and the Prophet said that even if you distributed in the people of Medina it will be selfish for them forgiveness but at the general rule it's not a requirement that you have to pass the head penalty for repentance if we exposed from the panel - and expose conceal it and after forgiveness from allah subhanaw taala and you repeated in sha allah will forgive you"
