  "title": "Why do they not read the Quran with understanding? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya since there are there so much more reward for reading the Quran with the understanding why is it or what are the excuses given by Muslims multitudes of Muslims for not taking your advice and reading it with understanding there are many excuses given by the common Muslim for not reading the Quran with understanding and the most common is is that we don't understand Arabic as a language as you may be aware that more than 1 fifth of the world population more than 20% of the world population about 1.5 billion out of the 6.3 billion people in the world they are Muslims but more than 80% don't understand Arabic as a language 15% of the Muslim population approximately they're Arabs and a few non-arabs know Arabic as language so more than 80% of the Muslims they don't don't understand Arabic as a language so the most common excuse is we don't know Arabic as a language now every human being knows at least two or three languages some know four some know five some are linguist but when a child is born he does not know any language but he learns the mother tongue to converse with the family members he learns the language of the locality so that he can converse with the friends he learns the language in which he's educated every human being knows at least two or three languages isn't it important that we should know the language in which the last and final guidance Revelation was given by our creat Allah subhana wa tala many people say that it's difficult to learn a language when we are old but age is never a barrier for any good work and that reminds me of the example of Dr Morris B raar bukel he was a French and he was given the French Academy Award in the field of medicine and you was selected for studying The Mummy of manapa that was form in the valley of kings and when he went to Egypt while doing his research one of the Muslims said it's nothing great that he found the body it's already mentioned in the Quran in Surah yunus chapter number 10 verse number 92 that almighty God will save the body of the Pharaoh as a sign for posterity so he was shocked that how could this book which is so old mention about things which we have come to recently that the body of the Pharaoh will be saved so that made him read the translation of the Quran after read the translation of the Quran he was so impressed with the Quran he wanted to understand Quran directly in Arabic so he learned Arabic as a language at the age of 50 imagine being a non-muslim learning in Arabic as a language to understand the Quran better and then he writes the book The Bible the Quran and science which is a very famous book so age is never a barrier for a person to learn a new language but it's not possible that all of us will be as enthusiastic as Dr moris P according to Abdul Maadi he says the Quran is the most untranslatable book in the world it is the most difficult book to translate because the language of the Quran is so pure it is unsurpassable it's intangible it is supreme it is Noble it is divine and many times one Arabic word has got several meanings one verse of the Quran it can be understood in various different ways it will have a different angle for for a lay man when he reads it for a scientist to have a different angle so that's the reason that's the beauty of the Quran so to read in Arabic is the best but for those people who don't know Arabic alhamdulillah there are many sh many many scholars who have translated the Quran into major different languages of the world most of the major language of the world the Quran has been translated by different Scholars so if you don't understand Arabic as a language at least read the Quran in the language you understand the best if you know English read in English if you know French read it in French if you know German read in German if you know Udu read in Udu read it in the language you understand the best but it's a requirement that we should read the Quran in the language we understand so there's no excuse I don't know Arabic that read the language you understand and alhamdulillah in most of the major language of the world you have the Quran today that it has been translated we have the translation of the Quran in most of the major languages of the world there are various other excuses given by Muslims that they're busy in their business in their work in studies that is the reason they can't read the translation of the Quran many of us we go to schools we go to universities to colleges and we spent decades in schools universities colleges and and we read and memorize volumes and volumes of books but we don't have the time to read the Quran how much time does it take to read the Quran if you read the translation of the Quran and if you are reading is fast it will take few days for you to read the Quran if you read one J one part every day it will take you one month but unfortunately we give excuses they don't have the time whatever degree you acquire in the school School in the college it may or may not help you in this world many of the people they graduates but they're jobless and the Hereafter unless this education does not get you closer to Allah subhana wa ta'ala this knowledge is useless for the what the Quran says inah Bak chapter number two verse number one and two that Al Lam me this is a book without doubt it is a guidance for those who have faith it is surely giving a promise that it's a guidance for you it will help you in this world as well as Hereafter so it's a requirement that the Muslims should read the Quran with understanding if they don't know Arabic read in the language they understand the best"
