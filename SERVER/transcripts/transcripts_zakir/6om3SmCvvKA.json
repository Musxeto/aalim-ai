  "title": "Why do Muslims emulate Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "now now this is with regards to the practice of sunnat i am told that it is uh actually emulating the practices done by prophet muhammed and if we're only supposed to bow down to the formless god why do we follow practices which are done by a human incarnation particularly things like growing your hair to a certain length which may not have a particular significance in terms of benefit or kissing the hazrat aswad when someone also declined that you're just a stone after prophet muhammad didn't kiss you i wouldn't do this either brother that's a very good question that's a good question that when we agree prophet muhammad peace be upon him he's not almighty god why do we have to emulate him why do we have to copy him if he's the incarnational he's not incarnation of god so in your sentences human in a human form he's a human being he is the best human being but he's not god why do we follow because almighty god has said that quran says in surah nisa chapter 4 59 god has said god said follow the prophet we follow for example i am the boss of a company i tell follow my general manager now you will say why follow general manager boss boss is saying so if boss says you have to follow unless the general manager goes against me and if the trusted general manager never go against me so similarly the prophet will never go against the teachings of almighty god it is because he is the messenger who has got the message of god for us so when you emulate him it gives us more blessings but we can't worship him we love the prophet we revere him we love him we obey him but we don't worship him so people who go to uh and all this this is wrong it's nowhere mentioned in the quran to go to dergah there's no hadith saying goodbye and the second part the significance of hazrat aswad as he asked again because the prophet kissed it i'm emulating it doesn't become the first it's not compulsory you have to do it sunnat means you will get blessing but in sunnat if you don't do there's no negative point in furth you have to do it if you don't do it negative points like pray five times you have to do don't do negative point so not means if you do plus points if you don't do no negative points so these are additional bonus points so if you want bonus you can do it not compulsory if you don't do also no one can say that you know good muslim so when you do it you get additional bonus point and a good muslim tries to get more bonus point but no one can say it's a sin therefore become the sunnah so prophet kissed it we are kissing it even if you don't kiss it yet there's no problem hope to answer the question thanks very much"
