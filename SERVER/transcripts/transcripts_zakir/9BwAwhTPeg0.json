  "transcript": "there's a question posed by salman haider just came on the facebook sir is life insurance halal a similar question was is asked on the whatsapp message by muhammad tariq from pakistan is it permissible to have life insurance life insurance per se is not haram in islam because they have to die a camel but today since most of the life insurance is related with rabbah so riba based life insurance interest based life insurance was interest is the 12th major synonym in today's world most of the life insurance are related with interest and riba based system so any life insurance or any insurance whether it be kind insurance any insurance which is linked with riba or linked with interest it is haram what do they do they take your money they take the money from thousands of people from tens of thousands of people they pull it together and they take your premium they put in a bank or they put it in a money based instrument where you get fixed money on fixed period of time and based on the returns they get the use that returns in taking care of the people a person who has died or a person or accident so this system based on rabbi's haram but we have an islamic alternative called as the kafur in the takafu system in the islamic life insurance system what they do the money you give they invest in a halal investment it is not rubber based it is halal as for the islamic sharia and the return they get from this halal based investment they utilize for taking care of a person that accident or a person died so if it is an islamic life insurance based on the takaful based on the islamic sharia then life insurance person is halal but if it's based on a non-sharia complaint or a riba based or interest based it is haram"
