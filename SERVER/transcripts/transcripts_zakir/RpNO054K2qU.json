  "transcript": "the next question is by brother shahil diori from india he's a non-muslim hi dr zakir i am 17 years old i want to accept islam but can i accept islam after i turn 20 because i don't think that my parents will support me if i accept islam now but the child has asked a question that is 17 years old and he wants to accept islam he is convinced with the teaching of islam but he feels that his parents won't accept him that is the reason you want to accept islam after three years then he's 20 where you can stand on his own feet my reply to your question brother is that if you are convinced with the teachings of islam and you agree islam is the best religion i would suggest accept islam immediately because we don't know how long will we live i cannot guarantee whether i will see tomorrow or not so my advice to you is that if you are convinced with islam accept it immediately as soon as possible and when you accept islam you need not proclaim it to the world since you're 17 years old and you feel that your parents will not support you i would say that at least wait till the age of 18 maybe you will become 18 after a few months or maybe after six months maximum maybe a year till that time accept islam you do your farah's you praise allah and if after the age of 18 men 18 is the legal age in india where you become an adult and no one can stop you from following any faith maybe that's the time you can tell your parents so if yet want to hide you can hide but see to it that you follow the pharisees but natural if you do not proclaim to the world or do not proclaim to your parents or to your family that you become muslim it will be more difficult for you to practice islam so my suggestion would be that you can convey the message that you've accepted islam and tell them but if you feel that it's going to be a big problem for you it is permitted that you hide from them and it's not required that you know you'll wait till you get a good job where you can earn a good living and then you proclaim islam it's not required the moment you realize it's the best religion accept it you may or may not convey to your parents but my suggestion would be that when you reach the age of 18 you also convert your parents and do dawah to your parents i am sure inshallah inshallah they will not be as angry as you feel you may never know they will accept you may never know you may be this arya to convince your parents to accept islam now when you accept islam and you proclaim to your parents you have a bigger opportunity for doing dawah you being the son of your parents it becomes your duty that if you have found the truth you should also convey the truth to your parents so my suggestion would be that you accept islam today tell to your parents at the age of 18 you can show them my video cassettes talk to them politely but my one request is that when you accept islam you have to be more kind to your parents you have to be more courteous to them follow everything what they say unless those things which are against quran and the sayings of the prophet only those things which are against the sharia only those things you don't fall other things you should follow more strictly for example you don't like blue color and your mother likes blue color and they say sun wear blue color you wear even though you don't like it wear it because wearing blue colors except in islam it is mubarak see to it that you love your mother more that you care for a moo you take care of her and you talk to her more be kind to her more she should see what's happened to my son how come he's become more kind more merciful more loving then you shouldn't say this is because this is what my religion teaches that paradise lies beneath the feet of my mother i have to respect my mother i have to love my mother i have to love my father so there should be a drastic change in your behavior towards the good not towards the negative so much so that they should think oh what has happened to my son he's become so good and they should also start loving the religion of islam inshallah i pray to allah that may give you the courage to accept islam as soon as possible and may give you the hikmah durdawa to your parents and i pray to allah that may he get your parents and your family also to the straight path"
