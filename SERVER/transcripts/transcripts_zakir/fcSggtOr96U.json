  "transcript": "there are many people who come and tell me brother zakira why can't almighty God become a human being what's the problem God can do anything and everything so why are you limiting God can do anything and everything so why can't he become a human being so I tell them even if I agree with you for the sake of argument that God can do anything and everything and if comes the human human almighty God is immortal human being is Mortal you can't have a Immortal mortal person together you get a mortal being or a mortal being you can either have God or man you can't have God man you can't have a person who's Immortal and Mortal at the same time it's meaningless you either have God or you have man you can't have God man almighty God has got no beginning human beings have a beginning you can't have a person who has a beginning and no beginning at the same time it's meaningless almighty God has got no end human being heaven and you can't have a person who have an end and no one at the same time so either you can have a man oh God you can't have a God man it's like you telling me I saw a tall short man okay he's just your tall man or a short man you can't say tall short man it's meaning opposite you can have medium height but not tall shot in a phantom and a thin man you can't have a fat thin man it's meaningless the qualities of almighty God and human being exactly opposite you can either have God or a human being so if God becomes a human being he sees this to be God almighty God does not require to eat we human means required to eat Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number six verse number 14 he feedeth everyone but does not require to be fed will human beings we require us we request sleep almighty God does not require rest and sleep Allah says in the Quran chapter number two verse number 255. Allah he's the one and only the Eternal the self-subsisting no Slumber can see them not as he requires to him belongs everything in the heavens and the Earth so almighty God if he becomes a human being he ceases to be God so what's the use of worshiping a human being like you and me and if I agree with you that almighty God can do anything and everything in the same argument if almighty God can do anything and everything almighty God can even tell a lie but to tell a lies ungodly the moment God tells a lie he sees it to be God if I agree with you for sake of argument almighty God can do anything and everything almighty God can even forget but to forget his ungodly Quran says in Surah chapter number 20 verse 52 Allah never forgets the moment God forgets he's easy to be God if I agree with you almighty God can do anything and everything almighty God can even do Injustice is never unjust in the least degree the moment God does injustice he sees it to be God if God can do anything and everything then God can even make a mistake but to make a mistake is ungodly Quran says in Surah chapter 20 verse 52 Allah never makes a mistake the moment almighty God makes a mistake he says it to be God that's the reason nowhere in the Quran is it mentioned that Allah can do everything nowhere but what does the Quran says for verily Allah has power over all things 106 109 chapter number two verse number 284 Imran chapter number three verse 29 chapter number 16 verse 77 in Surah chapter number 35 verse number one Allah says for verily Allah has power over all things Allah says in Surah chapter number 85 verse number 16 that all that alcohol he intends whatever Allah intends he can do but Allah does not intend to tell a lie to make a mistake to do Injustice to become a human being Allah only intense Godly things whatever intents he can do but the intense only got the things"
