  "title": "How to pray Salaah with Complete Concentration and thinking about Allah? - Shaikh Fariq Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is abdul rahman raziq assalamu alaikum   my question is how to pray a salah with \nfull concentration and thinking about allah   allah subhana wa tala says in the \nglorious quran in surah minoon chapter the believers they are successful those who they are in their \nprayer humbly submissive   so you need to have khushu in your prayer and it \nis common that our mind wanders during the prayer   many people their mind wanders during the prayer \nif you are a businessman you will think about   your business how much profit \nyou've made during the prayer   if you are a student you'll think about your \nstudies if you have appeared for an examination   you will start reviewing the examination \npaper during the salah for question 2   i should have written so and so answer \nquestion 3 i made a mistake in the answer   so it is common that our mind wanders during the \nprayer how do we prevent our mind from wandering   during the prayer the first thing that we need \nto do is to focus on the meaning of what we are   reciting if you know arabic as a language this is \nthe best if you do not know arabic as a language   then we should recollect the meaning we need \nto memorize the meaning of what we are reciting   for example when we recite surah alhamdulillah \nin our mind we should recollect the meaning   all priests to allah the lord of the worlds \nthe most gracious the most merciful we should   recollect the meaning but after a few days after \na few weeks even this will become mechanical   so after recollecting the meaning we should \nponder upon the meaning of what we are reciting   and if we do so inshallah our mind will not wonder \nand i would like to share with you an incident   once the people they were offering salah   and the imam and the muqtadi the people who are \nfollowing the imam after they completed their   prayer they were confused did we offer two raka \nor do they offer three raka in the maghrib prayer so one person he says that i am sure that we have \noffered only two raka in the maghreb prayer so   the people they ask him how do you know how \ncan you be so sure how can you be 100 sure   so he says i am hundred percent sure that we have \noffered two raka instead of offering three rakah   in the maghrib prayer because whenever i offer the \nmagri prayer in each raka i do calculation of the   profit that i have made in my shop i have three \nshops in each raka i do calculation of one shop so   in three raka i do calculation of three shops but \nin this salah i did calculation only of two shops   i did not do calculation of three shops so \nthat's the reason i am sure that we have   offered only two raka so it is common that people \ntheir mind wanders during the prayer and the   reason our mind wanders is because our mind is not \noccupied and empty minds is the devil's workshop he mentions in his book on page number 200 \nthat every individual stands in front of   his lord on two different occasions the \nfirst is while he he's offering salah   and the second is on the day of judgment when he \nmeets his lord ibn rahimahullah he said these two   different occasions that an individual a believer \nstands in front of his lord but if you do not   offer salah correctly then your accountability \non the day of judgment it will not go with ease now let's discuss a few ways in which we \ncan attain and concentration in our prayer   the first is bearing in mind who \nyou are standing in front of knowing   the greatness of allah subhana wa knowing how \ngreat allah subhanahu ta'ala is if you know   how great allah subhana wa tala is inshallah you \nwill have hosho and concentration in your prayer   the second is knowing that allah subhana wa tala \nhe is keeping an eye on you and he is watching you   the third is offering your salah with the \nintention of gaining complete reward from allah   the fourth and as i mentioned earlier it \nis a very important point that recollecting   and concentrating upon the meaning \nof what you are reciting you should   concentrate on the verse of the glorious \nquran and also you should concentrate   on the other car that you say during \nthe prayer so this is very important   besides this you should also see to that \nyour mind does not wander during the prayer   you should also see to it that there are no \nobjects around you that could distract you   for example images people making some noises \nthere may be music people causing disturbance   when you offer salah you should pray in \nsuch a place where there is no disturbance   and i would like to share with you a small \npersonal tip concentrate and focus only   about the salah and make your mind set in such \na way that you are going to face your lord   and then start your prayer inshallah you \nwill have to and concentration in your prayer   and our blood prophet muhammad \npeace be upon him said   that allah turns towards a slave as long \nas he does not look around in his prayer   so do not look around in your prayer so \nwe should not look around in our prayer and we should also remember death we should \noffer our salah as though it is our last prayer   and if we offer our salah in this way \ninshallah we'll offer it correctly   with khushu in surah and kabul \nchapter number 29 verse number 45 prevents from shameful and unjustice   salah prayer prevents from shameful and unjust \ndeeds if we offer our salah correctly with khushu   with concentration we will have a righteous \nlife and salah will prevent us from shameful   and immodest deeds the first thing among the \ndeeds that will be questioned to us on the   day of judgment it is our prayer if it is done \ncorrectly the remaining deeds it will follow   so we pray to allah subhana with allah that \nmay he accept all our salah all our prayer   and may he help us to get ultimate \nhosho and concentration during a prayer"
