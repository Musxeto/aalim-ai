  "transcript": "let's discuss the second category that the prophet he learned it from other sources or he copied or plagiarized from the other religious scriptures there are various allegations made by non-muslims and the critics of Islam that the prophet he learned the Quran from a Roman blacksmith who was just living in the outskirts of Makkah Allah subhana tala send the revelation in Surah n chapter number 16 verse 103 we know that they say that you learned it from someone but do they not know that his language is foreign and this Quran is Arabic pure the Roman blacksmith he could hardly speak Arabic he was a foreigner and you're saying that Prophet learned it from him and this Quran is a book written in Arabic which is so pure and eloquent it is like someone saying that a Chinese man who does not know English he has taught Shakespeare to write the book there are other allegations that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him he learned the matter of the Quran from was the relative of his wife KH pleas with her but when we read history we come to know that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him met only twice in his life once before he claimed prophethood when he was worshiping the Caba and he kissed the fo of the prophet and the other time when the first was revealed to the prophet and when the prophet was scared and shivering his wife takes him to worka only on two occasions and immediately after the first was revealed the first revelation was given 3 years later he dies and this Quran continued to be revealed for 22 and a half years so imagine Prophet met him only twice how can he learn from him and he died 3 years after meeting him the last time after the way he started so surely he could not have learned from warka he was a Christian Arab he was Arab but he had converted to Christianity but surely he could not have learned from him there are some people who say that the prophet he learned about the Quran from the Jews and Christians when he spent time with them we know that the prophet gave dawa to the Jews and Christian after going to Madina 13 years after the Revelation started so surely he could not have learned from them and in the discussions it was the prophet who was giving them information not the vice versa and many of the people who he discussed with many of them accepted Islam so it was the prophet who was helping them not they were helping [Applause] prophet"
