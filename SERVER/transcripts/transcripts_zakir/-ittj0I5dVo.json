  "title": "Sri Ram Asks Dr Zakir, \"Can a Person Enter Paradise without Practising Islam?\" - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good evening my name is sriram i'm a hindu without practicing islam do you mean to say it is difficult by practicing christianity or hinduism to go to attend the paradise after death that's a very good question without practicing islam can you practice christianity and hinduism can you go to paradise so you cannot go to paradise brother as i said the quran says in surah and imran chapter 3 verse 19 in nadine islam the only religion acceptable to almighty god is submitting evil to almighty god if you read christianity the word christianity is not then the whole bible like how hinduism is not the name of scripture the word christianity doesn't exist it's not there in the bible the word christian was used first time in the book of acts by the people who described the following of jesus christ peace be upon him it was a nickname by the people given of antioch in the book of acts if you read christian the word kishad is not there in the bible so jesus christ peace be upon him preached nothing but islam therefore he's going to come in the second coming to testify there's nothing like christianity abraham peace be upon him quran says in surah chapter 3 verse 67 he was not a jew or a christian you are the muslim abraham peace be upon him taught islam moses peace be taught islam again islam don't think islam is okay fine i have to have a muslim name i have to live in arab country after the name of the islam means submitting evil to almighty god if you submit evil to almighty god or a muslim jesus christ peace be upon him he said it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 5 verse number 30. i cannot self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will but the will of almighty god anyone who says that i follow not my with the will of almighty god he's a muslim so jesus christ peace be before the muslim he preached islam i've given the talk on similarities because of islam and christianity and i've proved that even in christianity they say believe in one god don't believe in trinity don't make images of almighty god god is not begotten all from the bible from the bible has proved how to offer salah from the bible about zakat about hajj should not have alcohol about modesty from the bible so even jesus christ peace be upon him he did not come to prince christianity he came to preach islam and almighty god is the same god for all the human beings he has only given one religion no other religion all these are corrupted form of the original religion like how the brother said sufism even that's the corrupted form of islam it is not islam at all what we have to follow is to islam the quran and the say hadith and all the messengers they taught only islam so if you follow jesus christ peace be upon him by going to the scriptures jesus christ never said worship me he never claimed divinity in fact there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be up himself says that he's god or where he says worship me but the christian says you cannot enter paradise until you believe jesus christ died for your sin he was almighty god there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that he's god always says worship me if any christian can show me any statement in the bible where jesus christ peace be upon himself faith that i am god or where he says worship me i'm ready to accept christianity today inside jesus christ peace be upon him said it's mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 28 he said my father is greater than i gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 i with the spirit of god i cast out devil gospel of luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 i with the finger of god cast out devil gospel of john chapter 5 verse number 30 i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will but the will of my father he submitted to almighty god you're the muslim it's clearly mentioned in the book of acts chapter number two verse number 22 said eman of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles which god did by him and your witness to it a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles which god did by him and you are witness to it so if you say christian means a person who follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him then i say we muslims are more christian than the christians themselves but the bible says don't have pork bible says the woman should cover the head it's mentioned in the first corinthians first corinthians chapter number 11 verse number five to seven the woman does not cover a head a head should be shaved off so brother all the messengers of almighty god they taught nothing but islam islam is submitting a will to almighty god so if you submittable to almighty god you'll go to paradise if you don't submit you will not go hope the answer is question"
