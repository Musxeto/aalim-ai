  "title": "Can we use Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) Water for Washing and Bathing? how can you explain that ...",
  "transcript": "this could be a fake question uh but I I require some scientific explanation for this in lot of developing towns there's a shortage of water so they have come up the the local authorities they have come come up with stps water comes out of it they say it is pure except drinking you can use it for taking bath and washing clothes so just wanted to know is it permissible Islamic way because the water is detailed from the you know impure water it is allowed we ask a question that because of the water they take out from the sewage water and they treat it in a way that it becomes pure for everything except drinking now if you realize that there are certain requirements for drinking water about the contents and mineral content Etc so the water they take off from tube well even there they say it is not safe for drinking for washing clothes bath no problem so that is because for drinking it's not pure but otherwise the Islamic aspect is that when you put dirt in the ocean lotion doesn't become dirty then water becomes clear so similarly if they make a treatment such a way that the imperative movement becomes pure no problem I'm just giving a simple example this sewage water fine it is dirty it evaporates it turns into Cloud the cloud water coming on is pure or not so there is a last purification system evaporation and getting down you take it it's 100 pure event for drinking unless there are some problems in the pollution Etc now they are adopting a system and purifying it having a bar doing no problem no problem at all ah purified by evaporation so you know the dirt and feces Etc in the muck and and some area and it's evaporating it becomes clear similar system with a purified so no problem at all hope that's the question"
