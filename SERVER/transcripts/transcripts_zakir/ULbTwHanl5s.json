  "title": "Why is Islam so Sensitive to Criticism? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamualaikum this is a question on behalf of a non-muslim brother his name is swaminathan he's completed his bachelor's in information technology and his question is why is the islamic world so sensitive to criticism and why does salman rushdie or a european cartoonist receive death threat the practice of fatwa is to be more precise isn't there a better way to react to this there should be sisters ask a good question on behalf of a non-muslim brother that why are muslims so sensitive to criticism and in reference to salman rashdi why are you so sensitive to criticism sister every individual is sensitive you show me one human in the world is not sensitive but the sensority keeps on changing the sensitivity keeps on changing certain things are sensitive so things you are not so everything the levels keep on changing each different individual as far as the muslims are concerned we muslims will ever create allah and we love our prophet muslim and our prophet muhammad said that no muslim is a muslim until he loves allah and a messenger more than his own self loves allah and messenger more than his own self now when we analyze the human being some of the human beings love their children the most there was research done that monkeys they loved their children very much so the monkey was put in a well along with the child and water was put water started rising up in that well so the monkey picked up the kid and put in the arms the water rolls it tried to save the child as much as the water kept on rising once it could not it left the challenge jumped out so they love the child a lot but own life is more than the child so left the child because the monkey could not jump along with the child just experiment similarly people like the children they like their own life etc but as far as the muslims are concerned we love allah and a messenger more than ourselves for example if you abuse me i would not like it but i would not mind it i would not like it but i would not mind it take it no problem but if you abuse allah and his messenger i would feel more hurt it is not sensitive it is because they are the closest to me so to the muslims allah and the messenger are the closest even closer than our children closer than our eyes closer than our husband closer than our own life so that there is a word you should say your question should be reframed that why do the muslims love allah and the messenger so much you tell me one human being you get the human being if you are abusing your mother if you abuse on his mother he'll get angry if you abuse in the name of the mother they get angry so we love our allah and our messenger more than our mother also so based on these things the muslims they want to clarify so when salman rushdie being a so-called muslim innovated commerce born in a muslim family when he wrote book and criticized falsely just for a few you know just for money so that's the reason the muslims objected you say are there any better ways there are many ways of objecting i don't agree that all the ways the muslims objected are right many a time they destroyed property which is wrong i don't agree with it but they are sensitive because it deals with our create allah now and a messenger but we should feel bad but some of them overreact some of them took our protests which are violent we should not be some were peaceful which is good best is to reply and if you hear my talk on is religious fundamentalism a stumbling block to the freedom of expression i have given details what did salman rushdie do and how do you write the book and the first country that banned the satanic verses was which country india sri rajiv gandhi at that time was the prime minister he banned that book satanic verses in india the first country to ban it and i appreciate him but unknowingly he did not know that in that same satanic verses besides speaking bad about prophet of islam and allah he even spoke bad about sita and ram sriram which people when they read the book they may not realize they are superficial and imagine i'm asking the question to the british government a few years back there was an american author writer who uses a four-letter word for margaret thatcher's policies margaret touches policy four letter word father uncle cousin king and they banned him from coming to uk why he uses the four letter word this salman rashdi he uses the same word and makes it active ing many times for the british policy for margaret thatcher and he calls you know what in his book maggie the no fine if you say maybe the britishers are bold they wouldn't mind but imagine if you meet the son of margaret thatcher and tell him that salman rashdi called you a son of a what will he do he will hammer you so everyone is sensitive depending upon what the sensitivity is imagine the same british government which banned another american author for using a fault of word allow salman rashdi why the reason is why because he abuses our prophet muhammad so because he abuses the prophet they can digest the same foreign word for margaret thatcher because he abused the prophet of islam so this is how the policies keep on changing so what we realize that in islam there is freedom of expression the freedom of speech but it should not go beyond the limit it should not hurt anyone and it should be with proof if it hurts anyone and if it's logical and proof and different but you cannot mind anyone maligning and backbiting is not allowed in islam so based on that the muslims because salman rushdie he maligned and he abused our prophet muslim that's the reason the muslims are bad and the agitated which agree with it and if we analyze in most of the religions the punishment for blasphemy is high whether you read the bible whether you read the hindu scriptures where they read the quran and this we consider as blasphemy that the reason the muslims were angry and we were sensitive because he spoke against something which we love much more than our life hope that answers the question you"
