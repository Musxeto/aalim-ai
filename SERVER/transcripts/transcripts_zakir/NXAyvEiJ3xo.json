  "transcript": "the next question ramen from azerbaijan he asks if allah knows someone will go to hell then why did he create that person that when we wanted to entrust or give the covenant to the heavens to the earth and to the mountains but they did not take up this trust or covenant because they were afraid of it but man took it we human beings we took this trust we took this covenant we decided to take this test allah subhanahu ta'ala he has given us human beings a free will and the purpose of allah creating us human beings it is for ibadah it is to worship allah subhanahu ta'ala as allah subhanahu talaha in surah yah chapter 51 verse 56 that i have not created the jinn and mankind except worship me we have been created by allah so that we worship him 67 verse number 2 it is allah who has created that and life to test which of you are good in deeds this life is a test for the hereafter allah subhana wa he created the angels they do not have a free will but for human beings we are a unique creation we have a free will and i would like to give you a simple example for example there is a person who has done bachelors in english now this person he appears for an examination and if in the examination he's asked abcd or simple things in english so there is no point in the test there's no point in the examination he has done bachelors in english he needs to be asked something of his level similarly when a college when a university plans to conduct an examination of mbbs for example so this examination it is difficult the university the college knows that certain students will fail but yet the college conducts the examination to test the students to know which students have worked hard allah he has created as human beings he has given us a free will and all those people who do good they will be rewarded they will enter paradise and if someone does wrong he will be punished for those wrong acts we human beings we have a free will if we do good we will be better than the angels because after allah subhanahu talaha has given us a free will we have the option of either doing right or doing wrong we choose to do the right things so we will be rewarded from allah"
