  "title": "Why is there Jannah and Jahannam in Islam? If Allah is Merciful then why does He Punish People?",
  "transcript": "the next question my name is Muhammad from Lucknow India my non-muslim friend asked me why is the Jannah and jahannam in Islam if Allah is merciful then why does he punish people in Hell Fire for committing shirk so basically the brother has two questions why is the Jannah and jahannam and the second question that why does Allah punish people for committing the first question regarding Jannah and jahannam Allah he has created us human beings he has given us human beings a free will this life it is a test for the Hereafter Allah says chapter number 67 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of your God indeeds this life it is a test for the hereafter and based on our Good Deeds based on our righteous Deeds we will enter into The Gardens of paradise there are various levels of Chana the highest it is and if you do bad Deeds we will go into Hell Fire Allah he has given us a free will so our reward the reward for our Good Deeds it is Jannah and I would like to give you a simple example a teacher conduction an examination certain students they fail certain students they get first class first marks they get full marks now can the teacher give all the students full marks of first class first marks but natural no because the students who worked hard they will say why did I toil why did I put in so much effort if I knew that I would get full marks I wouldn't have worked hard I wouldn't have put in so much effort so even if the teacher wants to be merciful in this situation the teacher has to be just similarly if students appear for a medical examination certain students they fail certain students they get High marks now can the examiner can the teacher give all the students High marks but natural no those students who failed they cannot be given High marks because later on when they become a doctor instead of saving human lives they will take human lives they will kill human beings similarly an engineer students they appear for an engineering degree so certain students they get high marks certain students they fail now can the teacher give those students who have failed High marks but naturally no because later on when they get the degree instead of constructing buildings they will end up destroying buildings they will build buildings which will fall down so when the students they appear for the medical examination they get the degree this is their reward that they'll become a doctor Allah based on our Deeds this life it is a test for the Hereafter if we do good deeds if we do righteous Deeds we will enter into The Gardens of paradise if we do bad Deeds we will go into Hell Fire Allah he is the most merciful but at the same time Allah he is just if Allah wanted he could have admitted everyone into Paradise but where lies the test now coming to your second part of the question when you said that why does Allah punish people for committing Allah clearly says in the Glorious Quran and so in this chapter 48 and so in this chapter number 4 verse number 116 in Allah and another place if he pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of silk he will never forgive if he pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of Sheikh he will never forgive and he gives opportunity to human beings several times not once not twice but several times in this life Allah he is merciful but at the same time Allah he is just and if the person if he has committed shirk before he dies if he asks for two repentance Allah he will forgive him I would like to give you an example there is a person who robs the policeman arrests this person now can the policeman say that I am merciful let the robber go squat free but natural no the person has committed a wrong act he needs to be punished for his wrong Act similarly if anyone does anything wrong does bad Deeds Allah he is merciful but at the same time Allah he has to be just with these people I hope that answers your question"
