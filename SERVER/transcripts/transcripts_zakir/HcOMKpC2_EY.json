  "transcript": "as far as the scientists are concerned they have a different philosophy they have a different approach this approach is known as the falsification test the scientist they are so busy there are so many new theories coming about they don't have time to analyze it they say if you have a theory first give us a way to prove your theory wrong if you come about With A New Concept first give us a way show us a way how to prove your theory wrong Albert Einstein in the beginning of 20th century he proposed certain things how does the universe work along with it he give three ways how to prove his theory wrong the scientist they examined for six years and then theyre it was right now anyone who gives a falsification test it deserves to be heard it doesn't mean the person is great or the work is great it may be right may be wrong but anyone who gives the falsification test it deserves to be heard there are innumerable falsification tests mentioned in the Quran you want to prove the Quran wrong it is very easy you try it out very easy there are some falsification test which was meant only for that time when the Quran was revealed some is meant for today some it will be meant till the last day I'll just mention about four or five because of lack of time one very good example is about the story of Abu laab Abu laab he was the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad sah wasallam and he was given this nickname Abu lahab the father of the flame and he was one of the staunchest enemies of the Prophet when whenever he saw anyone speaking with the prophet he used to wait moment the prophet left he used to go to the man and ask him what did the prophet say did he say black it is white did he say day no it is night he used to speak the opposite he was one of the staunchest enemies of the prophet he went out of the way he even lied many a times just to prove the prophet wrong now there's a Surah in the Quran by the name Surah laab chapter number 111 which all of us know very well it's recited many times in the Etc in this Surah it is mentioned that Abu laab and his wife they will burn in the Hellfire indicating they will never become Muslims they will never ever accept Islam now this Surah was revealed about 10 years before the death of Abu lahab when the Surah was revealed only thing Abu laab had to do was accept Islam and the Quran would have been proved wrong not actually many of his companions who were his friends in the span of 10 years they accepted Islam Abul laab later on after 10 years he died in the Battle of bad 10 years he had time the prophet was constantly reminding him for 10 years you accept Islam and the Quran would be proved wrong so easy only thing you had to do was say I am a Muslim finish not that he had to behave like a Muslim not that he had to offer Salah only thing you had to say I'm a Muslim and finish the Quran have been proved wrong so easy very easy he had lied many times against the prophet he had to lie once again and the Quran would have been proved wrong but he could not because author of the Quran is almighty God he knows that Abu laab will never accept Islam falsification test 10 years"
