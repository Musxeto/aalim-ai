  "transcript": "sister sumaiya from dhaka bangladesh she asks how to deal with non-muslims who only use hate speech and mockery in public when i talk with them about islam should i just ignore them allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran chapter 41 verse number 34 nor the good and evil are the same repel evil with that which is better for you will see between you and him who there is enmity will become your close friend do not defeat your enemy but rather win them over win their hearts and win their minds it is compulsory for every muslim to do dhawa and i started the session with the verse of the glorious quran from sunnah chapter number 16 verse number 125 invite all the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preachings and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best and most gracious so the first thing that you should do is do daw with the non-muslims even if they mock you even if they make fun of you yet you should continue doing dawah with hikmah and with husna and if you look at the lifestyle of our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him even he was mocked at the sahaba when they propagated the message of islam they were mocked at they were tortured but this did not prevent them from spreading the message of islam they continued spreading the message of islam so you need to do dawah you need to continue propagating the message of islam even if the non-muslims they mock at you but if the non-muslim their purpose is solely to mock and to make fun of the verse of the glorious quran then you should avoid them you should not sit with them as allah subhanahu tala says chapter number 4 verse number 140 that it has been revealed to you in the book when they hear the verses of the glorious quran they disbelieve in it and they mock at it so do not sit with them until they discuss something else for if you do so you are like them so if they are mocking they are making fun of the verse of the glorious quran then you should not sit with them and you should avoid them but this is the last resort after you have conveyed the message of islam to these non-muslims if there is yet mocking and their purpose is to make fun then you should avoid them and not sit with them"
