  "transcript": "you're a big help um I have one more question I'm a bit confused between the two verses in Quran um the first one is in Surah bakra 62 yeah which says that if you believe in one God and believe in the last day and do good deeds yeah you shall have nothing to fear on the day of judgment yeah and you will get your reward with your lord yeah mind it in this Surah it doesn't say it that you have to believe in the prophet Muhammad please be upon him as the last messenger and there is also another Surah which supports this which is a 22 in chapter number 22 and verse number 17 I think in which it says a similar thing that those who do who believe in one God who believe in the last day and who do good deeds will be fine on the day of judgment but then there is also one more verse in the Quran which says that whosoever amongst you comes to me without the religion of Islam it shall not be accepted of him and he shall be among the losers so in that life transverse does Islam mean believing in one God and believing in Prophet Muhammad and believing in all the other rituals or because Islam means submission so whoever has submitted yeah is submitted so you know what's the meaning of Islam in the last verse of the Quran of Surah chapter 2 verse number 62 that all those who believe in Allah and believe in the last day irrespective whether they are Jews or Christians or sabians they shall have no fear so whether they're asking that here the world doesn't mention believing in Prophet if you read the context of this Revelation brother what happened people came to the prophet and said that we have been Jews we have been Christians we have been sabians can God forgive us in that context the reply was given as long as you believe in Allah and the last day irrespectively previously whether you are a Christian or a Jew or a Sabian you will get the reward it does not mean today a person who says he's a Christian and who believes Jesus Is God he will go to Jannah no it does not mean that not Jesus Is God believes in one God ah believe in one God but if they believe Jesus Is God then they won't go together yes they live in one true God correct so he has to believe in one true God and if he believes in true God he also follows the Commandment of God simple yeah but maybe he's confused with that yeah so that means he's believed in a confused God he believed he believes in his creator yeah but he is not yet reached that level well then if you ask me the question a person who truly believes in God and little bit confused from his heart and yet doesn't believe in Prophet Muhammad will he go to heaven or hell that's your question my question is he's clear that there is one God clear that one God is confused in the prophet he does not do idle worship he does not do that he believes in one God and does good deeds and believes in the last day can you go to Jannah is your question yes fine this answer and I'll come to your last question also about that Islam is only way of life the other verses talk about Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so if you truly believe you have to believe in Prophet Muhammad but if you ask me no suppose I believe in God never died today yes you feel it good deed you believed in God but no I have two verses of the Quran supporting me that you believe in one God you do good deeds and you believe in the last day you shall have nothing to fear on that day yeah two verses but the context of the verse is what yeah the context of the verses when people came to Prophet Muhammad sallam and they wanted to accept Islam that previously we were Jews we were Christians then the verses said the context is important and coming back to your first question that Quran says in Surah Al Imran chapter 3 verse number 19 in the Islam the only reason acceptable in the sight of Allah is submitting our will to God submitting yeah and Quran also says Imran chapter 3 verse 85 if anyone desires any other religion besides Islam it will never be accepted of him and he shall be amongst the losers so not submitting a will to God means first you have to find out which is the true God yes and when you find out you have to come to Allah yes you can't say I believe in true God but in Jesus I believe I believe I believe in Allah so if you believe in Allah you have to follow what is the Commandment of Allah now when you believe in Allah and if you don't come to commandment of Allah that means it's not a true Allah I believe Allah is not created by anyone he is not born of anyone he doesn't have kids uh he you know correct I believe in that yeah but that's that's where my state is that's right yeah but now now that's not complete Islam that's part of Islam yeah part of Islam even believing it fed alone will not take it take it with profit but too bad it do not go to heaven fine so what they have to realize if you believe that true God when you know where you got the school of Allah was from where from where you got this from the Quran yes so from the Quran you also get the style of the Kalima yeah that uh there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is a messenger of God yeah now Islam has this distinct style I have not seen this style in Christianity or Judaism that kind of Kalima do I don't know I mean is it was there the same kind of no religions as well no you know why yeah because it says there is no God but Allah and similar similar in those things I'll tell you and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger and servant so no one should worship Prophet Muhammad therefore is mentioned there fine that in what Jesus would have not not in Arabic at every time that you have to believe in the prophet to be a Muslim yeah so at that time you have to believe in one God and you have to believe Jesus for the prophet of God at the time of Moses you have to believe that there's no God but Allah and Moses was the messenger of Allah you have to believe in that I understand but did you see that reference it is understood there's no reference in the Quran the Quran says they were Messengers it is understood and if I don't believe in Jesus now also I'm not a Muslim Quran says you have to believe in each and every messenger today so believing that time was a must and today you have to believe in Musa you ask in the question did you have to believe that time simple logic yes I know you have to believe at that time as well what I'm saying is why don't I see any any Kalima like that in today's Christianity or Judaism well today's Christianity change Christianity I don't change it is change brother they have changed the messenger to God it is mentioned in the bible today also that Jesus is not God he never claimed Divinity he's the messenger of God that's for the teaching of the churches yes yes today's form is the change form how about Judaism they still believe there is only one God they don't require Moses as God so did you see a Kalima like there is only one God and Musa no but they believe that Musa was a messenger of God they believed in that yeah but at the same time they even believe that he was an imposter Jesus Christ peace be upon him so that's wrong yeah if you believe Jesus imposter knows billah that is wrong so so you find some of the other mistakes here or there right therefore Quran is the furqan Quran means the criteria to judge right from wrong so whatever matches with the Quran we agreed the word of God what is against the Quran contradicts he says not the word of God what doesn't contradict and doesn't match ambiguous maybe that may be right I understand your point sir what I'm saying did you see any reference in probably in your study of Judaism is gone I mean they don't even have that maybe Aramaic maybe it will be an Aramaic I don't know I don't know of any such right right so I mean so so they were still believing in this thing that you have to believe in Moses as messenger yes but there is nothing concrete like you know like I don't know if any in the scripture right right okay right okay well my last question is last yeah after the last just last week last of the last last of the last yes recently in India it was in the news that uh same-sex marriages got allowed yeah and and uh on reading upon it yeah I found out that they said that it is at the genetic level of people genetic it's in the hormones yeah what they desire what they don't desire now I understand that Islam is completely against this it doesn't allow this but what I'm saying is if someone's got that at a genetic level yeah and it's his choice and he was he was he was born with that uh with that kind of tendency and yet Islam chooses to to punish him do something on something that he was born with so God sounds illogical yeah so go on go on made him like that and God is punishing him for that as well brother asked a question that recently in India homosexuality has been permitted not permitted but the law says it's not a big crime that was there in the Indian constitution they have softened it not permitted yet yes it is a court case that took place in Delhi it's not a law yet yes there are many organizations fighting against it so no law it's a law in Canada in USA in UK not in India yet right okay and today there are some scientific research that say that homosexuality is genetic so whether that's the question if homosexual genetic then who's to blame how can you consider it to be a sin very good question this research was done earlier a few years back and later on what was found out that this is totally false and the person who propounded this himself was homosexual right okay so there's no scientific proof yet it's an assumption right science doesn't testify yet that homosexuality is genetic right in fact Quran says chapter number seven verse number 81 which says that do you have Lust For Men more in preference to women to homosexuality talking about yes it is private in the Bible also talking about Islam yes also in the Quran is prohibited yes homosexuality is provided completely right it is the assumption that it's genetic it's not genetic at all how does it happen I'll tell you yeah the psychology they tell us that once you overdo a thing you start losing the pleasure so what God has permitted the normal sexual way of life you start overdoing it you start doing unnatural things right what God has permitted natural things you do unnatural you start doing from the reverse side so once you get fed up of doing it so often that's the reason Santa Fe research says a person who has no extramarital affairs enjoys the sexual life with his wife and husband the maximum yeah but this tendency is found in small children I mean you know yeah so I mean they have not got married yet let me complete yeah yeah welcome to children later on for them talking about the adults yes how it comes in children I'll tell you it okay so what happened there once you start overdoing it you want to enjoy more so that thing what is normal doesn't excite you any longer then you start doing unnatural things it's not genetic talking about children how it comes in children it doesn't just come out from birth it's not from birth because there were pornographic movies right they watch blue films it's Haram the parents the way they behave in front of the children all this has a psychological impact on the child don't tell a person who's born then you start becoming human it's not like that at all it's a misconception right scientific doesn't say that right it is because of the overexposure now children watch the blue flames yeah the channels free to Air you know the more pornographic channels than other channels yeah very good money so because of the media that's how when they see on the channel they start emulating and that's how they divert so they will be responsible for that right okay okay that answers me that's fine uh one thing you said was that the last question yes what has to be logical you said yeah so why didn't you don't have to be logical God is logical okay so why did he choose taking into account Islam is the correct religion why did he choose to bring you into this world in Islam and so many others in a different religion so so that means he's being partial from the birth very good very good question let's ask the question that some people are born in Muslim family and a person more in Muslim family chances Muslim Modern non-muslim Family non-muslim so why is God impartial maybe you are born in a Muslim family would I be a Muslim correct yes usually goes very good question the criteria to go to Jannah is not to be born in a Muslim family her beloved Prophet Allah said every child is born in the he's born as a Muslim he submit civil to God later on he's been influenced by his parents by Elders best teachers then you start doing idle worship fire worship he converts therefore when a non-muslim become the Muslim the more Prophet word is reward rather than convert he comes back to the original Faith now the criteria to go to Jannah is not to be born in the Muslim family the criteria is 103 verse number one to three he says except those who are faith those who have righteous deeds those who have got people the truth and those are people to Patient perseverance the criteria go to Jannah is all four things Iman righteous Deeds exotic people the truth exotic people if a person is born in Muslim family the first criteria the chances are more not the remaining three yes fine now you you may be born in a righteous family but not having Iman I don't know yeah but I mean why was he born in a Christian family or a Hindu family you know he should be born although it's more likely that he gets the other things there are four things to go to Jannah if a person is born in a Muslim family but does not have righteous Deeds does not do dhawa he'll go to hell yeah okay they will not go to heaven only by having a name Zakir Muhammad Abdullah Sultan will not take you to heaven even practice is important you may be born in a family which has righteous needs but may not be having Iman so everyone has different combination but almighty God says chapter number 41 verse number 53 soon we shall show them our signs in the first region of the horizons and into the soul until it is clear to them that this is the truth so Allah takes it upon himself that to every human being he'll put in his heart directly that this is the truth like how God sent me to put it directly into hadiya yeah there's no advantages yeah no no there are advantages advantages it's a big Advantage you got everything very easy but for a person who's in a different religion it's it's a com he doesn't even come back you got so easy in three hours you got it directly very easy right or wrong you don't think it to be easy yes see how you take it I'm saying how lucky you are compared to the other non-muslims you attended my talk yes yet you're not accepting it who's to blame you are God you want to make it big you make it big you want to make it important it is important yeah the problem is that almighty God puts in every human being directly not always to doctors I am only point zero zero zero zero one percent yeah it's not me some through me some through other some directly so on the day of judgment you cannot complain to God at least you cannot complain you cannot go and tell God I didn't know about Islam yeah I cannot you cannot yeah because you know you may be having more knowledge of Islam than many Muslims born in Muslim families yeah because the way of quoting Quran the way you're asking me question I'm sure so now after reading so much about Islam and yet if you don't accept Allah will question you you have no excuse whatsoever the other non-muslim will deal with them afterwards let's talk about you first yes you have no question at all yes on the day of judgment I have I I can say there were a few things which I was I did not get the right answers no there are many Muslims who are born in Muslim family not few have many questions which are not answered yes you have few they have many so you're in a better position you cannot complete to God and you have a few questions not answered I have a good give God that these are the bases because they did not get answered that's why I did not accept it if I don't accept it maybe I will later I don't know which question you don't have tell me now tell me now come on you can tell God doctors in front of 20 30 000 people what question you don't know about the Quran come on first of all I the answer that you gave that it is because because I know small small kids who don't even have access to that and still they have that those rich kids name them what nonsense they're talking I'm a medical doctor what do you know are you a medical doctor I'm a medical doctor fine okay now you are telling a doctor you have seen if I tell you that I have seen a building made of paper you know come in Bombay I have seen a building the pillars are made of paper will you believe in it I won't I have not seen it you're finished yeah see this is the first as the person who knows now I have seen you have seen does it carry weight yeah I have seen a building made of paper will you believe your point is that it's only because of media but I know no point is it is not genetic there is no scientific proof at all it is genetic I'm telling you right right what I'm telling you it can be one of the reasons what is there can be 20 other reason one of the reasons can be media you tell me it can't be medial disprove you right right one of the reasons can be media right fine yeah yeah yeah very good actually I have to go through all the other questions but but hope it's not too late I don't know how long I would live see if I die in the state of getting more knowledge yeah then I can always tell God that I was no no you cannot you cannot I'm telling you cannot you cannot I will give Sharda on the day of judgment I give you a chance you cannot see I don't know I'm gonna live tomorrow or not since 90 of my questions are answered but then I'll have to go through more things people accept Islam with ten percent acceptance so that girl according to me you have more knowledge than all the people who accepted Islam yeah that's true maybe that's true but my principle is unless I'm 100 clear I will I will not take such a big step I will only take that big step many things you did in life without knowing hundred percent did you know how much that you gave me 100 percent yeah see that way I'm ready to say the the thing but but the thing is I've seen some Muslims who say that if if you have iota of Doubt then you're not a Muslim so who said that who said that they say if you have are you going to follow the Quran are you going to say some Muslim forget about Muslims no you want to judge you have to believe it in 100 even if you have 99 Faith who said that who said that does the Quran say that it doesn't say that you follow Quran don't follow the other Muslim don't follow me as follow Quran so if I tell you if I tell you that I believe that Prophet Muhammad was a prophet of God 90 and 10 I have doubts am I am I a Muslim no Do You Believe In messenger or not a god other doubts are separate I believe in one God and I believe in his Messengers 90 percent I believe it is yes 90 I have waste ten percent who don't believe tell me now I'll clarify that I can't recall those questions this is escapism no not really I'm not into my heart I am not escaping I am not asking you to accept Islam I'm not asking you I know I'm only telling you if God forbid something happens to you before you accept Islam you will not be forgiven I am only telling you another wife I'm not being prejudiced here I'm trude being to take your time take your time when you need me you can call me on the email my pleasure to reply to you brother how do you spell i r f dot net it's a short form for Islamic Research Foundation right okay yes or you can watch me on peace TV all right okay thank you so much"
