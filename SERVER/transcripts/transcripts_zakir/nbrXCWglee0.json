  "title": "What is the Authentic Method for Performing the Eid Prayer? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "could you explain to me what is the authentic method for performing the e prayer and perhaps you would give us a short description for the benefit of the viewers watching today as far as eid salah is concerned there are different types of muslims pray and their different opinion but as far as you go across authentic sources the quran and the say hadith then you have one common method and according to the authentic sources of all the say hadith if you collect we come to know that as far as each salah is concerned whether they'll be idle or other we have to offer two salah two rakat salah two units of salah it's mentioned the hadith of sunan bahaki vomit number three book of jamaa salah hadith number 5719 allah be pleased with him he said that the traveller's prayer is two rakat the other prayer is two rakaat talking about idul ada and the jummah prayer is to rakhat this is the full length of all these prayers as it came from the messenger of allah that means allah should be two rakat point number two that before each salah there is no other and there is no karma it's mentioned in say muslim verb number two in the book of salah hadith number one nine two nine jabba bin samura he said that he prayed along with the messenger of allah both the eats on more than one or two occasions and there was no aadhaan and no akama that means for each salah there should be no other and no karma it's different than the normal congregation masala point number three that there is no salah before the each salah and after the salah there's no torah sunnah before after that and it's mentioned in the hadith of sunan abu dhabi volume number one in the book of salah hadith number 1155 where ibn abbas minlab plays with him he says that the prophet came out to pray the eat salah on israel's fifa day and he offered to rakhat and before that and after that he did not pray that before and after he salah there are no other prayers further point number four when a person starts salah he should say the al-eram that's allah and then say the open supplication this is followed by seven takbir in the first rakat and in the second record he should say faith be this we come to know from the authentic sources of sunan abu dawud volume number one in the book of salah hadith number 1145 and 1146 bihar aisha she says that the prophet when needs to offer the idol father and the idol that means he used to say seventh take beer in the first akkad and fight be in the second rakah this is the authentic way of offering his salah after that a person should say bill llahim in the sheraton regime christmas i seek refuge with allah from satan their curse and in the name of allah most gracious most merciful and then he should recite surah and after surah fatiha in the first takakat recites surakov chapter number 50 followed by in the second rakat surah kamar chapter number 54 or in the first akkad you can recite surah allah chapter number 87 and second rakat surah gashiya chapter number 88 both these types of first and second rakah have been proven from authentic hadith but even if a person recites any other surah any other verse of the quran yet the salah will be accepted these are the recommended ones it is sunnah which the prophet recited furthermore after the eat salah there is a quba it's mentioned say bihari volume number two in the book of tweets hadith number nine six two abney abbas miller pleases me said that he has offered each salah with the messenger of allah subhanahu ta permanent them all and all of them they offered the it's allah first then was followed by the all of them they gave the khudba after offering the eat salah it further mentioned in sunan abu daoud number one in the book of salah hadith number 1151 prophet muslim offering salah and before starting the khudba of ed he said that all those who want to listen to the khutbah can listen to the khutba all those who want to go they can go now here's a very important point most of the times you find in the khutba of each salah most of the imams say they don't get up it is wrong and they prevent them from going and they say you have a sin and they say many things it's haram to get up etc imagine the prophet muslim and he gave the khutbah he said if you want to listen you can listen if you want to go you can go does it mean that the imam the quran that they give today is much more important than the quran it's a pity they say these says that the prophet muhammad said if you want to hear the quran if you want you can go but it's preferable to hear the khutbah but the prophet gave permission that if they want they can go and further it's mentioned in sunan abu daoud or number one in the book of salah hadith number one zero six eight the prophet said that both the eids have synchronized the idol fifa and the friday friday is called as weak lead so those who do not want to offer the juma salah may not do it because the east saline congregation is sufficient but we will offer the juma salah that means imagine the eighth prayer is so important in congregation so if it falls on the same day eid sallah is sufficient juma salah may not be paid but if you pray it is good alhamdulillah but those who don't pray juma sallah it becomes compulsory that they should pray the duhar salah this was in short regarding the authentic way of offering the itself"
