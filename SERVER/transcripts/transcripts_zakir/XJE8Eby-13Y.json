  "transcript": "Alhamdulillah. My special elders and my dear brothers and sisters, I welcome all of you with the Islamic greetings. Assalamu alaykum. May peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah subhananaa tala be honor of you. It's a pleasure for me to be in Tanzania especially in the city of Darus Salam. It is my first visit to this country. I was there in Zanzibar for the last couple of days and now I'm in Dar Salam. It was my desire to visit Tanzania and finally Allah has made it possible. Alhamdulillah. The topic of this evening's talk of mine is what is the purpose of our lives? What how many times have we thought of this of this question? What is the purpose of our lives? What is the purpose of our existence? Why are we here? What are we doing here? Let us analyze today from the people over here in this auditorium. How many of you have ever thought before what is the purpose of our lives? Please raise your hand. How many of us have thought before what is the purpose of our lives? Or maybe about 20%. Okay, about 15 to 20% have thought. Is it a requirement for us to know what is the purpose of our life? Is it a must? I will give you a few examples to make you realize whether it is a requirement or not. Once there was a person who came at a crossroad and he asked a passer by where does this road go? So the passer by asked him where do you want to go? He says anywhere. So the passer by replied then it makes no difference which road you take because the person had no goal. He had no destination. So what different does it make which road he takes? So why is he asking where does the road go? This person had no goal, no destination. Let me give you one more example of a person who has no goal. Once the builder, he lays the foundation of making a building. So someone asks him how many stories is the building? He says I don't know what is the total area of the building. He says I don't know. So imagine a person lays the foundation of the building doesn't know how many story building it is doesn't know what is the total area no goal. So in our life if we don't know the purpose we are like that passes by and we are like the builder. Let me give you one more example. Once a person asks his neighbor, your dog, he always chases cars and vehicles, I'm wondering, will he ever catch up with any car? So his neighbor replies, you are thinking, will he ever catch up with any car? I'm thinking what will he do if he catches up with the car? Even if he catches up with the car, what will the dog do? So this means a purposeless goal. His goal is to catch up with the car. But what will he do after catching up with the car? So this is the second example of purposeless goal. For example, many of us we are doing graduation. When we ask him what will you do after graduation? I don't know. Why do you want to become a graduate? I don't know. So his goal is to become a graduate. But he has no purpose. This is the second example of having a goal without purpose."
