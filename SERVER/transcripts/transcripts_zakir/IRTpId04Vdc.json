  "title": "Yogesh Asks Dr Zakir, “If Quran is for whole Humankind, why should Hindus be Punished...\" – Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "the miss question is by Yogesh in goalie from Kolkata India associating partners with God with the number one media scene as per as LOM all Hindus do such worship and associate partners with God multiple how will it be a media thing for them as they are not Muslim so if Quran is for all mankind then such non-muslims who never knew that such a thing exists will not build accountable for the sin and on the day of judgment will they be punished but the Yogesh has asked a very important question that the Hindus who don't know about the concept of majors in the concept of sharing how will they be held responsible on the day of death point number one all the major religions if you read the scriptures they talked about monotheism believing in one God whether it be Christianity with a big you die including Islam and including Hinduism if you read in the scriptures there are various verse is talking about monotheism and talking about not to do shake if you will in the scriptures and on your punishes chap number six section number two was number one it failed it come every DTM garlic only one without a second it's mentioned in the sweetest letter of punish a chap number six was the my name that Nicosia casted dani.timus a dipper of that God he have got no parents he have got no mother you have got no father he has got no submitted it's mentioned in the center center of punish a chap number force number nineteen not just petty masti of that God there is no pratima pratima the sanskrit word which means an image it also means the photograph it means the portrait it means an idol it means the sculpture it means a statue so here so it hasit ro punish a chap number for stamina am saying not st patema asti of that God there is no image there is no photograph there is no portrait there is no Idol that is no sculpture there is no statue the similar message is given in the 8th chapter 32 verse number 3 made faith Tripathi must be of that God there is no image there is no photograph there is no portrait there is no idea there is no sculpture there is no statue further it's mention you wait chap number 40 verse number 9 and that map of Ashanti yeah Isamu team opacity they are entering darkness those who worship the assemble T as some good theme Sanskrit means the natural things like water fire air and there was continuous they are entering boy in darkness those who worship the Sun booty those who worship the created things some booty miss created things like table chair idols etc so it's clearly mentioned in the scriptures that there is only one God and you should not worship the natural things neither should you worship the created things without doubt and the brahma sutra of hinduism is a Cumbre duty a nasty nanana spec engine Bhagwan a key hey do sera nahi nahi Hanna here there I mean he there's only one God not a second one not at all not at all not in the least bit so if you read in the scriptures even the in the scriptures believe in one God and in the scripture is engaged in worship but unfortunately the pundits and the scholars of Hinduism they hide this from the masses for the personal benefit if you hear my lecture and read my book on similarity bridge slamming into ism or I can go to the website zakir naik calm you'll find all these references and coming to a second part of the question that they may not be aware may be in the Hindu he may not be a practicing Hindu and he may be do men to worship renata be aware mention in the scripture Allah says in the Quran clearly in surah fussilat chapter number 41 verse number 53 Sun URI him I Athena fell off a tree Rafi unfussy him Hatta yet abuyin Alaura that food we shall show them all signs in the furthest regions of the horizons until it is clear to them that this is the truth so Allah takes it upon himself that before a human being died he will give this message that there is only one God and he alone should be worshipped very clearly whether you deliver the message or not whether I did or the message or not whether we read the holy scriptures or not Allah has taken it upon himself that he will deliver this message to every human being before the person dies but because of the society the person understands the message Madame is okay for now if I follow Islam I have to give up my business I'm after stop drinking alcohol I may have to stop cheating so all these associated factors doesn't allow him to follow the guidance I received so who's to blame he's to blame and if a person is left alone without any interference he will come to the straight path and those I refer is not on two types the kabocha tribe and the Australian Aborigines and these two tribes did not come in contact with modern civilization till as late in 1950 and when they went and they did research they found out that they believed everything same concept of the creator of God like Islam but they didn't call themselves Muslims they believe there is one God they believe that making images of God is wrong they believe idol worship was wrong and for worshiping they did decide that they did prostration it was everything what is in Islam but by me about the concept of God that means if you let a person without any external influence of human beings of teachers or philosophers they will believe in time this is the dinner cetera therefore beloved prophet said every child is born in the military is born as a Muslim later on he gets convinced by the elders by parents by teacher then he may start doing idol worship me start doing fire worship so if no external influence is there he remained on little filter and whether he gets the message or not Allah will give him the message directly then of course on the day of judgment he will never object to Allah and last justice he will only say that I don't mind giving the full wealth in the world to you to save me Allah I said too late he will only say that please give me one more chance Allah switched on it so that varies in every human being to read the scripture reading scripture will come to the straight path read the Quran and they should worship only one God and should not associate partners with him"
