  "transcript": "my name is shanti my friend abdul brought me here actually i never expected a mass so you know huge and though i have been in conversation with this friend abdul he has cleared a few doubts but coming here after especially hearing usa i am appalled appalled by the truth of islam but here you you've given the name peace but in the world so much strife is going on and well there's something called peace which you have to go in search of don't you think that um you need to address the world in you know on the whole sister question that she had little knowledge about islam from a friend she came to this talk she was impressed with the audience she is appalled with the knowledge and my speech and she said that shouldn't we speak about peace throughout the world to the world at large sister if you really appreciated the talk and really impressed with the matter i've spoken suggest that i would request you to accept this religion of submitting evil to god and if you accept submittable to god then is the time you can get true peace islam comes from the root word salam which means peace it's also derived from the arabic word film which means to submit your will to god so the best way you can get peace is by submitting a will to almighty god so first of all i will come to the rest of the world i am first interested in you sister directly because you asked the question first i would like you to be at total peace so my request is that if you accept the way of life of submitting a will to almighty god and be at peace i would be very happy sister as far as telling the world at large about peace this is an exhibition a conference is the vision of islam we have such exhibitions and this is the fourth such exhibition we had a similar one in bombay a couple of months back from the 23rd of november to 2nd of december in bombay and the audience here what you see on the last day was multiple times more 200 000 so if this impressed you maybe 10 15 000 that was 20 times more in bombay more than 200 000 for the last talk of mine the topic was peace the solution for humanity or is islam the solution of humanity and i do agree with you that these small number ten thousand fifteen thousand two hundred thousand bombay is a very small number we should proclaim it to the world at large that's the reason two years back we have started a channel by the name of peace tv and this peace tv alhamdulillah in the past two years at present it reaches throughout the world all the countries in asia middle east africa australia europe north america alhamdulillah and today it has the reaches more than 90 percent of the world they can watch if they want to watch but the people that are watching are more than 75 million it is the largest watched islamic channel in the world alhamdulillah percentage-wise little bit more than one percent of the human population so at least i can bear witness to almighty god on the day of judgment that we at least gave the message to one percent of the human population 75 million we pray to allah may the viewership increased but those who want to watch you only have to put a dish maybe of 6 000 rupees less than 200 dollars and almost any part of the world you can watch this channel so we are also conveying this message of peace islam throughout the world but now i am interested sister that hope you accept this message of peace yes you"
