  "title": "Corruption and Wrongdoings are a must to run a Successful Business.How can a Muslim do Business?",
  "transcript": "the next question is from syed always from gujarat india i am 23 years old alhamdulillah and currently i am handling my father's business in today's fast paced world corruption and wrongdoing have become necessities to run a successful business as a muslim how can i practice my faith as well as handle my business without compromising in my team it's a very important question as by brother syed always and he says that today you cannot run a successful business without doing malpractice without corruption without lying i do agree with you partly but not completely i do agree that there are many businesses if you do malpractice if you do corruption if you tell lies you'll make a better profit but i don't agree with it completely there are occasions mashallah that if you're honest if you're truthful you will have a better clientage in the long run it will benefit you in business it will give you more profit but i do agree with you that by corruption by cheating many people make a lot of profit but for a muslim allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 67 verse number two allah has created that in life to test which of you is good in deeds this life that we're leading is a test for the hereafter and allah is testing you how do you lead your life and allah says in the quran that if you seek this dunya allah will give you this dunya but will not give you ashraf but if you seek for the akhirah allah will give you akhira and the dunya so as a muslim you should not involve in any activity which is haram you cannot do corruption you cannot tell lies you cannot fabricate i am aware that in many businesses if you lie you get a better profit if you cheat you get a better profit if you fabricate but as i told you this is not the case always in the long run if you're honest you benefit more if you're honest the clients keep on trusting you better irrespective whether it benefits you in this world or not as a muslim if you follow the teachings of the quran being honest do not cheat in the weights do not cheat in the measurement do not lie be truthful if you do this insha allah you will benefit in akhara and allah will even give you benefit in this world and that's the reason we find that many of masha'allah the muslims who are very strict to quran and sunnah they may not be very well qualified in the business acumen but because they follow quran and sunnah you find that the business flourishes a lot and irrespective whether you benefit here or not so if you're handling your father's business and if you really care for your father first thing you have to do is think about that it will benefit you and your father in yahara and after benefiting inshallah it will even benefit you and i always say and i give these examples to the muslims that if you are doing a business then make allah subhanahu talaha a partner in business what you should do you should say that whatever profit i make i will spend part of this profit in charity you start with small why don't you start with okay ten percent of my profit i will give in the way of allah maybe if you make a profit every month of ten thousand dollars once you start giving ten percent you give thousand dollar every month in charity inshallah your profit will increase to twenty thousand then what you do okay increase your child to 15 so when you were getting 10 000 you had only 10 000 with you the moment you started giving thousand dollars 10 percent profit your profit increased to 20 000 from the twenty thousand you're giving ten percent two thousand yet eighteen thousand is with you now instead of ten thousand you have eighteen thousand with you now momentarily twenty thousand you start getting fifteen percent profit now from twenty thousand you are giving three thousand dollar in charity in the way of allah yet seventeen thousand is with you eleven increase your profit would make you thirty thousand dollars the moment allah keeps on increasing whether allah increases or not you keep on increasing the share of allah the share in charity and inshallah the balance remaining with you will be a bigger amount than the previous balance the more percentage of profit you give in the way of allah your percentage reduces but your total amount increases and i can be a witness the best example is myself alhamdulillah in my earlier stages of dawah my parents and my brother supported me completely 100 i didn't have to think about my living but the moment i started doing my own business i have to just spend maybe a couple of days in a month a few hours a week because i'm a full-time guy i dedicated my life full-time for the sake of tala in business initially i started giving 25 of my profit in the way of allah then i started giving 51 and i kept on increasing the moment i kept on increasing my profit the percentage of profit to allah i will not tell you until what limit i went masha'allah i started earning millions of dollars in a year and sometimes million dollar even in a month so subhanahu wa allah pleased me so the bigger percentage you give to allah allah your percentage becomes small but the money remaining from it is mashaallah so i request you that when you're handling your father's business see to do not break any rule of the quran or the sunnah be very honest inshallah allah will give you baraka in the hereafter as well as dunya"
