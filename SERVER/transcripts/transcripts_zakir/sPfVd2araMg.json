  "transcript": "next question I can hear two aans from different mosque and the timing of both the adans differ by a few minutes when should I break fast at the first or second Adan as far as breaking of the fast is concerned the two adans and both that I'm differ you have to find out that which of the two M mentions the aan pronounces thean at the right time the right time is in the sunsets as the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said it's mentioned in s bukari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1954 that when the Night comes from this side and the day vanishes from this side and the sun sets that's the time if you break the fast so best is you have to first find out which of the two m is pronouncing the Adan in the right time or if there's a doubt best is today's the age of Science and Technology we have a chart which exactly tells the time when the sun sets and you can match it with your own watch the time or you can match the Adan which of the two more than give the right Adan and that's the right time we should break the fast you should not say that whichever M GI first have to break if there's a difference try and find out which of the two M pronounces at the right time or best is you do yourself you verify your watch on the right time see the timetable and break the fast at the right time"
