  "title": "Can People of Opposite Gender be Friends? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question is asked by abdullah ammar from afghanistan i have recently got admission at the university and as it's a co-educational system i have developed relationships and started talking with some of my female classmates through whatsapp and messenger even though we consider each other as brother and sister relationship but i found that this is leading me astray from the straight path like i cannot pray at times right now and i cannot concentrate in my salah and many more things you please tell me if it's permissible what i'm doing is right and if it's not permissible please give me an advice how can i get myself out of this situation it's not only me who is going through these situations but there are many muslims whose fate is same as mine there is another question on the same topic asked by assad nadeem on the youtube can people of opposite gender be friends the question posed by abdullah ammar from afghanistan is a very common question and it's common today that people go to co-educational schools co-educational universities and it's very common that when they go there they have friends of opposite sex as the question posed that can you have friends of the opposite gender and they get involved and it leads them away from the teachings of islam as far as having friends of the opposite gender is concerned what do you mean by the word friend is important if you're talking about acquaintances having of opposite gender no problem having acquaintances as long as you do not break any of the teachings of the quran and say hadith as long as you do not break any of the ruling of the sharia you can have a coincidence of opposite sex and we come to it inshallah shortly regarding saying that i consider them to be my sister and brother you have to understand what do you mean by brother and sister if you're talking about brother and sister and humanity no problem if you're talking about brother and sister in faith no problem but this brother and sister is not the same as brother and sister of blood this is totally nonsense you know like we have in india a girl ties a rakhi to the boy she is my rocky sister there is no sister in islam sister in humanity okay like i say sisters asked a good question sister in faith no problem but all these sisters of humanity and faith you have to do full and total hijab with them only with your blood sister where your parents are common whether both parents are one parent then the hijab is relaxed even with your cousin you have to maintain your full hijab the problem is that we see in the western countries it's very common that the intermingling of sexes and many of the muslim countries this is becoming common in them too where you have co-education schools you have co-educational universities and there you have friends and you keep on chatting and you keep on speaking things which are not required if you speak with an opposite sex things which are required as an emergency no problem but you cannot do chatting like how you do with the same sex like a boy has a boyfriend no problem you can chat you can laugh you can joke but you cannot do the same thing with an opposite sex who's an amira it's not permitted in islam what we find and it's very clearly mentioned as far as hijab is concerned before talking about the hijab for the woman hijab for the woman is given in the quran that a muslim should be properly covered and i discussed that in my previous session then also in my lectures that complete body should be covered the only part can be seen are the face and hands up for the wrist etc but this is only the hijab of the clothes the complete hijab besides the hijab of the clothes is the hijab of way a lady walks the way a lady talks the way a lady thinks the way a lady sees before talking about the hijab of the female the woman in the quran allah talks about the hijab of the men in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 30 where allah says say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and guard his modesty that means whenever a male looks at a female any brazen thought coming in his mind he should lower his case there was once a boy staring at a girl for a long time so tell me brother what are you doing it's not allowed in islam he told me that a prophet said the first glance is forgiven the second is prohibited i have not completed half my glands what did the prophet mean when he said that the first glance is forgiven the second is prohibited what it means that if you accidentally look at a woman do not look at her again to feast on a beauty that does not mean you can look at a woman for 10 minutes without blinking and saying that i have not completed my glance so maintaining the hijab is very important therefore it is not advisable for taking education in a co-educational university and if you have to take education if there's no other option then you have to maintain your hijab when you're speaking with the opposite sex you should lower your game you cannot stare at the woman or look into our eyes and talk in the western country if you do not look into the eyes and speak it's also like an insult so what we find that even the muslims when they go to western countries they do not follow this hijab when i visited islamic organizations in western countries i find that muslim ladies and gents sisters and brothers they are freely intermingling they're freely talking they may be wearing the hijab they may be covered their hair is covered but that is the physical ninja only of the clothes they are laughing they are joking in some of the western countries i found a man and a woman sitting alone in a small room and chatting muslim woman doing the howard or non-muslim boy in a closing it's not allowed a beloved prophet muslim said that if two names alone in a room the third person is a devil it's not allowed that you can be in a closed room a man and a woman and some organization have gone and seen that that of the organization has the lady secretary how can you have a lady secretary do you think all the muslim men in that country are not capable or aren't they qualified i cannot understand that how can a practicing muslim have a lady secretary how can they maintain the job if the secretary comes in the room in your room and no one else is there it's not permitted it is very common unfortunate they are preaching islam and they are not practicing islam so if you break the hijab there are high chances what the brother has asked ammar will happen your focus will go away from education you will start thinking other things as though your brother sister for namesake but then love affair starts and you deviate from the sharia and you start doing un-islamic things therefore best is to educate yourself in a single sex university and there was a survey done in uk that the schools which were single sex had better performance and single sex universities as compared to universities which were quite and that's the same thing in india also if it's a single sex education the performance is better because many a time in a co-education each sex is trying to impress the other sex so if a teacher is teaching the boy is trying to impress the girl in his class rather than paying attention on the subject this is very common so single sex education is better if there's no other posture then if you're doing higher education if you have to go to a quiet education see to maintain your hijab i'm not talking only about universities even if you go in office places your hijab should be maintained it is not that you are prohibited to speak with opposite sex no but when you speak you have to be careful there's a verse revealed in the quran in surah azha chapter number 33 verse number 32 which is addressed to the wife of the prophet um it says that oh wise of the prophet be not too complacent in your voice lest in whose heart is a disease he will have desires imagine the wives of the prophet they are called as um it is not permitted for anyone else to marry the wives of the prophet even after the prophet has died the quran is revealing a verse for the wives of the prophet be not too complacent in your voice lest in whose heart is a disease he may have some desires imagine the sahabas who are the highest level among the muslim ummah the prophet said the best generation was the sabbath there is no human being today on the face of the earth which is anywhere close to the sabbath there is no woman who is anywhere close to the muatru moment yet allah says to the moment do not be complacent in your voice why so that in whose heart is the disease can the sabbah have a disease in the heart you cannot think of it yet for safety as a precaution allah reveals this verse and today we find the woman in the offices in muslim organizations in muslim companies they are talking to each other they are laughing leave our side complacent they are joking what they think only wearing the scarf hijab is done they are totally wrong and unfortunately this western culture is even populating into the muslim countries nowadays we find muslim countries also muslim men and women they freely talk they're freely mixed if you required if there's a requirement you have to talk then you can talk but when you talk don't look iron to eye lower your gaze how many muslims do you find today in the world when they speak to a namiram lady that the lower they give very few in the western country hardly you will be counted like a joker but believe me alhamdulillah a strong muslim will follow this and if this is done all these things will not happen as the question was asked my mind is diverting i cannot offer salah but natural and today we find the dressing also is not as for the sharia you have non-muslim ladies not dressing up properly when the muslim ladies they may be muslim they may not be anything properly more of the body is exposed than covered so all these things you have to maintain the hijab if you maintain the hijab the men maintaining their hijab that whenever they look at a woman they should lower their gaze and see to it that they also not too friendly only talk when is required when there is a requirement not unnecessary joking etc can't be done with the same sex but not with the opposite sex hope that answers the question"
