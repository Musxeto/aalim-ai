  "transcript": "how can we overcome these shortcomings which make us seemingly worse after Ramadan sometimes rather than better how can we overcome the shortcomings which lead us into this situation first we Muslims should realize that Ramadan is not a sort of tradition or a custom that we have to pray and fast you know and only do these acts because it's a particular time period it should rather be to serve Allah subhana tala for the pleasure of Allah subhana tala because it's a f and if you do it the right way it will remain throughout the year inshallah and Allah says in the Quran in Surah hij 15 verse number 99 and serve thy Lord until the are is certain that means until your death that doesn't mean you only serve and worship Allah subhana tala in the month of Ramadan serve him throughout your life till the last day of your life till you die and we should strive in the way of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and we should should be with people who are righteous after the month of Ramadan is over we should be with people who are righteous who are on the straight path so that as the Quran says that help each other in ta you have to guide each other and help each other to trenden each other's Faith so that we are on the right path and we should not find it difficult to perform the acts of worship we should not find it as boring or as burdensome because people don't know the real reason that's the reason they feel it is boring Etc and we have to strive for the right thing as Allah says in the Quran in anab chapter number 29 verse number 69 if you strive in our path we will open up our Pathways for you if you Jihad in the way of Allah subhana J in the way of Allah subhana tala he will make the task easy for you and the Hadith of the Prophet M wasallam which is mentioned in s Muslim number four Hadith number 6778 where the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that paradise is surrounded by hardships and hell is surrounded by Temptations you know so people think it's very hard to do all these acts of worship and the good deeds and they tempted by the Satan towards the hell so we should avoid thean that's the footsteps of the devil and stay on the straight path that's very important and we should see to it that we should strive in Allah subhana tala's way and these hardship will benefit us in this world as well as in and the best Dua for this is that we lay our life for Allah subhana tala which is mentioned in the Quran in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 162 which says that that verily my prayers and my service for sacrifice and my life and my death are all for Allah subhana wa ta'ala who is the cherisher of all the worlds so we tell Allah subhana tala and we pray to him that my prayer is only to you and my service and my sacrifice for you alone my life and my death is for you alone the Lord of all the worlds and then inshallah Allah will keep us on the straight path and that will help us to be steadfast till next Ramadan"
