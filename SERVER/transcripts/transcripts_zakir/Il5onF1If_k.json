  "transcript": "the first question that has come on the whatsapp which has been selected by my group the first question is from brother yusuf shuheib ghana what are the basic guidelines in islam for choosing a spouse a similar question is asked by najiba afghanistan i am a 16-year old girl how can we love someone in an islamic way before marriage and a similar question asked by abdullah if it is not too personal can we know how did you select a life partner the first question posed by the brother that what are the guidelines regarding choosing a life partner or a spouse in islam our beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned say bihari number seven hadith number five zero nine zero as well as in say muslim volume number four hadith number three six three five it is a muthafic alike it's hadith present in bukhari as well as inside muslim it's mentioned abu haram allah be pleased that the prophet peace be upon him said that women are chosen in marriage for four things the wealth the lineage or nobility beauty and religion chooser for the religion here in this hadith a beloved prophet says that women in marriage are chosen for four things wealth lineage nobility third is beauty and fourth is religion and the best is religion that means choose the woman who is religious here we come to know that the maximum importance that should be given is to the religion because all the earlier three criteria which people normally look for in marriage it is limited and mainly for this dunya for example wealth wealth is something which can maybe get you some luxury in this world but may not be beneficial in akhera as the beloved prophet said it is more difficult for a rich man to go to general than a poor man but it's not haram to have wealth but it is not the major criteria should look for the second is lineage looking at the lineage of the family it's good but that is not the main it is mainly for the dunya you may say you're coming from a very good family from a noble family the third criteria is beauty which is again limited only to this world beauty is something which you may get tired of in few days a few weeks or a year the best and everlasting mainly for the akhira as well as dunya is religion it is the deen and if i was to pay any weightage in choosing this is my own opinion that if a boy wants to choose a girl 90 to 95 percent should be for the deen for the religion because that will get a makhara as well as the dunya yes as far as the wealth is concerned if a boy wants to marry a girl then what use is the wealth of the girl to that boy a good boy who has his own self-respect but nacho would not like to live on the money of the woman of the wife so irrespective whether the girl is rich or for what difference would it make him and even if he's going to use that is only for this dunya the lineage may or may not help that will not really count much the beauty as i said is subjective as long as the wife is no repulsive so maybe you can give about three or four points or three or four percent weightage to the beauty as long as you know repulsive the deen is the maximum 90 to 95 percent of the waiter should be given to the dean if it's a boy choosing a girl if a girl is choosing a boy then wealth may carry certain weight because if the girl is used to having certain comfort in life but natural she cannot marry a boy who's living on the street so if it's a girl marrying a boy then the wealth may have certain weightage maybe maybe about 10 marks the lineage may be one percent and the handsomeness of the boy as long as he's not repulsive but naturally because you want to live with the spouse for the full life you should be satisfied but mentally if you make up a mind you know if you really it's all in your mind any girl can seem to be beautiful it's in your mind so the handsomeness or the beauty carries a smaller percentage so for the man the religion i would say would carry 1995 was said marx and for the woman when she's looking for a spouse maybe would carry approximately 85 percent mark the religion the deen which is the most important anyway this percentage is from my side it is not from the hadith very clear that the most important is the religion that's it this is my percentage regarding the second question posed by the sister that can we have an islamic love before marriage regarding the love before marriage that we have nowadays in the modern society in the western society but natural it is haram there is no lbw lbw in the cricket you have like before we can lbw is love before wedding so the way we have in the western culture where their girlfriend boyfriend and they want to test each other they go out to a park and they go out for a movie they sit in the last bench of the theater or they want to enjoy they go for dinner and they talk and they may go to hotel and sleep overnight all these things is hara in islam yes you can while selecting a life partner have interview along with the maharam if a boy is going to look at a girl then maybe the boy sister is there or the girl's father is there along with the maram but nacho you can ask questions you can interview for few minutes or half an hour for one hour there's no limit you can have one meeting two meeting no problem to understand because you want to spend the full life with the girl and the girl with the boy but going out alone and being in seclusion you know the shaitan in there the prophet said that if there are two names alone the third person is the devil so in the islamic way yes you can interview but the love before marriage what we have in the normal sense in the western world it is prohibited islamic way yes you can have for example you may know the girl may know of a boy who's islamic who's very religious who has high taqwa who prays five times salah in the mosque and it's a die and the girl may want to have a good life partner so islamically what she does is that she proposes to the boy who she thinks is religious through her father or through a brother or the parents of the girl go and meet the parents of the boy and in islamic way it's possible this sort of love because you like the religious values and the deen in the boy it is permissible islamically if you go ahead following the rules and regulation not breaking the sharia it is possible in this way if you want to call it love before marriage because you like the religious aspects in the boy or the boy likes religious aspects in a girl in this way not breaking any rules of the islamic sharia then you can call it a sort of love before marriage islamically but saying to it that you don't break any of the rules of the sharia as far as the third question posed to me is that if it's not too personal the brother would like to know that how did i select my life partner and as many of you may be aware that i met sheikh ahmad in 1987 the first time when i was 22 years old i was impressed by him and that's how i got involved in the field of dawah and my life became more islamic previously i was an average muslim praying five times a day fasting and doing what normal muslims should do but the dawah came into my life after i met and once i started doing dawah and my last grace alhamdulillah i realized that i was good in debating i was good and convincing so i thought as far as choosing a life partner for me inshallah inshallah no problem any girl i marry i will be able to convince her maybe in a few weeks or a few months or no problem the girl i'll be able to convince this was in the initial stages when i was no wise when i didn't have much knowledge but naturally later on as the years passed i realized that very important reading the hadith of the prophet and knowing the other aspects of islam that choosing a life partner is very important and at that time i thought that the right age for a muslim boy to get married is 25 that was my idea that time now also now it may be a little bit earlier so at that time i thought that 25 years is the best time for a person to get married when he finishes his graduation and he can marry and at the age of 25 when i started to look for a girl and realizing having more knowledge of the deen reading the hadith and the quranic verses my criteria was based on the hadith of the prophet muslim which is in bukhari and muslim that while choosing a girl you look for four things first is the wealth second is the lineage the nobility third is the beauty fourth is the deen and the best is the deen you should choose a girl for deen and this hadith was ingrained in my mind and decided i want to marry a girl who is as religious as possible more religious than me that was my aim to get a girl who is in the field of dawah and religious so i told my sister that look out for a girl and my only criteria number one is deen regarding wealth the poorer she's better for me because i don't want to use any of her wealth lineage it doesn't matter and beauty she should not be repulsive that was my requirement and with this requirement i told my sister that she should find for me a life partner and believe me for two years she hunted and she may have searched many girls and unfortunately not a single one did she pass not a single of the girl who she thought and who she interviewed ever passed even the prelims later on we got information that there is a muslim a muslim girl in a neighboring city puna which is 160 kilometers from bombay where i lived and we came to know that she was the head the president of a ladies islamic dhawa organization and i went along with my sister and my mother and i went to puna i traveled all the way i drove for a few hours and i went to pune and that's how the first time i met my wife and that time she wasn't aware and we met her and he spoke to us spoke to a mother my mother was there and my sister was there her mother was there she was there and later on when we went back then we sent the proposal and then we had a formal meeting the first was in the formal meeting just we went and we met through one of our common friends and when we had the formal meeting we had for a few hours and alhamdulillah she was the first girl i met or i interviewed i interacted to be a would be wife and alhamdulillah the first was the best and allah blessed me masha'allah was the wonderful wife and alhamdulillah i consider it to be one of the best gifts that allah has given me besides the iman that allah has given me the best gift that allah gave me is my wife and she was from puna and in the first interview itself it was nearly finalized then we had another meeting my basic criteria was that she should be religious and she should be a die these were the two criteria religious and die and i could not find a girl better than her at that time already more than 27 years has passed for our marriage at that time i could not find anyone better at my knowledge and alhamdulillah this was the only criteria the remaining was not at all important but alhamdulillah even though i wasn't looking for beauty mashallah allah gave me a beautiful advice and as i said the beauty is in your mind and alhamdulillah and many people used to ask me that now you're giving so many ass for dhawa maybe you know about nine ten hours for dawa once you get married you'll have to give time to your wife how will you be able to manage both so one of the reasons that i married a girl who is a daya so that it's a venn diagram most of a time would overlap so when i gave approximately five hours to a in a day maybe three hours worth discussing dawah and then we started an islamic organization ladies wing in my organization research foundation the moment we got married first thing we did was started a lady's wing and she was the president of the ladies wing of islam research foundation so my main criteria was only the andawa and but naturally in the interview the question i asked was based on about what is the concept of purpose of life and other things so basically these two are the criteria allah blessed me and the best blessing for adai is to have a righteous and supporting life partner for thy the wife can make the life of a die hell i know many guys who are very good days but after marriage the dawah has been ruined because of the spouse allah has blessed me masha'allah and i consider my wife to be the best wife in the world that's what i consider alhamdulillah and i thank allah for giving me a spouse who was righteous and because of her after marriage my dhawa increased multiple times and kept on increasing more and more to the level now alhamdulillah allah blessed me and therefore choosing a life partner is very important and as the prophet said look for a life partner who's religious look for deen in her the other criteria are not at all important most important is religious and virtuous hope this answers the question"
