  "transcript": "these are issues which frequently come up in conversations in the UK and I believe that we've answered quite a few of them there today so very very beneficial indeed in the case of a person who vomits intentionally or unintentionally is the ruling the same regarding whether or not it invalidates the fast as far as vomiting is concerned a beloved Prophet Muslim said which appears in trimedi in the book of fasting Hadith number 320 a beloved Prophet said that anyone who vomits involuntarily then he should not make up for the fast but the person who vomits voluntarily vomits the Liberty then he has to make up for the Fast and the same hadithi repeated in Sun number two in the book of fasting Hadith number said that anyone who vomits suddenly that means involuntary suddenly then he should not atone for it that means the fast is valid you should not make up for it but anyone who vomits deliberately then he should atone for it that means he has to make a further faster so if someone vomits unintentionally the fast is not invalidated he can complete the first but someone vomit little bitly like putting a finger in his throat and vomiting or pressing his stomach and vomiting or purposely smelling something which is very nasty and continues doing that then he vomits or he looks at something which is undesirable and he keeps on looking at it continuously and then vomits so all these come under the act of deliberately vomiting if you vomit deliberately then you have to make up for the fast if it's unintentionally but if the vomit comes to your mouth and then you again follow it that will break the fast so the vomit comes out involuntary let the vomit come out don't suppress it then the fast not broken but if it comes and then you swallow the vomit back into your stomach that will break the fast yes if you again swallow the vomit which has come on to vomit comes out let the vomit come out involuntary that will not make the fast I see okay thank you very much for that"
