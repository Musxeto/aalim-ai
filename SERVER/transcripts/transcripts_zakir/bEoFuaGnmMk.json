  "transcript": "Allah says in Surah Al chapter number 103 verse number 1 to3 that by the token of time man is rily in a state of floss except those who have faith those who do righteous deed and those who exalt people to patience and pers those who have faith those who have righteous deed those who exalt people to truth and those who exalt people to patience and pers these minimum four criteria are required for any human being to go to Jenna number one is Iman having faith number two righteous deed number three inviting people to tr doing da and ISL and number four inviting people to patience and persever if any one of these criteria is missing under normal circumstances you shall not go to Jenna all four criteria are equally important Iman righteous deed dawa and inviting people to patience and perseverance so Quran gives the formula to attain Jenna to go to paradise because Quran gives you the formula to go to Jenna to attain Paradise I said Al Quran is a global necessity that once haar ascani may Allah have mercy on him he was a great scholar he wrote the sharah of bukari the second most important book after the Quran when he was going in the marketplace with his entr who the chief khazi and people a poor Jew he comes and he catches the mule of haani and he tells him I heard that your Prophet said this world is a prison for the Believers and it is Paradise for the unbelievers theal say that I know what's going to happen in the future and I know that in in the next life for the Believers we will get paradise and if you compare the Jenna to this world What I'm Living compared to the Jenna it is billion times better this world with all the wealth is the present and I know the unbelievers like you who do not believe in Allah in the next life they will go to Janam and the Janam will be so bad that even if you are the poorest man in the world if you compare to Janam your this life will be like paradise compared to Janam you may be the richest man in the world you may have the maximum luxury but compared to the luxury of a in Jenna it will be a billion times better so if you compare the difference between the poorest man who goes to Jenna and the richest man in the world going to Jenna the difference is very less so this world you should not be bothered whether you're poor or Rich whether you're a king or a poer you should be bothered that you pass the test because the Jenna and the prophet said it is more easier for the poor man to go to Jenna than a rich man because the rich man has to give hisab he has to give accountability of everything more difficult so comparatively it is billion times better than the richest man in the world and compared to the poor man also it is a billion times hardly any difference and the jam is so worse the description given in the Quran and the Hadith even if you're the poorest man in this world it will be like paradise the fire when it comes on your feet your brains will boil can you believe so this is the explanation and this Quran it prevents you to going to Janam and encourages to go to jenah that's the reason I call the Glorious Quran a global necessity"
