  "title": "Embryology in the Quran â€“ Part 1 - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "in the field of embryology there was a group of students who collected all the data that they could find in the quran as well as the hadith dealing with embryology and they followed the verse of the quran surah nahal chapter number 16 verse 43 and surah chapter number 21 verse number 7 which says first if you don't know if you're in doubt ask the person who's knowledgeable so these arab students they collected the verse of the quran and the hadith dealing with embryology and translated into english and presented it to professor keith moore that over 30 years back in the late 70s and professor keith moore at that time was one of the highest authorities in the field of embryology and he was the head of the department of anatomy in the university of toronto in canada when he went through all the translation verses of the quran and hadith he said that most of the verses of the quran we speak about embryology are in perfect conformity with latest advances of embryology but there are a couple of verses which i cannot say that they are right neither can i say they are wrong because i myself don't know about it and two such verses were the first two verses of the quran to be revealed of surah of chapter 96 verse number one and two he says read recite proclaim in the name of the lord who has created who has created the human beings from something which clings a leech-like substance so prophet keith moore said i don't know the human beings the embryo embryology means it's the study of the development of the human being the early stage of human being in the womb of the mother for those who don't know he said that i do not know whether initial stages of the embryo that's the initial stage of the human being it looks like a leech or not so he went in his laboratory and under a very powerful microscope observed the early stages of the embryo and compared it with the photograph of a leech and he was astonished at the striking resemblance and later when 80 questions were asked to him regarding embroidery in the quran and hadith he said that if you had asked me these questions 30 years ago that means from today more than 60 years back i would not be able to answer more than 50 because embryology is a new branch of medicine which i developed recently and whatever additional information he got he included in the new edition of his book the developing human the developing human is one of the books referred by most of the students throughout the world in the first year of mbps first year of medical college and even i when i was in the first year of the medical college in bombay if we had to get just past marx we used to refer to the book written by inder bersing if you wanted to score an embryology we had to refer to the developer human by professor keith moore so professor keith moore he incorporated this new information he got from the quran and the hadith into the third edition of his book the developing human which got the award for the best medical book written by a single author and later on this book was translated into several languages of the world and professor keith moore said that this information in the quran cannot come from human source the author of this quran has to be almighty god and he said that he has no objection in agreeing that prophet muhammed peace be upon him all the messenger of this god imagine prophet keith moore being a christian said that"
