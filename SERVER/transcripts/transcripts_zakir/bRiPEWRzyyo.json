double one two six nine 53895 i repeat plus 6011 269 53895 before we throw the floor open for the open question on the session i would like to give to the viewers two important messages the first is my message on the eve of the independence of my beloved country india today is the 15th of august 2020 it is the 73rd anniversary of the independence of india i would like to inform the viewers that alhamdulillah several centuries before india was one of the most powerful countries in the world it was one of the richest countries in the world it was one of the most resourceful countries in the world it was the most forward country in the world and india was ruled by the muslims for about a thousand years and when the muslims ruled india alhamdulillah all the indians irrespective to whichever religion they belonged whether they be hindus or the muslims were the christians with the sikhs all of them they lived harmoniously together and the country developed and it was one of the best countries in the world to live in yes there were walls but that was for power that was for land and on both the sides you would find hindus and muslims there was no war based on religion the human beings on the platform religion they did not fight with each other and alhamdulillah the advancement that india made was phenomenal until a couple of centuries before the britishers they came to india they came to india to do business and they formed an east india company but what did they do they came to india they looted india they cheated india they ruled india they ruined india they destroyed india they took away all the resources of india all the well of india to the country and they made india a country which was known to be one of the lowest countries in the world the gdp went down the wealth went down it was at its lowest alhamdulillah there were tens and hundreds of thousands of indians from the hindu community from the muslim community from the sikh community from the christian community who unitedly fought for the freedom of india and alhamdulillah 73 years before on the 15th of august 1947 my beloved country our beloved country india it got its independence its freedom from the clutches of the britishers but unfortunately when the britishers left india they left behind the disease of divide and rule from the time the british left in 1947 more than 65 years later alhamdulillah india kept on progressing after independence for more than 65 years india progressed economically in terms of wealth in terms of education in terms of science and technology and it advanced and alhamdulillah again india though did not reach on top of the world but it came somewhere alhamdulillah close to the developing country and india progressed but unfortunately since the last six years especially last four to five years india is deteriorating again the gdp has gone down the wealth has gone down the economy has gone down the unemployment has increased and there is more lynching there is anarchy there is loss of peace since this present government has come to power since the last six years we find that our country is deteriorating i pray to allah that may he free us also from the clutches of this fascist new government that is controlling my beloved country for the last six years i could see a ray of hope last few months when this government bought laws against the minority especially the muslims alhamdulillah the majority community the hindus they stood shoulder to shoulder with the muslims the christians came forward the sikh came forward and alhamdulillah they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the muslims against the wrong policies of the government a few months ago the same government engineered riots in the capital city of the country india and the main aim was to disturb to kill the minority especially the muslims and the engineered right alhamdulillah you could find many people from the majority community many from the hindu community who risked their lives and they saved the lives of many muslims at the same time many muslims in the muslim majority area they save the lives of the hindus this is what is unity and we can see that inshallah again india may go back to its glory i would like to tell this new government that you can fool some people some of the times but you cannot fool all the people all the times the best way that a country can develop is when there is peace when there is harmony when there is development when there is economic growth not when you try and divide the community the people of india on the basis of religion just for power and money of the selected few people the politicians they are destroying this country i pray to allah that may he get this beloved country of mine india independence from this government and inshallah inshallah i feel that time will come soon again when india again will be a superpower my second message is regarding the importance of maharam and fasting on the day of ashora our beloved prophet muhammad it's mentioned in say buhari or number four hadith number 3197 that our beloved prophet muslim said that the year is 12 months and of them four are sacred three are in consecutive numbers that is dulcaida and the fourth is rajab a similar message is given by allah in the glorious quran in surah alba chapter number 9 verse number 36 where allah says that the number of months in the site of allah are 12 in a year so you ordained the creation of the heaven and the earth and from them four are sacred and but naturally these four sacred monks are mentioned inside buhari as i mentioned earlier that is so do not do wrongdoings in them here allah is saying in surah chapter 9 verse number 36 that in these four sacred months do not do any wrongdoings that means if a person does any sin the sins are more graver in these four sacred months they are more heavier in these four second months and the good deeds that you do they will be more rewarding so the muslims should see to it that during the four sacred months they should be more careful they should abstain from all the sins especially the major sins as well as almost all the minor sins too and we should do as many good deeds as possible time will not permit me to repeat all the good deeds and i done that earlier when i spoke about the virtues of i had mentioned 45 good deeds the farah's the mustahab the other sunnahs etc it is further mentioned in sahih muslim point number three hadith number 2755 our beloved prophet muslim said that the most important fast after the fast of ramadan is in the month of allah in maharan referring to the day of ashura and the most important salah after the first salah is the night prayers that is the kamul tajud and the wither it further mentioned inside muslim verb number three hadith number 2746 a beloved prophet muslim said that fasting on the day of ashura the 10th of muharram i will pray to allah that may he forgive the sins of the previous year that means if a person farts on the 10th of muharram on the day of ashura all your sins of the previous year will be washed away but natural these sins are referring to the minor sins not counting the major sins that means the most important fast after the further fast of ramadan is the fasting of ashora but scholars differ foca has most of the focus says that the most important fast is the fasting on the day of arafah because on the day of arafah besides the sins of the previous years being washed away even the sins of the future one year is washed away that means if you fast on the day of arafah two years of sins are washed away the previous year and the following that is the next year if you fast on the day of ashura only one year that the previous years sins are washed away therefore focal defer most of them say the most important fast is arafa few say the most important fast is fasting on the day of ashora but unanimously all agree that these two fast fasting on the day of arafah and fasting on the way for sure are the most too important first after the further fast of that it is mentioned in say buhari word number five hadith number 3943 that abner pass radhiallahu and may allah be pleased with him he narrates that when the prophet reached madinah he found that the jews were fasting on the 10th of maura and he asked them that why do you fast during this day they said this day allah gave victory to moses and the people of bani israel over feron so the prophet replied that we muslims are more closer to musa salaam than the jews and he ordered the muslims to fast on ashura the tenth of maharam it's further mentioned in say buhari volume number three hadith number two zero zero six that ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him he narrates that he never found the prophet wanting to fast on any day more than the day of ashora and this month that is the month of ramadan is further mentioned in sunan abu dhabi volume number three hadith number 2445 that the prophet peace be upon him the people approached him and they told him that the jews and the christians they fast on the 10th of murrah on the day of ashura so the prophet said next year we will also fast on the ninth of mara it's mentioned in mustang ahmad word number two hadith number two one five four that the prophet said do the opposite of what the jews and the christians do besides fasting on the 10th of muram also fast on the 9th or the 11th of murrah because of this when you read the shara of say buhari half is ibn hajjar ascalani he says that fasting of ashura is of three levels the lowest is fasting on the 10th of muharram the day of ashora the second is fasting on the 9th and the 10th of maura and the highest is fasting on 9th 10th and 11th of maura that means we muslims we learn from all the hadees that maharam is the month of allah it's one of the four sacred months in the sacred month we should do good deeds obtain from doing bad deeds and the best is that we fast on all three days the 9th the 10th and the 11th of maram that is the best if you cannot fast for three days at least fast for two days ninth and tenth of more or ten eleventh or more room if you cannot fast for two days and you can only do for one day then the least of the least you can do is fast at least on the 10th of maram on the day of ashora this was the short message on the importance of maharam and fasting on the refashwara now inshallah we'll take questions from the people first we'll take a question from the whatsapp the first question that we have that has been selected on the whatsapp is from abdulrahman from india presently working in kuwait as a mechanical engineer you are my favorite in the field of dawah your speech is very logical and intellectual alhamdulillah i love you i love you too i feel you are one of my family members i feel the same all the muslims are brothers and to one another brothers and faith inshallah i am your follower since 2011. i always share your videos to my family members and encourage them to watch it as you know for muslims it is getting very difficult to live in india i feel allah is testing the iman of indian muslims through the ruling party the ruling government propagates false news about you and files false cases against you you are a very famous person and you have good links with other countries so you were able to do hijrah to malaysia alhamdulillah allah saved you there are many cases like this in india against muslims false cases are filed and false arrests are made under uapa act the common muslims don't have the opportunity or the option to do hijrah so what is your advice for common muslims who undergo a similar situation like you in india how muslims can handle or tackle this type of issue the brothers asked a very important question a very sensitive question seeing the situation of india as i mentioned in the message of the independence day that since the last four to six years there is a lot of onslaught against the muslim minorities in india and you find a lot of lynching a lot of attacks on the muslims it has been difficult for muslims to live they are being harassed they are being persecuted they are being oppressed and so on and so forth so the question posed by with abdul rahman is that i was able to hijra what should the common muslims in india do in such a situation i can give my advice it can be in two different categories one is muslims as a whole as ummah in india what they should do and muslims on an individual level as far as the muslims in india as a whole number one they should be united unfortunately the muslims are divided in india divided on bases of different sects in islam divided on bases of different organizations divided because they belong to different political parties they belong to different social organizations and this is the major problem amongst the muslims living in india allah says in the quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse 103 the same hold all together strongly to the rope of allah and be not divided we muslims should be united holding to the rope of allah the rope of allah is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith of a beloved prophet muslim if all the muslims in india hold strongly to the glorious quran and to the authentic hadith of a beloved prophet muslim inshallah we will be a strong force we will be united and will be a forbidden power mashaallah unfortunately we muslims as i mentioned we are divided into different sects in islam and the different groups the different religious groups in india they are fighting among themselves they are criticizing each other they are attacking each other this is totally uncalled for there is no problem that there are different groups as far as religious organizations are concerned as far a difference opinion is concerned but as a whole the muslims should be united and the best uniting factor is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith we muslims should agree to disagree they can be many religious organizations no problem but we should not fight with one another allah says in the quran in foreign number five verse number two that help one another in bir and taqwa in righteousness and good deeds number two we are divided politically some of the muslims they support political party a some support political party b some support political party c and what happens our words get divided and the net result is zero do you know that we muslims alhamdulillah according to the official statistics of the indian government more than 10 years back it says that muslims are 14.2 percent and a few years back they said that we are more than 200 million muslims in india and i'm aware that they are not counting many muslims in assam and many parts of india actually according to me the muslims will be close to 250 to 300 million in india the actual figure the government suppresses the figure officially indonesia is considered as a country which has the maximum number of muslims about 240 million muslims but according to me number one in the world the country which has maximum number of muslims it is my beloved country india minimum 250 to 300 million but even if you count and you agree with the government statistic that we have about 200 million what we should do that politically we should have only one party we muslims should make another party exclusively only formations and this party should be a force by itself irrespective whichever group of muslims you belong to whichever sect of muslim do we belong to whichever mother you belong to whichever religious organization you belong to whichever social muslim organization belong to we muslim should only have one political party and this political party should join hands with the other political parties which are not facist which are not communal number one they should join hands with the talents the dallas in india also are about 300 million unfortunately during voting they are counted as hindus and the dalits are not hindus babasa ambedkar had left hinduism and he loved islam but unfortunately the muslims didn't welcome them so he chose the second best he chose buddhism for the new buddhists they are hindus but for the political gain these parties they count them as hindus and they take benefit of them but these ballots are also being persecuted in india so what we should do we muslims should join hands with the dallas so that will be close to 600 million more than 40 percent of the population we can join hand with the other minorities and then we will be a bigger force and depending upon the situation where you are even if you feel that we cannot come to power we should support those parties which are non-communal those parties which care for humanity not those parties will divide the country on the basis of religion not those parties that persecute the minorities that do not give the rights to the minorities and if you see in the islamic history the best religious group that ever gave rights to the minority other muslims the minorities in a muslim rule get all the rights and they are protected by the muslim rulers and even today you see that in muslim majority country whether it be the gulf country whether it be other muslim countries the hindus are there but they aren't being persecuted they aren't being forced to sell law again so we should support politically those non-muslim parties we can join with them our muslim party have a coalition no problem but individually all the muslims of india should be united what happened nowadays that one muslim joins political party a the second muslim joins political party b third muslim joins political parties see fourth muslim joint political party one hindu comes and stands alone in a muslim majority area which may be having 75 muslims the muslim votes are divided and this hindu comes and wins the election in a muslim majority area why because muslims are divided we are foolish so if muslims are united and we have one force unfortunately unfortunately we don't find a single good muslim politician in india who we can say that he really cares for the deen of allah and the muslims more than his personal gain so we muslims should be united under one political party and should keep our differences aside and keep our personal preferences today what we find that one non-muslim political party makes a muslim as a member of rajya sabha so he supports the political party even if that party is against the muslim he supports them unequally without any condition it's a shame these muslims are selling the muslims of india the major problem is that we muslims don't have a leader in india we have lack of leadership not only in india throughout the world so my suggestion would be that the muslims should join together forget our differences like if you see the history of the khulafarashadeen when they ruled when they were khalifas they were first interested in seeing that they did not disappoint allah they were least bothered about the personal gain about the benefit of the family about the luxury they were more bothered about are they pleasing allah or not today unfortunately we don't have such politicians if we follow quran and sunnah and stick to it and the muslims are united inshallah no one will be able to trample us in this country of india this is number one requirement collectively at the muslim ummah number two individually as a muslim what can you do in such a situation what can you do when the muslims aren't joining together when they aren't uniting when they are divided what as you individual muslim who cares for the deen who wants to follow allah and his command what should you do number one as a muslim you should see to it that you are doing your farah's you you're doing all the furs as much as mustap that you can you are doing it freely and india is one of the few countries in the world which mentions the constitution that every citizen of india irrespective whichever religion he belongs to he can preach practice and propagate his religion and i did that for more than 25 years only in the last few years as i mentioned earlier that when this new government came the faces government came and they changed the full scenario of india we have proceeded that we get back where we had the freedom so number one a muslim should follow his deen if you feel that you cannot practice your pharah's you cannot do most of your sunnah then allah clearly mentions in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 97 that you have to do hijarah and i've discussed this in detail in my earlier answer it's a further hijra can be of various types number one if you have the means and the possibilities to go to a muslim majority country that would be the best and the person who asked the question himself is living in kuwait which is the muslim majority country you can do hijrah permanently you can do partially you can do temporary depending upon the situation number two i don't expect and i've given this in my early answer the muslims should leave india i don't expect that i'm talking of individual case that if you are and if the persecution gets so much like it happened in my case that's a different situation i don't expect all the muslims of india to live in or not at all that's not the solution the solution is number one politically we should become united we should have one force join hands with dallas and the other people who have more human values and see to it that we follow the constitution of india of equality if you cannot and i don't expect people to leave the country what you can do is you can shift or do hijra to a different state which is more lenient towards muslims and one of the best examples that i can think of amongst all the states of india that we have 29 states the best state that i can think of it is kerala where alhamdulillah has about one-third hindus one-third christian and one-third muslims and there the people of kerala are not communal nature the people of different religions they live harmoniously i've been to kerala many times there is no friction between different religions they have their religious activities and all of them can propagate the religions peacefully and this government doesn't have much hold in the state of kerala so one of the best options that if you want to do hijab to another state i would say kerala there are some states which are less communal they are but less as compared to some states which are very communal the less commonly would be bombay where i come from or maybe hyderabad or some other some are very commonly like up etc so depending you can do hijab to another state or maybe in your state to a different city which is less community or maybe in your city live in an area which is most safe like in bombay one of the safest place to live is dongri it is baikalla all these areas have got 90 percent 95 percent muslim some are very diverse in muslim so depending upon the situation if collectively the muslim mumbai is not coming together and they are not doing the job they aren't following quran sunnah you as individual muslims should follow the quran sunnah and see to it that if it's difficult where you're living you do hijrah to another state or to another city or to another area in your city itself depending on situation i know doing hijrah is not easy you may have to go to a new place you might have to sell your house we are living and go to a new house but this is the advice given to us in the quran duh if you are really a very famous personality and the government will come after you in any state then the best is to do hijrah outside the country if you cannot do permanently you can seek a job in a muslim country in the gulf country depending upon the situation but allah is very clear-cut in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 97 98 99 100 that if you are living in a non-muslim country and you cannot follow your deen you have to do hijab unless if you don't have the power if you don't have the capability and the capacity then allah will forgive you if you are among the weak and the oppressed this was in brief and i prayed rasmus made the muslims of india they unite together religiously unite together socially the united together politically and become one united force inshallah we will get back our past glory that we have inshallah hope to answer the question we have on the facebook rauf khan asif ahmad constantina and caesar sunni adamu bello abdul hamid suleiman may god protect your mela protector love you from pakistan from manipur india walaikum assalam to all of you on the youtube we have daniel zulfiker mr medico says javed i would like to inform the viewers that there are many questions which are asked which have already been answered by me so whichever question has been answered by me in the past sessions i will not repeat that i request the viewers go back to the youtube channel or to the facebook all these answers are there go in the search type the question in my name and you get the reply many questions are being repeated i will not answer the same question again it's a waste of time for those people already there so my request to you would be go to the youtube channel and you can search and find these answers there's a question on the youtube from brother abdulrahman from mumbai india that many times we cannot login to your youtube channel what is the reason and how do we see your youtube channel in india the reason that many of the people from india cannot login to my channel is because the indian government has blacklisted my channel they don't want people to watch the message of peace that i'm spreading so because of that if you go to my channel and type zakir naik or doctors akira channel you log in you cannot reach but there is an easy solution for that what you have to do is you have to go to the settings and in your setting you change the location from india to any other country change it to saudi arabia change it to usa change it to uk and then if you log in inshallah without any problem you can log into my channel because the indian government doesn't want peace to be spread throughout india they are trying the level best to avoid my message to reach india so the best solution is go to the setting go to the location change the location to any other country like saudi arabia uk usa and inshallah easily you can login to my channel the second option is that you can use a vpn and throw vpn virtual protocol network through any of the vpn which is available free from the app store or from the google store through vpn you can easily enter these are the two ways that you can get being in india you can see my channel and my alhamdulillah there are many people from india seeing and that's how you can get all these questions the next question is from brother rizwan from west bengal india which is the most important and effective method of giving dawah there are various different ways and strategies of doing dawah some are less effective while some are more effective the most common method used by muslims while doing jawa to non-muslims is that whenever they meet a non-muslim they speak hundred good things about islam even if that non-muslim agrees with those hundred good things we have mentioned regarding islam yet at the back of his mind he will think ah you are the same muslim who is a terrorist ah you are the same muslim who is a fundamentalist you are the same muslim who marries more than one woman you are the same muslim who subjugates the woman by keeping up behind the wheel these few negative factors at the back of his mind will prevent him from accepting the beauty of islam whenever i meet a non-muslim the first question i ask him i ask him up front that with your limited knowledge whether you're right or wrong what do you feel is wrong with islam and i make him comfortable you can criticize islam you can attack islam you can speak against the quran no problem you only tell me what do you feel is wrong with islam and after making him comfortable he poses about three or four questions and invariably these three or four questions fall amongst the 20 most common questions asked by non-muslims regarding islam if every muslim memorizes and knows the reply to these 20 most common questions asked by non-muslims quoting from quran and say hadith quoting from the scriptures of the non-muslims the bible the vedas giving answer with reason and logic giving answer on the basis of science inshallah even if we cannot convert the non-muslims he can at least neutralize the animosity which they have the logic is when the cup is full when you pour it will overflow so first empty the cup whatever misconceptions the non-muslims have regarding islam you first remove it then even if you speak a few good points about islam he will accept it these 20 common questions how do they arise in the minds of the non-muslim depending on how the media portrays islam and the misconception they spread these 20 common questions keep on changing the 20 common question we have today 10 years back they were different few decades earlier they were different depending upon how the media portrays islam these 20 common questions keep on changing and these 20 common questions are the same throughout the world whether they go to america uk singapore saudi arabia dubai whichever part of the world you go to india these 20 common questions are the same there may be an additional two or three questions based on the society and the customs of that particular country maybe if you go to western country where interest is more common they may ask why is interest private in islam but the remaining 20 common questions are the same so it's preferable to learn the answers of the 20 most common questions than to learn answers of 100 uncommon questions so number one is you memorize the reply that are good and i've written a book on this one the common question is by non-muslims or muslims of islam and it's translated to various languages of the world and you memorize it it's one of the best ways to do dhawa one of the most important criteria for dawah is given in the glorious quran in sula al-imran the chapter number three verse number 64 where allah says so that we are muslim is bowing away to allah so one of the best criteria of doing dawah is come to common terms as per us and you coming to common terms with the non-muslim is one of the best criteria come to common terms has been assigned and amongst the common term the most important term is that we worship allah that means when you are doing dawah the most important point of dawah is tahit removing shirt from the life of the non-muslim while starting dawa you can start dawa with quran and science you can start dawa with literature depending upon which subject the person is interested in no problem but your main aim should be you have to convince him about about one allah worshiping him alone and no one else and remove the shirt in his life this is the most important if you cannot do this your dhawa is useless you may convince the non-muslim not to have alcohol you may convince them not to have spoke you may convince them not to gamble but if you do not remove the shirt from his life you do not remove the idol worship from his life you do not get him to tahit oneness of allah allah but the others use this that's the reason for adai his main goal should be convincing about taheed the oneness of allah then number two is about the last and final messenger prophet muhammad these two are the most important criteria for dawah all the other aspects are secondary you can start with other things in which the non-muslim is interested but these two are the most important then we'll come ahra then become salah so on and so forth while coming to common terms it's important that if you read the scriptures of the non-muslims you will be in a better position to talk about tahit mentioned in the scriptures and i've given the talk on concept of god in major world religions and i proved from the bible from the vedas from the scriptures of christians jews hindus parties about oneness of allah i have given a talk on muhammad sallallahu salman the various worldly scriptures and from the scriptures of the christians jews hindus from the scriptures of the parties have proved the coming of the last and final messenger prophet muslim so if you are doing dawa and if you read the scripture this is one of the criteria i mentioned in the quran it becomes easier the other important verse of the quran for technique of dawah is surah chapter number 16 verse number 125 it says invite all to the way of their lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best and most gracious here allah saying that invite all invite the non-muslims to the teachings of islam to allah with hikmah and husna when you do dawah you have to do dawah with hikmah and husna with reason with wisdom and beautiful preaching but many people think that wisdom always means being soft yes most of the time we have to be soft but at times you have to be tough if you read this ruku the few verses before surahnal chapter 16 verse 125 it says that in prophet abraham is a beautiful example peace be upon him and what prophet abraham did he broke the idols so that was hikmah at that time so depending upon the situation hikmah doesn't mean always being soft most of the time yes being soft but sometimes they have to be tough and all these strategies you can hear in my talk i've given for more information you can go to my website zachinik.com there's a separate section international training program which gives you various strategies etc and we'll give you a training how to become a guy hope that answers the question we have on the facebook group raj sorry for islam i love you dr zakir naik only for allah i love you too for the sake of allah musambal ahmad and muhammad from kashmir rasif islam i love you i love you too haroon dil saus salam walaikum fazdul kareem i'm watching from new york masha'allah mursal and hussain love for all muslims muhammad anas inshallah one day indian muslims will unite amen take full body aziz azmi javid azizi from afghanistan assalamualaikum welcome the next question from muhammad saud india i am a student sir you are a great muslim influencer for the ummah so my hindu tutor asked me that if i had only one bread and a hungry man comes and asks me for the food and we both are dying of hunger what does islam say in such a situation should i eat or should i give him it's a very tricky question asked by the teacher of muhammad saud that if you are hungry and you're dying of hunger and another hungry man comes and he too is dying of hunger and you have only one piece of bread so would you eat it yourself or would you give it to the hungry man what does islam teach you regarding the reply for such a situation is depending upon the situation if there is a hungry man who comes and i realize that he is dying of hunger and i am dying of hunger too and if we both can survive by having half loaf of the bread then i will make that bread into half give him one half and eat the other half may be a situation that the hungry man may be a non-muslim he may not be used to hunger i'm a muslim i'm used to fasting and i know that maybe though i'm hungry i can survive more for a couple of days and that hungry non-muslim man he is not used to staying hungry and if he doesn't get food maybe in the next few hours he will die so what i will do i will give the complete loaf of bread to that non-muslim man knowing very well that i'm used to fasting and i can maybe survive for the next few days and i'll pray to allah subhanahu tala that may he provide me food as soon as possible you may ask me that what is the logic behind this the logic behind this is that allah says in the quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 32 that if anyone kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity this was says if any muslim kills any other innocent human being whether it be a muslim or non-muslim it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and there was continuous if you save any human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity this verse i do not find in any other scripture except the glorious quran that if you kill one innocent human being you have killed the whole of humanity that means killing any innocent human being is prohibited it is haram it is the second major sin in islam and the verse continues that if you save one innocent human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity so here knowing very well that i'm used to fasting i can stay hungry for a longer time i have an opportunity an easy opportunity of saving one human life so if that non-muslim who is not used to staying hungry and is dying of hunger i will give my loaf of bread to him and pray to allah may he save me and even god forbid if i die because i have saved one human being it is as though i have saved the whole of humanity insha allah inshallah allah will put me in jannah hope that answers the question the next question from adil rashid from kashmir india i am a student of class 12th sir i have a friend who is a non-muslim and i am trying to explain to him islam since the 25th of may 2020. yesterday he asked a question but i could not give him the answer the question is that no religion says that if you do not follow god then you will be punished but in islam allah says if you do not obey me then allah will give you a strong punishment isn't allah egoistic sir my friend is very close to saying the shaada if you reply then he may accept islam soon inshallah the question posed by adil he's doing dhawa to one of his non-muslim friends and he's very close to accepting islam he has the question that why in islam allah is so egoistic knows bella and he says that if you don't obey me i will punish you whereas in other religions god does not say that if you don't obey him you will be punished i disagree with a non-muslim friend in fact most of the religions say that if you don't obey god you will go to hell hinduism says that christianity says that and most of the religions but i do agree with you that islam is most strong allah in the quran is very firm and he says that if you do not obey the commandments if you associate partners with anyone else besides him it is shirk it is the biggest sin you will go to hell fire islam is more firm is more staunch i do agree with you let me give you an example and ask your question so that you understand better if there is a family who's staying in a tall building on the 20th floor and if their family has a son who is about five years old six years old he wants to jump from the balcony of the 20th floor very stained and he tells his father i want to be superman and he wants to jump there is one father who says and tries to explain to us unlogically you will not be able to fly you're not a superman please don't jump the second father is that same example another father whose son says he wants to jump from the 20th floor he says don't jump from the 20th floor other punish you i will not allow you to go down to play you have a third type of a father same situation son wants to jump from the 20th floor wants to fly like a superman but this father he is more firm he says you dare even think of jumping i will slap you i will tie you and close you in a room if you think of even jumping and if you try jumping also i will lock you up in a room i am asking the question a normal child of the age of five and six who will listen to more the chances of him listening to the first father is more or chances muslims the second father is more or chances muslims the third father is but natural the answer is that listening to the third father the chances that the son will not jump from the 20th floor is in the case of the third father because the third father is cruel to be kind he is very firm i will tie you up i will slap you i will lock you in the room the child will get scared you cannot say no i'll try to explain to him logically you know he may not understand the second father says okay i will not allow you to go down to play so what the as long as i fly like a superman who wants to play but i will lock you in a room i will slap you i will tie you up it will scare the child now the third father loves this child more he is willing to go to any extreme proceed that he doesn't jump and kill himself similarly allah almighty god in islam he is very clear-cut and sure that if the person does shirk if he associates partners with almighty god it is the biggest sin he will go to hell fire so if telling do not have alcohol do not have pork do not gamble do not do adultery all this is beneficial if you do you will go to hell so in islam allah subhana wa tala uses three types of strategies in convincing the human beings number one is with reason and logic if you read the quran there are many verses saying that will you not then understand this book is for people of understanding that means talking to them logically some people will agree logically some verses of the quran allah says if you do this i will reward you i will give you jannah in which rivers will flow beneath your feet in which you'll have a lot of fruits to eat you will have the best of life giving you rewards sometimes the third strategy allah uses if you don't obey me i'll put you in hell fire i will punish you so there are three types of strategies used by allah almighty god in quran and in islam to convince the followers to follow the straight path whether a human being follows the straight path or not it makes no difference for allah it will not make him greater he is already the greatest but if you follow the commandment it will benefit the human being if he doesn't have alcohol he'll have good health if he doesn't gamble it will save him a lot of trouble you don't do adultery it will prevent them from several diseases it will let them lead a good happy family life so all these things what allah commands in the quran and in islam what a beloved prophet says in the sharia it is benefiting the human being not almighty god but almighty god loves this creature allah in islam is the most loving most kind most merciful therefore he wants his creation the human means to follow him that's the reason allah is very firm also trying to give you a warning that don't do all these wrong things otherwise it will be lost for you and he even tells them that you get punishment so this is for the benefit of the human beings that's the reason today in the world the religion that is followed most is islam in numbers and senses you may have more number of claiming that christians may be close to 2.7 billion or a little bit more muslims are more than 2 billion in the world more than 26 but the percentage the number of human beings following a religion number one is islam most of the christians don't follow the religion the only name say christians so amongst the human beings the people that follow maximum the religion are the muslims it is the islamic religion why because the way allah uses the strategy of reason and logic islam is the most logical religion give the strategy of giving reward the reward that is mentioned in the quran about jannah the description of jannah is the best as compared to any other scripture at the same time warning them you will get punishment you get hellfire the description of hellfire in the quran is the worst as compared to all the scriptures so the strategy used by allah is the most logical most rewarding most punishing that's the reason the people that follow the maximum and religion is islam and according to a survey which was done in germany just about one year back the people that are the most satisfied and the most happy are the muslims because of this strategy hope this answer will convince your friend and i pray to allah that may he give hidayah to your friend and may accept islam the next question is from brother sameer sam whether somebody asking the question that if tattoo haram in islam please answer our beloved prophet salallahu said it's mentioned hadith of say bihari verb number seven hadith number five 943 that ibn may allah be pleased with him said that allah curses the woman who practices tattooing and who gets tattooing done on herself and the woman that removes the hair from the face and the eyebrows etc and the woman who makes artificial gaps between her teeth to look beautiful or changes the structure what allah has given her and will i not curse those women who the prophet has cursed or allah has cursed in his book this hadith is very clear-cut say bukhari on number 7 hadith number 5943 a similar message is given in say muslim volume number five hadith number five five seven three let it be massive malabi please with him he said that may allah curse the woman that practices tattooing and the woman that they're tattooing on herself so based on these two hadith both of them and the saying it is the highest category of hadith is a hadith which is available in say buhari and say muslim it is the highest category of say it says very clearly that doing that to me practicing tattooing or having tattoo done on yourself both and allah curses such people tattooing means you take a needle and you inject dyes one of the commonest way is that you take out blood and in place of the blood you put a dye maybe blue color or any other color this is called tattooing but tattooing if it is permanent it's called tattooing so anything which is permanent you inject a dye and you put a color whether it be blue colored color any color and you make a design or whatever it is and that dye becomes permanent part of your skin this type of permanent tattooing is haraman islam it's not permitted but if it is done on a temporary basis for example you use henna or you use mehndi or any color which is temporary for a few days then that is permissible especially hinna is permissible mehndi you do a design as long as the design that you're doing with hina with hindi or any other temporary color it is not against islam it should not be an image of an animal or a human being as long as it doesn't break the rule of the islamic area it's permitted but permanent method with a needle injecting dye or there are new methods now if it's permanent color using any sort of design if it's permanent it is changing the creation of allah this is prohibited the next question is by brother shahil theory from india he's a non-muslim hi dr zakir i am 17 years old i want to accept islam but can i accept islam after i turn 20 because i don't think that my parents will support me if i accept islam now but the child has asked a question that he's 17 years old and he wants to accept islam he's convinced with the teaching of islam but he feels that his parents won't accept him that is the reason you want to accept islam after three years then he's 20 where he can stand on his own feet my reply to your question brother is that if you are convinced with the teachings of islam and you agree islam is the best religion i would suggest accept islam immediately because we don't know how long will we live i cannot guarantee whether i will see tomorrow or not so my advice to you is that if you are convinced with islam accept it immediately as soon as possible and when you accept islam you need not proclaim it to the world since you're 17 years old and you feel that your parents will not support you i would say that at least wait till the age of 18 maybe you will become 18 after a few months or maybe after six months maximum maybe a year till that time accept islam you do your pharise you pray salah and if after the age of 18 when 18 is the legal age in india where you become an adult and no one can stop you from following any faith maybe that's the time you can tell your parents so if yet want to hide you can hide but see to it that you follow the ferris but natural if you do not proclaim to the world or do not proclaim to your parents or to your family that you become muslim it will be more difficult for you to practice islam so my suggestion would be that you can convey the message that you have accepted islam and tell them but if you feel that it's going to be a big problem for you it is permitted that you hide from them and it's not required that you know you'll wait till you get a good job where you can earn a good living and then you proclaim islam it's not required the moment you realize it's the best religion accept it you may or may not convey to your parents but my suggestion would be that when you reach the age of 18 you also convert to your parents and do dawah to your parents i am sure inshallah inshallah they will not be as angry as you feel you may never know they will accept you may never know you may be the zarya to convince your parents to accept islam now when you accept islam and you proclaim to your parents you have a bigger opportunity for doing dawah you being the son of your parents it becomes your duty that if you have found the truth you should also convey the truth to your parents so my suggestion would be that you accept islam today tell to your parents at the age of 18 you can show them my video cassettes talk to them politely but my one request is that when you accept islam you have to be more kind to your parents you have to be more courteous to them follow everything what they say unless those things which are against quran and the sayings of the prophet only those things which are against the sharia only those things you don't fall other things you should follow most strictly for example you don't like blue color and your mother likes blue color and they say sun wear blue color you wear even though you don't like it wear it because wearing blue colors except in islam it is muba see too that you love your mother more that you care for her more you take care of her and you talk to her more be kind to her more she should see what's happened to my son how come he's become more kind more merciful more loving then you should say this is because this is what my religion teaches that paradise lies beneath the feet of my mother i have to respect my mother i have to love my mother i have to love my father so there should be a drastic change in your behavior towards the good not towards the negative so much so that they should think oh what has happened to my son he's become so good and they should also start loving the religion of islam inshallah i pray to allah that may give you the courage to accept islam as soon as possible and may give you the hikmah dawah to your parents and i pray to allah that may he get your parents and your family also to the straight path next question is from sameer from kerala india sir one atheist has asked that can god create a heavy rock that he himself cannot lift this is a common question that was asked to me also in my school days and my college days that can god create a rock which you cannot lift to reply to this question i normally ask that atheist that do you know how to drive and say this i know do i have a car can you take a left turn whenever i tell you whenever you tell me i can take a left one no driver yes can you take a right turn whenever i tell you yes whenever you tell me i can take a right turn the person is expert in driving a car i should be expert in riding a motorcycle okay tell him can you take a left turn whenever i tell you when you come at a crossroad yes i can take a left one whenever you tell me whenever i come at a crossroad if you come at a crossroad if i tell you right the wheel decider he said yes i can take the right turn i said okay now good now when you come at a crossroad take a left right turn the atheist will say what is the left right turn take a left right turn he means i cannot take a left right just now you told me you can take a left one whenever i tell you you can take a right turn whenever i tell you not take a left right turn then you understand what i'm telling him is illogical yes he can take a left hand whenever he wants he can take a right hand whenever he wants but left and right are two opposing things you cannot do at the same time so if you ask and god create anything he said yes god can get anything can he lift anything and everything yes he can lift anything and everything can he create a rock which he cannot lift it is illogical yes god can't create whatever he wants yes he can lift whatever he wants now you're telling can god create a rock which you cannot lift so as they say why don't you take a left right turn it's like telling that can god create a tall short man yes god can create tall man he can create a short man can he get tall short man that two opposing things that meaningless can god make a fat thin man god can make a fat man god can make a thin man god can make a fat man into thin man he can make a thin man into a fat man but fat thin man these are illogical things so the question is illogical the atheist doesn't know the qualities of god yes this question can be asked to a human being no problem because the human being cannot create everything a human being cannot lift everything so if this question is asked to a human being it makes sense but the atheist doesn't know the concept of god that's the reason is asking this question so i asked that it's yes can you take a left and he said yes can you take a right i said yes kendrick a left right turn he says no so now he's trapped so similarly this question saying can god create a heavy rock which he cannot lift is an illogical question so you can answer an illogical question by asking an illogical question back to the questioner and this way inshallah he will realize the mistake so allah subhana wa tala is all powerful he can do what he wants but he will not do ungodly things hope that answers the question the next question posed is by brother naushad from india allah created human beings some human beings he gave long life and some shot a long living muslim can perform more good deeds than the short-living muslim what if a muslim wants to perform more good deeds but he dies very soon isn't it injustice whether the nakshat has asked a very interesting question and he says that if a muslim dies at a very early age won't it be injustice as compared to a muslim who's living for a longer time or personally 40 years they are the muslim emily for 25 years so isn't it injustice for a muslim would live for a short time that he has no opportunity for doing good deeds if he had lived for longer time he had done more good deeds what brother nausea fails to realize that i can ask a counter question also that the more longer you live the more evil deeds you can do so it is disadvantage is to live for a longer time because if you live for longer time you will do more evil deeds if you live for shorter time you'll do less evil deeds this life doesn't work in this logic allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 67 verse number 2 allah has created that and life to test which of you is good in deeds wa allah can test people even in short time even in long time suppose the person does good deeds allah knows that average good deeds will do may be suppose for example in a year a person averaged us 10 good deeds so if a person lives for 10 years he will do 100 good deeds if he lives for 50 years he'll do 500 good deeds that doesn't mean a person who does 500 good deeds is better than a person with 100 good deed they are the same the average is 10 good deeds per year so it works more on a percentage and various aspects allah judges every human being depending upon the quality and the ability he has given he makes some people rich some people poor some people healthy some people handicap the people who are poor they don't have to give the car they get 100 out of 100 in zakah the person who is rich has to give zakat has to give more charity so depending upon the facility allah subhanahu wa ta'ala allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 40. allah is never unjust in the least degree there's no question that allah can do injustice so you allah subhanahu wata'ala knows depending upon the ability has given you whether wealth or poverty whether health or sickness with the short life or long life based on the ability he has given you he will judge you accordingly allah is malik deen the master of the day of judgment he knows all these things no one on the day of judgment will ever tell to allah that you have been unjust even the kafirs will be put into hellfire they'll say we agree we are wrong but give us one more chance and allah say it's too late allah gives you thousands of chances in this world you come in this world only once and then is the day of judgment hope that answers the question this will shall be the last question before we end the session this question is from isha a reward from jharkhand india i am born in the hindu family but from the past few years i am a muslim alhamdulillah my family is absolutely anti-muslims and after this corona and jamaat incidents the hatred for muslims have doubled i met a boy three and a half years back he is a muslim by birth alhamdulillah he gave me the knowledge about islam and allah gave me the hidayah and i became a muslim by heart and soul now i want to marry him so that i can follow islam and inshallah but till the time i'm here at my parents house i have to face many troubles like i have to hear their cruel words against muslims they criticize muslims they say bad things about muslims they force me to eat prasad they scold me when i do hijab they scold me when i say good things about muslims they stop me from fasting they actually don't know that i'm a muslim now but they have hints they put question on my character and many other things what should i do till the time i'm here sir the boy i want to marry who gave me the knowledge about islam never forced me to convert my family members see news channels such as ajak and republic tv and they keep on criticizing my religion islam their hardcore bjp regarding the reply to your question sisters allah says in the quran in surah fossil 41 verse number 34 that repel evil with goodness you may never know the person in whose heart is evil he will become your friend the person who's your enemy he will become your friend so allah advises repel evil with goodness so even though your family members are against you they're cursing you they're criticizing you they're attacking the muslims you are the good muslim and i congratulate you that you've accepted islam may allah support you you as a good muslim should respect your parents to respect your family members if they are against you you have to be better you have to be kind to them you have to be merciful for them they should say what kind of daughter is this we're attacking her we're criticizing her she's yet kind she's yet loving you have to love your mother more you have to love your father more you have to love your brother more and they should find a marked difference between isha what was before becoming a muslim anisha after she's become a muslim you should obey them only those things what they tell you which is against quran and the sunnah against the commandments of allah and the sayings of the prophet muhammad again the sharia those are the only things you have to obtain from allah says in the quran in surah luqman chapter 31 verse number 14 and 15 and chapter number 29 verse number 8 that you have to be kind to your parents but if the parents do jihad strive and struggle to make you worship somebody else besides allah then don't obey them so only in this time when they ask you to do shirk do idol worship don't obey them when they force you to have prasad don't obey them politely refuse them don't be rude to them and they should be a marked difference in your behavior love them even if they criticize you then i would request you that ask your friend who brought you close to islam and confirm that does he want to marry you you may never know if he bought you close to islam he didn't force you but ask him directly do you want to marry me and how long will you take to marry me ask a direct question don't feel shy if he says it's a few months no problem if he says too long then you have to tell him that i cannot practice for long islam in my family so i have to see to it that you have to tell him to talk to his parents and finalize the marriage as soon as possible and if he's trying to give excuses no i will give you the answer after three years after four years then give him an ultimatum you give me the answer within a few days or a couple of weeks when i'm going to marry and see to it that it is very soon in the next few months maximum a few more months but don't delay it too much if you find that he's not very firm i would advise you look for someone else who is a good muslim or convince him to marry you fast and marry this person according to rules of sharia taking the permission of his parents inform your parents then the moment he agrees that you have become muslim you are an adult you have a right to choose your life partner and alhamdulillah after you tell your parents that you become a muslim it becomes your duty that you have to do dawah to them but see to it that don't behave rude with them if they are root to you you should not be rude to them because paradise lies beneath the feet of your mother your mother may not be in paradise but your paradise lies beneath the feet of your mother be kind to her be respectful to her and it's your duty that you can then give my talks on similarity between islam and hinduism and other lectures of mine slowly slowly talk to them only when you talk to them and you speak to them nicely kindly with love and affection and i pray to allah that may give hidayah to your parents and all your family members so that all of you inshallah can enter jannah this was the last question and you will have to end the session and i would like to remind you inshaallah that inshallah will meet again next time next saturday but we will meet inshallah 5 minutes earlier because in riyadh the sun is setting earlier and my son will start the session not at 11 o'clock malaysia time not at six o'clock makkah time but five minutes to six
