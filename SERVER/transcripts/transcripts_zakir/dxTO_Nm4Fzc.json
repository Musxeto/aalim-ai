  "transcript": "so first of all I must say I've known you for a while I have a chist a Muslim sister somewhere here in the crowd and she sends me your stuff and I listen and I must say it's it's a huge honor to be in in in your presence sir firstly before I ask my questions I have to I have to lay a foundation I have to ask you at first if you as a Muslim do you believe in the Bible brother as the question that do I believe in the Bible no I do not believe in the present Bible I believe in the original Revelation which was given to Jesus that is the inil the present Bible according to the scholars of Christianity is not the original inil I believe in the original inil the which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon Him according to the scholars of Christianity there are 24,000 manuscripts of the present Bible and no two identical so the scholars don't believe to the word of God how can I believe so the present Bible is not the word of God it is mixture it contains some part to be the word of God some part to the word of Jesus Christ some parts the word of historian and some parts of pornography pornography you know pornography I don't know pornography sir there is a chapter in the in the Bible Ezekiel chapter number 24 it's pornography even if you give me a million dollar I cannot read it so this present Bible is a mixture some parts are word of God which matches with the Quran I've got no problem agreeing it to be the word of God which goes against I cannot believe the original Revelation given to Jesus was the word of God but that hasn't been maintained the scholars of Christianity says that leave us at you and me because you have not studied the Bible you may not do you know that there are 24,000 manuscripts of the Bible I know the Bible and no two identical no two identical there are so many versions of the Bible King James Version New International Version American Standard Version revised Standard Version in my library I've got 250 different versions of the Bible Quran is only one Quran in Arabic is only one there may be different translation but Bible different different version so the present Bible is not at all the word of God is it clear and that that that that goes for both the Old and the New Testament of course both okay so um my next my my main question is the concept of Christ being the Son of God and the concept of Christ being God for we as Christians is something it's it's it's actually really easy to grasp and for a long time I've wondered why the concept of Christ being the Son of God and of Christ being God for us as Christians is easy to understand it's been easy for us to grasp because we have gotten our knowledge of that concept from the Bible the brother is saying ask me a question why can't the concept that Jesus is son of God and he's God of the Bible why can't the Muslim understand this question so I'm telling him I clearly mentioned in my question answer session and my talk why can't the Muslim and why can't the Christians understand I understand the Bible very well I'm not speaking on behalf of the other Muslims I have read the Bible I have studied the Bible nowhere does the Jesus Christ peace be upon him and I told that there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement anywhere in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says I am God or where he says worship me if you you you you brother can point out a single verse from the bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says I am God or where he says worship me I'm ready to accept Christianity one verse only one yeah yeah yeah brother said in three places three places where Jesus claimed Divinity what was my challenge there is not a single verse in the Bible where Jesus Christ himself says I am God or where says worship me he's saying Jesus said and my father are one does it mean he's God no does it mean he's God no I'll come my challenge was show me a single unambiguous statement not show me a single unequivocal statement where Jesus Christ peace be himself says I am God or very he says worship me brother is saying Jesus said I and my father are one do you know where does it say in the Bible do you know where does it say in the Bible no you do yes do you know do you don't know do you know the reference or not do you know the reference where does the bible say Jesus Christ said I am my father I could check I could check I could it for you do you know now or no yes or no I don't know now I'll help you I'll help you help me help me help me please you don't know help me please help me please okay what is quoting is Gospel of John Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 30 he's telling a verse of the Bible which he believes and I'm telling him the reference thank you sir thank you sir you should thank me thank you sir so who's working hard me or you thank you sir you are quoting something I'm giving you the reference so who's struggling more you or me you you who's doing more research you okay now what is the context for the context of Gospel of John chapter 10 verse number 30 you have to read seven verses before you know the brother earlier he tried to misguide us by quoting out of context the brother who came before he was trying to misguide by quoting out of context now I will quote you the context the context is Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 23 you can open the Bible and check I'm going to speak from my mind and check whether I'm saying correct I have a Bible in my box okay get it help him help him please give him the Bible I'm speaking from my memory forther context Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 23 it says Jesus enters the porch in Solomon's Temple verse number 24 the Jews the soldiers they surround him and ask him how long does how long does thou make us doubt if Thou Art the Christ tell us plainly Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 23 24 Gospel of John chapter 10 chapter 10 verse number 30 I my father a one it's too much John is not there John will be in the middle John 10 correct Gospel of John 10: 30 correct 100% what him 100% 100% very good correct now I will start from verse number 23 7even verses before Jesus enters the Solomon's porch read Solomon's Temple Jesus enters the porch in Solomon's Temple verse number 24 the Jews the soldiers surround him and asked him why thou make us doubt if Thou Art the Christ tell us plainly correct verse number 25 I told you but you believe not the work that I do in my father's name there bear witness of me verse number 26 you do not believe me because you are not my sheep verse number 27 my followers they hear me and they follow me no man can pluck them out of my hand verse number 29 My Father which is greater than all all no man can pluck them out of my father's hand verse number 28 no man can pluck them out of my hand verse number 29 my father is greater than all no man can pluck them out of my father's hand verse number 30 I and my father are one yeah it's talking about one in purpose not one as joined that means Jesus Christ was talking about the truth when he's speaking about the truth the message was the same if I my father is a doctor I am a doctor I and my father are one does it mean we are joint no in profession we are one he's a doctor I'm a doctor he he heals the human being I heal it doesn't mean I'm my father you understand my father is a doctor I a doctor and my father of one see the context no man can pluck them out of my hand context context verse number 28 no man can pluck them out of my hand verse number 29 no man can pluck them out of my father's hand I and my father are one if you say this one means actually one for argument Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number 21 says Jesus says my father is in me I and you I am in you telling the 12 apostles if you believe it's one there should be 14 Gods Jesus you open Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse 23 it says Jesus say my father is in me I in you he telling the 12 apostles that I am in you so there should be 14 Gods why three Gods so this one doesn't mean one as an entity it means one in purpose so God was the same purpose what Jesus Christ taught was the same purpose what is Apostles followed same purpose there should be actually 14 Gods from this we come to know it doesn't mean one entity mean one in purpose verse number 31 I'm continuing verse number 31 the Jews they pick up stones to Stone Jesus Christ peace be upon Him verse number 32 same same Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 32 many of the good works have I done Jesus Christ which of the good work do you want to Stone me verse number 33 we Stone you because you being a man you blashe the Jews are telling we want to Stone you because you being a man you want to blaspheme that means even they misunderstand that he claimed his God Cor like how you misunderstand verse number 34 is the clarification it is said in your scriptures that if the word comes to the person of God he's called Gods chapter Psalms chapter 82 verse number six 82nd Psalm verse number six e are Gods so if the word of God comes to a person and if you call him God the scripture is not broken that means small G small God mean the messenger of of God no problem read the context where does it say one if you really mean I and my father are one then you have to say I father and 12 Apostles are one all the apostles are God even Thomas even Peter do you believe Thomas is God Thomas is God Thomas is God Thomas um because Jesus said I father is in me I in you to the apostles We Are One if I my father are one is God there should be 14 Gods I never heard any church any Christian in my life saying there are 14 gods that means this one is one in purpose I answered your first question now second one um so please wait wait please don't give a speech I know I want to I just I'm giving you reference just listen to my answer um I completely agree with all you said I can't hear you that microphone you cannot hear this you can hear that microphone you cannot hear different microphone brothers and sisters can you hear me I cannot hear you what do you want to the second reference he gave second place he said I am the way the Su and the life no man come with the father but through me that you said correct sorry I am no he that has seen me has seen the father sorry he that has seen me has seen the father yeah that's do you know the reference I said that reference yeah what is the reference reference you tell me sir you tell me doesn't know the reference he's telling me the verse where Jesus Is God according to him doesn't know the reference Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 7 open open War Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 7 14 right here does it say that or not 789 yeah ah good what is the context context context is go to verse number one verse number one Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number one if you believe in the father believe in me also in my verse number two in my father's Mansion there are many in my father's house there are many mansions I go to prepare a place for you I go and then you'll follow then Thomas says you don't know where I go then he says I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but through me verse number six this is one of the ways the Christian Missionary says Jesus claim divinity you didn't say other say I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but through me every messenger at this time was the way the truth and the life no man come un the father through almighty God but through the messenger at the time of Moses he was the way the truth and the life no man came unto God but through the teachings of Moses at the time of Jesus he was the way the TR and the life no man come to God but through the teachings of Jesus that doesn't mean he becomes God at the time of prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is the way the the life no man come to the father but through prophet Muhammad again he says from now onwards you know me and you know him verse number seven yeah from today you know me and you know him God now you know him and you have seen him correct correct now you know him and you see him that means means according to the Bible knowing means seeing so and then he says anyone who has seen me has seen the father in context knowing means seeing so if you know me you know the father if you see me you have seen the father same thing if you know Moses you know the father if you see Moses you have seen God if you know Prophet Muhammad you know God if you see prophet mammad you have seen God in context it doesn't make them God the third difference Jesus said I am Alpha and Omega No Beginning No End doesn't the bible say that Jesus was born in the stable in Bethlehem he had a beginning it's a contradiction right or wrong Jesus is Alpha and Omega No Beginning No End we had a beginning in the stable right or wrong right that means it's false the Bible is telling a wrong thing he's not the beginning the no beginning and knowing that's the reason I'm telling you study the Bible you study the Bible hear my videos you'll come to the throat can we have the next question please"
