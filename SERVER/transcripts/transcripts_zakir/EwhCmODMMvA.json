  "transcript": "alhamdulillah I welcome all of you with the Islamic greetings may peace mercy and blessing of Allah subhana wa tala be all of you it's an honor for me to be invited by the organizers of this event which is to Mark the solidar after one lunar year after the attack on Gaza which took place on the 7th of October 2023 and we know from the report of Al jazira two days ago on the 24th of September 2024 that total 41,46 people in Gaza have been killed these are the confirmed records and 95,000 921 people have been seriously wounded of course the actual figure would be much more there'll be tens of thousands of people more who have been killed and hundreds of thousand who have been wounded these are the confirmed case known to the authorities of Gaza and we know that for the last one year what has been happening is nothing but a genocide in Gaza and we are in solidarity with the people of Palestine especially Gaza for the last 75 years that they have been struggling and fighting for the freedom especially the last one year since the 7th of October 2023 since the last one lunar year the struggle has reached his panicle and we pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may the people who have been mared may Allah subhana tala grant them and may the people who have suffered who have been wounded and we know that more than 80% of the people of Gaza have been displaced we pray to Allah subhana tala to give them to give them sa to give them steadfastness to give them patience and soless what the people of Palestine especially the people of Gaz are doing is they are doing they are protecting in the third holiest site in Islam that is Masjid AA if they would not have been there we would have to do that job so the full Muslim umah is thankful to the people of Palestine especially the people of Gaza and the atrocities that has happened in the last one year particularly it is unbelievable and this is the first time that there is a genocide which is is been telecast live there have been many genocides before which we come to know we get evidence sometimes after years sometimes after months sometimes after weeks this is the first time in the history of humankind that a genocide what was happening in Gaza for the last one lunar year has been telecast live on the social media and we know that the atrocities that have been done on the people of Gaza what Israel has done they have broken almost all the r rules of international laws they are selectively targeting innocent civilians they are bombarding hospitals they are stopping the relief material that is reaching to Gaza whether it be medicine whether it be water whether it be electricity and according to reports the people that have been killed more than 2third were women and children it is nothing but a genocide and when we see what's happening in Gaza it is a reminder to us Muslims when we read the Quran when we read the Hadi how the sahabas how the sacrific the life how they did J they struggled for the cause of Islam when we see what's happening in Gaza it's a reminder it makes us understand the Quran better it makes us Muslim to understand the Hadith better and we see a mother whose child or a son has been mared and she's praying to Allah subhana ta'ala that even if you give me 10 more children I would love to Marty them for your call here we are seeing genu the Iman and when the non-muslims when they are watching these videos which are going viral they're shocked what kind of Iman do these people have what kind of religion are they following what kind of Faith do they follow what kind of God do they follow who is this Allah that even after so much of a atrocities is being done instead of complaining they are saying alhamdulillah praise be to Allah they are saying mashallah as Allah Wills they are shocked so much so that in the last one lunar year we have reports of tens of thousands of non-muslims who have accepted Islam only by watching the news of Gaza only by knowing what has happen in Gaza there are tens of thousands of non-muslims all over the world especially in Western countries that have accepted Islam and we find a larger number tens of millions of non-muslims before this the non-muslims hardly knew what was happening in Gaza what was happening in Palestine for the last 75 years and there was a one-sided narration in the media now when they seeing the eyes are opening they have realized the truth so much so that now there are tens of millions of non-muslims who have come to know about Islam and we we find them in protest large number of non-muslims are protesting all over the world not only Muslim countries and non-muslim countries against the atrocities what is happening in Gaza so Allah subhana wa taala Allah says in the Quran in Sur Imran chapter number three verse number 54 they planned and plotted Allah to plan Allah is the best of plan Allah says they plan and plotted Allah is the best of planner here we see that whatever atrocities they're doing now it's open to the world it is a double standard what they talk about human rights it's nothing but violation of the human rights we are here when one Luna year has been completed we are here in solidy for the people of Gaza Allah subhana wa taala is with you we request you to continue your struggle and inshallah we pray to Allah subhana wa taala so that he gives you the best in this world as well as in the i' given a speech on this topic of 15o action plan or 13o action plan for the Muslim umah for the Palestinian calls and time will not permit me to repeat all the points but it is a f for every Muslim the least we can do is pray for the people of Palestine is to pray for the people of Gaza and the best time to pray is in the last one3 of night in in your because Allah answers the prayer the best at that time and we find Muslim umah in many countries they are reading the in every Salah in five time Salah in jamaat they are praying for the people of Palestine it the duty that we pray for them it is the duty that we spread the atrocities that is being done on the people of Gaza all over the world on our social media whether it be on Facebook whether it be on YouTube whether it be Instagram see to that you bring in Awareness all over the world it's your duty and we have to protect against the atrocities protest many times does wonders and what we find that in the last few months the protest have not only been in the Muslim countries they have been in the non-muslim countries even in America in UK in European countries all these countries are strong alleys of Israel and we see the Common Man the non-muslims coming in huge numbers in tens of thousands in hundreds of thousands in large numbers protesting against the atrocity that is being done on the people of Gaza and we find that today only because of what's happening in Gaza and the way the people in Gaza are reacting the IM that they have we find that the tens of millions of non-muslims they have come closer to Islam and we have to see to it that we contribute the best that we can for the cause of Allah subhana wa tala we have to see to it that whatever you have whatever Li Lim mited resources Allah has given you or whatever maximum resources Allah has given you you have to sacrifice that for the cause of the people of Gaza so that we get the a in return and even boycotting is a very good strategy and we know because of the boycott that has been done in the past several months there's been a great loss for companies like Starbucks like company like McDonald's which are supporters of the atrocities supporting Israel in atrocities done on the people of Gaza and we find that they have gone in huge losses in huge losses so much so that that many of the people who were supporting Israel in attacking Gaza are now supporting Gaza we have to do our duty as Muslims and I would like to end the short speech of mine in just reminding the people that what the people of Gaza are doing are phenomenal may Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala reward you may Allah Grant you the highest levels of jna may Allah give you may Allah give you and it's the duty of every Muslim that we stand by by the people of Gaza and we pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may he solve all your problems and let peace Prevail back into the land of Palestine i' would like to end the speech with the Ayah I quoted of Surah is chapter number 17 verse number 81 where Allah says when truth is H in falsehood falsehood perishes for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish"
