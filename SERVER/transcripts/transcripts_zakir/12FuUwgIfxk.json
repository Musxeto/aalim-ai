  "title": "Does Islam Believe in Rebirth? If Suicide is Prohibited, why Muslims Blow Themselves Killing Others",
  "transcript": "good evening everyone my name is sanji um i'm working here in land marvel company as an admin executive uh i got a few questions but i lost only two questions regarding this islam first question is do islam believe in rebirth and second question is in islam it's not allowed to commit suicide but many people that in pakistan in arabic countries they are blowing themselves up and they are killing many people so who they who are the peoples they are motivating them whether they are for really following the islam or who is motivating them that is my question sir brother has two questions the first question does islam believe in rebirth and the second question that is suicide prohibited in islam how come people in pakistan other part of the world they are blowing up themselves and killing themselves the two questions as far as the first question is concerned that does islam believe in rebirth if you ask only in rebirth yes islam believes in rebirth what we believe that the human beings come to this world once the quran says that if we give you life and come on this earth then we cause you to die and then we resurrect you again in the next life this is exactly what is mentioned in the vedas if you read rigveda book number 10 it speaks about punar janam punar means next janam means life so the veda speaks about punar janam about the next life but unfortunately most of the hindus they misunderstand the meaning of punar janam punar means next jannah means life we believe in the next life you say punar janam you say rebirth we have no problem but most of the hindus they believe in a philosophy known as samsara it's a sanskrit word samsara which means birth death birth death a cycle of reincarnation a cycle of birth that birth death birth death this cycle of birth death birth death or some sarah or reincarnation is nowhere to be found in the vedas what they quote is a verse of bhagavad-gita chapter number 2 verse number 22 which says that like a human being takes off the old clothes and puts on new clothes same way the soul throws away the whole body and puts on the new body as far as this is concerned i've got no objection with the bhagavad-gita it's further mentioned even in the panishads that like a caterpillar walks up a grass of blade it jumps on to the new grass i have got no problem now as far as the scriptures are concerned if you take the literal meaning of the veda which does not speak about the cycle of birth that the birth death but only speaks about punar janam next life islam speaks the same but most of the scholars of hinduism they could not understand that how can a human being be born with some congenital defect how can he be born as a handicap some are unhealthy some are born handicapped some are born in rich family some are born in poor family so they thought this was injustice so how could god be unjust therefore they propounded the theory of samsara which is nowhere to be found in the vedas the vedas are considered as the highest hindu scriptures in the hindu scriptures we have this mirati and you have the shruti smithi means scripture written by the human beings and shruti are the vedas and upanishads considered to be the word of god now because they could not justify why some people are born in rich families some in poor family some are unhealthy some with kenjal defect they propounded this theory of samsara as far as islam is concerned allah says in the quran in surah chapter number to test which of you is good in deeds this life you're leading is a test for the hereafter and we believe that every child is born sinless is born muslim irrespective whether he's born handicapped or healthy whether rich family poor family all these things are a test for human beings as allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 and surah and 5 chapter number 8 verse number 28 it says that surely we will test you with fear and hunger with loss of life and loss of what you have earned it's mentioned surah chapter number 8 verse number 28 that your children and your wife are a test for you now here we realize that the quran says the children are a test for you know if a child suppose is born handicapped it's a test for the parents the parents may be very good they may be past maybe allah wants to test them more after giving them a child which is handicapped yet do they have faith in allah or not it's a test so whenever any calamity before then human being it's either a punishment or a test whenever any good thing happens in your life it's either a reward or it's a test that does not mean if something bad happens it has to be a punishment it can be a punishment it can be a test if something good happens in your life it can be a reward or it can be a test so here almighty god is testing the parents that do they have faith in almighty god so if a handicapped child is born the parent may be an average muslim and if he says oh why my child only has to be born handicapped why my child has to be born with a congenital heart disease allah is testing them the people who are good muslims they'll say allah at this time no problem yet we thank allah subhanahu wa and more difficult the test more higher is the reward to pass a simple graduation of ba is easy but to pass mbbs is difficult the moment you pass mb base in front of a name you get doctor dr full stop higher status examination is difficult the honor is more so almighty god test different people different way the child that is born what the hindus said the hindu scholars in his previous janam in his previous birth he did the sin therefore he was born handicapped they didn't have any other justification if you do good deeds then you're born healthy so what hindu scholars they propounded that every living creature it keeps on changing according to them the universal brotherhood of hinduism is all living creatures are your brothers so sometimes you're born as an animal sometime as a bird sometime as a rat sometime as a cockroach sometimes human being and the human being is the highest level and they're born as a human being seven times so they came with this philosophy because they could not justify why a child is born rich or poor handicap or healthy similarly for a person who's born poor it's a test for him for the rich people he has to give zakat every rich person who has a saving of more than a sub level 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5 percent of that saving every lunar young charity for the poor person for him he gets full marks in zakat he's poor so he has to give no zakat 100 out of 100 but we say the rich man if he gives proper zakat he make 100 out of 100. he says okay fine i've got so much wealth this part is exempted from zakat he may get fifty percent of zakat so you'll get negative points he may not give zakat at all so imagine suppose there's a questionnaire there's a question in a question paper which is very easy should you be happy or sad so when a person is born poor actually in zakat he gets hundred out of hundred therefore beloved prophet said it's easier for a poor man to go to jannah than a rich man but we say a poor man how sad not sad 100 out of 100 in zakat for the rich man he has to give charity he has to give zakat he has to give donation he'll be accountable for his wealth so what in islam we are born in this world once and once is sufficient once we die we are resurrected on the day of judgment you want to call it rebirth i've got no problem you want to call punarjanam i've got no problem we say life after death but surely if i agree with you for sake of argument for sake of argument what the hindu scholars propound that you know sometime you're born as animal sometimes bird sometimes human being i want to ask you the question brother in this world as every year is passing on is the population of the human beings increasing or decreasing rather increasing or decreasing increasing very good is the sin in the world increasing or decreasing i can't hear you increasing or decreasing increasing sorry increasing increasing human beings are increasing and every sin is increasing if i agree with the philosophy of hindu scholars more the sin increases the population of human beings should decrease so therefore i believe in going to the highest scriptures vedas when i talked we had given the talk earlier in chennai during the first peace conference that was in 2004 similarities between islam and hinduism and there i showed and compared that even in ways it speaks about one god no idol worship and everything so what is common between the scriptures we follow so this the cycle of samsara birth that birth that is nowhere to be found in the vedas it's the philosophy of the hindu scholars to justify because they could not justify why human beings are born poor or healthy which i've given you the answer in islam as far as the second question is concerned that if you said haram in islam is it prohibited if yes then why do people commit suicide is somebody instigating them who said bombing the quran says in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse 195 that do not make your own hand the cause of your destruction so according to the quran committing suicide is haram it is prohibited so as far as committing suicide it is prohibited as far as killing any other innocent human being the quran says in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 32 that if anyone kills any other human being whether it be a muslim non-muslim unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone saves the human being it is as though he has saved the whole of humanity so killing any innocent human being whether it be a muslim or non-muslim it is prohibited in islam so if anyone whether he puts a bomb without killing himself or with killing himself if he kills innocent human being it is prohibited so as far as killing innocent human being is concerned it is prohibited if you use it as a strategy of war you know the japanese used to do the suicide you know initially where you get without bombing from according to a professor who wrote a book dying to win in america he says that the first people who did suicide bombing were the ltt tamil tigers but yet the blame is put on muslims i know why it's the media have you ever heard of any muslim doing suicide bombing it was first the ltt and then the americans and maybe some of the muslims black sheep may have picked up but who were the originators but yet when susan bombing comes the terrorists are labeled the muslims in chennai a few years back are also given a talk on terrorism and jihad an islamic perspective but i've described in detail about this answer of suicide bombing as far as islamic perspective is concerned but killing innocent human being and committing suicide is haram hope to answer the question [Applause] you"
