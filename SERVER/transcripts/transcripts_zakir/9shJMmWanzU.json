  "title": "Should we Trust in Allah and keep the Mosques Open during Coronavirus COVID 19? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "what is the opinion on the groups of Muslim who protest against the closing of mosques due to coronavirus on the basis that that would imply fearing other than Allah the question poses that whatever I do regarding the word Muslim who are protesting again is the closure of the mosque in different parts of the world and they're saying that you are fearing others more than Allah as far as I am concerned I am against those people who go to extreme lengths in the Neukom do not commit excesses in your Deen as far as the guidance given with the prophet musa alehsalaam the Prophet clearly said in say Bihar in verified which I discussed in my previous sessions that when you know of an epidemic of a plague in a particular land don't go to that land and if you're in that land don't leave that land where isn't it the Prophet said if you see a leper if you see a leper run away from him as they have seen a lion so all this happening says that we should stay away from contagious diseases but the Prophet said dire camel understand God now what we have situation as far as the group of people who are against the closure of mosque we'll discuss that later on what if you see the different scenario world over of Muslim countries the first Muslim country I won't take its name the first Muslim country that openly announced that they're going to shut the mosque because of coronavirus in that country there was not a single death due to karana virus they were few hardly about 40-50 positive cases of corna virus covered 19 as a precaution they closed the mosque in complete country many Muslim scholars objective and within a few days many Muslim countries all over the world followed it I am NOT against closing the mosque to take yourself from covered 19 if it's a requirement but don't go overboard to give a statement that you should ferrule and no one else is not correct because the profit was the person who feared Allah much more than us he said run away from my leper as we have seen a lion he said when you know of a place don't enter that city if you're in that land don't leave that land these are precautions be touched in God but we have to tie a camel but what we see that some of the Muslim country will over precautious they not tying the camel they are strangulating the camel in some countries when there is not even a single case of coronavirus covered 19 they shut the mosque this is nonsense if there is the case where the cases are many and many people are infected there are people who have died and then you close the mosque after taking guidance from the medical experts and if lamas callers only hearing the medical experts who don't know about the dean who don't know about the religion that how important it is to pray in the mosque you cannot take the advice Quran says first allow al Vickery in wind allah tala moon that if you don't know as the person who's knowledgeable surah al chapter 16 verse 43 and sorry i'm be about 21 verse number 7 so there should be a striking balance so if the infection has spread quite a lot and you think that opening the mosque you will really cause many more people to be infected not just being overcautious so they should be striking balance between the two so those people who are not bother about prevention and telling that we should have faith in allah they are wrong and those people are all precautions and closing it beforehand even they are on so we should not commit excesses in your religion Allah says in the Quran lithography nuku do not commit excesses in your religion so in such a perforce number 171 so my view is that even if your take precaution as I mentioned Murli and so take precautions you can take a Sujatha you can take a masala a prayer mat where ma hand sanitizer in can be done do with you at home spend the least time in the mosque go to the restroom in your house don't shake hands read the Sunna Salah before the Forrestal at home after the Forrestal asana at home take all these precautions and continue until you think it is possible when you think it is really required to close and then you know that what no opposition but don't be all precautions and when the things upset also open it as soon as possible if you take precaution and and proper guidance having a proper session with the health authorities and the Islamic scholars in consultation and then taking the decision it's correct but just taking a decision to please the world or to please the other people or to say no I will continue praying this is not Islamic so don't commit excesses follow the middle path"
