  "transcript": "alhamdulillah was [Music] the viewers platform I welcome all the viewers with Islamic greetings mercy and blessings of Allah of almighty God beyond all of you I welcome you to a talk on the first 10 days of jalija I have divided this talk into four sections the first is importance of the first 10 days of the lija the second is the important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days of the lija the third is the virtue of arafah and the fourth is first we'll discuss the importance of the first 10 days of the leja this if I forgotten Sunnah of a beloved partner you may have sinned all year you may have missed doing good deeds in the month of Ramadan you've been missed the last 10 nights of Ramadan you may have missed doing good deeds this is the opportunity make the best of it the first 10 days of the Raja even if you have not sinned the Holier maybe you did some minor sins maybe you did about that in the month of Ramadan even you might have got the last 10 nights of Ramadan even you might have prayed the full night of life yet you cannot afford as a Muslim the opportunity during the first 10 days of the legend most of us Muslims we are normally aware of the importance of Ramadan and we prepare ourselves and I remember when I was a kid more than 30 years back when I was in school about 45 years back we used to prepare ourselves from none and we knew the importance of Ramadan even of the last 10 nights of Ramadan but we never heard about the importance of the first 10 days of the Liga alhamdulillah now since social media has started this is being discussed by the speakers my time when I was a kid when I was in school when I just entered College we never heard the speaker speaking about the importance of 10 days of the Richa I remember the first time I heard was maybe about 15 years back in the social media when we got involved in the field of dhava more than 25 30 years back that's the time we came to know about the importance of the first 10 days of the Ninja and it was about 15 years back that the first time I heard in the social media a speaker speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of the Leisure and alhamdulillah it's increasing and more and more people are speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of the winter that's the reason I thought I will dedicate the major portion of this session today to the first tenders of The Ledger Allah takes an oath in Surah chapter number 89 was number one to two Allah says foreign by the ten nights they say these 10 nights that Allah is taking oath of refers to the first 10 days of the leja and in many languages when you speak about the days that includes the nights when you speak about the night reading includes the day for example if I say in English I spent 10 days in London but natural it includes I've spent 10 days and 10 nights in London depending upon the context we include the full day it may include part of the day it may include the night it may not include similarly when in Arabic the knights are referred to it may refer to the night only it may refer to the night and they put together or it may refer to the day only in this Surah al-fajr Surah number 89 verse number one to two when Allah says Asher by Dawn by the 10 nights the Mufasa Serene say and it's also mentioned word number eight page number 413 and if we refer to the summarized version the English translation printed it is volume number 10 page number 468. foreign that these 10 nights refer to the first 10 days of the leja and they agree that these first 10 days of dulhija are better than all the other days of the year it's even better than the last 10 days of Ramadan but it's mentioned volume number five page number 412 that though the first 10 days of the leja are the best days of the full year the last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights of the year the scholars differ some Scholars few do say that the first 10 days of the are better than the last 10 nights of Ramadan there are few Scholars who say the last 10 nights are better than the first 10 days of the religion but the right opinion and the correct opinion Islam may Allah have mercy on him and he rightly said that the first 10 days of dulhija are the best days in the full year it is even better than the last 10 days of Ramadan but the last 10 nights of Ramadan they are the best nights in the full year because it has the latest it's the best night in the full year so the last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights because it is and amongst the days in the full year the first 10 days of dulija are the best days in the year because it has the second place with the Quran refers the benefits which have been provided and may celebrate the name of Allah through the days appointed here these days are referring to the first 10 days of the lija foreign then simultaneously perform all the Five Pillars all the five Horizon of Islam if he wanted to yes he can Implement on the Waheed he can offer Salah some at least together in the first 10 days he can give zakat if he hasn't given your obligated charity or give extra charity he then fast and he can also perform Hajj these are the only days in the full year where a person can simultaneously perform all the five pillars of Islam it is mentioned and say buhari word number two Hadith number 969 he said that the Beloved Prophet Muslim said there are no good deeds done on any other days better than done during the first 10 days than during these days and the sahabas the companions they asked not even Jihad and the prophet replied not even Jihad unless a person put in danger his life and wealth in the way of Allah and does not return with any that means he goes for Jihad and he's martyred in the way of Allah that means a beloved Prophet Muslim said the Good Deeds Done during the first 10 days of jalijah better than any deed done on any other days of the year including unless if the person is martyred and he loses his wealth and life during Jihadi that's the only one Good Deed which cannot be better otherwise the day is done on the first enters of the lija are better than any deed than on any other day of the year it is so important and unfortunately this Sunnah of doing good deeds during the first tenders of dhulija is forgotten it's further mention you in sahih Muslim why number three Hadith number 2747 when the prophet was asked regarding fasting on normal arafah the prophet said it expiates the sins of the previous year and the coming year that means the most important fast after the first of Ramadan is fasting on your R5 it experts your sins of the previous year as well as the coming year there are some Scholars who say that the first thing of Ashura the tenth of Marram is the most important because there's a Hadith that the most important fast after the first is the fasting on your mother but the different opinion but the correct opinion is that your arafah fasting is far superior because it expeds the sins of the previous year and the following year whereas fasting on Ashura expirates only the sins of the previous year but this unanimous agreement that these two fast of your arafah and fasting on Ashura are the two most important fast after the fasting of the month of Ramadan it's mentioned word number three Hadith number 2437 that one of the wives of the Prophet said that the messenger of Allah fasted during the first nine days of the lija and during Ashura and three days every month the first Monday and two Thursdays so from this Hadith we come to know that the prophet fasted the first nine days of the religion that means it is highly recommended to fast on all the first nine days of the Ninja one mask why not fast all the 10 days are the answer is given in say buhari number three Hadith number 1991 where the Beloved Prophet said that he forbade fasting on either because these are the two eids of celebration of eating and drinking so it is prohibited too fast on the two then that's the reason we don't have to fast the first 10 days though the first 10 days are the most important days of the year we only fast during the first nine days it further mentioned inside Muslim world number three Hadith number two six seven nine the Beloved Prophet Muslim said that no one shall enter Paradise except a believer and the days of mina are the days of eating and drinking that means a Muslim should not even fast on the three days following that is the 11th 12th and 13th of zelage because these are the days of eating and drinking and feasting so besides the Eid they a Muslim should not even fast on the ayamata that is the 11th 12th and 13th of July it's mentioned inside Muslim volume number five Hadith number 5118 that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that during the first 10 days of dholija a person who has an animal which he has to sacrifice he should not remove his hair not trim his nails based on this Hadith a person who is sacrificing animal have animal and wants to sacrifice on each day or the following three days he should not remove his hair or trim his nails from the first day of the lija until he sacrifices animals this restriction is only for the person who is sacrificing the animal himself if a person has asked somebody else to sacrifice on his behalf then the Restriction is not there it further mentions number five four four six said the Deeds Done during the first 10 days of zulija are the most important Deeds Done in the full year and that's the reason you should say the tahlil is alhamdulillah number two page number 462 that the tagbirath mentioned there is that Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest there is no God but Allah Allah is the greatest to Allah is mentioned in number two page number 462 Allahu Akbar Allah foreign Volume 2 read number 65. that Abdullah Bin Omar they have to go out in the marketplace during the first 10 days of the Richa and loudly they used to recite the Virat and when the others used to hear them the Sabbath they used to repeat on their own that means it is a Sunnah during the first 10 days of the leja to say the taqbirat loudly in the marketplace it's mentioned in volume 2 page number 65. that Abdullah Bin Omar BPS with them both they have to go out in the marketplace during the first 10 days of the Richa and loudly they used to recite the birat and when the others used to hear them the Sabbath they used to repeat on their own that means it is a Sunnah during the first 10 days of the leja to say the taqvirat loudly in the marketplace I have traveled to so many Muslim countries I have never heard in any Muslim country Muslims saying loudly in the marketplace I have not heard many Muslim countries have gone to maybe in some Gulf countries there may be people say but when I travel I have not heard this in the marketplace we should revive this Sunnah and this another Hadith mentioned foreign he said that the messenger of Allah asked do you know the deed which is most loved by Allah the deed which is most precious to Allah the deed which is more beloved to Allah more than giving charity of silver and gold more than going in the battlefield and striking the necks of the enemies more beloved than having your neck struck by the enemy in the battlefield and the Sabbath asked which is the deed and the prophet replied of Allah now this Hadith it's not specifically talking about the first 10 days of the legend it is generally the deed loved most by Allah and all the other haditha quoted earlier say that the Deeds The Good Deeds Done during the first 10 days of the are better than deeds done on any other day so imagine if we do the zika of Allah during the first 10 days of the specially go out in the marketplace and say loudly it is much better than Distributing gold or silver in the marketplace much better than being struck by the enemy in the battlefield striking the enemy on their neck in the battlefield or being struck by the enemy on your neck in the battlefield let us revive the Sunnah and during these 10 days of the lija are starting from tomorrow in most of the countries in Malaysia where now it is close to 12 midnight has already started the night has started but the day will start approximately five or 50 minutes from now inshallah Malaysia is one of the few countries where the first 10 days of gulija will start and later on the other countries the gulf countries four hours later five hours later so on and so forth so that's the reason I thought it's important for me to speak on this topic so let us decide today that these 10 days of the letter which are starting from tomorrow in most of the countries in some countries it may be one day later India Pakistan Etc in some countries it may be two days later but most of the countries it is inshallah starting from tomorrow so let us make the most of these first 10 days of the lecture now we will discuss the second point which is the important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days I have enumerated five important points some people have listed 10 20 30 some more there are hundreds of Good Deeds you can do to make the list a bit shorter I have enumerated 35 important deeds and acts to be done during the first 10 days of the Ninja and whenever I enumerate I try and enumerate the ones which are the further on the top then coming with the highly recommended Sunnah and then the other Sunnah later on that's my policy and when I repeat the Good Deeds I also repeat the Pharisees which are supposed to be done daily because what are the farage daily have to be done first then you can talk about the sunute then you can talk about this so this is the order I follow whenever I list the important Acts or deeds will be done so number one the most important Act during the first end of dilija is that you should offer Salah in congregation in the mosque all the five daily Salah in congregation in a mosque it is especially for the Muslim men for The woman there are exceptions and when I'm listing these 35 important points it is for all types of Muslims whether you're more practicing Muslim whether you are modern practicing Muslim or less practice Muslim you are a less practice Muslim you will see to it that you will do as much as these Good Deeds as possible if you're moderate what you'll do you'll try and do all of these 35 Good Deeds if you're already a practicing Muslim then what you'll do you'll see to it that you'll increase the intensity of a mother so these days are meant for all the Muslims where they are less practicing modern practicing or more practicing if you're less practicing you see to it that you do as much as possible of all the good deeds if you're moderate you see today you do all the good deeds and increase the intensity if you're already a good practice Muslim doing all the farahs see to that to increase the intensity of the mustahab if you're moderate and you're doing the farai then you do if you are a highly practicing Muslim then besides the farai and the Sunnah you do this if you're already doing this what do you do you increase the intensity so during these two important days one is the first sentence of dilija and the other are the days in the month of Ramadan it's very important that you increase your intensity so the first important did to be done during the first 10 days of the lija is offer Salah in congregation all five times in the mosque number two if you have not performed Hajj you should perform it fit further you if you have the means and if you have the health and the wealth and if you have not performed Hajj you should perform much it's tougher than you if you have already performed Hajj and if you can do it again it is mustab it is Sunnah it is encouraged but we know since last one and a half year we have this pandemic of the coronavirus and last year hardly approximately 1000 were permitted to Hajj the Saudi government has announced they will allow 60 000 Muslims to do Hajj out of which 15 000 would be Saudi Nationals and the ball is 45 000 would be the foreigners who are living in Saudi Arabia who already have the karma they will not allow any outside people to enter who are not residents of Saudi Arabia but those who are already residents of Saudi Arabia they will allow 45 000 people and they'll see to it they'll allow from all the different nationalities depending upon the percentage they're present we prayed Allah that may he next year solve this problem of the pandemic and again the Muslims would be able to do in large numbers inshallah in millions like what we used to do two years before the third important act indeed is that you should abstain from all the Haram Acts from the major sins as well as the minor sins and if you're a good Muslim not do any images there are some minor sins that Muslims normally do unknowingly unknowingly see to it that during these 10 days we abstain from all the sins not in the major sins but each and every of the minor cells the fourth is that you should fast during your arafah the ninth and as I mentioned earlier it will exped your sins of the previous year and the communal the fifth is fast during all the first nine days of the luja and that is a highly recommended Sunnah sixth is that if you have the means you should sacrifice during that is the tenth day of diligya if you have the means and Allah give you capacity sacrifice an animal on this day the seventh is that say the thus B that is that is as much as possible during all the 10 days of the leja or you can decide together you can recite this as much as possible throughout the day the it is that you should go out in the marketplace and say that as loudly so that people are reminded of Allah and they also repeat it on their own and as I had mentioned earlier as much as possible God in the marketplace tell to the others remind others to do zikr to remember Allah it is than Distributing gold or silver in the marketplace the ninth is praying Salah in the last one third of the night and do Dua enough for forgiveness during this last one third of the night in which Allah answers the prayer of the maximum the tenth is pray in which the prophet said if you pray this well rakat you will enter Jannah and have a house close to the house of the prophet and the twelve Sunita Sunnah before the father Salah the two plus two foreign also offer the Salat Doha and the salatu duha is offered approximately when asked which is the right thing he said immediately about 20 minutes after the sunrise till about 10 to 15 minutes before the time you can offer the Salah do anytime between this time you can afford two rakat Prophet said two Rakata as much as you can but the prophet most of the time you offered foraka so preferred before a cut you can even afford the prophet even offered eight rakat foreign and the better time to offer the prophet said is when the camel can feel the heat of the sand so it is preferable to offer after the midpoint between the Fajr and between the dohar this is a better time but you can offer anytime 20 minutes after the sunrise and if you offer immediately after Sunrise it's called an ishrakh but the better time is after the midpoint as in the Sunnah of the Prophet the 12th point is that you should do Dua before breaking your fast the 13th do as much as Dua throughout the 10 days of the ninja and do not miss doing Dua during the Friday of these 10 days the first 10 days whenever Friday comes whether once or twice see to it that you offer in that one hour after sarsala before Maghrib this is an important time one of the prescribed time for the Dua the 14th is do zikr of Allah as much as possible throughout the 10 days of the religion Point number 50 read the Quran and if you don't understand Arabic along with Arabic it read the translation of the Quran in the language you understand the best Point number 16 ask for forgiveness from Allah during the first 10 days of the lija Point number 17 give as much charity as possible besides if you have given your zakat good if you have not feed to it you give it but besides zakat give as much as Charity as possible Point number 18 do as many Good Deeds as possible Point number 19 every day during these 10 days of the media Point number 20 recite the of the Beloved prophet if you are not reciting start reciting in these 10 days if you recite few start reciting more or increase for most of the acts there are duas so see to it you do the Muslim duas Point number 21 do as many sunnahs of the prophet for example while you drink water seed to it you sit and drink water it is a very important mission of the prophet when you wear a footwear see to it do you wear the Footwear on the right leg first when you remove the Footwear see to it you remove your left leg first when you're into the mosque enter with right leg when you exit the mosque you exit with the left leg when you enter the toilet enter with the left leg when you exit the toilet you exit the toilet with the right leg when you are wearing a dress a shirt put your right hand first when removing the shirt remove the left hand first when you're wearing a trouser put the right leg first when removing the trouser remove your left leg first because of the profit do as many fun as you can if you're not doing start doing it if you're doing few do more if you are doing more increase it as much as possible during these 10 days of the religion during these first 10 days of dulija you should see to it that a good deed should increase as compared to the other is of the year it should be more if you are a refund if you are reading only the first start eating them if you're reading all these three increase your Salah increase your Dua increase you're asking for forgiveness 22 read the authentic Hadith of the Prophet as I Hadith you have to say bukhari say Muslim and the sister I say of albani that they had it from Abu Dao from Messiah from and so forth and there's also a new compilation done Byram with accumulated all the Hadith and remove the duplicate which is approximately 16 546 Hadith so once you read this you can easily say that you have read all the Hadith whether it's bukhari Muslim Etc without duplicating so it's easier so if you read the Jamaica it's a good thing to do Point number 23. if that you should forgive people's faults forgive the faults of others that people do around you rather than keeping in your mind or taking a grudge forgive it if you forgive Allah will forgive you whether it be of a family member whether it be of your staff whether it be people around you forgive as many faults as possible of the others Point number 24 do Isla with your other Muslims Point number 25 dudawa with the non-muslims Point number 26 is that you offer foreign the next is the 20 eighth point is attend as many lectures and programs and courses of the authentic Scholars to increase your knowledge in Islam and today being a pandemic if they thought the world attending Life program were difficult you can go to the next point that the 29th point you can watch the videos the video recordings of the authentic Scholars and the authentic orators whether it be on a learning management system whether it be on the Facebook whether it be on the YouTube whether it be on the alidaya whether it be on the beach TV on various social media platforms but see to it that these Scholars and orators that are hurry authentic Point number 30 here are the audio recordings of the authentic Scholars and orators you may be in the car and traveling it's a good opportunity while driving you can hear the audio you may be doing some exercise you may be jogging at that time you can hear the lecture and increase your knowledge Point number 31 read the Sira the biography of the Beloved Prophet Muslim and one of the good biography that you can read is the seal nectar which is written by Sheikh Safir Amman Mubarak it is one of the best seeda that's available Point number 32 spend more time with your family when you spend more time with the family doesn't mean that you go out more with them shopping all the 10 days yes if you want to shop just before eat then buy them good clothes Etc no problem but not all 10 days not going for outing when I say spend more time with the family that along with the family you read the Quran you read the skill of the Prophet at an Islamic program authentic Scholars and authentic or writers watch the video recordings of authentic orators on various platforms social media platforms hear the audio together spend time discuss with them talk to them about the Good Deeds to be done in the first 10 days of religion about the Sunnah of the Prophet read the translation of the Quran this time you are doing a Venn diagram besides doing the ibada you're asking your family to do and the prophet said that the best amongst the Muslims is the one who's best with family especially advice so spend more time with your family and encourage them to come closer to Allah Point number 33. do not waste a single minute during all these first 10 days of the religion Point number 34 be cheerful and happy during all these 10 days of the future and point number 35 see to it that you behave with the people around you with love affection and care this was in short the 35 important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days of the religion now we'll discuss the third point that is the virtues of arafah Allah takes a promise in Surah chapter number 85 verse number three chapter number 85 verse number three Allah is taking a promise by the witnessing day referring to Friday and by the witnessed day referring to your arafah Allah in the Quran number 85 verse number three is taking an oath of yamul arafah it's mentioned number six Hadith number 3339 said that yamul mashud that is the witnessed day or the attended day is your arafah that is the ninth area of the lija and is the witnessing day it refers to Friday it's mentioned in musnad Ahmed ROM number two Hadith number 2455 that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that Allah took a covenant from the loins of the children of Adam in arafah and it says that he took a covenant from the loins of the children of Adam from The Descendant and took a covenant and he bought them from the loins and Scattered them like ants on the fields of arafah and then escorted the verse of the Quran chapter number seven verse number 172 where it says that Allah from the loins of children of Adam from The Descendants and ask them am I not your lord and they replied yes we testify you are a Lord and Allah continues lest on the day of judgment you will say that you were not mindful that means Allah took a covenant from all the children of Adam from The loins from all the human beings that am I not your lord and all of them testified yes you are our Lord took a covenant from all the human beings Point number three is that is the day when our Deen was completed and Allah has fulfilled his favor on the human beings it's mentioned Prince number 45 that um that a Jew came to him and asked him o chief of the Believers there is the worst in your Quran which if it was mentioned in our book we would have celebrated it as Eid asked which is the verse and the Jew said it's mentioned in a Quran and he quotes So remind that chapter 5 verse number three Bella says on this day I have perfected your religion for you and have complete my favor on you and have chosen for Islam um replies we know this was it was revealed on a Friday on the day of arafah that means it was the day of arafah when Allah he perfected the religion of Islam and completely the favor on the human beings and has chosen Islam for us this is the third virtue of arafah the fourth virtue of arafah is that arafah is also a day of Eid number three Hadith number 2419 that the prophet said that is these are the three days following Eid the 11th 12th and 13th of July these are the days of Eid deed are the days of Celebration these are the days of eating and drinking for the people of arafah in arafah it's a neat day for them the fifth virtue of Rafa if that it is the day where Allah forgives and frees the maximum slaves it is called the day of forgiveness and it's Hadith mentioned since the wife of the Prophet said that the prophet narrated that or no day does Allah forgive his servants and free his slaves whether male or female then on the day of arafah and he comes close to the angels and he boasts to them about them and says what do they want that means this day of arafah is also called the day of forgiveness and on this day Allah the maximum slaves ever in the full year on this day of arafah from the Hellfire the sixth virtue of arafah is that it's mentioned in one number three Hadith number three five eight five the Beloved Prophet said on the day of arafah Allah hears the supplication the maximum and I and the earlier Prophets they decided that there is no one worthy of worship except Allah and he has got no Partners to him belong all the domain and all present you to him alone and he has power of all things this is the best Dua that anyone can do on your that was recommended by the prophet it is called the day of Supplication and the seventh virtue of arafah is that a beloved Prophet said as I mentioned earlier inside Muslim volume number three Hadith number 2747 the prophet said that fasting on the day of arafah expiates your sins of the previous year and the coming India and the same information is repeated number 1730 when the prophet said that anyone who fasts arafah his sins of the previous year and the next year are expedited so these were the Seven Virtues Of yamul arafah The Day of arafah now we'll discuss the last and the fourth point that is that is the Eid or the day of sacrifice the end of sacrifice or the real sacrifice and we know that Allah had asked Prophet Ibrahim that what do you love the most in this world but natural after Allah he said my son and Allah tests that can you sacrifice him for me and Abrahim Islam goes and tells his son Ismail salaam and he said don't worry father you will find me steadfast and and this is what we remember every year that we should be able to sacrifice anything in this world for this we sacrifice an animal for one person it is a goat or if you want a big animal like a cow or a camel it can be for seven people and it's mentioned in Surah chapter number 22 verse number 37 it is not their meat or blood that reaches Allah but it is a party which is so we don't sacrifice so that the blood and the meat is but we do it for our taqwait is Allah and what do we do with the sacrifice we sacrifice the animal we distributed amongst the poor people amongst the friends among relatives and keep some for ourselves normally it is recommended that minimum one third should be given to the poor people one third to the family and friends and the maximum you can keep yourself with one third this is a practice let me tell you the feeling features that should be done on either number one that have a bath early in the morning number two put perfume on yourself it's a Sunnah number three is that where the best of your clothes number four number five preferable do not eat anything before they eat prayer number six go to pray early number seven that it is recommended that all the women including the children including the menstruating woman should go for the eat Salah even if they don't have to offer Salah or they don't have to go to the masala and when you come back from eat prayer see to it that you take another route not the same route in which you went for the Salah and preferable to pray in a Muslim an open ground which is called asika now what is the reason that Prophet recommended that all the women and the children including the menstruating women should go for the eat Salah even if they don't have to offer Salah even if they don't have to go and pray what is the reason why the prophet said that you go from one root and when you come back take the other route why did he say that pray in a large place for all this we come to know that the reason is so that it boosts the morale of Muslims normally we Muslims or for five times Salah incongregation the mosque once a week in Juma we have a bigger congregation we pray in the jummah mosque the congregation is multiple then bigger than what congregation we are doing the fight time Salah and twice in the year during the Eden the prophet recommended that to pray in an open ground known as the idka why so that a larger number can gather imagine if you are living in a village and during the East shall I come to know there are 30 000 Muslims there are forty thousand Muslims the morale of the Muslims is boosted and if you are living in an area which has a good non-muslim also the non-muslims will think 10 times before interfering with the Muslims or the Muslim the 30 000 in number 40 000 in number imagine if you're living in a big city and if you prayed one either in which hundred thousand gather or a few hundred thousand gather imagine the scenario it will boost up the morale of the Muslims and at the same time would give a non-muslim thought that they better not interfere with the Muslims this is the psychology for which what is the reason that the Beloved Prophet even told the woman and the children to go even the woman is demonstrated when you go through one way come to the other way not the same way why so that the other people in the other locality of that Village of that town or that City no the Muslims are going in large numbers if you go through root a come back through root B so that the people of ruti also come to know the people of root to be also come to know that Muslims and large number the next important point when you come back if you have the means you sacrifice an animal if Allah has given you the means later on you go and meet your family friends it's the day of Celebration and when you meet the greeting is accept the Good Deeds from us and from you normally in India Pakistan they say Eid Mubarak or other words the Sunnah is to wish except The Good Deed from us and from you you can feed Mubarak it is the right thing is as the sabbas wished each other and the day of Eid this should be a day of Celebration be happy be cheerful let me tell you the important points of the eat Salah before I end this talk there are 14 important points of vithala number one the Eid Salah is further for every Muslim who is an adult I know sin number two it is offered between the time after the Fajr Salah and before the dwar Salah but the earlier we offer the potatoes number three it should be offered in an open ground also known as number four that if Eid Falls then praying Juma on that day is not further but it is Sunnah it is recommended if you pray it is good but if you want you can abstain from Yuma Salah at that time you should pray only the Zohar Salah next Point number five is that there is no Adan or no Akama before the Salah number six there is no Sunnah before the Salah or after the Salah number seven the each Salah is of turaka number eight there are six in the first rakat before Surah Fatiha besides along with that there are total seventhirat in the first takat before Surah in the second rakat after you get up from the sujud in the starting of the second after seeing
