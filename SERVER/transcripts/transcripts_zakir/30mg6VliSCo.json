  "title": "Can we Pray Eid Salaah at Home because Mosques are Closed due to COVID 19 - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "from usa my question is what we have to do on each day to pray with people is that okay to pray at home with the families similar question was asked on the facebook i'll merge it together by fahad from kashmir india can we offer each prayer at home if yes then what are the conditions was there any other event held in history due to which each prayer was performed at home a similar question by akib walid bhatt kashmir what is the ruling to offer each prayer if lockdown and restrictions a similar question by samya from bangladesh can we offer each salah at home in congregation due to coronavirus regarding the question was each seller ever offered at home before in the history as a whole no as a whole majority of the people in the world offering it hope no it wasn't done but yes there were occasions when some people did and analysis that the basic question is can we pray each salah at home and if we pray at home how can we pay there is there is hadith of one of the sabbaths and has been malik male 1 repeats with him that in basara he missed his prayers so he goes home he collects his family he gets his servant his slave and he asks him to lead the salah and in that salah he prays to rakat each allah everything normal with the tagbirath but does not read the kodama so based on this all the focus unanimously agree that if anyone misses the each salah he can very well play pray with his family at home or can pray alone also all other things that have to be followed same except the khudba since khudba is not fart the kudbha of the ju masala is first but the khudba of the each salah is not offered so at that time based on this hadith if you miss you can come home you can pray have the takbirat and then but the kuduba after each salah is not required so yes it has happened in the past for people have missed but as a whole because most of the mosques in the world are locked down i don't know of any incidents in the world before that most of the each salah will not take place in the mosque it's the first time regarding the question that can we pray each salah because of the pandemic of coronavares covered 19 and if we do what should we do so as far as this ruling is concerned it is unanimous there is no difference opinion now it is not the question of missing we cannot pray because the mosques are locked down maybe in some countries like in malaysia they have agreed that mosques will be open but maximum 30 people in a mosque with taking care of of physical distancing all that is there but 30 people that will not take a riven of one percent of the population of malaysia would like to pray so but naturally most of us cannot pray in the mosque so can we pray at home yes you can pray at home but when you pray at home you have to pray same as it is normally prayed one of the family members agent can can lead the salah and the only additional factor is that the additional takbirath after the the haram the first segment in the first rakat there are additional six takbir so total seven and then you read the surah fatiha then you go for good as normal then go for sujud after doing the second so do you get up and you say allahu akbar and when you come you need additional fighter b the one allah plus five should become six so it is seven in the first rakat six in the second rakat or five edition in the first rakat and uh uh sixth edition sorry in the first rakat and five additional in the second these this is the only difference as compared to normal two and normally after the after the salah there is no quality for preghetto but just a few days back i called uh sheikh muhammad hassan who according to me is one of the most knowledgeable living islamic scholar in the world and i said that because of this pandemic situation you know in the quran 19 most of the mocks are closed can we pray to me yes we can pray to be said can if we have the imam can we even have can we read the quran he said yes moomkin though it's not a fart if you want and you have an imam who can give a kuduba you can even give up this is a fatwa given by sheikh muhammad normally kuduba is not required at home but if you have someone who can give the khudba he said it's possible if you want the blessing to hear the kuduba you can do that if people want to hear the khudba of the mosque which has a loudspeaker after the allah can do that but this option is also open according to sheikh muhammad let me remind you one thing if you are paying at home do not neglect all the other sunnah please that doesn't mean if you're praying at home you only pray at home do all the other sunnah it is sunnah for the muslims that the moment ramadan ends after the maghrib salah the first of shawwal you start the takbira that we read immediately after the maghrib salah till you pray the islam so continue with that allah as much as possible till you start the salah number one number two when you get up in the morning you have gusel and you soon not to have gusel have a breakfast the prophet at breakfast to indicate that this is not a fasting day and you're not fasting before you go first before the prophet went for he is to have dates he used to have odd number of dates so you can have dates with the three whether five odd number of dates before you read the salah see to do a good clothes the best clothes that you have doesn't have to be new if it's new no problem but whatever best clothes we have you wear the gents if they can perfume themselves so follow all the other sunnah so that and then go for not that if you're praying at home all the sunnahs are completely neglected so this was in brief that how you can conduct the salah at your home if you cannot go to the mosque"
