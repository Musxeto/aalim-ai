  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum this is sabrina azam from bangladesh is it permissible in islam to draw pictures or diagrams of animals for the purpose of academic learning as animal painting is haraam in islam about prophet muhammad peace be upon him said it is mentioned in sahih al-bukhari hadees number triple to five as well as in sahih muslim hadees number two one one zero musa that every image maker he will be in hell fire and another hadees that is also mentioned sahih bahari and sahih muslim abdullah prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that one of the most severe punishments on the day of judgment will be to those people who make images referring to drawing and the drawing that is prohibited in islam is the drawing of living things for example animals human beings birds insects etc wherein you draw distinctive features of these animals of these living things of these humans of these birds of these inks etc for example their eyes their ears their nose drawing their face etc this is prohibited in islam and abdullah prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that the one who makes images of living things on the day of judgement allah subhana wa tala will tell him to bring life to these living things so making these kind of images it is completely prohibited in islam as far as for the purpose of education can we yet make these images can we draw these pictures of these animals etc even for education this should be avoided except in situations where it is a necessity because the ruling of the sharia is that things that are haram in a situation of necessity they are permitted so for example if a person or if a student is studying medicine in this situation he needs to understand regarding the human body so he may need to work on a sculpture or he may need to work on some pictures etc similarly the doctor to understand the human anatomy he needs to work on the sculptures on the human sculpture to have a better understanding so the students who are studying medicine they need to involve in this so in this situation when it is necessary it is permitted i would like to give you another example if the police they want to catch a criminal for example who's robbed or has done some criminal activity but they're unable to catch him and there is a witness so this witness he knows the physical features and he knows the facial appearance of this person of this criminal so he describes this to the artist and the artist sketches or draws the criminal's face so in this situation it is necessary to draw the face of the criminal so that the criminal can be caught easily so in a situation where it is necessary it is permitted to draw and to make images whereas the general ruling is that you should not involve in making images drawing images of animals of human beings of birds of insects etc wherein you draw distinctive features for example their eyes their ears their nose etc"
