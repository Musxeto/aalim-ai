  "transcript": "could you tell us which are the most important of all the voluntary fasts the most important of all the warranty fast is fasting in the month of maram especially the Ashura that the tenth day of maharam and a beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in Hadith of say Muslim form number two in the book of fasting Hadith number two six one two where a person asks the prophet that which is the most important of the prayers after the prescribed prayers after the first prayers and which is the most important fast after the first fast after the first in the month of Ramadan Prophet replied the most important prayer after the further prayers is the prayer at night and the most important fast after the fast in Ramadan is fasting in Muharram fasting in the month of Haram is the most important and a beloved Prophet further said it's mentioned in the hadithi in the book of fasting Hadith number 752 the Beloved Prophet said on the day of Ashura it is expiration of a sins for the previous years the old sins that he did in the previous year it will be expected another Hadith of Sai buhari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 2004 it says with him he says that Prophet Muslim when hirish Madina he asked the Jews who used to fast on the tenth day of that why do you fast on the Tennessee of so they replied that the bani Israel got the freedom from the enemies and Allah gave them freedom on this day and Prophet Moses peace be upon him he fasted on this day replied that we have more right over Prophet Moses peace be upon him than you do and he commanded the Muslims that they should fast on the 10th of maram that is Ashura in Sun number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2439 where if nabba says my life is a team that when Prophet Muslim said that the Muslims should fast on the 10th of modern on the day of Ashura some of the sabba some of the companions of the Prophet came and told him that this is the day which is celebrated by the Jews it's an important day for them the prophet said next year inshallah we'll also fast on the ninth but unfortunately the prophet did not live to see the next year he expired before that foreign book of fasting Hadith number two four one six that the prophet did not miss four things number one is fasting in the day of Ashura number two fasting the first 10 days of Dil Hajj number three fasting three days every month and praying the Sunnah Salah before the Fajr Salah So based on this we come to know that it's very good to fasten Ashura that is the tenth day of maharam but to be different than the Jews it's preferable that you fast on the ninth also so the best is to fast on the ninth and the tenth but even if someone passed on the 10th only scholar say it's fine some Scholars say that you can also fast on the 10th and the 11th to be different than the Jews okay thank you very much Dr Zaki"
