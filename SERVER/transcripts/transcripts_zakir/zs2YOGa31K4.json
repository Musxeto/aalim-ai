  "title": "Blood Transfusion, Kidney Dialysis and Injections containing Nourishment Break the Fast - Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "can a person undergo blood transfusion and or accept an injection which nourishes his or her body during the fast blood tone Fusion is concerned it comes in the same category as getting from nourishment when you transfuse blood into the body blood is considered as something of nourishment something similar to food because the food that we eat it enters the stomach goes into the bloodstream and that's what makes up the blood so when you transfuse blood it's taken as though it's a sort of nourishment and food entering the body so that breaks the fast similarly if you put any food via the rails tube into the stomach that too breaks the fast if it's parental feeding it breaks the fast or if you inject anything which is in the form of nourishment then that breaks the fast even kidney dialysis as I mentioned earlier that if you take out blood from kidney and you purify it and add into its food nutrients and chemicals and put back into the body that too breaks the fast taking any injection with the intravenous whether intramuscular or subcutaneous if it does not contain nourishment if it contains a form of nourishment it makes the fast if it's only for medicinal purpose not containing nourishment then that does not invalidate The Fast and the person can take that"
