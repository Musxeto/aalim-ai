  "title": "Why is Slavery Allowed in Islam and Why is it Permitted for a Man to have Sex with a Female Slave...",
  "transcript": "yeah first of all sir I would like to thank you because uh I have become a better human being and not only a better human being but a better Muslim because of you and undoubtedly it is Allah who provides the heed but for me you were the source of that heed and my question is that uh I have read in glorious Quran that in previous time during the time of prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam men were allowed to keep female slaves and uh they were allowed to have that intimate relationships with with them without the nikah and the offsprings were also considered to be legitimate so I mean wasn't it a any kind of degradation of the honor of the women and were women allowed to do that or this privilege was only confined to men brother as a question that at the time of the Prophet there were women who were slave women and you allowed to have sex with them even without marrying so why was it allowed what is the privilege and is the wife Versa pered on there are many vers in the Quran we say that you can have sex with whom those are who are wife and what your right hand possesses right hand possesses means they are the slaves and at the time of the Prophet the walls used to take place and when walls used to take place they were captives when they were captive from both the sides the men and the women they became slaves though if you analyze there are ver in the Quran which also says in Surah n chapter number 4 number 25 if you do not have the means to get married then marry a slave woman and give her freedom in Mah that if you don't have the means to get married so marry a slave woman and give her her Freedom as M so here it's encouraging that although the slavery has been abolished brother you asked a question your question is over it is correlated actually you cannot corate anything you have to go behind the queue to correlate you asked the question we heard your question it was long if we start correlating always non-muslims allow Muslims they can go be the que no problem if we start corating we'll be able to handle very few questions for non-muslim I'm a bit lent so now the thing is that so it's preferable to marry vice versa it's not possible it is only for the female women slaves that the man can have sex the Quran doesn't say the vice versa and this again if you analyze that if you see at that time promiscuity was very common promiscuity and having sex outside the bond very common so Islam has bought it in stages like as alcohol was very common the first verse of the Quran of Surah Bak chapter 2 vers number 219 says that in alcohol there is prophet and loss loss is more than Prophet the next verse was revealed in Sur n 4:43 that do not pray with your mind befogged mean when you're praying don't have intoxicant finally the ban came in Sur ma 5 vers number 1990 that alcohol is Ban so here first almighty God Allah subhana taala prohibits any other sex only two people allowed your wives and that which your right hand possesses now in this age we don't have you know any walls it may take place people say that the Quran talks about slavery is it Justified I said yes why not you know why because today we know that internationally slavery has been banned but do you know what's happening in Guantanamo do you the laws of UN resolution how they treat the prisoners of War if you compare that with the Islamic law Islamic law is far superior to what's happening in Guantanamo and after a few days we have a speaker coming by the name of James E he's a Chinese and he was put in Guantanamo he will give you a story so do attend that talk so if you see what is done in Guantanamo and the way the prisoners of Wars are ill treated you know they're imprisoned in the Islamic law the slave is free to move around imagine prisoner of war but free to move around great major thing you're giving them a place to walk they can go to the they cannot run away but if they run one going to do you have to catch up with them but imagine a prisoner of war is not chained in the normal prisoner of war you have prison camps with electric wires they can't go out all sorts of nonsense goes there you know all sorts of sexual abuse goes there do you know that what nonsense goes so the Islamic law even if I agree how they treat the slave is far superior than the UN Charter far superior than Guantanamo but in Islam Islam disagrees with having sex outside the marital bonds so just the Restriction it was permitted that time what your right hand possesses but preferable is as it goes further that give their freedom in m and have effect with them that's preferable hope that answer the question thank you sir"
