  "transcript": "the next question is from muhammad salla yemen dr zakir how are you alhamdulillah i'm fine if prophet muhammad peace be upon him was not the last of the prophets and messengers you would have been our prophet at this age after allah may god bless you and increase your likeness and may god combine you with the prophets and friends in paradise god willing i mean my question is what is the most moving and convincing thing i can use to persuade non-muslim people to make them accept islam the brother has a question that what is the most important and logical way that i can persuade a non-muslim to accept islam before he asked the question he said that if prophet muhammad was in the last messenger he would consider me to be a prophet in this age as the law this is totally wrong and i believe it prophet muhammad said it is mentioned in hadith of hadith number 3686 where the beloved person said that if there was the messenger going to be after me it would be omar al-khattab umar malala be pleased with him and you know he was the second caliph of islam of course we know that the prophet would have ended as allah says in the quran in surah azab chapter 33 verse number 40 that prophet muhammad muhammad that prophet muhammad peace be upon him is not the father of any of you men walk rasulullah but is the messenger of allah and he is the hatmundabeen he is the seal of the prophets the prophet has ended and muhammad sallallahu is the last and final messenger and but natural as the prophet said after him if anyone would have been the prophet muhammad please with them and there are various sabbahs today no human being not even anywhere close to any of the saba leave aside the kulfar shaddeen not to talk about other male liberty with him even the sabbath hundred twenty four thousand sabbath no one today not even mean nowhere are we close even one percent to the sahabas the level that they are that the best generation is the generation which was living at the time of the prophet regarding the second thing that he did for me and i pray to allah that may accept your dua and i do that dua too that may he put me in janitor fridas in the company of muhammad sallallahu sallam and the ambiyas and the khulafarashidhi and i do that and i'd like to thank you for the dua regarding our main question that what is the best way to convince a persuade a non-muslim to accept islam there are various reasons that the non-muslims accept islam and the most common and the best reason is tahit oneness of allah and that's what the survey said my reply to the first question that's overdone in manhem university in germany that the people who are the most satisfied are the muslims and the reason is tahit the oneness of allah the concept of god in islam is unique though all the religions basically believe in monotheism but tahit is not merely monotheism it is far above that besides believing in one god we should also worship him and no one else and if you hear my talk on concept of god and major religions i've given a section of the talk on tahit small and we muslims are not supposed to worship anyone but allah and if you worship anyone that's called as shirk which is the major sin so the maximum non-muslim that they love is about the aspect of tahit that allah is the only one who's supposed to be worshiped and he's alone he doesn't have any partners he's the most wise he's the most knowledgeable that is the number one then we have salah then we have other aspects for more details you can refer to my cassette on concept of god in major world religion"
