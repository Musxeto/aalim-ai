  "transcript": "Dr zakya relating to the application of alul or black eyeliner as we know it is Sunnah it is a sunah of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam may Allah bless him um is it something which is permitted during the fast as far as putting alcohol in our country India it's called a surma or uh black eyeliner it's Sunnah of the prophet and we get in the Hadi that pleased with him used to always stay with the prophet he used to cook his food also and he used to put this alcohol and Prophet never prohibited him even when he put during fasting so this proves that putting Cal does not break the fast it is permitted and even when you put any eye drops or ear drops even if the ear drops or eye drops after a certain time you can feel the taste in the throat according to most of the scholars it does not invalidate the fast because that is not the normal passage of food and I drops these are medicines they aren't food and there are times that because you know that I'm being a medical doctor the ears nose and throat they're connected known as ent ent ear nose throat so when you put eye drops even the ear drops you know nasal drops there are chances after some time it may go into the throat and you may feel the taste if in the nle drop you should throw it out but ear drops and ey drops You Feel The Taste according to most of the scholars it does not break the fast but there are some Scholars who say that if it reaches the throat it will nfy the fast but the right ruling is that because it's not the normal passage for food and drink according to most of the scholars it does not nullify the fast and if someone who's has a doubt the best for him is he delays putting those nasal drops after Sunset so he's absolutely safe but the right ruling is that even you put a nasal drop or your drop it does not break the fast"
