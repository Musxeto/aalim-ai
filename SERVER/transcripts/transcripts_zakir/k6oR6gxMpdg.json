  "transcript": "relates to a woman who's cooking during the fast is she allowed to taste the food as long as a person who's cooking the food whether it be a gent cook or lady cook inkari volume number three in the book of fasting chapter number 25 it say Abbas he narrated that tasting food from the pots or meals it does not break the fast this is a m Hadith of bukari but it is connected along with and and the chain goes on it makes it sah and it says that Abbas please with him he says that tasting vinegar and food while fasting so all the Hadith prove that while fasting a person can taste food but you have to be careful the food should not enter your throat you should not swallow the food and that is the reason the scholars say that if it's required you should do it otherwise not for example Imam he says that tasting food is Mak unless it's a necessity same with he say that it is Mak unless it's a necessity and while it's a necessity if a woman is cooking food she has to place the food on the tip of the tongue so that she realizes whether the food is sweet or salty and then she should spit it out she should not swallow it so that will not break her fast or if a mother wants to give food to the baby and the only way she can give is by chewing it so she's permitted to chew the food and then give it to the baby but care should be taken that they should not swallow any particle of the food she should spit it out so these are necessity where it's permissible to taste food but unnecessary just because you're feeling hungry and you taste it it's maku though it will not break the fast maku is discouraged it will not break the fast but otherwise for a necessity it can be done but Cas should be taken it does not go down the throat it should not be swalled after tasting the food should be spat"
