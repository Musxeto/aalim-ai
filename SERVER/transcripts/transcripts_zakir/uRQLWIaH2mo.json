  "title": "Is Al Hidaayah the Halaal Version of Netflix? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the first question is from suleiman sheikh a businessman from london uk i'm looking forward for the launch of your new platform alidayah can i say that al-hidayah is the halal version of netflix with the suleiman sheikh from london now the question that can he say that al-hidayah is the halal version of netflix it would not be wrong to call al-hidayah the halal version of netflix but rather it should be besides halal it should be the mustab platform alhamdulillah and i spoke two sessions before regarding the alidah platform if you compare it with netflix and we all of us know that majority almost all the programs on netflix they are haram they are not in lines with the teachings of the quran and say hadith there may be one or two allah programs or few programs which may come in the category allah but almost all we know a haram whereas the platform we are going to launch al-hidayah it is halal not only is it halal halal is the four types it can be further it can be musta but it can be mobile it can be macro this output it in the mustahab category that is encouraged category not only is it halal it will get you closer to allah netflix primarily is an entertainment platform it may have very few programs on education whereas al-hidayah it is a spiritual edutainment platform mainly it will be talking about religion and also a lot of education it will also include entertainment the tagline of netflix is unlimited movies talk shows and more the tagline of al-hidayah is the guidance for humanity so that is the difference one is unlimited movies talk shows and more ours is guidance for humanity and inshallah guidance to salvation it is more on the deen also talking about dunya also talking about education and it will also contain entertainment and normally what do you mean by the word entertainment entertainment is something you like and you love so if you enjoy it that's called entertainment for every individual the entertainment may differ so to see to it that to make our platform al-hidayah also entertaining besides adding the spiritual aspects and the educational aspects we are involving the entertainment aspects and making it halal normally when we find that if there is a good quality it is glamorous it has all the elements to attract a person it becomes entertaining compared to that alhamdulillah if you compare netflix it has high quality recording and inshallah al-hidayah also will have high quality recording netflix has film cameras 4k 8k similarly al-hidayah the later programs all the programs recorded after december 2015 are recorded in 4k and 8k and even 6k alhamdulillah and the difference is that netflix it started as a dvd rental in 1997 then got converted into a platform and then had many movies so most of the movies what they have they take copyrights and it's not their own it is mainly other productions later on lately since the last few years or more than 10 years they started producing their own programs and now they're producing their own programs also whereas the palidar platform majority almost all more than 95 programs are produced by us except for programs of sheikh ahmed mela grantham jannah including dr ishwar hammut both of them they are stalwarts they are one of the best speakers available in english language and urdu language because they no longer are there we have recorded few of the programs of dr him with quite a few but since they no longer are there we have used their old programs even though it's of low quality we upgraded it and it's there for the audience to watch so except for these two speakers the program that recorded by us on high quality cameras like netflix if you see the older movies that are very old you may have of low quality similarly our programs of sheikh these are the next but maybe a little bit low quality but everything after december 2015 is on film camera cinematographic cameras 4k 6k and 8k between november 2011 and december 2015 it's on high quality hd cameras and before that it was on digibeta if you compare as i said the entertainment means something which is attractive and the first conference that we did the peace conference the solution for humanity in 2007 it was my desire to use the best of technology when we look at the grammy awards the oscar award in hollywood in bollywood the way they have the stage set up with professional design sets good lighting etc though most of it is haram but technology is not haram so we use this technology and we presented the islamic aspect so that it becomes entertaining also and that's why i said that ours is a spiritual edutainment platform so most of the programs are on specially designed sets with intelligent lighting with huge stage mashallah if it's a public program with large audiences with multi cameras ranging from four cameras to up to 37 cameras so that's the reason it has the entertainment element also in netflix you have movies and tv shows and some others in al-hadayah if you look at the categories we have good debates we have got public lectures we have got group discussions we have got workshops we have got interviews we have got tv talks we have got tv shows we have public question answer sessions we have live questionnaire sessions we have children programs we have tarawi and the list is long alhamdulillah in the genre or subjects on netflix you have mainly movies as i said it is action movies or thriller movies or romance or comedy in our subjects we have comparative religion we have lectures and programs on quran on prophet muhammad peace be upon him on the sahabas the companions of the prophet on wives of the prophet on hajj on tahit on zaka on ramzan on fick and the list is long if you compare with the navigation system that is there on the netflix what we have done we have used a mixture of the navigation system completely of the netflix we have got as well as the youtube so you can navigate the programs according to the categories that is if you press debates you get all the debates coming on the screen or when you start you have good roles first are the recommended videos then maybe the latest videos then would be the categories of the videos debates public lectures group discussions tv talks interviews etc then you have the subjects quran seed of the prophet sahabas hajj ramazan fick etc and then you have the most watched of the program in these categories or subjects if you click the category debates all debates will come if you click lectures all the lectures will appear if you click group discussion all good discussion will appear so in this way it's easy to choose and navigate besides this we have also used the navigation system of the youtube youtube have a different system it says sorting in the youtube we have most popular and the oldest and the latest we have besides the most popular we have the recommended we have the earliest programs we have the latest programs we have got more options as compared to youtube and it can be sorted that way you can even sort it in various different ways so it's a mixture of the navigation and search of the netflix and the youtube and i feel it's much more easier netflix is basically only video on demand so what we're comparing now is video on demand of the netflix and video on demand of the alidah platform but in alidaya besides video on demand there is also another section which is the islamic courses and this is not available on netflix it is not on youtube it is a different system altogether rather it's an lms a learning management system and as i mentioned earlier our full alida platform has got two sections one is dr zakir naik and the other is other speakers in my section mainly my program would be and along with it the bonus would be the programs of my son fyric and the programs of islamic international school so basically dr zakir next section would be only my programs my son's programs that is sheikh farik and islamic international school in the other speakers though we have more than 75 speakers we have selected the best 40 speakers it is the largest platform to have so many numbers of authentic speakers on one platform more than 40 and from the 40 speakers that will be there not counting me more than 25 of the speakers would have courses in the courses again the navigation system is the same it can be category wise it can be subject-wise and the variety is there this is not there on the netflix furthermore winning on the courses if you go to dr zakir next section in the courses it has five different materials number one it is the video program of that course number two it has a study guide which helps you maybe after watching the video when you go through it it's a recap and it may be a summary or the bullet points the major points of the course number three it also contains the complete transcript of my course complete transcript verbatim so when you're watching the course there are two screens that open below if you want an option is yours only watch the video or you can watch it in the next screen which has the study guide you can do simultaneously or later on and below the study guide it is a transcript so you can read the transcript completely if you want simultaneously later on option is yours besides this there is additional course material in this additional course material you have posts which are very well designed graphically designed which contain bullet points of the course so these posts are very attractive they are graphically presented and give a good impact all these things are the additional material that is there besides the additional material the last is the assessment in the assessment there are three types of assessments there is multiple choice questions that's true and false match the following in these three types of assessments there are three levels of assessment one is for the beginners the second is for the intermediary the third is for the advanced so the three levels beginners intermediary and advanced depending upon which level you belong to you can answer the multiple choice questions or true and false or match the following in the other speakers basically there are three types of course material one is the video second is a study guide and third is assessment so this platform of lms learning management system is not there on the netflix therefore i would say that you rather say it's not only a halal version of netflix it's much more it is muslim it's entertainment and it will get you closer to allah and inshallah it will guide the humanity towards chennai hope in brief this is a summary of the difference between the netflix and the halal version that is al-hidayah the guidance for humanity"
