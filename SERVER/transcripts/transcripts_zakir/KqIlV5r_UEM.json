  "transcript": "i am a doctor for those my question is that we know from the hadith that rasulullah alaiwa islam told us about the fitness or reflections of the jal and according to some of the hadees we are informed that the jar will reach every house he will show you water which you cannot drink and he will show you fire which will not burn you can we consider tv to be one of the afflictions of the jar sister asked the question that there are hadith talk about the dal which is there are some scholars including she has quoted that that some of the scholars said that this television you know kind of the jar manager screen is only one eye so this is the jar so can't we consider this as a jar there's no hadith saying tv whether tv is or not you know what we have to do our beloved prophet muhammad said that when you stand for salah don't leave any gap close in your gap so that there's no place for the shaitaan say bukhari number one book of adam chapter 75 hadith number 692. the same hadith is repeated in sunnah vermont number one in the book of salah chapter number 245 hadith number 666 that when you stand for salah stand shoulder shoulder close in your gaps so that the satan doesn't come even if you consider this you convert the dajjal into a muslim change this tv media into a true media and propagate it there is no proof that television is a dajjal but even if you consider it to be a dajjal what we have to do is we have to use this media to propagate the haqq so that we can testify to allah that we have tried a level best to convey the message to the world and give the message of islam to the whole of humankind alhamdulillah [Applause]"
