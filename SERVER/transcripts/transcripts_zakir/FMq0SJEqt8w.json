  "transcript": "so the question posed by Salman Haider just came on the Facebook sir is life insurance Halal a similar question was is asked on the WhatsApp message by Muhammad Tariq from Pakistan is it permissible to have life insurance life insurance per se is not Haram in Islam for the aphrodia camel but today since most of the life insurance is related with rabba based life insurance interest based life insurance what interest is the 12th major sin in Islam in today's world most of the life insurance are related with interest and rebar based system so any life insurance or any insurance whether it be car insurance any insurance which is linked with riba or linked with interest it is Haram what do they do they take your money they take the money from thousands of people from tens of thousands of people they pulled it together and they take your premium they put in a bank or they put it in a money-based instrument where you get fixed money on fixed period of time and based on the returns they get they use that returns in taking care of the people a person who have died or a person on accident so this system based under by Haram but we have an Islamic alternative called as the couple in the takafu system in the Islamic life insurance system what they do the money you give they invest in a Halal investment it is not republished it is halal as per the Islamic Sharia and the return they get from this Halal based investment they utilize for taking care of a person at accident or a person died so if it is an Islamic life insurance based on the takaful based on the Islamic Sharia then life insurance process but if it's based on a non-sharia compliant or a riba based or interest-based it is Haram"
