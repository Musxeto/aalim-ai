  "transcript": "people very often ask this question we understand god has created the human beings for worshiping him but what is so special about the human beings why they created us human beings are a unique creation of allah they are the best creation of allah human beings and virgins are the only creation who have a free will of their own all the other creation of allah subhana wa tala they have submitted their will to almighty god allah and they do not have any free will they obey allah 100 they have no choice but the human beings and the jinns they have option to either obey or to disobey allah allah says in the quran in surateen chapter number 95 verse number four verily we have created the human beings in the best of moles for verily we have created the human beings in the best of worlds human being is the best creation of allah besides being created in the best of molds we are unique we have a choice of either obeying or disobeying allah subhanahu wa after a free will has been given to you and if you obey the commandments of allah you are superior to the angels because the angels they have no free will they obey almighty god without a free will so if after a free will has been given to you and if you obey and submit your will to almighty god you are superior to the angels you know when we say oh this man is an angel it has two meanings one is maybe it's an insult because human beings are superior to angels but it means that you are a human being after free will is given to you but you are obeying the laws of god like an angel so it makes you superior a human being who's obeying like the angel so then it makes you superior but if you disobey allah if you go against his commandments then you become the brother of the devil and you become a satan so human beings have a choice to either obey and to become superior than the angels or to disobey him and become like the satan the choice is yours and when we analyze that why has allah with allah why has he created us it is because we are the best of creations we have an option of either obeying him or we have the option of disobeying him if you obey him you become superior than the angels if you disobey him we become like the satan"
