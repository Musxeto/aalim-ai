  "transcript": "good evening I am Sarita Mary I work in private company as Administration manager and I wish to take up Islam and it's only because of two men in my life that is uh I wish to marry a Muslim man and I see him every day the way he talks to people and his simplicity and he is very religious the second person will be Mr Zakir that is because I am watching his speech and it is very informative to know about all the religion before I could take up Islam I have one query to clarify by your end that is how is Mother Mary that is Mary mother of Jesus is described in Quran Islam by seeing a person who's religious and seeing my tapes only query is that how is Mother Mary described in Islam and what is the status if you compare what is mentioned about mother Mary in the Quran I've been at the Bible in the Quran there is a full chapter a full Surah called as Maryam on the name of the mother of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Maryam if you read all the books in the Bible where the Old Testament or new testament but the 66 books of the Protestant or 73 books of the Catholics there is not a single book which is named after Mary but there is a full chapter in the Quran called as Maryam may Allah and if you refer and analyze the story of the birth of Jesus Christ peace be upon a mentioned in the Bible and mentioned in the Quran both are different overall they are the same but minute points if you note for example if you read the Bible it says that when Archangel Gabriel comes and asks mother Mary that you shall have a son so she replies how shall I have a son where I know it not a man no it's not about me sexually same thing in the Quran if you read in the Quran verse number 42 to 47. where Mother Mary she says that how shall I have a son when no man has touched me replies when Allah and says to it be and it is so in the Quran it says when mother Mary questions that how shall I have a son when no man has touched me that means no man has trusted sexually so Archangel Gabriel replied when Allah decreed the matter and says to it be and it is in the Bible Archangel Gabriel replies that the holy spirit will come unto thee so when a person has to think that what will the Holy Spirit Come on to marry and do what should let your mind wander it lets your mind wonder what will the Holy Spirit Come unto mother Mary and do the meaning is the same it means that without any male intervention Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born but the way the Quran describes is more Sublime is more Divine and is much more palatable as compared to the Bible so if you read in the Quran Allah says in Surah Al Imran chapter 3 verse 42 Allah says that the Angels came and told that Allah has chosen thee so the honor given to Maryam in the Quran is that Allah says that she is a chosen woman above the woman of all Nations imagine the Quran is being revealed in Arabic to the Arabs and at that time the Arabs and Jews did not get along well the Quran says a Jewish woman the mother of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Mother Mary has been honored as the woman chosen above all the other women imagine is giving the message to the Arabs it is actually antagonizing them that the Jewish woman is chosen above the Arab woman he did not say that his wife khatija may Allah be pleased with her was the chosen woman or his daughter Fatima Allah The Chosen woman he could not because Allah said that the revelation of Allah he has to repeat it he says in the Quran that mother Mary is the chosen woman above the woman of all Nations so the respect given in the Quran to Mother Mary is far superior even than the Bible hope dances the question sister"
