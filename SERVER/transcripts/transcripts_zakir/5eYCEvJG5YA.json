  "transcript": "how is it possible for me to recognize that this particular human being believes in the sign of Allah subhana wa ta'ala unless I recognize that he's a Muslim or he's a m usually when you attend a conference the delegates they wear a label or they wear a batch on which is mention the name of the delegate and his designation or the place where he comes from if it's a conference of intellectuals maybe the profession is mentioned whether he a doctor or an engineer or an advocate if it's a conference of specialists in the field of medicine the speciality is mentioned whether he's a cardiologist a heart specialist whether he is a neurologist a brain specialist whether he is a urologist a specialist of the kidney whether he's a gynecologist a specialist in the disease of the woman whether he the pediatrician a specialist of the children the speciality of that person is mentioned this batch or a label which the delegates wear it's a sort of an informal introduction if you want to ask any question about the heart you'll ask a cardiologist if you want to know about something about the brain some latest advances you'll go and approach a neurologist if you want to know something about the treatment of the disease of the children you'll approach a pediatrician this batch is a sort of an informal introduction it's a requirement that every Muslim should also have a label for example I'm wearing a batch I have a label on which is mentioned Allah any person whether Muslim or non-muslim when he sees this batch even if he cannot read Arabic he will realize it is something in Arabic and he'll immediately realize that this person is a Muslim it's an informal introduction introducing myself that I a Muslim there are various other batches available and we have a great Variety in the Islam Mage Foundation bches mentioning ill Muhammad that there's no God but Allah and Prophet Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam is the messenger of Allah subhana wa tala we have batches mentioning Quran is the word of God for Universal guidance when a person sees the batch a non-muslim he may also be inquisitive that what is this badge you're wearing what does it mean Allah and you have an opportunity to do dawa he may ask that Quran the word of God what is this Quran an opportunity to talk it's not possible for all the Muslims in the umah to wear a batch like the one I'm wearing it's difficult it's not freely available and it's also expensive therefore I wouldn't say that everyone should wear a batch and neither do I wear a batch always I don't wear this batch always just a few times not always when I wear the coat I wear a batch not always it's not practical that every Muslim should wear such a batch why don't we Muslims wear a label which is being worn since ages and it's already there in our community since ages I'm referring to the the beard and the cap that why don't we Muslims wear the label that is Sport a beard and wear a cap there may be many Muslim Brothers of mine who may ask me that brother Zak what does the cap and the beard have to do with Islam do I have to wear a cap and Sport a beard for Allah subhana wa taala to recognize that I'm a Muslim for Allah subhana wa ta'ala to recognize any human being whether he's a Muslim or not he doesn't require us to wear a cap or sport a beard Allah subhana wa tala is he has the knowledge if you deserve jna Heaven Allah will give it to you if you deserve jahanam hell Allah will give it to you Allah doesn't require a person to wear the cap or a beard to recognize whether you're a Muslim or not but the question I ask that how will I as a Muslim who doesn't have meab will recognize whether the person in front of me whether he's a Muslim or not how will I recognize"
