  "transcript": "if you wear the label it allows you to do a compulsory duty of the Muslim that is propagate The Message of Islam it does wonders and there are various types of label for example if you go to the house of a Muslim you know if the Muslim wants to identify himself as a Muslim he may have certain posters or certain big lettering ayats Arabic writing maybe like all is due to the Bounty of the Beloved Lord it may say oh my Lord increase me knowledge you can easily identify that this house belongs to a Muslim maybe mention allahar easy and now technology is advancing and new labels are coming up with the help of Technology you have a clock giving out the aan the aan clock when you ring the bell it says assalamu alaykum new new labels are being invented alhamdulillah it may help you and if you go to an office in the office you may have certain inscription or certain poster that indicate that this office belongs to a Muslim if you enter the aim of Islam Foundation the first in front went ISL the only religion the only de acceptable in the S of Allah is Islam directly no problem indicates that this PR belongs to a Muslim when you retire in a vehicle in a car you may have certain stickers mentioning in the name of Allah most great most merciful and nowadays you know I have a habit when I go out and travel abroad for my friends I get certain tokens like kitens Islamic kitens and one when had gone to jeda a new device is fitted it's a device which you put in the car the moment you switch on the car the moment give the ignition it starts alhamdulillah it starts the Dua when you start the journey which a prophet recommended that praise be to Allah and seek Allah's guidance that he may have control over the vehicle Etc and if the passenger sitting next to you if he doesn't know the Dua he memorizes it alhamdulillah it does wonders there are various laes available and when I came the first time to Milat nagar it was after the rides about in the year 1993 about more than 5 years back the first time when I came to Milat nagar and when I entered and when I read the name on the buildings Al makah Al Madina mifa Mina believe me touched my heart alhamdulillah I was so impressed that this full Colony I had known that it's one of the biggest colony of Muslims but when I entered makah Madina mifa Mina alhamdulillah it impressed me a lot every building the moment you read the name anyone can realize that this is a Muslim building and when the people staying in Milat nagar when they go out and say that if person ask where do you stay and if you say I stay M nagar it's taken for granted you are a Muslim even where you're staying identifies what religion you belong to alhamdulillah but unfortunately when I came next time I realized that the buildings had the labels but everyone living in the building didn't have the label so when they go out and when they look at them people may not realize whether it's a Muslim or not I'm not saying all the people of M nagar many have seen alhamdulillah who are the label so inshallah when I come next time to Milat nagar inshallah I would be happy that besides the buildings having the Islamic name even the label is there on each and every individual inshallah I hope that will be the case that next time when I come to Milat nagar all of them inshallah besides having the label on the building in the place where they're staying they should even have the label on the themselves that when they travel out people recognize that he's a Muslim she is a Muslim she is a Muslim woman a Muslim should never ever be afraid to identify himself as a Muslim the only reason that a Muslim may not like to identify himself as a Muslim is if he doesn't agree that Islam is the best way of life he may be a namesake Muslim maybe born in a Muslim family given a Muslim name otherwise a Muslim will never feel afraid to wear his label he may feel afraid if he doesn't know the answers because if you wear the label you're proclaiming that I am a person following the religion of hak the religion of Truth and whenever there's a competition between truth and falsehood truth always prevails truth always wins people sometime afraid that that if people come to Muslim I may lose my customers I have non-muslim customers I may lose them he's afraid but if he knows Islam if he identify himself as a Muslim that he's a person following truth he will inshallah benefit even in his business because the Quran clearly states and I would like to end my talk with the quotation of the Quran from Surah is chapter number 17 verse number 81 which says when truth is H against falsehood falsehood perishes for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish [Applause]"
