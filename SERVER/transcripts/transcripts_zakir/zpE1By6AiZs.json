  "transcript": "previously human beings we thought that the world was flat it was in 1577 when Sir Francis Drake sailed around the earth that he first time proved that the earth on which we live it is spical in shape the Quran mentions 1400 years ago in chapter number 79 verse number 30 and thereafter we have made the Earth XG shape one of the meaning of d is an expanse and the Earth is an expanse the other meaning is derived from the Arabic word duah which means an egg and today we know the Earth is not completely round like a ball it is seten from the pole it is geosphere in shape and if we analyze the Arabic word dahaha doesn't refer to a normal leg it specifically refers to the Egg of an ostrich and if you analyze the Egg of an ostrich is too geosphere in shape Imagine The Glorious Quran 1,400 years ago says that the Earth is geosphere in shape"
