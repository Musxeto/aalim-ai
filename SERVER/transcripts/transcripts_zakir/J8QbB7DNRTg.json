  "title": "IMPORTANT ACTS FOR A MUSLIM IN THE MONTH OF RAMADHAAN - DR ZAKIR NAIK",
  "transcript": "um are there any particular activities a Muslim should concentrate upon during this blessed month of Ramadan and of course we should relate to you the importance of the fact that our viewers really can gain massive benefit by knowing specific activities they can get involved in and they can start planning the Ramadan now yes I believe that this is a very good question because most of the activities we'll be dealing as time goes on in the episode but just to give a brief outline I would just specify a few important because the whole answer will take very long the few important points that we noted is that number one it is the Nia the near is very important the near of fasting should only be for Allah and for a fasting to be accepted then here is important so making the near very important without which the fasting will not be accepted number two is observing the Sunnah of the fast that we'll be dealing in detail in the next few days but just a point to be noted that one of the important Sunnah is that we should have sore as late as possible that is just before the break of dawn just before and we should break our fast have iftar as early as possible immediately after sunset furthermore in this blessed month we should be careful and we should avoid all things which are prohibited and all things which I'm a crew and this is the best opportunity where a person if he has certain activities which are against the Sharia where they're doing Haram activities or macro activities this is the best time he can abstain from it and that will be a good habit which inshallah may abstain may be throughout his life for example if a person has habitually to drinking alcohol if you can abstain from having alcohol from the break of dawn to Sunset he can abstain from it from the Cradle to the Grave similarly we should take care that we should abstain from the things which amakru for example it is makro to stand and drink water and if you're happy to do that so see to it that is month of Ramadan while having water we should sit down live for the Sunnah of the Prophet so it's a good month in which you can abstain from Haram activities which you have been doing maybe some of them or the macro activities furthermore it's a good time where you can Implement many of the Sunnah of the prophet in your day-to-day life for example maybe sporting a beard many Muslims don't have a beard so it's a good month where you can follow the summary of The Prophet the Sunnah of the Prophet about the duas of when you enter the home when you leave the toilet the Dua that is there when you're traveling in a vehicle subhanallah so this is a good month in which you can adopt as much as soon as possible so that we can be on state path this is a very good month where you should see to it that you should offer the Salah not only the five-time Salah which is the first even try and offer as many in our film and Sunnah and if you are not habituated to reading in congregation see to the reader congregation and at first possibly go to the mosque for the Salah in this month we should be particular that we do not miss the tarawi many people think and it is the fact that it is a Sunnah but many people think that because it's a Sunnah we can miss taravi tarawi is a very important those not a father but every Muslim should make it a point that as far as possible they should attend taravi because of the blessings it has so taravi is very important which Muslims should never miss and when we offer tarawi many of us we rushed through taravi because we want to complete the Quran and many of them read 100 miles para we should read the taravi with patience at a moderate pace so that people can understand what is the command of Allah and that if time permits and if possible we should try and do it the calf in the last 10 days and while doing ethical make it a point that you don't socialize many people make a mistake of socializing defeated this month which do most applications this is the month of Dua and we should do more spend time in Remembering Allah and also worshiping him this is the month in which we should try and read as much as Quran as possible besides reciting the Quran Arabic if you know Arabic as a language then there's no problem but if you don't know then also read the translation of the Quran in the language we understand the best if you understand English written English read it in the language you understand the best but while it said in the Quran for which you get a also read the translation of the Quran so that you can Implement on the guidance of Allah if possible read the Quran once and every seven days or at least read one juice every day so that you complete the Quran at least once in the full month of ramnan in this month try and read as much as Hadith as possible but see to it that you read authentic Hadith and the best book on Hadith is the book of sale buhari then they say Muslim foreign and every rich person who has a saving of more than the sub level more than 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5 percent office saving every lunarian charity that is and many people they do not calculate the zakat properly you may get a point that you calculate the zakat honestly and it is better to give little bit more rather than to give less so calculate it properly and see to it that you give and this Ramadan is a month of generosity it's the month of satka and you get 10 times more reward for good deeds so this is the month where you should maximum charity and besides that we should make it a point that during this month we should be cheerful many of the Muslims they look dull they look gloomy you should be cheerful and happy and we should give more time to our family many times we neglect our family which is situated that we give more time to our family and do all these activities collectively we should also have a look to the people around you that means we should deal with the other human beings with Mercy with love with care if they've done some mistakes they'll forgive them this is the month of forgiveness if you have done something wrong to the man for forgiveness live with the people around you with love care and with affection we should that means Ponder on the things seated that you plan your month of Ramadan plan it properly and say to it they do not waste not even a minute not even a second this is the month of gaining and this month is the best month for self-improvement also and besides that you should also make it a point to do Islam which are the Muslim brothers and sisters it's also the best month to dawa that is convey the mystery of Islam to the non-muslims give us to the brothers and sisters that plan your month efficiently and see to it that you utilize every second of the recent month"
