  "transcript": "from basharat waseem bhai from kashmir india he texas assalamu alaikum zakir sir you said in mumbai that you sleep only for three to three and a half hours i am also sleeping as less as possible three to four hours a day but the problem is that all the day i feel light headed i feel drowsy and dizzy so my question is that do you also feel drowsy dizzy and lightheaded during the day and if you also feel the same then how do you overcome that lots of love from kashmir thank you the question is that yes i do when i was in bombay i used to sleep on an average of three to three and a half hours sometimes even two hours two and a half hours sometimes four hours four and a half hours on average three to three and a half hours when i shifted to malaysia when i did hijara to the beautiful country of malaysia i increased my sleep by about half an hour now i sleep about three and a half hours to four hours sometimes two hours two and a half hours sometimes five hours on average three and a half to four hours the question is that the person says that he feels dizzy he feels lightheaded he feels lousy and do i feel the same and how do i overcome alhamdulillah most of the time i do not barely once in a blue moon maybe once in several months i may feel you know maybe drowsy but most of the time alhamdulillah i am fresh but let me tell you as a medical doctor the normal hours of sleep required for an average adult human being is eight hours an average human being should sleep at least seven to eight hours if he sleeps more than nine hours it is excessive if he sleeps less than seven hours it is less so therefore you should sleep between seven to nine hours the best is between seven to eight hours sleep and scientific research says that anyone who sleeps less than six hours a day cannot function normally and i agree with that so let me tell you that i request all the brothers and sisters that you sleep at least six to seven hours a day this is the best and it is good that you should sleep and allah says that he has made the night for you to sleep but let me tell you one more thing also that most of the people who are successful in whichever field whether good bad ugly all of them were celebrities good bad ugly whether they are film stars or whether they are businessman whether they are the richest billionaires or whether they are good social workers or whether they are good islamic speakers or religious speakers all of them most of them almost all they are very hard working and sleepless but this is a very small percentage 0.00 though there is nothing mentioned in the seerah for beloved prophet muslim who is the best example about how many hours did he sleep but when you see his routine you can make a judgment that the prophet it's not possible for the prophet to have slept for more than four and a half hours or five hours so according to my study he may have slept most of the time between three to four and a half five hours to sleep more than four and a half was difficult because it said that the prophet prayed the hajj you depict camel for one third of the night so if you calculate all these things and then even if he sleeps early immediately after isha having food the time of sleep that calculated depending upon the season can maximum stretch to about four to five and a half hours and minimum can be lesser than that so i assume that the profit slept between three to four and a half but please let me tell you there is no seerah that mentions this it is my own research profit list because you know my wife always tells me that the quran says that the night has been made for you to sleep so it is sunnah to sleep and you should sleep but then i quote the voice of the quran that blessed are those people and those who attain fellows in the jannah those who sacrifice their bed for the sake of allah so it is both of course sleeping is better but if allah has given you that capacity as far as i am concerned in the thing that i am unique it is the last one of thaan who has blessed me and has blessed all the human beings whether muslim or non-muslim to make them function normally even if they sleep less for five hours or four hours or three and a half hours it is a blessing from allah and most of the top scholars and the fukahas and you know we know from the history that they slept very little and i also sleepless it is a blessing for allah but if you feel headache please do not it does more damage to your health than good you may stay awake in the night and sleep less the productivity of those hours that you're aware is 50 or 25 percent better sleep well and do better productivity four times more than normal well if you're sleepy or twice my request is please don't try and sleepless it's better that you sleep what's the requirement if allah has given you the capacity like what allah has given to me and then you do it's no problem"
