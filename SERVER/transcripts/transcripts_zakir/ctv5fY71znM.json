  "transcript": "the next question is from prashant kumar india i am an 18 year old law student honorable dr zakir naik as you may have also heard that the people who worship idols actually worship the jinns what if the jinn is good and are the man and he grants our wishes by asking from allah in our favor is it still wrong the question of prashant kumar is that people do idol worship those who do idol worship they actually worshipping jinns and some of them are good jinns so is it okay if you do idol worship and the good jinns they let our prayer come true by asking almighty god regarding worshipping anyone besides almighty god is a sin is a major sin in hinduism as well as in islam it's clearly mentioned in the quran as i mentioned in my earlier answer in surah nisa chapter 4 verse 48 and it's really such chapter 416 that allah may forgive any sin but the sin of shirk he will not forgive associating partners with almighty god worshiping anyone besides almighty god is prohibited further mawlana says in the quran in surah darya chapter number 51 verse 56 that allah has created jinns and the men not about to worship him similarly in the hindu scriptures it's clearly mentioned in the scriptures in suita satar upanishad chapter number 4 number 19 of that god there is no prathema is a sanskrit word which means an image prathima means photograph painting portrait it also means a sculpture an idol a statue it says of that god there is no prasima there is no image there is no photograph there is no portrait there is no painting there is no statue there is no idol there is no sculpture so doing ideal worship is private in hinduism and it's clearly mentioned in the chandraganasha chapter number six section number two verse number one it says it come evident god is only one without a second so according to hinduism and according to islam worshipping idols is prohibited regarding even if it's jinn or good then you cannot worship even good people there are many good human beings you can't even worship the messengers all the messengers said that you should not worship me but allah worship allah rabbi with my lord and your lord if any muslim says that he wants to worship prophet muhammad knows bella i will not say that if he says that even that's not allowed the best example human being in the world is prophet muhammad because the prophet said worship only almighty god so what about the jinn even if the jinn is good you cannot worship him worship ibadah is only due to allah so it's very clear-cut that no human being whether hindu whether muslim whether any human being any non-muslim they should not worship anyone but our great allah"
