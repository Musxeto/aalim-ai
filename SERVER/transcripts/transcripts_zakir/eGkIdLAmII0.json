  "transcript": "uh salaam alaikum doctor uh it's my honor to uh sitting here uh sorry standing here asking this question at the same time i'm very sad to ask this question if the quran is a book of the guidance and the islam is uh is a religion of the with the knowledge and and all this then why we are muslim as a nation as a majority we are standing in the back among the nations why when we compare our nation with other nations we see a big hole between between us and them brother asked a very good question very important question very relevant question [Applause] that if quran has so much of information regarding science technology it's a book of knowledge book of guidance and why are we muslims backward it's a very good question the reason is if we look back into the history from the 8th to the 10th century we read in the historical books the europeans they called it as the dark ages dark forum not for the europeans the arabs the advancement they made in science and technology was phenomenal if you had to know about science if you want to do research of science you had to learn arabic like how today we learn english at that time the muslim on top of the world because we were close to quran and sunnah today the reason the muslim the backward is because we are far away from quran sunnah so quran is not to blame you and i are to blame if you read in the books of history and books of science i said in my lecture even in a feast in a phase 600 after the quran was revealed was the first to describe the blood circulation in that textbook we know about william harvey we don't know about ibn office so two reason is the number one muslims have gone away from quran so now number two media you know media also plays a big role in it in our textbook in my school i never heard about ibn office after when i did research i came to know in my textbook was mentioned william harvey the first person who drew the world map of the world was ali russi in 1154 he was a muslim do you know the numbers that we have one two three fours it called what's it called one two three four what is called so loudly arabic numerals how we have roman numerals one two arabic numeral why because zero was first introduced by the indian the arabs took it up put a december point and we have the arabic numerals if you know about aleppo he was the one who discovered the pythagoras theorem which we learned in school we learned pathogenic theorem we don't know the name of absolutely the square of the hypotenuse is equal in a triangle the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the other two sides of the triangle do you remember you forgotten you remember mashallah good student who was the person who discovered it now you came to know correct better late than never elliptically muslim trigonometry we learn trigonometry who is the main person of trigonometry we learn chemistry who's the father of chemistry we know gibber gabber it's not gaba it is they want to you know change the name westernize it gaba so gabor looks like a westerner sounds like a westerner correct it is the father of chemistry wrote more than 200 pages 2000 pages he was the first to distilled alcohol alcohol comes from the arabic word al-ghul i'll call it arabic meaning evil spirit can't distill it how many people know about al-khindi at the time when newton who's the biggest scientist in the world history newton said all laws absolute al kindly said no all laws are not absolute they're relative later on albert einstein game all i've heard about einstein how many of us have heard about al-khindi the two brothers muhammad ahmad and hassan shakir they told the area of the earth from an angle at the red sea at the time when we didn't were sure whether the earth was spherical or not at that time they told the area of the earth which was quite accurate if you read about alipnia bas he wrote two thousand pages on medicine if you know about alibna sina i haven't seen i've ever seen a sound like a western universe aristotle of the east you can keep on giving examples muslims on top of the world because we were close to quran and sunnah today we are far away from the quran in sunnah that time if you wanted to get advanced in science and technology it was compulsory you learned arabic arabic was the language on top of the world today where is it who's to blame we are to blame so my request to all the muslim brothers and sisters you go back to the quran study the quran quran is the most positive book in the world it's a proclamation to humanity it's a fountain of mercy and wisdom it's a warning to the heedless it's a guide to the earring it's an assurance to those in doubt it's a solace to the suffering and the hope to those in despair you can get all these benefits only if you read the quran with understanding if you don't know arabic read the translation of the quran in the language you understand the best implemented inshallah it will be a guidance for you for your full life and you'll see your life change hope to answer the question"
