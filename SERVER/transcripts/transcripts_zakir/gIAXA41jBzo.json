  "transcript": "the next question hummus issa ali from tanzania east africa i am a great fan of you and i'm learning a lot from you may allah bless you and your family and reward you janna inshallah i mean i mean my question is i took my bachelor's degrees last year in 2019 from the government university through government students loan because of my economic conditions and then i came to realize that i will have to pay it back with interest after being employed so what should i do to make up for this major sin please help brother hamish has asked a question that unknowingly he took a loan for his education degree his bachelor's degree and then later on he realized that this loan has to be repaid back along with interest what should he do now if you have taken a loan knowingly which you did not knowingly and now you realize it's a major sin the best is to repent and as i mentioned earlier that if you have to repent first thing you have to agree that what you have done is wrong agree rabbi is wrong number two stop it number three repent and ask forgiveness to allah number four don't do it again and number five undo it if you can so now that you have taken a loan unknowingly inshallah all the more reason allah forgive you even if you take knowingly you want to ask for forgiveness you can and allah will inshallah forgive you you agree it is wrong if you have taken knowingly also stop it don't do it in future ask for forgiveness undo if you can now that you have done it unknowingly yet alhamdulillah you have to stop it you have to agree it is wrong not to do it in future ask for forgiveness and undo if you can now that you have taken a loan how can you undo it of course you can stop it if you can agree it is wrong which you have done also see it you don't do it again and inshaallah you won't do it again how can you undo it now that you've taken a loan and you have to repay it the best is what you have to do take that same amount of loan from islamic bank and give it to the conventional loan that you have taken suppose they have taken a loan of x amount and you have to give x plus y back so take x plus y from the islamic bank on the islamic principles based on the sharia and give it and immediately stop that loan over finish what you have to pay principal amount and interest take from the islamic bank give it and then repay slowly after you get a job to the islamic bank number one if there's no islamic bank in your vicinity in your country in your city the next option is that you can take from zakat money from your relatives and as i said that one of the criteria for zakat there are eight categories where the card can be given one category according to surah tabah chapter number nine verse from the sixty is gare mundetter if you're a debtor if you have taken a loan you can take zakat money from your relatives from your friends no problem you can even take zakat from a person who you are dependent of zakat in the category of focara or needy cannot be given but and the category of ghada moon yes because it is not the duty of the person who you're dependent on to take care of your own so you can take even from your father or from your mother or from your son or from your daughter it is permitted according to shaykh nathamiya you can't take so even from your dependent totalities you can take zakat and give it to the conventional loan that you have taken the third option is last if you don't have islamic bank you don't have relatives go to your friends if your friends have know zakat to give the last resort is that you ask for forgiveness the moment you earn money if there is a time period that you keep on paying one one thousand or maybe a small percentage you keep on paying much more than what you're required and finish the loan as soon as possible so that you can stay away from it and you can save yourself from online disrespect so these are the various options available as for forgiveness inshallah will forgive you"
