  "title": "How can Buddhist Books that are Written 400 Years after Buddha be Authentic, and  if not ...",
  "transcript": "foreign that's the question that while talking about Buddhism brothership he mentioned that the books on Buddhism have been written 400 or 500 years later and after that in the scriptures of Buddhism there is mentioned so he says that it's confusion that how could scripture written 400 years back be authentic and if it's not authentic how could the name of Muslim come in so if it is weight mentioned and the point we noted here brother that I do agree with you that if something is written on the spot after Revelation the chances of it being authentic is more but to say that if a book is written 300 or 400 years later on it cannot be authentic it's not 100 true because our Hadith of Islam they're saying of the Prophet most of them were written 100 200 30 days afterwards so if you use this logical argument for Buddhism that Buddhism is wrong then you have to agree Allah Hadith is wrong but the difference between Buddhism and Islam is that the world of a different in Islam we have taken care of verifying whether the person have narrated these Hadith the same with the prophet they have been verified which has not been done in Buddhism in Islam whenever we say that Hadith is sahih we check the narrators who heard it from Muslim who did he say to who was sabbas then it comes with then we check the authenticity of each narrator and the memory of its narrator so the science of maintaining the Islamic Hadith is very Superior and it is scientific unlike other religions that is the reason we today in Islam can differentiate from which is not the case in the other religion including Buddhism so Buddhism what we have today we agreed that everything on the Buddhist scripture is not authentic it's 100 authentic but there may be some parts which authentic so what we assume that even though we agree that the whole Buddhist scripture may not be authentic we say that but the Buddhist they say it's the word of God oh it's authentic so what do we say okay if you agree everything authentic and it is mentioned the thing the problem so what we say that whatever matches with the Quran Hadith we Muslims have no objection in accepting it to be true similarly when we compare Quran and Islam with the other scriptures because we compare that does not we are testifying that the complete religious scripture is authentic per se what we are saying that we agree part of it is correct part is wrong the opposite party they are saying everything is correct so what we say even if we assume everything is correct why don't you follow what is common based on the verse of the Quran of Surah Imran chapter number 3 verse number 64 which says come to Common terms as we Ascend you which is the first term Allah so what Dr schweb did he tried to tell you that the whole scripture per se of Buddhism may not be authentic because these if you analyze how was the Buddhist scriptures compiled it's not in a scientific manner there was a council Hill and one of his disciples Ananda his sayings were taken so it differs all the thing differs so they don't have a scientific method as we have in the region of Islam that's the reason the saying that the Buddhist scriptures historians they say everything authentic which cannot be said of the Hadith but your argument that because it was written 400 years back is wrong the chances of it being false is high so therefore whenever we take out a fault in other religion be careful that we don't trip ourselves if you put this as a trump card that because it is written foreign agree with but the argument is that we have taken care in preserving what is right what is wrong but yet the Quran carries the highest weight because the moment it was revealed to prophet sallam he dictated it to his companions who wrote it down and it was preserved but the Hadith preservation is also scientific alhamdulillah but it has a different level altogether as compared to the Quran hope to answer the question"
