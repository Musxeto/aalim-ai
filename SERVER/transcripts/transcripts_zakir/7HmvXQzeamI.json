  "title": "The Christian Missionaries Falsely Claim that they Can Speak in Tongues and No Poison can Harm them",
  "transcript": "the brother said that the question he asked that there are some Christians who speak in different tongues who speak in languages that no one understands and they claim to have Spirit what they're referring to is a statement in the gospel of Mark that anyone who has faith can speak in tongues there's a statement in the Christian that the poison shall not harm them and they will speak in different tongues in foreign languages and that's the reason when anyone say this I tell okay if any Christian claims that he has got faith I will give him poison have in front of me no born so far as had poison in front of me if they claim that they have the spirit and if they claim that they are faithful and they are believers in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no poison will hurt them and they will speak in different tongues and the same thing when I had a dialogue with William Cambell says that he has faith in him so I gave him a 100 rupee Indian note and in the 100 rupe Indian note that 17 languages I gave example 100 rupees is in English and X rup as in Hindi I requested him to read the other 15 languages leave side speak read it he could not that means he has no faith he could not read 100 rupe note in different languages that means he doesn't have faith and he gave the 100 rupes back to me that means he lost the bet so this is a statement in the Bible that people who have faith and people who are True Believers can speak in foreign tongues and no poison will harm them that's the reason many of times in a debate when someone gives poison to the person who's preaching never he has poison he gets scared and runs away that means he has no faith according to the Bible"
