  "title": "What the Muslims should do in Relation to the Palestinian Cause - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "number four you should make it on billboards or on your colleges on your universities this information number five you should take a protest as many people as protest you know protest could mean VI peaceful peace we should have peaceful protest we cannot be like them just because they do some atrocities it should be peaceful protest large numbers that is number five number six see to it that we can boycott the products if you boycott starting have products what the Israeli products it will be an economically yeah imp so number six is boycotting the products number seven we can give whatever charity we can for the cause of Palestine whether for aid for reconstructing the country for rebuilding the hospital for rebuilding the school whatever you can and Allah subhana wa ta'ala looks at the percentage of the donation not about the amount so I tell that if a person who earns $1,000 a month and if he gives $100 it is better than a person who earns a billion dollar and donates a million dollar person who earns a billion dollar a month and donates a million dollar he's giving .1% of his earnings and the poor man who's earning $1,000 and giving $100 he giving 10% so the $100 will get him 100 times more blessings than the billion person who earning a billion dollar and giving a million dollar so Allah subhana wa taala almighty God looks at the percentage not at the amount so give charity then and this seven points any Muslim can do"
