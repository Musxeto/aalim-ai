  "title": "Why is there an Increase in Terrorist Organizations Amongst the Muslims? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is vasudatya raj and i'm a law student actually firstly i would like to thank you for giving us such an informative talk on terrorism and islam my question is what do you think is the reason for the sudden increase in the number of terrorist organizations which are basically islamic and they fight in the name of islam and since you say that islam is giving the guidelines is that women children elderly people shouldn't be injured or killed but there have been various bomb laws and killings of women and children what do you think is the reason for that thank you the sisters asked a very relevant question that what is the reason that there's increase in terrorist organization among the muslims and so many bomb laws and especially when islam says it should not kill china etcetera what is the reason and that's very good question personally tell you again that personally i haven't met and interviewed any so-called hundred percent hardcore terrorist i haven't met but i can give the reasons the logical answers why such thing may be happening number one some people may really be terrorizing the innocent people some muslims may be on the wrong track they may not be following the guidance of the quran like you have black sheep in every community one of the number one terrorists of human history who it is it is hitler he has incinerated six million jews so can i blame christianity for that hitler was a christian so i can't say because it lands 26 million jews therefore christianity says that you have to here alone if you add up all the terrorist organization put together i doubt whether they'll reach 6 million one individual alone again mussolini mussoloni is a christian so just because mussolini killed thousands of innocent people that does not mean i can blame christianity for that so there may be certain black sheeps in the community black sheeps may be calling themselves muslims and maybe in the wrong may be point number two it can be that there are people who harassed like you asked me that today there is no indian fighting for the freedom of the country do you find any indian fighting for the freedom of the country no but hundred years back had several so if you ask me brother zakir why did 100 years back there were many indians fighting for the freedom because the british government ruled india that's the reason people are fighting for their freedom today the british government has gone back so no one is fighting for the freedom so maybe these muslims may actually be harassed they may be being arrested and you find this in several parts of the world in palestine etc that you find that maybe if you go to the history if you go back to the history and you find that they have really been harassed and if no one is coming out to help them they are resorting to whatever means they have like the example which is given in the bible david and goliath the stone was sufficient so who's to blame we are to blame we are to blame that we aren't going to the root cause of the problem if there's a terrorist organization we have to go and really find out what is the reason that they have resorted to terrorism the only way you can solve this problem just by killing them the stairs it will not solve the problem if you kill one there will be 10 emerging what we have to do we have to go and find out what is the reason why are you restoring to this method we have to go back to the root cause it's like giving the example of palestine when hitler in 26 million jews the jews were kicked out from germany and the palestinians they said hell and was helen you are a cousin come and join us it is like i tell a stranger that if you have problem come and stay in my house after a few years he kicks me out of the house and when i start making noise outside my house that see these people have entered my house so you call me a terrorist am i a terrorist i was welcome a person is a stranger just as a human brother i got him to the house after a few months he kicks me out when i say that i want my house back you say that i'm a terrorist who's to blame we have to blame we are to blame we have to find out that what is the cause of the problem if we who almighty god has given us intelligence has given even the power and to get together if we get to the root cause you will come to know that why should a person want to die who would like to die who would like to die a person who says that i say i'm going to get killed so why not i die and take somebody else also so if you ask the psychologist they will tell you the root cause is we have to go and ask these people that by doing all this and many a time will find out that the truth is lying behind it and the truth is that they may be being harassed and some people may really be terrorists some people may be terror and the people for money some people for fame some people for politics so i do agree sister that but majority what i feel that they are being troubled whether it be muslim whether it be hindu whether it be christians there has to be a backlash if a person cannot bear whatever torture that is undergoing he resorts to psychologists say and i'm a medical doctor i have done my studies in medicine they have to retaliate it is human nature so why should a person would not like to raise a finger would like to carry a gun in the hand why so what we have to do we have to find the root cause and try and solve this problem that's the only way we can see to it that these terrorizing the innocent people will stop and all human beings can live together as one brotherhood [Applause]"
