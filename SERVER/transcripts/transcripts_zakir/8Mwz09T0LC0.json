  "title": "What If He takes Off after Breaking Fast and only on the Plane sees the Sun again? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "question seven if a person breaks his fast after sunset on the ground and immediately takes off in a plane and then sees the sun does he have to stop eating um is his fast valid or should he repeat it and this situation can happen to a traveler that he's in a place and the time for ifar is the the sun is set and he has ifar and immediately the plane takes off maybe 2 minutes after the sun sets at 6:00 and 602 2 minutes after 6:00 the plane takes off and the moment the plane takes off it goes at a high altitude and at that time you can see the Sun so what happened does he have to stop eating the person who has completed his fast where he was staying the fast is valid he doesn't stop eating the fast of that day is finished he has completed the fast he can have thear even when he goes to a high altitude and he sees the sun he need not stop eating his fast is completed but on the other hand if a person takes off 2 minutes before at 5:58 or 2 minutes to 6 2 minutes is balanced to break his fast and if he takes off and then sees the Sun and he sees the Sun for another 5 10 minutes he should not break his fast he can't say okay while at the ground 2 minutes were left so now at 6:00 the time is up I will break my fast because there he can see the Sun so at that time he should continue fasting only after the sun sets maybe after 5 minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes that's the time that he should break his fast and similarly while traveling in a plane if suppose the pilot is there and the sun can be seen the pilot should not take the plane down so that you can break the fast early but if there's a technical problem and you have to change the altitude and come down and if the sun sets for the person in the plane then they can break the fast"
