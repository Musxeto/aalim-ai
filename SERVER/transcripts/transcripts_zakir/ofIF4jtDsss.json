  "title": "Was Jesus Christ (Pbuh) Crucified According to Islam & Christianity? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my question is kind of related to the one the sister started asking and the other one who commented on picking good things in religions see i believe i believe islam is part of this continuous chain of religions like if we're talking about judaism christianity and islam in order to be a muslim you have to believe first in judaism and christianity my question is like this matters and the crucifixion of the christ like i mean let me say the the islamic story about the crucifixion of the christ in other words and i believe that it's you know once this issue is clarified we'll have no more major differences like gaps will just turn off that's the question he has posed two parts of the question that a muslim can only be a muslim first if he believes in judaism and christianity and then islam which i disagree brother allah says in the quran imran chapter number 3 verse number 19 in nadine islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah is islam so what moses peace be upon him priest was nothing but islam he never preached judaism what jesus christ peace be upon him priest was nothing but islam he never preached christianity the word christianity doesn't exist in the bible do you know that the word christianity doesn't exist in the bible the first time the word christian is used in the book of acts in the book of acts it says that the people of antioch they called the followers of jesus christ as christians it was the nickname given by the people of antioch jesus christ peace be never heard the word christian in his life do you know that so where did he teach christianity so for you to say a muslim should first follow judaism krishna then islam is totally wrong in nadena in the islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah is islam what all the messengers preached is nothing but islam these what you find the bible and the other books they are the corrupted form of the original revelations now coming to your question that what is the islamic version of crucifixion what islam is about crucifixion quran says in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse 157 that they said in boast that we killed jesus the son of mary the jews they said in boast we killed jesus son of mary for mark they killed him not neither did they crucify christian walakin should be alone it was only made to appear so and all those who differ are full of doubts with only conjectures to follow for a surety they killed him not so according to the quran the jews said in boast that we killed jesus christ peace be upon him but they killed him not needed to crucify him it was only made to appear so and all those who differ are full of doubts with only conjectures to follow for a surety they killed and not so according to the quran we believe that jesus christ peace be upon him he was not crucified it was only made to appear so and i've had a debate on was christ really crucified crucifixion means a person should die on the cross and in my debate have proved that jesus christ peace be upon him he did not die on the cross so we don't have an english term for a person who's put on the cross but does not die so the new word that we can coin is crucifixion f i c t i o n fiction not fiction not f i x i o n so what we believe that it was a crucifixion c r u c i f i c t i o n but it was not crucifixion f i x i o n because i proved in my talk that he did not die on the cross to cut it short to make the christian realize in one nutshell how to prove that jesus christ peace be upon him did not die on the cross he was crucified when jesus christ peace be upon him was asked by the people that oh master show us some signs so he replies in the gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 he says you evil and adulterous generation you asked me for a sign no sign shall be given except the sign of jonah for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth now anyone who's a christian he knows the sign of jonah he has to go to the book of jonah it is only one page only two sides and when you ask any christian about the sign of jonah they will tell us that jonah was asked by almighty god to go to january to deliver the message but he runs away from the commandment and goes to joppa so here while he's traveling in the ship there's a storm so it was a thinking at that time that the storm is due to a person has not obeyed to the commandment of his lord so they draw lots so jonah peace be upon him he volunteers and says i have run away from the commandment at that time it was a thinking that if they throw the person overboard in the sea the sea would become calm so they take jonah and they throw him overboard now when they throw jonah overboard was he dead or alive was he dead alive he was alive when he goes in the sea normally in a raging sea in a storm a human being ought to die but jonah does not die peace be upon me the life a fish comes and gobbles him up when the fish gobbles them up was dona dead our life he was alive if he dies it's not a miracle he's alive it's a miracle three days and three nights the fish takes him around the ocean the man ought to die because of suffocation he does not die it's a miracle the fish vomits him out on the shore he ought to die he does not die it's a miracle of a miracle of a miracle of a miracle he's thrown overboard he does not die a fish comes and gobbles him up he does not die three days and three nights he roams in the belly of the fish he does not die he's vomited out he does not die a miracle of a miracle of a miracle so jesus christ peace be upon him said that as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth now when you ask a christian jesus christ peace be upon him in the sepulcher in his grave for three days and three nights was he dead or alive was he dead or alive the christians tell us he was dead but then there's a contradiction for him to fulfill the prophecy of the sign of jonah he has to be alive so only on this one prophecy there are various ways i can prove he wasn't crucified it proved that jesus christ peace be upon did not die on the cross he was alive so based on this we can prove from the bible that jesus christ peace be upon him he did not die on the cross jesus christ peace be upon him puts all his eggs in one basket he says no sign shall be given except the sign of jonah for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the will so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and further if you analyze even three days and three nights it is not fulfilled because on friday he's put on the cross so before saturday comes he's put down he's in the grave when when he's put in the grave he's put on friday night he's on saturday full day saturday night sunday morning is out so it's two nights and one day so even the prophecy of three days and three days is not fulfilled but surely if he has to fulfill the other way like jonah he has to be alive and i've given various arguments from the bible and proves that jesus christ peace be was not crucified you can take my videotape i had a debate with an arab christian an iraqi christian was christ really crucified and approved there that he was not crucified he was raised up alive hope to answer the question [Applause]"
