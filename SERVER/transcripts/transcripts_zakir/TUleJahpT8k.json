  "transcript": "there are other people who say knows billah Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him you're suffering from mythomania this is a psychological disorder that a person mentions a lie and he believes it is the truth mythomaniac is a person who tells the lie and we believe that it is a fact and a psychologist he treats the person by giving him more facts suppose a person says that I am a king the psychiatrist will not say that you're crazy the psychiatrist will say you are a king where is the queen so the middle say the queen has gone to a mother's place where is the minister the minister has died where I are gods the more you keep on posing facts then he says I think I'm not the king and if you analyze the Quran the Quran mentioned about facts keeps on giving facts and figures facts mentioning historical things so the Quran is a treatment for mythomaniac it's not a book written by mythomaniac knowsvilla"
