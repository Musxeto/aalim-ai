  "transcript": "the question asked by maida khalid when we are fasting after doing wudu how many times do we have to spit to ensure that we don't swallow with the water when you do do one of the important things you do in udu is your gargle you put water into your mouth and when you gargle you throw the water out you normally gargle thrice so you throw the water out thrice if you have thrown out the water properly you don't have to additionally spit out more there's a misconception that many of the people think that have to keep on spitting when you gargle butt naturally you gargle in the mouth you put water and you throw the water out as long as you have thrown all the water out it is sufficient if you realize that there's some water remaining then you can spit it out no problem but there is no hard and fast true that you should spit once or spit twice or split thrice but naturally you're putting water in your mouth thrice all the three times you throw it out that's it that's sufficient if you fear that there is some water remaining you can spit out but it's not compulsory that you have to keep spitting out to be sure that no water has remained normally when you are at the daytime always sleeping there is saliva being secreted from your mouth and this moistens your mouth this saliva which is normally secreted it normally goes back it is secreted and it is ingested there is no harm at all but purposefully if you collect saliva in your mouth and make it into a large quantity and then you swallow that is wrong but normally the saliva which is secreted it goes into the stomach there's no problem at all whether you're awake or whether you're asleep so similarly while doing vudu normally the sunnah of vudu is that you have to sniff excessively that's the sunnah of the voodoo you sniff the water into your nose excessively so what the prophet said that while fasting do not sniff excessively so sniffing excessively when you're not fasting is a sunnah as i told you in my recommended acts that some of the sunnah are different of ramadan so while you're fasting you should not sniff excessively while doing wudu because when you sniff excessively there are high chances that the water through your nostril can go inside and get break your fast so while fasting when you're doing wudu you should take precaution of not to sniff into your nose excessive water that's it but while gargling do the normal gargle that you do and spit out the water that is sufficient"
