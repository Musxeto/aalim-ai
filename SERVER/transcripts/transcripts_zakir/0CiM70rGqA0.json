  "transcript": "Allah mentioned in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter number 3 verse number 31 the prophet is commanded to say that all those who love Allah follow me for Allah will love you and Allah will forgive you now if he analyze that we human beings we too love the other human beings we love our parents our father and mother we love our wives we love our children and the reason we love them basically is because these people people these human beings have done certain favor on us for example we love our mother because she bore us in a womb for 9 months she took care of us in childhood she brought us up we love our brothers either they have given us something or we want something from them we love the human beings so in that context if you calculate the favors Allah has done on us Allah says in the Quran in Sur ibraim chapter number 14 verse number 34 that if you count the favors of Allah subhana wa ta'ala you will not be able to add them up so imagine if we love our parent for the few things they have given us how much should we love Allah subhana wa tala and the love differs we human beings we even love animals we love human beings also but the love of the animals that the human beings have is different on a different level as compared to the love that we have for the human beings similarly the love for Allah subhana wa ta'ala is on a different level as compared to the love we have for the human beings it is far superior it is far more on a higher platter it is mentioned in the Quran in Surah FAA chapter number one verse number five alone we worship they alone we ask for help we have to only worship him and no one else Allah says in Surah chapter number 40 verse number 16 you ask me and I will answer your prayer Allah says in Surah Bak chapter number 2 verse 186 oh messenger when they ask you about me tell them I'm near to them and I will answer their prayers so all worship should only be done to Allah subhana wa ta'ala and no one else he is the only one who deserves the worship and no one else now let us analyze the purpose of creation from another perspective from the perspective of the human beings that what is the purpose of existence in this world God created us we came in this world what is our requirement what is our purpose of existence and Allah gives the reply in Surah mul chapter number 67 verse number two Allah says Allah it's Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good Deeds Allah has created death and life to test which of you good deeds and Allah says in the Quran in Imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 Allah says every soul shall have a taste of death but the final recompense will be on the day of judgment and anyone who has been saved from the fire and enters the garden he would have achieved the objective of this world for this world is nothing but mere chatles of deception that means this life of us in this world is a test for the Hereafter if you obey the Commandments of Allah subhana wa ta'ala in the next life we'll get Paradise if you don't obey we will not get Paradise we go to hell so this life the purpose of existence as Allah says is the test for the Hereafter and Allah says in the Quran in an kabut chapter number 29 verse number two that do you think just by saying we believe we will let you go we will surely test you mean if you just say I believe in Allah I am a Muslim i a m do you think Allah will let you go finish your test is over Allah say don't you think we will test you just by saying I am a Muslim just by saying you're a Believer just by saying I submit my will to almighty God you will not go Scot free Allah will surely test you and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 155 that surely we will test you with fear and hunger with loss of your lives and of the goods and what You' have accumulated in your life and give Glad Tidings to those who are patient Allah says he'll test everyone either with fear or with Hunger or with loss of life or with Goods or the wealth have accumulated Allah will test you and Allah test different people in different ways"
