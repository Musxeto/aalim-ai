  "title": "15 Point Action Plan for the Muslim Ummah when Someone Insults Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) ... Part 2",
  "transcript": "number two he should take some action minimum the minimum today that the muslim can do besides condemning that is that tell to convey to the others that this act is wrong and today the world is a global village and today the social media has become so popular and so common that for us to condemn such acts we can easily do it on the social media this wasn't there 10 years back but now today internet is used by about 60 of the world population out of the 7.82 billion people that we have today 60 percent use internet 4.56 billion people and from this 4.14 billion of the people in the world they use social media that is 53 of the world population uses social media so what a muslim can do and most of the muslims will be having social media accounts whether it be facebook whether it be youtube whether it be twitter we have to condemn this act on the social media if you cannot write any articles yourself or you are not good with words the least you can do is go to the other facebook pages or the other social media sites and scan what the other muslim the either said what the muslim leaders have said what other muslim scholars have said the least you can do is copy and post it onto your social media account today facebook is the largest and the most used social media today as on october 2020 there are 2.701 billion users monthly active users mau in the world 2.701 billion active monthly users that's about 35 percent of the world population they are on the facebook even if you agree that the muslims use social media less at least 25 percent of the muslim will be on the facebook and today the muslim population is approximately 2 billion i am shocked that in the last one week when i heard some of the heads of states of muslim countries they are saying that muslims are 1.6 billion in the world today some said 1.5 billion from where do they get these statistics this may be 10-15 years back according to the pew report which is authentic report in 2015 five years ago they said that muslims were 1.8 billion 24.1 percent of the world population were muslims and statistics tell us that the muslims increase 2.2 annually every year some statistics say they increase by 1.5 percent if you calculate and you multiply 1.8 billion by 2.2 by 2.2 by 2.25 times you get a figure of more than 2 billion if you agree the increase is only 1.5 percent every year yet you get a figure of 1.95 billion so today muslims are approximately 2 billion in the world so how can a head of state of a muslim country which is one of the largest in the world say that muslims are only 1.6 billion so even if we agree that 25 percent of the muslims use facebook that means half a billion muslims will be having facebook and imagine if we convey this message and we condemn this act it may be anything whether it may be the danish cartoon whether it be the charlie hebdo whether it be macron what he insulted the prophet or whether that would be salman whenever such incidents takes place the least you can do today is on the social media you can wait and alhamdulillah i did a campaign for about five days on the facebook and it's going to end today inshallah from last tuesday to the saturday for five days and i had 16 posts that were designed and every day either three four or five posts were posted on my facebook and alhamdulillah in a span of these five days it's yet continuing about 35 million people saw this post mashallah and in the next one week it may reach about 45 to 50 million so everyone can put on his facebook we know today the more number of people that you have the facebook doesn't let your post reach everyone they let only a small percentage reach amongst the followers only a small percentage receive unless you pay a lot of money another policy i do not give a single dollar i don't give any paid ads or any paid post mine is 100 fully organic my followers alhamdulillah on the facebook are 22.6 million but on a normal post about 500 000 800 000 sometimes a million but in this mashallah the average was much higher you can even post it on twitter you can post your condemnation on the youtube the talk that i gave the answer that i gave last week it was for 24 minutes and when i put on my youtube in three days mashaallah more than half a million people saw it so this way a muslim can mashallah reach across the world imagine if all the muslims put on their social media account surely we will be able to convey this message to half the world everyone at least has some following and many people have this philosophy that oh you know there are hardly about a thousand people on my facebook only 500 people on the facebook allah will give you savable on your action suppose a person can reach a million people and he only reaches half a million people and a person who allah has given capacity to reach to a thousand people and he reaches all thousand people he will get more sub up than the person who has reached half a million people because allah gave him a capacity of one million so depending upon whatever ability you have got my request to the muslim ummah is that see to it that you condemn this act on all the social media accounts that you have whether it be facebook whether it be youtube whether it be twitter whether it be whatsapp and today we know alhamdulillah after facebook the number two most popular social media account it is the youtube youtube has got two billion followers as of october 2020. the third is whatsapp which has got two billion monthly active users the fourth is facebook messenger which has got 1.3 billion monthly active users the fifth it is a wechat 1.206 billion monthly active users the sixth is instagram 1.153 billion active users monthly if we make use of the more active or the more popular of the social media there are higher chances that you'll reach a larger audience at least if we take care of the top 15 or the top 20 most active social media you'll be able to reach a large audience snapchat has got 441 million users pinterest has got 413 monthly active users twitter has got 336 million monthly active users so what we should do we should propagate as much as possible on the social media with whatever ability you have if you cannot do it yourself copy the post of other islamic scholars other islamic guys other islamic leaders and promote this as much as you can in my youtube channel i gave a reply for about 24 minutes to the attack president emmanuel macron made against islam and that video of 24 minutes in a span of less than three days it had more than 500 000 views alhamdulillah so you can use the facebook you can use the youtube you can use the instagram and this is how you promote and what you can do you can go on the internet and select some books or pamphlets on the life of prophet muhammad peace be upon him for example a short booklet written by a hindu life of prophet muhammad peace be upon him by prophet ramakrishna rao you can pick up statements from the book of lama team muhammad peace be upon him in the book heroes in hero worship thomas carlyle writes about the prophet you can pick up that paragraph and send it to a non-muslim friend what michael had wrote about the prophet in the book the 100 most influential people these short things you can pick up from the net and send it to your non-muslim friends you can even send the seerah of the prophet muhammad one of the best seerah is the sealed nectar which is written by sheikh you can pick it up and most of these things are free send it to a non-muslim friend send it to your muslim friend put it on your social media account and distribute it it's very easy and social media believe me is absolutely free you don't have to spend a single penny on it and no one can say that you cannot spend it on the social media it's very easy"
