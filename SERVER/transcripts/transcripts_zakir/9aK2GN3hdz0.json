  "title": "Quran Mentioned 1400 Years Ago the Sun Rotates About its Axis, Opposite of what I Learnt in School",
  "transcript": "when i was in school i passed my school in 1982 about 29 years back there i had learned in science that the sun though it revolves it does not rotate about its own access but the quran mentions in surah ambia chapter number 21 verse number 33 it is he who has created the night and the day was the sun in the moon fifa each one traveling in orbit with its own motion the quran says the sun and the moon besides revolving it also rotates about its own axis and today recently a few decades earlier science has come to know that the sun rotates and takes about 25 days to complete one rotation which has been incorporated in most of the school textbooks throughout the world there may be certain skeptics who will say it's nothing great that the quran speaks about astronomy since the arabs were advanced in the field of astronomy i do agree that the arabs were advanced in the field of astronomy but like to remind them that the arabs became advanced in the field of astronomy a few hundred years after the quran was revealed so it is from the quran that the arabs learned about astronomy and not the vice versa"
