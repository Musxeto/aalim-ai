  "transcript": "in the subject of oceanology there's a verse in the quran in surah furqan chapter 25 verse number 53 he says that it is let free two bodies of flowing water one sweet and palatable and the other salty and bitter though they meet they do not mix there is a barrier which is forbidden to be trespassed the same message is repeated in surah rahman chapter number 55 verse number 19 that we have let free two bodies of flowing water though they meet they do not mix there is a barrier there is a parzakh which is forbidden to be trespassed when the commentators of the quran when they try to understand this verse all of us know very well and we knew it earlier also that there are two types of water sweet and salty but they could not understand the verse of the quran which says that there are two types of water sweet and salty though they meet they did not mix there is a barrier which is forbidden to be test passed there is a barza the mufasirins the commentators could not understand what did it mean today after science has advanced we have come to know that whenever one type of water flows into the other type of water sweet water flows into the salty water it loses its constituents and gets homogenized into the water it flows this transitional homogenizing area according to the quran is called as the bazak it is an unseen barrier and this has been testified and verified when this verse of the quran was shown to prophet hay who is a very famous marine scientist and a professor in oceanology in the university of colorado in usa and he said that what the quran mentions 1400 years ago has been testified by science recently and this phenomena can be seen even with the naked eye at the cape point the southern most tip of cape town and south africa where one type of water flow to the other type we even see that the colors of both these waters differ another good example is in egypt when river nile flows into the mediterranean sea and the best example is the gulf stream it flows for thousands of miles it starts from the gulf of mexico and goes to the east side of north america travels upwards then goes eastwards and travels to the west coast of europe it flows for thousands of miles but yet the two waters are distinct and if you are traveling in a ship towards the extreme of the gulf stream and pick up take a bucket of water from the left side and a bucket of water from the right side you will find that one is sweet and the other salty even the temperature between the two they differ imagine quran speaks about this phenomena 1400 years ago"
