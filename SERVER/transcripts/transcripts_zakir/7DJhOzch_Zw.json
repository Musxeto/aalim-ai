  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaykum my name is Sahar I a student at University and live in Pakistan why Allah subhana wa tala did not directly send the Glorious Quran so that people can follow it why did Allah subh tala sent the Torah before the Quran in this way we will get confused why should we follow the Torah then the Bible and now the Quran if there is only one holy book the Quran all should follow follow it and there will be no conflicts Allah subhana says in the Glorious Quran in number 13 ver number 38 for each period we have sent a book by name four Revelations are mentioned in the Glorious Quran the tah the zabur the injil and the Quran the tah was theah the Revelation that was given to Moses peace be upon him the zabor was the W the Revelation that was given to David peace be upon him the inil was the W the Revelation that was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him and the Quran is the last and final Revelation that was revealed to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so by name four Revelations are mentioned in the Glorious Quran but there were several other Revelations for example ibim the Scrolls of prophet Ibrahim but all the revelations before the Glorious Quran they were only meant for those people and for that time they were time bound but the Glorious Quran it is is not meant only for the Muslims or only for the Arabs but the Glorious Quran it is meant for the whole of humanity and Allah subhana T says inah ibraim chapter number 14 verse number one the book is revealed to thee in order to lead Mankind from the depths of Darkness into light Allah subhana tal says in Surah ibraim chapter number 14 verse number 52 here is a message let them take warning thereof and let them know that there's one God let men of understanding take heed Allah subhana T says in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 Ramadan is the month in which the Glorious Quran was revealed as a guide for mankind so the Glorious Quran it is a guidance for the whole of humanity so the Glorious Quran it is meant for the whole of humanity now why didn't Allah subhana tala reveal the Glorious Quran directly the previous Revelations that were revealed they were meant for those people and for that time but Allah subhana wa tala did not reveal the Glorious Quran directly perhaps because the people they would not be able to grasp the message and I would like to give you a simple example when we study in school we study gradually and step by step for example Nursery Junior kg senior kg first standard second standard third fourth fifth until 10th grade then we have college then we have graduation postgraduation Etc so it is a gradual and step-by-step procedure you cannot directly study in 10th Grade you have to study first grade second grade third grade the student cannot tell the teacher that teacher why do we have to study 10 years why don't I directly study in 10th Grade it is a gradual and step-by-step procedure similarly because the people they would not be able to grasp the message so first previous Revelations were revealed based on the understanding and capability of the people later on the message kept on getting more difficult based on the grasping power of the people Allah subhana tala revealed the Glorious Quran previously the people they were not so Advanced so that's the reason Allah subhana wa ta'ala he did not reveal the Glorious Quran directly he revealed previous Revelations which were meant for those people and Allah subhana tala did not Pres preserve these Revelations because he did not think it fit to preserve them they were only meant for those people Allah subhana says inah chap number 15 verse number n and it is we who have revealed the Glorious Quran and it is we who will guard it from corruption so the Glorious Quran it is guarded from corruption and Allah subhana tala has said that he will guard the Glorious Quran from corruption"
