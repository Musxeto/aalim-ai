  "title": "Should Muslims Avoid Wearing their Label if it is a Danger to their Lifes? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign my question is that I was told during the 1993 riots those people were wearing their levels were identified and hunted down and killed the in Bombay in such situation I think we should avoid if we were in the table in the face of danger to our life thank you assalam somebody asked a question they're doing the right we took place in Bombay 1992 and 1993 many people were afraid of their lives and many people remove the label so is it right to remove the label during such things every rule has an exception and the Quran clearly mentions that if under compulsion if on a compulsion unwillingly you can even do shirk for example if someone puts a gun on your temple on your head and ask you are your Muslim deep within your heart you know him that I'm a Muslim but to save your life under compulsory now the last resort the Quran gives you an option that you can tell a lie in this situation if life and death is the question only other situation similarly during rights you are living in a non-muslim area and suppose if you step out and life will be in danger in such situation if you remove a label inshallah Allah will forgive you for example if in a right around the corner anonymously puts a gun on your temper Muslim or Muslim you have option of saying [Music] is allowed if around the corner no one is watching me what do they use I have options permission so here if a person says non-muslim and saves this life so that he can spread Islam afterwards alhamdulillah similarly if someone asked me on the stage where there are hundreds and thousands of people watching me I am Muslim or non-muslim you're also have the option both Muslim or non-muslim but here may say that if I give shahada there are hundreds and thousands of people watching me it may boost up the morale I may prefer saying I'm a Muslim and becomes alhamdulillah so Quran gives both the permission and the compulsion like the Quran says chapter number two verse number 173 chapter number five verse number three in Surah chapter 6 verse 145 and in Surah in Hell chapter number 16 115 that if unwillingly if you disable Allah Allah is that after saying that poke is forbidden for you if unwillingly if you are dying of hunger if poke is the only thing you can find if you have gone in a boat and you have no food and someone offers you poke for your survival you can eat that much which is sufficient for you to survive not eat your tummy full but the moment you come on the shore again it becomes prohibited so to save your life Islam with permission under compulsion unwilling if it is here you have an option that if you feel your life in a ninja or you cannot bear the mental torture no problem but alhamdulillah I do know that there are few people who move the label and many of them the moment that Master became cordial they vote the label again but I know of hundreds of Muslims who did not wear the label before the rights but after observing the rights the moral was boosted and they started wearing the label I personally know of hundreds of Muslim alhamdulillah who after the rights wore the labels for the situation we were in a problem we should identify ourselves as Muslims the moment the mental shock of the riots was over alhamdulillah many Muslims wore the label after the rights hope to answer the question"
