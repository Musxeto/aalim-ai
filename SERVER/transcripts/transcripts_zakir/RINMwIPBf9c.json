  "title": "Will I get the same Sawaab whether I Read the Qurâ€™an in Arabic or in English? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there's a question by faizan kuwait my question is will we get the same sabab of reading quran whether we read in english or arabic since i cannot read arabic fluently the beloved prophet muslim said that every letter you recite of the quran you get sabab and allah is not one letter it is alif is the letter lam is the letter higher the letter you get 10 10 10 30 so for every letter you recite of the quran you get 10 blessings as far as this blessing is concerned surely it's only when you recite the quran in arabic not when you read the translation but natural when you read the translation you will get saba but not the same at all as you get in arabic the sabab that you get for reading in arabic is multiple times more than reading the translation but point to be noted is that one is sabab for hitting the quran the other is for implementing the quran if you read arabic and you don't understand arabic how can you implement on the message of the quran whereas if you read in english or urdu or bangla the language you understand the best you may get a minute a small percentage of saba for reading it but if you implement on the message you will get multiple time mosab so reading sabab is one thing in which you get more in arabic but implementing is one thing if you read the quran with translation and you implement on the message that you abstain from the things which are haram and do the things which are commanded by subhana allah surely the sabab is multiple times more even than reading in arabic so the best i would say is that if you don't understand arabic as a language the best is you read the arabic quran in arabic and also read the translation it is the best you're killing two birds with one stone so that you get the saba for reading also and you also get the saba for implementing the message of allah"
