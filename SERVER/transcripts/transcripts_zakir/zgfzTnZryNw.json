  "transcript": "for additional Assurance we have another label I'm referring to the cap people ask me that is it a f to wear a cap there is no words in the Glorious Quran saying that it's a f to wear a cap neither did our Prophet said that it's a far to wear a cap so I wouldn't say it's a f but it is a Sunnah and if you read sayari volume number seven in the book of dress chapter number 16 it's mentioned according to Abbas that the Beloved Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam when he came he wore a black turban the prophet whenever he went out he always covered the head unless he was in a state ofam he always covered the head according to anas bin Malik he said that when the prophet came out he covered the head with a part of His Garment further if you read in s bukari volume number s in the book of dress chapter number 17 Hadith number 699 anas Malik Allah be pleased with him he said that in the year of the conquest of Mecca when the prophet entered Makkah he was wearing a helmet the prophet always covered his head so it is a Sunnah to cover your head whether it be with a piece of cloth or like a head covering with the Arabs we or a cap and the madis those who experts in the knowledge of Hadith if they have to verify whether the ri whether the person who narrated is a Sika is true or not many of the muhad who are staunch they do not regard the Hadith of a narrator who did not cover his head with if a narrator did not cover his head the stch M say we will not accept his Hadith so imagine it is a Sunnah to cover the head and the cap it is so cheap it is so cheap you know hardly cost about 10 Rupees 15 rupees or 20 rupees the one that I'm very it's made in China cost about 25 rupees it's a harmless thing it cannot even hurt a fly it is so harmless but it can do wonders it can do wonders and I normally keep on traveling alhamdulillah I keep on traveling in various parts of the world and people when they see me especially when I go to the Western Country who is this man you know fine looking man wearing a coat coat and trousers and wearing a cap it looks a bit funny and many people who aren't aware what is this cap so I tell him it's the sign it's my label I'm a Muslim oh you're a Muslim an opportunity to Da which is a f in Islam an opportunity people wonder what is this person you know wearing a funny type of head gear they come and approach you they are giving you an opportunity to open your mouth it does wonders people start respecting you alhamdulillah it's a harmless thing it can't even hurt a fly but it does wonders and if suppose you're working in office which is being owned by a non-muslim and if suppose he does not like you wearing the cap it's very easy take it out and keep it in your pocket but the moment the office time is over you can wear your cap back it's your right he's only paying you for eight or 10 hours that you're working for him but the moment you come out you can wear the cap it's preferable to wait always but suppose you have a certain problem that you have to work in that office and if it doesn't allow you no problem take out the cap and keep it in a pocket it has wonders you know when we go to the mosque alhamd we see that the majority of the Muslims they wear the cap alhamdulillah but when they come out most of them put it in the pocket why what's the problem are you afraid to identify yourself to Muslims outside are you afraid what are you afraid of in The Mask alhamdulillah you wear the cap but when you come out you put the label in your pocket see in the mosque people recognize they're a Muslim alhamdulillah you should even wear it there but when you come out why do you keep it in your pocket and if you ask your grandparents and those elderly people they will tell you that people respected this label the cap and the beard and the non-muslims very often when they wanted to hire a taxi a cab they searched for a driver who wore a cap and a beard know that oh oh These are Muslims you know they honest people they will not cheat us they will not take us for a ride"
