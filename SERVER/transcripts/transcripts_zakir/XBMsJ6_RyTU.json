  "transcript": "does the situation uh or the circumstances of the supplicant um have any bearing on whether or not Allah accepts the Dua as I mentioned earlier that the situation or circumstance he's in if you ask Allah subhana wa taala he can supplicate to Allah subhana tala but there are certain situations which are preferable for example when a person is fasting when a person is traveling when a just ruler when he supplicates or a just Imam or a father supplicates for his son or daughter or a person who has Halal earnings and he supplicates or it can be a person who prays in sujud as our beloved Prophet mam said it's mentioned had of in the book of Supplication Hadith number 35 598 the prophet said the prayer of three people is never rejected number one is a just ruler or a Imam number two a person who's fasting especially when he breaks his fast and number three is an oppressed person and there similar Hadi which I quoted earlier of Ali Hadith number 693 where the Prophet said the prayer of three people is never rejected a father when he prays for his child a fasting person especially when he breaks his fast and a traveling person when he prays so the of the Prophet these are the times which are preferred when a person supplicates as compared to others"
