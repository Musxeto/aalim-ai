  "transcript": "any sisters have any questions uh brother this question is concerning with a few ayats the beginning verses of suratul bakara um a person who became a murta he presented this ayat and he created a doubt I mean he asked a doubt concerning those ayats he said that Allah is saying in the initial verses of Surah baqarah that these people will get hidayah or guidance from Allah those who have taqwa those who spend out of their wills and all those qualities so his question was a person who is already having taqwa and already doing all this why where does he require hidayah or guidance so if Allah is going to guide someone who already has a Daya what's the great deal just ask the question she said that one Muslim he posed this question against the Quran or she and that person poses a question on Surah starting few verses we say that Allah guides those who have taqwa so the question is what is the use of guiding those who don't have takwa should be guided already an example a simple example to answer this question that in a class where teacher teaches the student she but natural teaches all the students lecture but she says that those who follow my instructions will pass the examination the teacher teaches the same to all the students if the 100 students she teaches the same thing but those who follow the teacher or those who have the yearning or the desire to obey the teacher to obey the teacher instruction and they study hard and they pass the examination so the teacher says that those who have the desire to obey me will get guided from my lecture and pass the examination so you come into teacher so what's the use of those who have the desire to listen to you passing the examination those who don't have the desire should pass so if the teacher says okay fine that those who don't have the desire to pass I will pass them so it is illogical this is examination Allah says in the Quran chapter number 16 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of his good indeeds this life is the test for the Hereafter Allah has bought us human beings in this world as a test for the Hereafter and we are undergoing a test and Allah says in the Quran that if we want it you could have made each and every human being a Muslim very easy for him if he wanted he could have made each and every human being a Muslim and already but then where is the test that category is already there the Angels the angel is a category of creation of Allah who never disabled Allah whatever Allah says so what will be the difference between angels and us the difference between the human being and the angel is that the Angels don't have a free will of their own whatever Allah says the human means and the Jinn we have a free will we can either Obi Allah after a free will is given to us Allah and foreign means we become higher than the angels but after the Free Will is given and if you don't obey Allah we become the pattern of the Satan so this life is a test for the Hereafter so what Allah says that all those who have taqwa Allah will guide them Allah says in several verses chapter number 29 verse number 69 that all those who strive in my way I will open up their Pathways so if someone objects that Allah has opened up the pathways for those who strive in his way it is illogical he should open up the pathways for those who don't strive and if I'm teaching the medical students those who don't follow the textbook they will pass so these doctors when they come out they will not Retreat the patient they will kill the patients and Allah says in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse 160 that if Allah helps you none can overcome you if Allah forsakes you who is there then who can help you so let the Believers put their trust in Allah what the Quran says that if you have faith in Allah Allah is bound to help you and you're born to be successful if you are not successful it is not allowed to be blamed it is you have to be blamed Allah promises the diffuse striving is if your Pathways have not been opened don't blame Allah you have to blame yourself so if you analyze read the Quran Allah is giving us guidance he forgives the mistakes many Mysteries human being make he forgives Us by the same time he says that all those who strive in his way all those who have taqwa all those who have the yearning to sacrifice Allah will surely help you and guide you those who disable Allah so only thing we should have is the faith in Allah should strive in his way and inshallah will be successful in this world"
