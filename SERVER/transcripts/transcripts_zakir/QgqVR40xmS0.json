  "title": "Why is Music and Dancing Prohibited in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good evening my name is nikhila I'm a dental \nstudent my information about Islam is really   less or whatever I know is because of my friends \nmy question is I've read this poster they say that   music and dance is like not accepted in Islam why \nis that I mean you cannot say it's generally also   you can you know listen to music or singing \nor dance or whatever or you cannot just say   like only for bharatanatyam or for any form of \ndance you have music in general music also we   have you when you praise God when you show your \nemotions why is it said that music and dance is   not allowed sister has a question that why is \nit in Islam that music and dance are prohibited   first I'll come to music then I go to the dance \nas far as music is concerned a beloved part of   Muslim said that the musical instruments as a \ngeneral rule they are prohibited except he gave   permission for the duff that's the one-sided open \ndrum called as Duff or duffley besides that the   prophet prohibited because if you analyze it takes \na person away from the remembrance of Allah from   the remembrance of almighty God that's the reason \nwhen we hear these you know film song whether it   be Hindi it may be malayali or Tamil or whatever \nit is you find that in these film songs most of   the words that are mentioned they are far away \nfrom reality you know the hero tells the heroine I'll get the moon for you I'll get the star for \nyou we know it's not possible no man can get   the the star of the moon for his lover but yet we \nkeep on repeating because of the ambience because   of everything so because of this general rule \nis that the music does take a person away from   Allah that is the reason a beloved Prophet \nprivate musical instruments except for tough   or as generally with your voice for example when \na person recites a Quran if you recite the Quran   his voice is good that's permitted because \nthat takes a person towards Allah the musical   instruments along in the background do create \na different Ambiance otherwise singing per se   it is optional as long as the words of the \nsong they take you towards your great Allah   if the words of the song take you away from Allah \neven that type of song is prohibited now come to   the second part why is dancing prohibited there \nis no words in the Quran Hadith that I know of   which says dancing per se is Haram \nbut normally because people dance   to show to the other people you know \nwe have dance performance on the stage   whereas on the stage and thousands are watching \nyou so normally in terms of the hijab reason we   wouldn't like to expose Our Ladies our mothers our \nsisters our daughters on the stage and thousands   of people looking at them so any profession in \nwhich the body is used as a show as to entertain   the people it is prohibited that is the reason \ndancing in public or dancing in parties where   your opposite sex mixing many a Time the rules \nof dancing they conflict with the rule of the   Islamic Sharia normally when you have a dance \nyou have pears male and female and most of these   pairs that the girlfriend boyfriend and you dance \nin front of other people so because it breaks   the system of Islamic hijab that's the reason \nper se it is prohibited because it goes again   in the system of hijab so you have to realize \nthat many a times when you dance you dance in   public you go out for parties and you move around \notherwise with you and your wife you can do what   you want as long as it doesn't go against the \nSharia alone in closed doors husband and wife   what they want to do as long it doesn't go against \nthe rules of the Quran inside there's no problem   but because most of the time dancing exploits the \nbody it includes singing dancing you go on the   stage and other people are watching so it breaks \nthe rules of sharia of the hijab and you can   hear my video because said women's rights in Islam \nmodernizing outdated which speaks in detail why do   we Muslims protect why do we love why do we Revere \na woman for because we love our women that's   the reason to protect them and we don't want to \nexhibit them that's the reason professions which   involve singing in public or dancing or modeling \nthese professions are prohibited for a lady"
