  "title": "Other Acts Discouraged in Ramadhaan â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Zaki regarding other issues or other acts which are discouraged which we haven't already covered can we now mention other acts which are discouraged during the month of Ramadan the other act which I discovered during the month of Ramadan is that many people they sleep the full day because they're awake in the night and only get up for the Salah and they go back they convert the day into 99 today which is not the purpose of fasting number two many people they are lazy and inactive during the day number three many people kill their time during the daytime with things like play game Amusement rather than doing things which are encouraged and soon of the Prophet number four many of them they give iftar party rather to show off than to see the pledge of Allah number five many people they ask the woman folk in the house to cook a variety of dishes for sahur and for iftar thus making most of the women spend major portion of the time in the month of Ramadan in the kitchen rather than spending time in the worship of Allah the sixth mistake the people make is that they spend a lot of time in renovation of the house in the month of Ramadan trying to prepare for it rather than worship Allah the seventh thing that discouraged is many people steering the full night and indulge in activities which are unproductive rather than the worshiping Allah number eight is that many people they spend time in excessive socializing after tarawi number nine is many people spend time in shopping they spend most part of the night in shopping number 10 is that they spend excessive time in eating the full night number 11 is many of them they spend the night loitering and roaming about rather worship and number 12 is that many of them they spend the last ashra the last 10 days preparing for Eid rather than worshiping Allah so these acts should be discouraged may Allah encourage us to spending our time productively during the month of Ramadan"
