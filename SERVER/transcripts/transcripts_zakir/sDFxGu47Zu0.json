  "transcript": "the second question it's from mark's king is masturbation haram 14s a similar question has been asked assalamu alaikum dr zakir my name is abdul ghaniyu i would like to know the ruling on masturbation i traveled and left my family behind for greener pasture for about one and a half years now i miss my wife very much when i call her online for video chat we sometimes end up with masturbation i would like to know if this is sinful or not a similar question is asked by third questioner assalamualaikum sir i am habibullah islam from assam india i am a student is masturbation haram in islam i do this and later i regret i do tawba but after some days i do it again i can't find the solution to this problem i am unhappy with masturbation and what i do the question that is masturbation permitted in islam is a very common question and literally every session i have one or two people asking this question but i've been trying to avoid answering this question but today i decided that let me answer this question as far as the act of masturbation is concerned the scholars in islam there are different opinions but the majority of the scholars they say that masturbation in islam is haram even though majority of the scholars say haram there is a large number which also say that it is mahru and there is another large number of scholars who say that it is muba it's optional so i would like to say at the outset that majority of the scholars in terms of percentage majority they say that it is haram but a large number they may not be majority but the number is huge a large number of scholars they also say it is macro it's discouraged and another large number though not in majority they also say that it is moba and we'll discuss this issue today and i'll let you know that which group of scholars do i agree with towards the end as far as the jurist the fukaha amongst the shafi and the maliki almost all of them they say that masturbation is haram and according to imam ashafi may allah have mercy on him he says it is haram and he quotes the verse of the quran from surah chapter number 23 verse number five six and seven if you read surah mohammed chapter number 23 verse number one on what it says that believers will eventually be successful verse number two says those who humble themselves in prayers verse number three says those who avoid vain talks verse number four says that those who do acts and deeds of charity verse number five says those who guard their private parts or those who abstain from sex verse number six says accept those who they have married that is their spouses that is their wives and those which their right hand possesses for them there is an exception and verse number seven says that all those who cross these limits they are transgressors so here the quran says in surah moment chapter number 23 verse number 5 6 and 7 that the movements are those who guard their private parts abstain from illicit sex except from the spouses and what their right hand possesses that's an exception and all those who cross these limits they are transgressors so based on this verse of the quran imam shafi malala because with him he says that here the verse is very clear-cut that sex you can only have with your spouse and what your right hand possesses and everything else is prohibited now this verse of the glorious quran can be interpreted in two ways the first group of scholars they understand this verse as here guarding your private parts in arabic it means that all types of sexual pleasure that means all types of sexual pleasures for a moment is only permitted with your wife and what your right hand possesses that is the slave girl and now the slave woman has been abolished so now it is restricted to only your wives so based on this verse if all sexual pleasure is only permitted with your wife then even masturbation is haram masturbation stimulation of your organ and most of the time it is self stimulation of your private part such that there is exacerbation or this orgasm but the other group of scholars say that this verse guard your private parts it's only restricted to sexual intercourse so the verse of the quran actually means that you can have sexual intercourse only with your wife and what your right hand possesses other than sexual intercourse this verse doesn't refer to other things so if you agree with the second group of scholars then masturbation doesn't fall under this verse of the quran that's the reason the scholars are divided but if you literally know the verse of the quran the meaning it says guard your private parts so but natural there is no explicit verse in the quran which says that masturbation is prohibited and what we realize from this was it means sexual intercourse and there are various other verses which have prohibited sexual intercourse with people outside the marital bonds or if they are not what your right hand possesses if they are not your slave woman as allah says in the quran in surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 32 come not close to adultery sinner of fornication for it is an evil opening other roots to evil so based on this verse of the quran the other group of scholars they say that this verse specifically refers to sexual intercourse that means sexual intercourse is only permitted with your wife and with what your right hand possesses otherwise it doesn't mean other things so if you agree the meaning of this word is only restricted to sexual intercourse then masturbation is not included in this verse so that's the reason scholars differ and according to ibn hasan he says that our beloved prophet has permitted a person to touch his private part and the hadees it says touch with your left hand no problem it is your organ you can touch he also says that it is your fluid you can emit it if you want so based on that he says when the prophet has permitted to touch your private organ and that is what you do in masturbation it is self stimulation so surely it is permitted and masturbation is of two types one is stimulation the other type of masturbation is your spouse or your sexual partner is stimulating you and no scholar ever says that your wife or your spouse is not permitted to touch your private part so based on this surely the other type of masturbation where your spouse touches permitted so when you can enjoy with your spouse touching your private part then why can't you do it yourself so based on the second group of scholars which in lesson number they say that this was does not include masturbation at all it is just talking about sexual intercourse so sexual intercourse is only permitted with your wife with your spouse and with what your right hand possesses it doesn't include masturbation so that's how the scholars differ there is another argument given by the first group of scholars who say that masturbation is prohibited and they call the hadith of a beloved prophet muslim which is mentioned in say buhari volume number seven hadith number five zero six six in which a beloved prophet muslim said that o young people whoever has the means to get married they should get married for it will help you to lower your kids and guard your modesty guard your private parts and it continues those who cannot marry they should fast for it will reduce your sexual desire so here the first group of scholars they say here the prophet said if you cannot marry you should fast the prophet did not say masturbation that's the reason masturbation haram now this logic to say that just because the prophet did not say masturbate doesn't make masturbation haram yes what we have to understand from this hadith that the young people should marry if they can if they cannot marry they should fast that means fasting is mustahab no way does it mean that masturbation is haram because it's not mentioned as haram suppose if i say that eat date it's good for nourishment and for energy and if the prophet says he did that does not mean eating mangoes haram it means eating dead is good in mustab the other fruits become moba so it is wrong to conclude from this hadith of say bukhari that masturbation is haram it is wrong logic because for haram they should be strong evidence from the quran or from say hadith so based on this the second group of scholars who say it is not haram they say there is no text at all anywhere in the quran this is the only verse with the scholars quote of sore mom menu chapter number 23 verse number five to seven which they say it doesn't include masturbation there's no clear-cut evidence it only speaks about sexual intercourse and there's no say hadith prohibiting masturbation there are some deif and maudu hadith we say masturbation is prohibited but that is not good enough for evidence so we come to the second group of scholars and we'll discuss what they say they believe that masturbation is mahru amongst them is ibn abbas mallaby peace with him who was the companion of the prophet there is a person who comes to him and says that i have been masturbating he says that masturbation is better than fornication marriage is better than masturbation that means the call the verdict of ibn abbasman allah be pleased with him who was the close companion of the prophet muhammed according to him marriage is better than masturbation masturbation is better than fornication indirectly it means that surely masturbation is permitted but it is macro the best is marriage if you cannot marry then masturbate because it will prevent you from fornication so based on this the second group of scholars who say masturbation is permitted but comes in the mahru category is imam amin humble he's of the opinion that masturbation should not be done but if you're going to do fornication then you can do masturbation and he puts it in the makru category so the humbly school of thought most of them they say that masturbation comes under the makru category that means it's discouraged and this is also said by mujahid he says that masturbation it should be avoided but if it's done to prevent fornication or xena it is permitted this is the view even of ibn hasan that ibn hasam says that masturbation is macro it's discouraged but if you're going to involve in fornication then better do masturbation it is permitted in such cases and he says that though masturbation is permitted it is not amongst the deeds of the noble people it's not the deeds of nobility that's for this saying that means the noble people normally don't do it so it is discouraged so that's the reason this group of scholars put it in the macro category there are many other scholars in this category time will not permit to discuss that the third group of scholars they put in the mobile category the students of ibn abbas some of the students they understood that ibn abbas has put masturbation in the makuru category and even they say it is macro but the other group of students of nebash malala be pleased with him they said that it is permitted without any condition amongst them we have jaffar bin said he was a tabayin malala mercy on him and he was the student of abn abbas may allah be pleased with him and his opinion is that masturbation is permitted there is no harm at all in doing it is mubarak there is no sin and the normal circumstance is permitted there is another tarbane by the name of amar bin dinar according to him also masturbation is permitted there is no restriction it comes under the mubarak category if you want to do it do it if you don't do don't do it it is in the moba category even the famous scholar imam shahani is very famous just 150 200 years back he was there and according to him also masturbation is muba it is permitted it is optional if you want to do it do it there is no sin if you don't do it also there is no problem it is under the moba category and even according to maradavi he says that masturbation is makru but depending upon the situation if it causes you trouble it comes under the ram category and he also goes on to say that if you fear you will do fornication masturbation becomes further that's his opinion so here you have three groups of scholars one group which is the majority saying it is haram based on the voice of sorry momentum chapter number 23 verse number five to seven whereas the second group of scholars say it is macro it's discouraged and the third group said is muba it is permissible it depends upon you according to me i being a medical doctor that in our medical college when i did my medicine they used to say that when you ask a person do you masturbate 99 percent will say yes and the remaining one percent they are lying anyway this is just a joke it's amongst the medical students it's not a fact but according to research today research tells us that amongst the males 95 percent masturbate amongst the females approximately 80 percent masturbate i am not saying that it is normal to masturbate but it is very common and there is a myth that which is there if you go to some of the islamic sites and those who believe in haram they say that masturbation causes blindness masturbation it causes nervous problem all these things are a myth in no way does masturbation cause blindness in no way does it cause a nervous problem yes if you do excessive masturbation they can be certain problem that is excessive masturbation and even medical science tells us if you do excessive sexual intercourse with your wife maybe 10 times a day even that will cause problem so excessive anything or excessive most of the things will cause you problem but normal masturbation medically doesn't cause any problem if you do masturbation according to medical science it is normal if you don't know also it is normal but the majority of the people are involved in masturbation but i'm not saying it is the norm but i am saying that majority people do it so based on what the scholars say and what medical science is i agree more with the second group of scholars and i would say that masturbation is macro it is discouraged to make anything haram you require a strong evidence from the quran or from say hadith and there is no evidence whatsoever the verse of the quran i do agree with the second group of scholars for example the number may not be pleased with him and the other group was called the boss may allah be pleased with him i believe in the past call that it is not haram and this verse of surah mommy noon chapter number 23 verse number 5-7 does not include masturbation it's not prohibited it is restricted to sexual intercourse and i put it because there's no evidence it will either come in the muba i put in the makuru because i agree with the call of ibn hassan that it is not the act of nobility but because majority of them may be involved in it and there is no evidence from the quran and the sunnah to prohibit it i put in the macro category everything the majority do is not correct for example today according to research 95 of the women in the western countries before they passed the university they involved in cena that does not mean not at all the quran is very clear-cut in surah israel chapter 17 verse number 32 that zina is prohibited it is haram majority do doesn't give it a sanction to make it halal but if there is no text in the quran or say hadith prohibiting it it becomes moba i put it into the macro category for various reasons one of the reasons it's not the act of the noble people number two that excessive masturbation is haram it can cause problems it can cause health problems it can cause psychological problems and most of the time masturbation is associated with haram activities most of the time masturbation is associated with pornography whether you're watching a blue film or a pornographic film or you are watching obscene photographs images here itself if it associates with haram activity that again becomes haram so if you associate masturbation with pornography or with obscene photographs it is haram and that is prohibited and it leads to that high chances that's the reason i would say that best is to avoid but if you cannot marry for various reasons that we have so the best would be you fast as was recommended by beloved prophet and say buhari volume number seven hadith number 5066 that oh young people whoever has the means to get married they should get married for it will help you to lower your gaze and guard a modesty and if you cannot marry then you fast it reduce sexual purge and this is scientifically proven that if you fast it reduces your urge of your sexual desires so the best is too fast but it not be possible to fast always and depending upon the levels of sociology that keeps on differing so based on this the mustaph is too fast but if you cannot or if that's not sufficient to suppress your desire and if you have to masturbate it is permitted it is not a sin there is no evidence anywhere in the quran or say hadith which says that if you masturbate you get a punishment the reason i'm saying this that i'm being a medical doctor i know that there are many muslims many of them hundreds who have come to me for consultation and they believe because of the views of most of the muslims they are good practicing muslims but they believe it is haram so they come to me and the similar what question was asked that he's tensed he's unhappy and he has got mental stress because they are good practicing muslims they pray five time salah but they realize and they think masturbation is haram so they get 10 stopped and worked up and this causes many a time big problem because they think it is haram and they are doing it and they have the guilty feeling this guilty conscious prevents them sometimes or many a time even to do good deeds it disturbs them in the salah it disturbed them in the ring of the quran so because of not knowing the fact what is there in the medical science today these people think it's haram it disturbs them so i would like to tell you that i'm not giving a blanket rule that do it i'm just telling you best avoid it but if you have sexual urges which you cannot suppress doing masturbation is not haram according to me it is permissible don't do it excessively once in a while no problem don't be mentally disturbed that's haram and as the question asked i have asked for forgiveness again i do it i repent again i do it so let me tell you that if you come into this category where you have sexual desire it keeps on differing from different people some people high sexual desires some people are medium some people have less so if you fall in the category of people who have high sexual desires and if you're not married and if you have to masturbate though it is makuru i would say it's discouraged but don't have the guilt feeling don't do it excessively don't do it along with pornography and i would go to the extent that if because of this you're going to do fornication or zina or adultery then according to me masturbation becomes mustafa and as mentioned by my mum humble and in abbas may allah be pleased with him that masturbation is better than fornication so normally according to me i would like to repeat i'm not giving a blanket permission all of you should do according to me masturbation comes in the makuru category best is to avoid it if you have the then if you're not married better that you fast if there is a head there then masturbation is permitted there is no sin there is no punishment you don't have to feel guilty and if you have the urge and if you think you'll fornication then build a masturbation and avoid fornication and marry as soon as possible we know that masturbation differs in different people even after marriage masturbation majority of the people masturbate 70 percent of the males after marriage they masturbate but of course by age it keeps on reducing marriage also reduces the more sexual intercourse you have it reduces so this is my view regarding masturbation avoiding is the best next option is fasting if you yet have the urges then it's permissible don't have the guilt feeling and see to it that you practice and stay on the quran sunnah or for your salah and do ibadah and inshallah tala that he keeps you on the straight path hope to answer the question"
