  "transcript": "so after a person is dead all his relatives and all they give money to the poor they feed the poor so that that Sabah goes to that person who is dead how far Islam says about that as far as when a person after he dies people do many charity Etc and that sabab Guru said it how far is it true there are two aspects of it if a person use charity if he gives charity he'll get the song but there are certain things that after a person dies only few things that really help him after dive one thing is the knowledge whatever he spread that's one thing the Good Deeds they are done for example he has opened hospital for free treatment people have been treated so that is and one of them is the children the righteous did done by the children how he trained them the Good Deeds they do will add on to his account otherwise account is closed person Drive account is closed a few things account runs the meter eight runs the knowledge that he has paid it's a good deeds he has done there are certain things for example a father was sick he could not go for Hajj he had the money but didn't have the health so you go there so certain things are done by the children the knowledge given by the parent to the children that's meter keeps on continuing and the Good Deeds they are done but a person dies they never knew anything didn't follow Islam and now you do something you do charity and build hospital for your father who was far away from Islam do you think you go to Jannah that was the rich people go to Jannah correctly right or wrong the prophet says fine it was the wish of your father and the father said from my wealth make a hospital when he dies he was far away from Islam never prayed never did anything and then you are a good Islamic person and you say I build husband him what the father's name is whatever it is this will not get many way closer to Jannah but what did you do you go because no bearer of Burden can bear the burden over therefore the Quran said in several places but that's the question"
