  "transcript": "and the next question is from danny nobody he's from cairo egypt i want to ask you about stock market what does the sharia say about trading in stocks as we know if we invest in long term it's halal how about trading for a short time for one hour for a day for a week i make sure that it's not gambling because i do analysis before buying and sell it after getting capital gain thank you dr zakir as far as can you invest in halal stock and can you do it for a short term for a day or for a week or for a few hours as far as if you want to invest in stock first you have to identify whether the stock that you're investing is halal there are various criterias of how to analyze whether the stock that you're purchasing the shares of your purchasing or companies halal or not number one the major activity of the company should not be haram it should not be dealing alcohol it should not be dealing in poke so the number one is it should it should not be a bank which is based on river the conventional bank the activity basic activity should not be haram number two there are various other criteria that the company should not take so much loan that the debt to the cash ratio is very high so there are fukahas and scholars who have devised that activity should not be haram and even the debt taken should be a minor percentage the various criteria so you have got indexes for example you have the dow jones index of islamic stocks so these people experts and they laid the criteria why these stocks are halal why these talks are not alar it's haram so if it is identified as a halal stock by an expert focahe in this field on islamic organization which is specialized you can invest in that in stock it's permissible the second part of the question can you invest for a short time for a few hours for a day for a week and i'm expert i'm not am not gambling because i am doing a calculation see when you buy shares is actually you are becoming a shareholder i am asking a simple question with all the calculation will you physically be a partner not shares physically be a partner of a business only for one hour and the answer is no will with all your calculations okay i want to be a partner for one no you cannot physically if you say that i want to share and become a partner for a day would you become of a company no you cannot so stock exchange gives us easy flexibility to buy shares but that does not mean you should gamble if it's done for a short period intentionally that i will sell it when it goes off give and you keep it for a few hours for or for a day or a few days it tend to point to gambling if it's done unintentionally then you want to keep it for few years and then you realize something market has crashed and then you want to sell it that's acceptable but from first you plan that i want to sell it as soon as it increases even if it's a few other not this is speculation and this is not permitted in islam so you can involve in stock if it's a halal stock halal share but don't speculate don't do it for fewer keep it for a long time"
