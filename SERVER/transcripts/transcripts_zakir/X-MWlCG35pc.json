  "transcript": "previously when automobiles were introduced the first time in India people did not know how to drive so whenever you purchased a car the company along with the car the company also gave you a driver once a naab a famous naab a very rich man he buys a car so along with the car the company also provides the driver one day in the morning the naab the rich multimillionaire he tells his driver I want to take my beam Saba I want to take my wife for shopping please get the car ready the driver replies naab s the car is not in working condition naab sa is very angry put the car back in working condition immediately so driver says to put the car back in working condition I require 10 L of milk 20 kgs of pure honey 30 kgs of pure ghee and 40 kg of rice that also basmati rice soab the rich multimillionaire he gives the driver 10 L of milk 20 C of pure honey 30 kg of pure ghee and 40 K of rice that also basmati rice top quality the driver gives it to his wife and within a few minutes the car is in working condition I'm asking you a question today if your driver tells you that to put the car in working condition he requires 10 L of milk 20 cages of pure honey 30 cages of pure ghee and 40 cages of basmati rice what will you do what will you do will you give it to him what will you do you will kick him out of the job even though you're not a mechanic you know how to drive the car you know very well that a car runs on gas and petrol it does not run on milk ghee rice you know very well even though you're not a mechanic you know the basics how a car functions similarly today if you know the basic message of our creator subhana wa ta'ala if you know what our creat almighty God has mentioned in his last and final instruction man of the Quran no one will take you for a ride you will understand your Dean much easier no one will make a fool out of you there are some people who tell me the brother Zak suppose if you're driving a car and if you have a temporary license temporary license this a kcha license in India temporary license and if you have an accident you the police will give you a small fine if you have a permanent license and if you have an accident the police will give you a bigger fine therefore if you don't read the Quran and if you don't understand the Quran and if you make any sin God will punish you less if you understand the Quran and then if you commit a sin then God will give you double punishment you know very good logic so why I don't understand the Quran you know behave like a person to have a temporary license and enjoy life no less punishment I told this brother for sake of argument I agree with you that a person who has a temporary license a person who has a kcha license if he has an accident maybe the police will find him with 1,000 rupees or $1,000 and if if a person who has a permanent license if he has an accident maybe the police will find him double 2,000 Rupees or $2,000 okay I agree with you but the point to be noted is that if a person who has a permanent license in one year the chances he'll have an accident is maybe one but a person who has a temporary license who has not learned driving well the Chan is he'll have an accident in one day maybe 50 so at the end of the year the person who has per license pays a fine of 1,000 rupes of $1,000 and a person who has a temporary license he pays the fine of $50,000 a person who has the temporary license pays $1,000 a person who has a permanent license pays $2,000 so if he has an accident once a year at the end of the year he pays a fine of $2,000 and a person who has a temporary license maybe he'll have 50 accidents in a year at the end of the year he pays a fine of $50,000 or $50,000 pleas"
