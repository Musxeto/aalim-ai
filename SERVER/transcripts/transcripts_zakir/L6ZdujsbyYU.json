  "transcript": "as far as the first category is concerned that is the actions and deeds of a Muslim related to himself it is the same irrespective whether that Muslim lives in a Muslim Society or a non-muslim society the actions and the Deeds are the same there are certain concessions given in certain situations but it does not differ whether whether the Muslim is living in a Muslim Society or the non-muslim society it is the same for example what is f what is compulsory for a Muslim in a Muslim Society is also f is also compulsory for a Muslim in a non-muslim society for example every Muslim has to believe and worship only one almighty God Allah subhana wa ta'ala irrespective whether he living in a Muslim Society or a non-muslim society he should believe in toed he should worship only one Allah subhana wa tala a Muslim has to pay five times a day minimum in a Muslim Society the same has to be done by that Muslim even if he lives in a non-muslim society fine there may be different situation in a Muslim Society there may be a mosque in every area there may be a mosque in Every Second Street which may not be the case in a non-muslim society but yet if a Muslim is living in a non-muslim society he has to offer five times Salah it is compulsory it is f if the mosque is not closed by or you have to travel long and he cannot do that he has to offer Salah maybe in his office or at home but Salah is f he he has no excuse to miss it a Muslim irrespective whether he's living in a Muslim or a non-muslim society he has to give zakat if he's entitled to give if he has a saving of more than the nisab level more than 85 gram of gold he or she should give 2.5% of that excess wealth of that saving every lunar year in charity a Muslim cannot say that he living in a non-muslim society and the standard of living is high or the place where he's living it is expensive therefore he will not give zakat if he has a saving of more than the nisab level 85 grams of gold he or she should give zakat every year a Muslim irrespective whether they living in a Muslim or a non-muslim society he has to fast in the month of Ramadan if the days are short in winter maybe the timings will be less if it's in summer where the days are long the timing of the fast would be longer but he has to fast compulsory he has no excuse if he lives in non-muslim society he has no excuse he has to fast similarly a Muslim if he has the means to perform Hajj if he's an adult he should at least perform Hajj once in his lifetime if he has the means health and money he has to offer Hajj there's no excuse even if he's living in a non-muslim society he may be living far away from Saudi Arabia from Makkah but if he has the means to travel that distance he has to offer Hajj at least once in his lifetime it is far in this way all the far all the actions and deeds which are compulsory for a Muslim in a Muslim Society is also compulsory in a non-muslim society a Muslim woman she has to do hijab irrespective whether she's living in a Muslim or non-muslim Society she has no excuse that she's living in non-muslim society that the reason she will not do hijab there's no excuse It's a f it has to be done in this way all the other fars being honest speaking the truth it is the same it does not differ similarly what is Haram for a Muslim in a Muslim Society is also Haram for a Muslim in a non-muslim society whichever part of the world he lives in shik is Haram he's living in a Muslim Society it's also Haram if he's living in a non-muslim society there's no excuse that because he's staying in a non-muslim society or a Western Country he can't do shik it's Haram throughout the world similar L fornication and adultery it is Haram for a Muslim irrespective whether he living in a Muslim or non-muslim Society irrespective which part of the world he lives in Pok is Haram whether he lives in a Muslim country or non-muslim country having non zabia food non-h halal food any meat which is not sorted by the Islamic method or which Quran does not give permission to it is har irrespective whether he living in a Muslim or non-muslim Society in short whatever is far and whatever is Haram for a Muslim it is the same throughout the world irrespective whether he living in a Muslim or a non-muslim society there are many Muslims who give excuse that because I'm living in a western country or because I'm living in non-muslim society some things are excused what is f is f what is Haram is Haram and as far as the other aspects are concerned regarding must things which are encouraged those which are considered as Sunnah must which is encouraged it is the same also but there may be a little bit leniency for example covering the head for a Muslim man or wearing a cap is must it is a Sunnah of the prophet but if you feel that are living in a non-muslim society and you feel that wearing a cap May endanger your life and if you want to avoid that act you can do it because wearing a cap is not F than Islam if you do it you will get plus points if you don't do it you have no loss but you will not get the plus points so living in a non-muslim society the things is must if you fear regarding certain aspects and you avoid it you will not get the plus points similarly things which are maku things which are discouraged or the same throughout the world but they can be little bit leniency for example going for the call of nature standing and doing the call of nature it is Mak but if you know living in a western country and the toilets may not permit you and if you do it there is no problem but you will lose the plus points you don't gain negative points so as far as the F and the harams are concerned there is no excuse at all as far as the other aspects are concerned about the Sunnah and the makru if you want to avoid it for certain reason you can do it you will not get negative points but you will lose the positive points this was in short regarding the first category of a behavior of a Muslim in a non-muslim society"
