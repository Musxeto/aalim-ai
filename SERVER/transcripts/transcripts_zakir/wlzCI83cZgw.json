  "transcript": "i welcome all the viewers of the peace tv network that is the peace tv english the peace tv urdu the peace tv bangla as well as the peace tv chinese as well as the people watching us on the social media platforms that is youtube facebook twitter and instagram i welcome all of you with islamic greetings may the peace mercy and blessings of allah subhanahu wa of almighty god be upon all of you inshallah we will be starting the session ask dr zakir and his son farik inshallah we will be starting season 3 session 4 and inshallah i will answer to the questions that you have posed so let's take the first question my question is will our duas be accepted and granted in this world there are certain conditions for a dua to be accepted the first is that we should ask allah subhanahu ta'ala directly about prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that when you ask help ask from allah so we should ask allah subhanahu wa ta'ala directly we should not ask through someone many people they go to the graves they asked the dead they think that these people they will intercede on their behalf but we should always ask allah subhana wa tala directly without any intercession allah subhana talah he is very close to us he is closer to us than a jugular vein and allah subhana wa tala says in surah baqarah chapter number 2 186 and when my servant calls upon me say i am near i respond to the call of the supplicant so we should ask allah directly the second is we should know the greatness of allah we should know how great allah subhanahu ta'ala is if we know the greatness of allah subhanahu ta'alah we will be sincere in our dua and our supplication the third is that we should not be hasty in our supplication about prophet muhammad peace be upon him he said that allah subhana he responds to the person as long as he is not hasty so we should not be hasty but rather we should be patient when we are asking anything from allah the fourth is that we should not involve in sins especially the major sins the more sins we do the lesser chances that adva it will be accepted and the fifth is that our income it should be halal we should not involve in things that are haram our food should be halal what we drink it should be halal abdullah prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that when a person goes on a long journey and he's tired and exhausted and he calls on to his lord but the food that he eats is haram what he drinks is haram what he wears is haram how will allah respond to him so our income it should be halal so inshallah if you follow these few criteria there are high chances that it will be accepted now as you said in your question that will adwa be accepted in this world there are three ways in which adva are accepted the first is that we are granted what we ask for in this world the second is that we get something better in the hereafter and the third is that a calamity that was going to befall us it will not befall us so whenever a dua it is not answered in this world we should always have patience and we should have hope in allah that he will respond to us in the hereafter or a calamity that was going to befall us it will not be for us and many a times when adva it is not answered there is good in it for example you ask allah subhana wa tala for a bike for a motorcycle allah subhana tala knows that if he gives you a motorcycle if he gives you a bike you will meet with an accident and you will die so allah subhanahu ta'ala does not give you a bike so there is good in it so many times allah subhanahu ta'ala does not give what you ask for because there is good in it so we should always have hope in allah and even if our prayers they are not answered in this world but inshallah in the year after our prayers it will be answered and a believer he always has hope in allah subhana wa tala he always needs to dua ask allah subhanahu ta'ala for whatever he needs if his dwarves are not answered in this world he will definitely have his share in the hereafter and he will have something better in the hereafter we all human beings we should strive for the afterlife for the hereafter and if we don't get what we want in this world we will have a better share in the hereafter so we pray to allah subhanahu talaha may he give us the best in this world and the best in the hereafter and save us from the punishment of the hellfire"
