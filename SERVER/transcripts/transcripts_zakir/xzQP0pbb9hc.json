  "title": "The True Follower of Any Religion is He who Follows its Scripture - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Das Anthony Das and I am a trainer by profession my question is like this doctor mentioned about Universal Brotherhood and Doctor also mentioned that the similarities uh the way we see God uh he mentioned various religion I I would just like to ask this will it be okay for people of a different faith let's say Christians can Christians uh refer to the the their gods or The God as Allah brother ask a very good question that can people of other Faith refer to their God as Allah the answer was given in my lecture that if the God who you call as Allah fits in this four line definition you can refer otherwise you can't and I gave you a sample a test that there are some human beings in the world who call bhagan rajish to be God now when you put bhagan to the test of surlas it fails so if you call bhagan as Allah it is totally wrong the same way the god you worshiping which God do you worship as I from the Christian faith according to Christian faith I'm a student of compared religion I know what Bible says I studied the Bible I can quote the Bible from my mind I'm asking you who do you believe to be be God the creator of Earth yes Creator no problem but do you believe Jesus to be God Jesus is a Son of God Son of God if God has son then he's not [Applause] God Bible has got Sons by the Tongue if you read the Bible Adam was Son of God Aphra was Son of God Isel was Son of God all those who are led by the spirit of God are sons of God in that idiom any one who followed the Commandment of God is a Godly person in that way I've got no problem in Hindi we say bet is so no problem beta but someone say J that means he's insting so only calling Son of God is a good word but if you say begotten son do you believe Jesus is begotten son Jesus is the son of God the Son of God even ephra is Son of God Israel is Son of God so do you mean that Ephraim and Israel the same as Jesus peace be upon him I think uh it would not be fair to question in that manner because if you were to see Christianity from a Christian point of view not Christian point of view I see Christianity according to Bible point of view if you want to if you want to understand any religion go to the scriptures if you want to understand Islam don't look at me don't look at Muslims you analyze the Quran and the say had if you want to understand Christianity you have to study the Bible if I have to understand Hinduism I have to study The Vedas and the other scriptures so what you have to know that as a student of comparative religion I'm a student of comparative religion I've studied the Bible I've studied the V I've studied the Quran and we have question answer session for people to correct us if you disagree with me you have a right to disagree but you have to tell me why so I've given the talk here and I know the concept of God according to Bible very well I'm not bothered what the church says because for me Bible is important not the church so similarly as far as the question is concerned you can call the god you worship as Allah if your God fits in this forline definition so in this forline definition even your Jesus Christ peace be upon does not fit and even Jesus Christ peace be upon father does not fit because God cannot have son so both of them you cannot call us God hope that anwers the question so doctor you disqualify Christians from calling Allah simply because the fact that Christians believe that Jesus is a Son of God so that the reason if he the Son of God begotten son I disqualify because this statement what you say son of of God is referring to your Bible Gospel of John chapter number 3 verse number 16 I'm quoting and you know that very well Gospel of John chapter number 3 vers number 16 says God so of the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not die but have everlasting life doctor the way you are seem to be answering my question the spirit you answering my question uh the Ence you answering my question doesn't seem to be promoting this Brotherhood between you and me it is putting a separation between you correct because if you go against the Bible I will separate from you if you are towards the Bible I'm with you anyone any human being who wants to create disharmony because he's going away from his scripture I will not agree with him because you are going away from the scripture and going towards your church I'm saying go back to your Bible you quote the Bible I'm giving references what you are saying is just out of your own mind now if you try and take the Christians away from the Bible I will not agree with you you quote the Bible and you quote the verses what Jesus Christ peace be upon who spoke there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he said worship me and I told you if any Christian anyone in kale or in Malaysia or anywhere in the world shows me from any version of the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he says worship me I Dr zakin n I'm ready to Christianity if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves Jesus Christ peace be upon Him according to the Gospel of John he was circumcised on the eight day brother are you circumcised no I'm not I'm circumcised so I'm following the teachings of Jesus Christ or you if you read the Bible it's mentioned in the book of Ephesians chapter number 5 verse number 18 don't have alcohol it's mention the Book of Proverbs Chapter number 20 verse number one that do not be drunk with wine brother do you have alcohol I don't I have never tasted alcohol in my lifetime but the Christians as a whole have or not say again the Christians have as a whole or not I haven't I'm asking the Christians as a whole I haven't the Christian as a whole do they have or not I haven't I would not want to speak for other Chris fine you don't do you have book say again do you have po yes I have okay now I'm quoting you if you read the Old Testament if you read the book of Deuteronomy chap number 14 verse number 8 in the book of Isaiah CH 65 verse number 2 to5 in The Book of Leviticus chapter number 11 vers number 7 and 8 it says you should not have foke I don't have F you have F if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves I'm promoting communial Harmony I'm quoting your Bible and Jesus Christ peace be upon him said in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17 to 20 if you break one jot a tit from the Old Testament you shall never go to Paradise one law if you break off the Old Testament you shall not go to paradise I am more Christian than the Christian themselves I can go on and on I can go on and on talking about the similarities there are differences I'm not here to talk about differen I'm talking similarities but the problem is if you say Bible is the word of God why aren't you following the Commandments of the Bible why so this is the problem with the followers that when they want to follow the scripture what my solution is Simple Solution one simple solution I tell that at least believe that one book is the word of God so Christian would not mind okay fine I agree Bible is the word of God the Hindu will say I don't mind believing V to be the word of God the Muslim will say I don't mind believ in Quran to be the word of God I tell them let us agree to follow what is common in all these three scriptures what is different will discuss tomorrow right or wrong we will discuss tomorrow let us agree today that let us follow 100% what is common in all these three scriptures as I told in my lecture that all these scriptures talk about one God this God has got no images he has got no picture no portrait no father no mother I have given quotations from the Old Testament from the New Testament I have given quotations from the Old Testament New Testament from the vas from the Quran Point number one let us agree there is one God worship him alone not Trinity not trun God one God next I had given the talk yesterday inaro Muhammad sallah Ali wasallam in the major world religious scriptures Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam is not only mentioned in the Quran he's prophesized in the Old Testament in the New Testament in the Hindu scriptures in The Vedas in the upanishad in the puranas he prophesized in the fari scriptures in the Buddhist scriptures let us agree to believe that Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger so easy all the scriptures say don't have alcohol Bible say don't have alcohol Quran say don't have alcohol the Hindu scripture Manus say don't have alcohol let's stop having alcohol so easy Bible says do hijab all the ladies should do hijab they should cover their head only you see nuns and mother Mary you know mother Mary Mother Mary her photograph is just like a muslima properly covered but when you see the other ladies no if you read the first Corinthians 1 Corinthians chap number 11 verse number five and six it says the woman that does not cover a head she dishonors a head her head should be shaved off even in Islam in Quran it doesn't say that the woman who uncovers the head should be shaved off this is how strict the Bible is for the woman to cover a head but most of the Christian women we see the head covered so I'm trying to get communial Harmony not Discord so please don't come here and say things which are wrong say again please don't come and lay allegation against me I'm bringing correlationship I am bringing communial Harmony that's a different thing that you want to go away from your Bible I want to get you closer to your Bible thank you now now I feel that it is not fair just because you follow certain things in the Bible you become more Christian than Christians I follow a lot of things which is also in the Muslim faith and I know a lot of things the Muslims don't follow in the Muslim faith I'm sure you would agree with me but would that make me more Muslim than Muslims there is not a single statement you can give in the Quran as a whole not you may be better than one individual Muslim he is a namesake Muslim Muslim means a person who submits his will to God if he says he submits and he does not submit he's a pseudo Muslim he will not go to Jenna he will not go to Jenna just by saying that I'm a Muslim will not take him to Paradise I will openly say that unlike in your Christianity that you believe Jesus Christ peace be upon Him died for your sins according to your church and you go to Heaven that's not part of the Bible That's the teaching of the church so I'm here to promote communial Harmony to let people know and what I'm telling is quotation directly you tell me what is common you tell me one thing in the Quran which I don't follow show me one thing tell me one thing one thing in the Quran I see I can see something common in what both of us are saying sorry one I can see something common there are many things common not something common I can see something common I can see I can see I didn't say you can see I said that I can I can see something common in what both of us are seeing I can see that there are some Christians who do not follow Christianity as as well as they should and I can see there are some Muslims who do not follow what Islam teaches as they should not some Christians according to statistics majority Christians don't follow according to statistics today there are 7 billion people in the world the people who profess the Christian faith they may be close to two billion the people that profess the Islamic faith more than one and a half billion but the people who follow the majority in the world are Muslims majority the Christians they they they don't follow so as a whole the religion we have black sheeps in our community but as a whole the religion which is maximum followed the teachings of any religion that is Islam I know there are black sheep in the community there are many black sheep but as a whole as a percentage today's statistics tell us the religion which is maximum followed the teachings based on the Quran on the scripture is number one Islam that's the reason today the fastest going religion in the world is Islam brother what's your if you have any question you can POS a question or go behind the queue yes brother POS your question shall I okay I just like to end by saying I would like to say that okay I rephrase there are some Christians who are not following the Christian doctrine there are some Muslims who do not follow the Muslim Doctrine I would like End by saying say however I would not want to boost my ego by saying I am more Muslim than Muslims thank you sir brother said there are some Christians who don't follow not some Christian majority people who claim to be Christians are not following the Bible according to statistics and I do agree that there are some Muslims who are Black Sheep who are not following those who don't follow the scripture those who go against the Quran they are not true Muslims they may be part or they may be Pudo but you can never say never ever can you say until you accept that there's one God and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God you can never claim to be better than the Muslims [Applause]"
