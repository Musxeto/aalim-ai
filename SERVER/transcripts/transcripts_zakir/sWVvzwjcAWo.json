  "transcript": "where should a woman pray I think we've answered partly on this question at home or in the Masjid if she prays at home can she lead the congregation or a Congregation of women it's mentioned in number 336 where the Beloved Prophet said that the best mosque for a woman is her inous room inous chamber and the best place for a woman to pray is her Inner Room that's the best and in another Hadith of mus Ahmed volume number six Hadith number 27202 which also mentioned in Hadith number 335 once a lady asked the prophet I would love to pray with you the lady said and the prophet replied I know you'd love to pray with me but your prayer in Your Inner Room would be better than praying in your house the prayer in your house would be better than praying in the courtyard you're praying in your courtyard would be better than praying in the mosque where you live where around your people your praying in the mosque where you live around with people is better than praying in my mosque so that means for a woman the best prayer is the inner room and the way that praying in your room is better than the house house better than the courtyard Courtyard better than the mosque in your area the mosque in better than the mosque of the Prophet though the prophet said it's mentioned in say Muslim number two Hadi number 3 to10 that praying in my mosque is equivalent to a th000 prayers that m pray the mallam it's equal to praying a thousand times in any of the MOs but this Hadith is mainly referring to the men because no to can contradict so this had mainly refer to the men for the woman the best place is the house especially her in her room and there's a Hadith in AB volume number one book of Salah number 591 May pleas with her mean she comes to the prophet and says that I would like to have a m in my house and the prophet gave her permission the next Hadith number one number 592 it says that s wasallam he went to a house after appointing the mtin and he asked her to lead the prayer in congregation and the woman in the house they joined her and the narator says that he saw the M then he was the old person it's further mentioned in ath ofak Hadith number 19 1922 AA pleas with her who the wife of the Prophet she says that she led the congregation of the woman she was the Imam but she stood in the middle of the road and another had in number 4953 who was also the wife of the prophet with her even she said that she led she was the IM of a Congregation of woman and she was standing in the center of the first room so here it indicates that the women they can pray but it is better for them to pray in the Inner Room better than going in the mosque but they are permitted to go in the mosque as we discussed yeah earlier yesterday that praying in the mosque is permitted but for them the Inner Room is better than the house the house is better than Courtyard Courtyard better than the mosque close to them than the mosque of the Prophet but they can pray they can go to the mosque if they pray at home they can have a congregation there's no problem at all and a woman can lead the congregation according to the way"
