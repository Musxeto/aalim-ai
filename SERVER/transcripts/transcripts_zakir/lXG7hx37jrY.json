  "title": "Can a Muslim have an Account in an Interest Based Bank? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "is it permissible for a muslim to put his savings in an interest or riba bearing account or bank for safety purposes if he or she pays the interest that he earns out in charity most of the scholars they say that if under compulsion especially if you're a non-muslim country and for safety reason you can keep your money in the interest based conventional bank but whatever interest you get you have to give in charity without seeking the reward of allah because it's haram most of the scholars say that but i personally i disagree with them that's my view i agree more with the view of sheikh me he says that even this is prohibited because the quran does not say do not use interest if the quran would have said do not utilize do not use interest then the verdict was right the quran said don't involve in rabah don't take don't give so if you have to give in charity first have taken from the bank so disagree with that if you have to stop the system of rabbah you have to totally ban the system we can't see the put for safety and then i'll take them in and give on charity indirectly encouraging them because the moment you open an account which has got interest you are signing and giving them permission that you are agreeing with interest with rava that itself is a sin so allah's curse will be on you allah the soul will wage a war against you because ask this question and i say to these people who say that you can put in the bank and given charity that suppose i deal in drugs in cocaine in brown sugar and suppose i invest a billion dollars every month i make a profit of billion dollars and the complete profit i give in charity to the poor people so now is it allowed they say no sarah i said why because dealing in drugs cocaine brown sugars so when dealing in drugs cocaine brown sugar is haram riba is a bigger haram because if you deal in rabbah allah and rasool will wage a war against you so when you are giving me permission to keep in the bank and deal with riba for a bigger sin surely he should give me permission for a smaller sin so therefore i disagree that if they really want to keep for safety they can very well keep an islamic bank or as a last resort they can keep in a current account there are some accounts in the bank which are accounts which don't give interest they call this current account there is no interest at all in that that as a last resort you can keep but only keep that money which is required for only because i know that being in different countries like in india in uk you have to deal with checks etc so if you're a businessman keep only that much amount which is required for holi otherwise you can invest it in property in real estate and stock whatever it is and the least if you want for security you can take a locker and keep hard cash in the bank i know it's foolish but yet it is better than revolving in rabbi at least you'll be safe from online as a soul they'll wage a war against you as a last resort if you really want only security take a locker which will cost just a few hundred rupees a month or a couple of thousand rupees a year and a few pounds if you go to uk take that locker keep your money hard cash declare to the government no problem but give hard cash if you really want security but taking rabbah and even giving in charity because encouraging the system of rabbi i consider that to be haram okay i mean in the uk alhamdulillah we do have a few banks now coming up by the way so allah help us to encourage those organizations to do non-interest made these organizations be on the straight path i mean i'm stated that they're truly interested in inshallah inshallah"
