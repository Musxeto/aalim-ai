  "title": "Why is an Insane Person Exempted from Fasting? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "oh that's beautiful next question very important one one of the categories you've mentioned an insane person is exempted but why is this the insane person is exempted because the same hadith earlier a beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned hadith of hadith number 143 that the pen is lifted from three categories of people a child till he reaches puberty a person who sleeping till he wakes up and a person is insane till they become the sound mind so this the prophet has exempted and they are free from fasting the reason is because one of the criteria for the fasting to be accepted is near his intention an intention can only be made by a person who's sane who's sound in mind only if we sound can he willingly intend to fast if he's insane he cannot so that's the reason if an insane person whether he fast or not it doesn't make a difference at all it is he's exempted and once he becomes sane he does not have to compensate also for the fastest because he's not responsible for that he's not held responsible so that's the beauty of islam they only held responsible those people who should be held responsible only those people who have got the responsibility to make the intention knowingly okay"
