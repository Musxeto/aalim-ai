  "title": "Pooja Asks Dr Zakir, \"Quran is Corrupted as it says Sperm is Produced between Backbones\"",
  "transcript": "the first question that we have is from puja pradeep quran faith sperm is produced in between backbones how is it possible that means the quran is corrupted the sister asked the question that the quran says that human beings are created from sperm which is emitted from the backbones and this is not possible so quran is corrupted what the sister is referring to is a verse in your quran from chapter number 86 verse number five six and seven well last name that let man think from what he's created he is created from a drop which is emitted from a space between the backbone and the ribs but the sister may not be aware that she may not be aware of the medical knowledge and if you refer to any book on embryology or human development these standard books will tell you that a human being in the embryonic stages while the development takes place in the womb of the mother when the human being is a fetus originally the the organs the reproductive organs in the male the testes they originate from a space which is same as that of the kidney between the backbone and the 11th and 12th rib so this is the origin of the gonads of the ovaries and the testes which are the reproductive organs and later on these these reproductive organs the descent in the female it descends to the true pelvis and in the male via the inguinal canal it goes into the scrotum but even in the adult life after the reproductive organs have descended to the position yet they received the blood supply from the space from the same space where the kidney is present between the backbone and the 11th and 12th rib and even the venous return goes back to the same space even the nerves come from the same space so alhamdulillah at a time when medical science wasn't advanced and you did not know that 1400 years ago the quran mentions about the scientific fact which we came to know now and yet most of the human beings who don't know about medical science don't know so it was the ignorance of sister puja that because she's unaware of the medical science she thinks that the quran is corrupted alhamdulillah the glorious quran is the last and final word message of almighty god allah which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him it was revealed 400 years ago so imagine what science came to know yesterday 40 years back 50 years back 100 years back the quran mentioned 1400 years ago so this is one of the proofs that there is not a single scientific mistake in the quran and there are so many things what the quran mentioned that science has come to know about it today so this is one of the proofs and signs that quran is from our creator almighty god allah hope that answers the question"
