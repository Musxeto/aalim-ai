  "transcript": "mashah our brother VI is very learned read the Quran [Applause] masallah has read the Quran and I do agree with him Sur Bak he's quoting the ver of the Quran from Sur Bak chapter number 2 verse number 34 he says we told to the angels bow down all bow down except El this is mentioned not only in Surah Bak it is mentioned minimum seven times in the Quran in Surah chapter number 7 Surah chapter number 15ah chapter number 18 thing we told to the angels bow down all bowed down except so now objected so from this we come to know that El if you read the translation we understand was a angel we think but if you read in Surah chapter number 18 verse number 15 it says that we asked to the angels bow down all bow down except El was amongst the Gin you understand so was a gin so now you tell me brother Z seven places Allah said to the angels bow down all bow down except means angel now one place in the Quran says he was a Jin so there's a contradiction correct it's a contradiction because this is a translation in Arabic language there is a law called as law of t t means if the majority is addressed the minority need not be addressed for example if there are 99 doctors and one engineer and if I say all doctors stand up even that engineer will stand up because in the law of T in Arabic grammar the majority is address minority I need not say all doctors and one engineer stand up but in English language if I say all doctors stand up only doctors will stand up that one engineer will not stand so nowhere does the Quran say that El was an angel nowhere we because of the translation and lack of Arabic knowledge we think we assume many of the Muslims also assume but the Quran clarifies in Surah 18 verse number 50 that was a Jin and Jin like the human beings have a free will so amongst the Angels there was one Jin also present who was El he was very Pious but his arrogance that why should I bow down to Adam he's made from mud I'm made from fire arrogance that made him disobey almighty God he was a gin even human beings and Jin both have a free will they can disobey God so here they disobey God and that's the reason he was taken out and he is the biggest Satan and now he tries to attract the people who are in the path of God and tries distract them from the remembrance of Allah subh I hope answer the question"
