  "transcript": "what is the maximum number of days as a traveler that he can stay in a given City continuously and be Exempted from his fast for instance he goes on to say um if he's a student he's giving the game away here if he's a student and he's traveled abroad for 2 months is he Exempted from his fast in Ramadan most of the scholars what they say that what is the ruling for Salah when a person travels as Hadith accorded earlier that our beloved Prophet wasam said mentioned in MA Hadith number 1667 that our beloved Prophet says that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has Exempted a person from fasting and half of this prayers when he's traveling and Exempted a woman from fasting ing when she's pregnant Etc so the ruling what is there for Salah as a traveler it is the same as for a person who's fasting and most of the fuk most of the scholars who the difference opinion but as for Salah they say that maximum person can stay in a city in one place after he has left his own Hometown is for 4 days so most of the scholars they agree that same thing is for fasting that maximum they can stay in a city and can be considered as a traveler is for 4 days if they extend then they not be considered as a traveler though there difference opinion in different schools of thought but the majority consider this coming to the second part of the question that if a person goes for studies and stays in a foreign land maybe for 2 months or 3 months or several months together will he be considered as a traveler no in this condition he's staying for a long time for months together as far as fasting is concerned he will have to fast all the obligatory fast of the month of Ramadan next question if a fasting person he's been fasting the whole day decides to travel in the afternoon he starts his travel in the afternoon is it compulsory on him to break his fast or is it optional what is the best solution for him if a person starts the travel midday or in the afternoon and if he's in the hometown till afternoon it becomes f for him to keep the fast at least in that time only time a traveler is permitted to break the fast is when he leaves the home town if he decides that he's going to leave in the afternoon it's not possible that he does not fast in the morning he has to fast in the morning because there can be change of plans if he decide in the afternoon he may change his plan so then it will be a sin on him so if a person is traveling the only time he can break the fast is when he leave the city limits until he hasn't left he should not break so if he leave the city limits in the afternoon he's permitted to break not that he should break but if he feels there's no hardship he can continue fasting and complete his fast it's optional on him okay excellent next question is from one of our viewers who was a pilot and he considered himself to be in a Perpetual state of travel every day he's traveling on the plane um long distances and um he's asking is he Exempted there from all fasts if a person's profession is such that he a pilot or if he's a sailor and he has to travel and if he leaves his hometown and if he's gone away so but naturally he's consider as a travel he's Exempted from fasting but he has to make up his fast before the next of Ramadan so if he travels a lot then you have to fast in the holidays mhm whatever holidays he gets and when he station in home term so if he does not want to fast he's Exempted because considered as a traveler but he'll have to make up the fast as soon as possible before the next Ramadan unless you start on a very long flight maybe from India to New York which is more than 12 hours but if the the flight is a short flight I don't think so there'll be problem"
