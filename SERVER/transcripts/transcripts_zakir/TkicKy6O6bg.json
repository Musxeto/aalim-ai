  "title": "Overall, Men and Women are Equal, but Each has a Degree of Advantage in Certain Aspects - Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "and have to repeat the example given by my son that if in a class two students A and B both get 80 out of 100 both come out first in the class and if you analyze the answer sheet there are 10 answers to 10 questions in answer to question number one student a gets n out of 10 and student b gets s out of 10 so student a had the degree of advantage over B in answer number one in answer to question two student b gets n out of 10 and student a gets s out of 10 so in answer to question number two student B has the degree of advantage over a all the remaining answers from question number three to question number 10 all the remaining eight answers both A and B get eight out of 10 so if you add up student a also gets 80 out of 100 student B also gets 80 out of 100 but student a has advantage over B in answer number one and student B has the advantage over a in answer number two but overall both are equal similarly in Islam men and women are equal but equality doesn't mean identicality in some aspects the men have a degree advantage in some aspects the women have a degree advantage"
