  "title": "Rahul Asks Dr Zakir, “Quran is Unscientific as it says Humans Created from Congealed Clot of Blood”",
  "transcript": "hi just one more question in the quran 96 chapter number two it says created man out of a mere clot of congealed blood i was listening to uh the hindi translation urdu translation of this as well a few days ago and it did say that now we know that uh like this this is common knowledge now that it's that we're actually not born from a you know drop of blood it's a drop of semen so i do see a translation of another verse it says then fashion we the drop in brackets semen a clot of congealed blood then fashion we the clot a little lump so that means it puts the blood in the second stage but but i don't think blood comes towards the later stages of you being a doctor can probably throw more life sure was the right person quran says chapter 16 verse 43 chapter number 21 verse number 7 if you don't know ask the person who knows i'm not very knowledgeable but in these few things i'm knowledgeable i'm not a knowledgeable person i'm just a student of comparative religion and i'm just a small doctor mbbs but this is my field of speciality this same argument was given by dr william campbell there's a person by the name of dr william campbell who's a medical doctor and got a phd writing a book against the quran he wrote a book saying there are 13 scientific errors in the quran and for eight years no muslim replied so the american student they called me for a debate and i went to u.s and chicago a few years back and we had a debate on the topic the bible and the quran in the light of science and one of his arguments for the same what do you post that the first two verses of the quran to be revealed chapter 96 verse number one and two he says read recite a proclaim in the name of thy lord who created who created man from a kanji cloth of blood he said that this was basically copied the greeks first thought that human beings are made from blood it's an old theory which is proved wrong and as a medical doctor no yes human beings are not made from blood so prophet muhammad peace be upon him he did a research he copied from this series who copied from that greek and a big list he made research and he said see prophet muhammad he copied from the syrian from this and he gave a big lineage where he got it from his research his phd did he's a phd doctor and a medical doctor then he further goes to say that all the translation you read it says blood blood blood but latest some of the muslims translate alaka as a leech-like substance he knew it which i don't know he knew it but in defense he's saying we have to take the meaning what was present at the time of revelation of the quran we can't take a meaning which is understood today at the time the quran was revealed no one understood it as leech and his right therefore all the contemporary the fossils you read all say blood none of them say alaka is leech like substance which we agree allah has got three meanings a kanji clot of blood something which links and a leash like substance and prophet keith moore was shown this verse of the quran he goes under a microscope he says i don't know it looks like a leech he observed the early stages of embryo in a microscope and compared it with a photograph of a leech and he was shocked at the striking exact resemblance so today medical science confirms that the embryo looks like a leech but his argument is you have to take the meaning what was prevalent that time not today and he gives the example that quran says and the bible says don't have pig but today in america pig also refers to a policeman so would you say quran says don't date a policeman and the people try to laugh i couldn't say anything because he was speaking i have to follow the rule but my turn came to speak and i said what dr william campbell says is correct as far as the bible is concerned because the injeel was revealed only for that time and for those people so whatever meaning was revel in that time you have to take but the quran was not revealed only for the muslims or the arabs only for that time it was revealed for the whole of humanity until eternity so you have to take all the meanings from the time of revelation till the day of judgment all the meaning should be taken into consideration can be one is correct can be all are correct and this william campbell he's practiced in morocco he even knows arabic as a language so doctor medical doctor md i am only mbbs he is better than me writing a book against md quran no the arabic language i don't know arabic of the language so we had a debate so i said as far as the bible is concerned fine only the meaning where it is revealed has to be taken for the quran all the meanings and what meaning is today he has no objection because professor keith moore who is one of the highest authority at that time in the field of embryology he confirmed and wrote in his new edition that the embryo looks like a leech so you cannot object but we also know that the second meaning it clings something which cling is correct because the embryo clings to the uterine wall the latest research also says that in the initial stages in the embryo the blood does not circulate so it looks like a congenital clot so even the conjunct is correct which science has testified today what the quran says that it made from a congealed clot by appearance it looks like a kanji clot by function it links to the uterine ball and by shape it even looks like a leech so alhamdulillah all three are correct even kanji cloth is correct even something which clings as well as leash like substance hope that answers the question [Music]"
