  "transcript": "the brother asked a question that during the riots which took place in mombay 1992 and 1993 many people were afraid of the lives and many people remove the label so is it right to remove the label during such things every rule has an exception and the Quran clearly mentions that if under compulsion if under compulsion unwillingly you can even do sh for example if someone puts a gun on your temple on your head and ask you are you a Muslim or a mush deep within your hearts you know that I'm a Muslim but to save your life under compulsion at the last result the Quran gives you an option that you can tell a lie in this situation if life and death is the question only this situation similarly if during rights you're living in a non-muslim area and suppose if you step out and your life will be in danger in such situation if you remove your label inshallah Allah will forgive you for example if in a Right Round the Corner a non-muslim puts a gun on your temp Muslim or non-muslim you have option of saying you're a Muslim and become sh or say I'm a non-muslim and get saved both is allowed if around the corner no one is watching me what the use I have option of either say Muslim become sh or say I'm a non-muslim Quran gets permission so here if a person says I'm a non-muslim and saves his life so that he can prep Islam afterwards alhamdulillah similarly if someone ask me on a stage where there are hundreds and thousands of people watching me are you Muslim or non-muslim here also have the option both of either saying I'm Muslim or non-muslim but here the may say that if I give shahada there are hundreds and thousands of people watching me it may boost up the moral I may prefer saying I'm a Muslim and become Shah alhamdulillah so Quran gives both the permission and the compulsion like the Quran says in Surah Bak CH number 2 vers 173 ma number 5 vers number 3 in 6 ver 145 and in chter number 16 ver 115 that if unwillingly if you disobey Allah subhana wa ta'ala Allah is Rahman that after saying that pork is forbidden for you if unwillingly if you're dying of hunger if poke is the only thing you can find if you have gone in a boat and you have no food and someone offers you poke for a survival you can eat that much which is sufficient for you to survive not eat your tummy full but the moment you come on the shore again it becomes prohibited so to save your life Islam gives permission under compulsion unwillingly to disob Allah subhana wa ta'ala Allah is Rahman here you have an option that if you feel your life is in danger or you cannot bear the mental torture no problem but alhamdulillah I do know that there are few people who remove the label and many of them the moment that M became cordial they vote the label again but I know of hundreds of Muslims who did not wear the label before the rights but after observing the rights the moral was boosted and they started wearing the label I personally know of hundreds of Muslim alhamdulillah who after the rights were the label seeing that okay this was the situation we were in a problem we should identify ourselves as Muslims the moment the mental shock of the RS was over alhamdulillah many Muslims were the label after the rights hope that answerers the question"
