  "title": "\"The Mughals tampered the Hindu scriptures. Myth or Reality?\" - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "i've been introduced to you by my sir nasir sir guru who is a teacher by profession and the first time i heard you was at azad medan and the topic was similarities between hinduism and islam my name is depend said and i'm working with a construction company i have come across an argument by my fellow friends when we have discussed about these topics and the question is that when the moguls were there they have tempered with the hindu scriptures and that's the reason we find uh you know some references and things like that in the scriptures is it a myth or a reality please throw some light on it thank you brother i have a good question that when the moguls came to india they tampered with the hindu scriptures is it a myth or is it a reality as far as my study goes it is a myth there are some things what the hindu said did come into the scripture for example the word hindu the word hindu doesn't exist in any of the hindu scriptures before the arabs came to india hindu is actually a geographical definition the word hindu was first used by the arabs when they came to india this hindi hindi even now today when i go to saudi they call me hindi india hindi means it's a geographical definition for people living in the land of the indus valley it's not a religious definition that's the reason jawaharlal nehru says the word hindu does not appear in the hindu scriptures until the arabs came to india but regarding a question the moguls tampered with the hindu scriptures point number one as far as my study goes the mughal did not tamper within the scriptures fine now even if i agree with you that the book is tempered now once i have tampered you leave that scripture now if you agree that the scripture has tempered so leave it now what are you going to follow a tempered scripture follow a scripture which is not tempered quran so even if i agree with your argument that moguls have tempered the scripture and only the scripture suppose you have two glasses of water one glass is pure in the other glass someone puts one drop of gutter water is in front of you but once it mixes you can't make out the dirt will you have that glass of water no why you can't see it but because you saw dirty black color drop it falls in the glass of water it mixes you can't make out will you have it will you have that glass of water it i won't have it correct very good because you're logical so even if i agree with you that morgans have tempered the scripture leave that scripture have the pure scripture quran and if you say they have not tempered the hindu scripture says you have to follow the quran hindu scripture says that you have to follow prophet muhammad peace be upon him if they have not tempered if they have tempered leave it follows this if they have not tempered the scripture says that i have to believe in one god which i give quotation besides giving quotation of god that scripture also says that you have to follow the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him i can give you quotations from the hindu scriptures talking about the coming of muhammad sallam if you read the hindu scripture bhavishya purana parabha 3 khanda verse number 1 to 14 talk about muslim if you read book number 20 hymn number 21 verse number 6 book number 20 hymn number 21 verse number seven talking about muslim rig book number one hymn number 53 verse number nine it talks about muslim if you read the psalm wait agni mantra 64 talks about sallam even mohammed sallallahu serman mentioned by name he is called as ahmad the one who praises book number eight hymn number five month number 16 book number 20 hymn number 126 number 14. he's even mentioned by name as muhammad he's called as narashansa narashansa means one who is worth praising the praiseworthy if you translate narashantha into arabic it becomes mohammed he is mentioned by name muhammad as narashansa in several places wait book number one hymn number thirteen verse number three rig wait book number one hymn number eighteen mantra number nine rigveda book number one hymn number 106 mantra number four rick wade book number one hymn number one forty two month number three rig with book number two hymn number three mantra number two rig with book number five number five number two rig with book number seven hymn number two manta number two rig with book number 10 hymn number 182 number two yajirobe chapter number chapter number twenty verse number forty two i can keep on quoting only references of muhammad sallam mentioned in the scriptures so your scriptures say that there's one god you worship him alone and you have to follow the last and final messenger even when the scriptures speak about the kalki author about muhammad sallam as the last and final messenger says his mother's name will be sumati that's amina the name of god rama salah mother it says his father's name will be vishnu yaas servant of god abdullah which is the name of muhammad allah father it says he will be born in sambala a place of peace that is makkah he'll be born in the place in the family of the chief of makkah and we know in the family of quraysh he'll have four companions talking of the sabbath i can go on and on and on talking about this he will come he'll be the last messenger that is prophet muhammad peace be upon him i am asking your brother do you believe in one god do you believe that there's no ideal worship yeah i don't believe in idol worship after i heard your speech at times so you know i'm very clear in all those aspects and i've heard you a lot of times so i just had a question which was posed to me and i wanted an answer for that so wanted to hear that so do you believe that prophet muhammad is the last and final messenger yeah i do believe yep is very clear and um from the bottom of my heart that you're doing such a good work and you're clearing all these misconceptions that we all people do have marshmallows reward you brother and in islam if you submit your will a person is called as a muslim exactly so sorry to interrupt you but that's the reason when people ask me who what's your religion and uh you know i speak gujarati and when they tell me what's your religion i just uh when i heard you that um you know the definition of a muslim is the person who goes his will to allah and that's what i told him that you know i'm a muslim so he was like shocked so the reason why i was shocked is that i i speak gujarati i know where you know am a muslim or something or you know come from a muslim background family so i was like i'm born in whichever family it is but then i know what is right and i've just studied that and that's what i talk about and i preach about and i just try to do my bit in the small pieces and bids that i can do so thank you i really appreciate it and i thank you and may almighty god grant to jannah and if you require any query any question the most welcome to contact us it's a pleasure thank you very much"
