  "transcript": "is it permissible to pray Twi at home okay if a husband leaves the wife and children in Twi will he get the reward equal to those who pray Twi in congregation in the mosque or the Masjid praying in congregation is preferable than praying alone as we discussed earlier praying in the mosque is preferable in praying at home so for the man it's preferable that he goes to the mosque and join the congregation but as far as the women are concerned the prayer in the Inner Room is better than prayer in the house house better than Courtyard Courtyard better than the MOs so it's preferable that the women pray at home and if they want they can make congregation at home that's the best as they discussed earlier that would be the best that the wom pray at home and they have a congregation but the man is preferable that he prays in the mosque"
