  "title": "According to Dr Zakir Naik, All Religions Promote Peace",
  "transcript": "that if you read the books of Judaism the books of Christianity you will find verses of Peace never in my lecture ever did I say that any religion is against peace or any religion is in favor of terrorism I always said all religions are against terrorism what I made one statement in my speech that the verse of the Quran chter 5 verse number 32 this verse which is so emphatic I do not find a similar verse in any of the scripture because I'm a student of comparative religion saying that if you kill one innocent human being it is as though you have killed the whole of humanity and if you save one innocent human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity it was only one verse so that generally I do agree that most of the religions almost all they speak about peace that's the reason Jesus Christ peace be upon him if you read the Gospel of Luke chapter number 24 verse number 36 when he goes to the upper room he says when he wishes apostles shalam alaikum which means same peace be upon you in Hebrew so the greetings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him too when he met the people wasalam alaykum which meant same in Arabic assalamu alaykum may peace be on you"
