  "transcript": "question number four education and youth what role should Islamic education play in addressing the Contemporary challenges faced by the youth in Bangladesh how can young Muslims in Bangladesh balance modern education with traditional Islamic teaching so the first guidance given in the Quran to humanity was not to pray was not to fast was not to perform Haj it was read it was Proclaim it was a recite so the first guidance given to humanity in the Glorious Quran was to educate yourself and it's compulsory on every Muslim man or woman to acquire knowledge that the Hadith of the Prophet so education is a must regarding education and youth and of course for the Youth it's more important and how should you incorporate the Islamic teachings we had launched a school in Bombay in the year 2001 Islamic international school and our motto was education for buha worlds that means educate the children on the Islamic pattern at the same time it was affiliated with the igcs the degrees is coming from UK so they were the formal subjects and the Islamic subject the formal degree recognition came from UK so we were registered under the igcs system it's the largest recognized system in the world where there are tens of thousands of students every year passing so no one will say it's a Muslim owned school or it's a Indian School the degree is coming from UK so our motto was education for both the world so it was formal education Islamic education we saw to it that we taught Islam from nursery and started reading the Quran in junior kg senior kg he started from first standard by the time the child reaches fourth or fifth is Quran so we select some students and it was a dual language of instruction Arabic and English Arabic is the language of the Quran language of the Hadith so we felt it's important that our students know Arabic as a language so if you see that in our school we had Dean and D both put together and the classes were divided in the full week in five days to 60 classes if you analyze maybe 35 40% were in Arabic they mean in English and even the English subjects there separate subject called Islamic Studies it was talking about Islam in English language so those who don't understand Arabic Etc they understand directly and the gain so it was Islamic Studies in English so if you put Arabic together and the hi together and the Islamic subjects in Arabic Shar Etc along with the English Islamic Studies put together so more than 50% was Islam mashallah so it was unique school and was doing very well but when we Hijra of course now it's not the same as before but my advice is that we should have this combination of education for both the worlds like how we had in Bombay and this will be the best to educate the children and the youth they will be inclined towards modern technology Etc but according to Sharia compliance it will be the best and the country will progress maximum in this"
