  "title": "Manju Singh Accepts Islam after asking the Differences in the Scriptures of Hinduism and Islam",
  "transcript": "good evening sir came from nagpur i want to ask you one question about vedas because i believe vedas are main scripture of hinduism so i want to know if you are telling or putting a common point which is similar to other scripture why you do not put different points in front of non-muslim people which are contradictable or which are opposite to each other because i believe in common point as a being a hindu girl it is very important to know which are the common point and which are the different points in hinduism scriptures sisters ask a very good question she said that i quoted the vedas i did point out similarities why don't i speak about differences and she wants to know the similarities as the difference says sister if i can give a talk on similarities between islam and hinduism for a few hours i can give a bigger talk and a longer talk on differences between islam hinduism but the reason i choose to speak about similarities because that is the advice given by my creator allah in the quran in surah that we worship that we erect not among ourselves lords and peoples other than allah foreign this verse of the quran shows as a way how to speak with different kinds of people come to common terms as us and you which is the first term the most important term is allah not with allah that we worship none but one almighty god regarding differences sister i can give a talk for us together about differences not that i can't but it will bring animosity maybe it will hurt the feelings of someone that we may be forced to do during a debate when there is a debate for example i had a debate with a person by the name of dr william campbell if you're the talk sister yeah i have seen your videos so that talk was talking about differences between christianity and islam why he wrote a book saying there are 30 scientific errors in the quran and for eight years no muslim replied in usa it became a hot seller so the students of us they called me and we had a dialogue the topic was quran and bible in the light of science whatever allegations he had against the quran i replied to all i post 38 points from the bible which is again sentence he could not reply to any so in the debate i may have to do that if i have a debate with a hindu scholar who says that vedas are completely with signs so then i can talk about the unscientific things but if i talk about differences maybe you may feel offended so if you want to go on a higher level surely you can ask queries at irs will give you all the things but in public i personally don't want to talk about contradictions unless someone forces me not that we aren't aware but if you know the similarity what i'm telling you let us agree to follow what is common so what i tell the people what is common in the vedas in the bible in the quran let everyone agree that at least one book is the word of god hindus will say veda the word of god christians will say bible is the word of god muslim will say the quran is the word of god i tell them a thing which everyone wouldn't mind agreeing let us agree to follow what is common so when you follow the commonalities in the vedas in the bible in the jewish scriptures talmud in the quran we find all this scripture says there's one god all the scripture says the last and final messengers prophet muhammad peace be upon him so i'm asking your sister why don't you believe in one god i want to ask you the question sister do you believe this one god i believe in one god do you believe and do you believe sister that the last and final messengers prophet muhammad peace be upon him just because i am asking you the question because it is very difficult to understand quran and vedas and i am so much confused which scripture is more important for me to achieve to the god i mean to worship to the world have you heard my lecture on similarities between islam and hinduism or sallam in the hindu scriptures have you heard that yeah i have heard do you know that your scripture says that the last and final messengers prophet muhammad peace be upon him yeah do you know that yeah so do you believe prophet muhammad is the messenger of god yeah definitely do you believe yeah so if you believe there's one god and you believe that idol worship is prohibited and if you believe that prophet muhammad is the last messenger in arabic we call you as a muslim sister do you believe in one god yeah i believe in one god do you believe there's no idea worship do you believe that almighty god has got no images yeah you believe that yeah and you also believe that prophet muhammed is the messenger of god so what you have entered you may not have gone very high but by saying this there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad is a messenger you indirectly become a muslim muslim means a person who submits his will to god so do you submitter but i am indirectly muslim no if veda is telling the same thing and quran telling the same thing so which if you're indirect also no problem indirect also most welcome whether you come direct or indirect you welcome your sister now you know what is coming now if your veda says that the last and final messengers prophet muhammad peace be upon him and you have to follow him so by following prophet muhammad you're indirectly following the vedas also then you have to find out what did prophet muhammad say then you have to read the hadees but slowly slowly so now your nursery then junior kg then senior kg then first standard then you reach under 10. but have you taken admission i want to know that do you agree that you're a muslim muslim means a person who submits his or her will to god why it is important that the person who are believing in one god is called or she is called a muslim yes why muslim means a person who submits evil to god and the first important creed to submit your will to god is believe there is one god believe there is no ideal worship and believe prophet muhammad is the messenger if you say this that means you have agreed to submit and then it takes time then you go to standard one then slowly you may know what is required about fasting about charity not to rob not to steal all this comes late but do you agree to submit your will is important and do you agree to follow the teachings of prophet muhammed is important what i want to ask your sister yeah i agree so would you like to say the shahada shazam would you like to say in arabic that there is no god but one god and prophet muhammad is the messenger yeah there is a one god and uh the prophet muhammad is a last prophet mashallah mashallah sister congratulations i would just say it in arabic and i want you to repeat it you know what you have said is the same thing but i want to ask you sister is anyone forcing you to say this no no one is there i'm putting pressure no it is completely out of free will yeah okay in arabic just repeat it allah [Music] i bear witness i bear witness i bear witness that there is no god that there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad and prophet muhammad peace be upon him peace be upon him is the servant is the servant and messenger of allah and messenger of allah mashallah thank you i congratulate sister now we have entered the fall of islam and insha allah for getting more knowledge for going to first standard second standard third standard be in touch with the sisters of the islamic research foundation and it will be a pleasure to guide you and if you have any queries regarding quran regarding islam you're most welcome to ask if you have any queries even regarding hinduism etc most welcome sister and i pray to allah that may he grant to jannah sister [Applause]"
