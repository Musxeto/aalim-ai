  "title": "Solution for the Muslim Countries being Boycotted, Blacklisted, Threatened by the Enemies of Islam.",
  "transcript": "the third question from Mohammed Sarah Dean Lahore Pakistan most of the Muslim countries in the world are facing problems they are being put on sanctions being boycotted they are being blacklisted blackmailed threatened or attacked Muslims in most parts of the world have been humiliated they have been persecuted oppressed and even least according to you what is the solution I do agree with this brother mimosa Raja Deen from Pakistan that unfortunately today we find in the Muslim Ummah most of the Muslim countries they have been blackmailed they have been blacklisted their sanctions have been put there being threatened they have been attacked for no fault of this Muslims are being humiliated there are rights Muslim Allah being lynched what is the solution according to me the solution Allah gives in the Quran in surah Imran chapter number 3 was la 103 well Allah says that what a sim would be Hubble Elijah me over at Africa hold all together strongly to the Rope of Allah and be not divided if the Muslim Ummah is united then insha Allah will be a strong force and no one will be able to bully us the problem today is that the Muslim Ummah is divided and we are not close to the Quran Sunnah the only way that Muslims can be righted is holding the Rope of Allah the Rope of Allah it is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith of Amazonas allah so if all the Muslims hold strongly to the glorious quran which is the last and final revelation las manos allah and the things of prophet muhammad peace be upon him there are the NSI hadith if we hold strongly to this and if we are united then we will be a strong force today there are about 2 billion Muslims in the world out of 7.75 billion human being in the world more than 26% of the world population today they are Muslims if you see the example of China China about 1.4 billion approximately 18% of the world population today they are a big source and they're so big then the live bothered about the left of the world did themself a 1.4 billion do you know whatever social media that is this wrote the world it will fruits in the world but it's not influencing China because they're banned Facebook they're banned YouTube the band Google does their own alternative thereby do there were no what's up there would reach at so they have got the own alternative and 18 percent of women doing them if is a big chunk that's what isn't today they are number two in the world but in many aspects the number one and the way they are developing coming from very low the way they have come up in the last few decades this phenomenal because they United so we have to take the good points and I many negative points of China but the good point is they United and they themselves are a big force so my soul that even America's afraid what my suggestion is that the Muslims should be United they can have their countries no problem but I the whole regime United today we have the United Nation organization you are known for whatever you ever say most of them fall except the big superpower the five or six country which have what the veto power besides them everyone has to follow if they don't follow then the twins they arm they put sanction they put embargo and they they have unwitting policies for the own benefit if they want to attack if they want to take for Iraq they create false the big superpower American Duque they create false evidence and they attack attack Iraq not the Saddam Hussein was a very good Muslim but what right did America USA and UK to attacking us and after that that Iraq was worse than what was before when was a Muslim doing they were just sitting they were fighting among themselves we Muslims should be whatever said and done first of all we should remove let our differences aside and we should unite we may not agree with certain policy of the other Muslim country but on the basis of Quran and Sunnah we should unite and we should have our own United Muslim organization like their if you a know we should have um or all the 57 Muslim countries should have United forget about what we have in the past we have some organization but they are not effective at all because they're controlled by one or two we should be united on the basis of Quran if we are united on the basis of Quran let Quran be a constitution practically not politically there are some Muslim countries her ethically grounded the Constitution but most of the things was Quran prohibitive goes on in that country it's only for theory we should practically have Quran as a constitution and have United and we should have alternative like how there is a World Trade Organization WTO we should have a World Trade Muslim organization WTM oh and I'll give you an example we Muslims we have the GCC Gulf Cooperation countries the six countries Saudi Arabia Kuwait UAE Qatar Oman Bahrain these six countries are close to each other and they produce oil they have got petrol and if they fight among themselves the other will take advantage so many years back they made a cooperation Gulf countries cooperation so that they can fix the price so there everyone benefits in this way not only should we have for the petrol we should have for palm oil the two Muslim country will produce majority of the export palm oil is Indonesia and Malaysia these two countries so if all the Muslims come together we'll have control over palm oil we'll have control over natural gases we'll have control over patrol if all unitedly will be a big force and if someone tries to bully us all of us will be United unfortunately today many of the Muslim countries are helping the enemies of Islam in attacking the other Muslim country because they want to have an upper edge against the Muslim country it is totally harmless one Muslim country is being partnered with other non-muslim country to overpower the other Muslim country this is totally not allowed we should be united we may have our differences but just because we want to prove that we are better than the other Muslim country we are seeing to it that we are spending money to destroy a Muslim brother today we have some of the Muslim countries are spending billions of dollars to destroy their the Muslim country just because they want to be superior than the other Muslim countries this is against the principle of Islam if all the Muslim countries unite whether big or small with the powerful or not if all unite if we have a united army a Muslim army of all the countries put together then no one will be able to blackmail us you know that Allah subhana Allah has given us the black gold we have the wealth if we unite we should use this well to promote Islam not to destroy Islam so this is there then we have all the international organization if there is a wh a world organization we should have a world Abu Simbel organization W MH o and these health rules should be based on Quran and Sunnah unfortunately we are blindly following the rules made by the non-muslims some may be character may not be correct so if we have unity amongst all in the Muslim countries all the 57 Muslim countries more than 2 billion Muslims if there is a interpol international police they should be an islamic poll islam poll that islamic police if we have unity in all aspects of life and if some muslim country is breaking the law of the quran and sunnah the other Muslim countries can get together and correct the Muslim country why should we allow the non-muslim to interfere in the affairs of the affairs of the Muslims so if we ever in check amongst ourself and our Constitution should be Quran and thus I had the if we follow this inshallah within a few years within a decade Muslim continued me on the top and in respective what's happening today we find the question posed about the Muslim leaders and the Muslim Vantage today there is one silver lining the silver lining is that there is a hadith there's a prophecy of a beloved cross masala solemn that towards the end of time and if you go on my facebook I started the series of the signs of the end of the world my innocence and major signs and there are more than 80 minus signs out of which there are approximately forty five that have already occurred and there are approximately forty that the pending noted record and then there are ten media signs but towards the end of the world a beloved prophet Morrison prophesized that made the elephant will come if a leaf alum will come mia Darussalam made ELISA Lam would be the leader and the Muslims would rule the world for seven years that would be the golden years for the Muslims and that time inshallah they will follow Islam and the holliford again would be revived and that time whether you wanted or don't want it I wanted or unwanted this would be the best time so there's a silver lining I only pray to Allah subhana Allah that may we live till that time when marilla salam come so that we will support him and a beloved prophet of allah allah is given by Shara that that group of Muslims that will support me daily Salam they have been promised paradise i peter las manos era that may he come during our time during my time and i would be the first person to support him and would love to see how islam flourishes and we wait for the time till the time he comes we don't know how long will it take few weeks few months few years you decayed Allah Allah what we should do we should follow Quran and Sunnah and see to it that we forced our leaders to follow Quran and Sunnah and the Muslim United on the ban of Quran and Sajadi inshallah again will be a superpower"
