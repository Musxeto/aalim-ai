  "transcript": "brother I have a medical shop and I want to ask about certain things whether I can sell it or not like certain cough syrups which have alcohol and then we sell some contraceptives also so which one is allowed and which one is not can you give me the answer I will ask a question that yeah the medical shop can he sell cough service container alcohol contraceptives brother as far as the Quran machine knowledge in four different places in Surah chapter number two verse number 173 in Instagram the chapter number five verse number three in Surah chapter number six verse number 145 and chapter 16 verse 115 after mentioning the prohibited Foods it says that if under compulsion if under compulsion you have these prohibited fruits then Allah is if your life is in danger and the only thing that can save you is a particular food for example if you're in the sea and you're in a boat where storm has come and you have no contact on land and poke is the only thing available on that boat on that ship so for that time though pork is prohibited it becomes permitted for you but the moment you come on the shirt becomes prohibited similarly if alcohol is the only drug that can save your life then becomes permitted but I am aware of being a medical doctor that many of the drugs and the syrups they do contain alcohol where it's not a necessity sometimes necessary sometimes there can be substitutes so what I would suggest that since it's a medication the onus lies on the person purchasing it for example you sell a knife and you may be selling knife to cut vegetables but if we use this for murder so here's to blame not you what I can suggest that you can give other Alternatives of cough syrup we do not contain alcohol and now research tells us that alcohol is not the best solvent they use this as a media so they can be other substitutes so you are the Muslim you can sell substitutes which do not contain alcohol at the same time I wouldn't say it is Haram to sell but if you promote the other drugs it's preferable as far as the contraception is concerned again if you hear my answer on Family Planning you have given the reasons where enormous circumstances should not be done unless it's advised by a medical doctor that if the life is in danger that if she undergoes if she has one more pregnancy if she has several surgery section chairs and multiple scissors in section four five six and if the gynecologists say that one more pregnancy is determined to a health and she can die under these circumstances as a last resort Family Planning and contraception can be done so if you are selling certain products and if you note that the majority of the people purchasing are indulging in wrong things I personally would prefer that if you don't indulge in these things for example it'd be property or the other things so these are mainly used for wrong activities it again depends upon a taqwa but if you know if someone uses it these contraception for a reason which is in Islam which is permitted in Islam then it's fine but if you know that most of our customers are not using for this purpose so as far as the temporary method is concerned the difference opinion among the scholars whether it's allowed or not allowed as far the permanent method OC pills all this college degree it is Haram unless it is good for medical reasons so that depends upon each individual where does he fall in but if you feel it falls in the gray area and your position when I've sold it I I being individual person never understood it but I'm not giving a fatwa that's Haram to sell that but as an individual person if I was running a medical store I would not have sold these things because I know that most of these are used by people for reasons which are not jazz in Islam so either person individually would not accept General difference so and your position wouldn't have solve these things but that depends to sell because I'm sure that in various reasons Islam does give permission if we determine to the health but since most of the customers that buy from you they may not be following in this category I personally would avoid it if I was in your position you you can take your own decision hope to answer the question"
