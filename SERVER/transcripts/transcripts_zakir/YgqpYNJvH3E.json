  "transcript": "dr zakiyah regarding another important aspect how allah accepts tawba repentance what are the prerequisites for sincere toba and could you possibly enlighten us with some prophetic traditions of some of the prophets making tawbah to allah allah says in the quran chapter number 66 verse number eight that is repentance and there are basically five prerequisites for allah to accept number one the person should accept that he's doing is wrong number two he should immediately stop it number three should seek forgiveness from allah number four he should not commit that act again and number five if he has taken something from any other human being and if he can return it he would turn it back for example if he has dropped some money he should turn the money back if he's taking some wealth he should give the wealth back if he can undo the harm he should do it and according to ibn kaim he says that repentance is accepted when the person does not do that evil act again and it further helps him to do good deeds and prevents him from going back to that act according to imam and nobi he says there are three prerequisites for any tawba to be accepted number one you should stop that what he's doing number two should ask for forgiveness number three you should not do it again and he says that the fourth requirement if he had done some harm to any other human being then you should undo it if he can and there are various examples in the hadith which give that how people have asked for forgiveness it's mentioned hadith of say buhari verb number four in the book of stories of the prophets hadith number 3470 that there was a person who had committed 99 murders so he wants to seek repentance so he asked the people that how can he do it so they send him to a monk so hmong says that you have killed 99 people there's no chance of forgiveness so that person that murderer he kills the monk too and now he has committed hundred murders so it goes to another person and says that i want to seek repentance so he says that if you want to seek repentance go to that land where people are worshiping allah subhana wa tala and inshallah you should leave the land in which you have committed the crime and go to that land where people are seeking repentance and inshallah allah will gandhi forgiveness so he immediately goes towards that land but on his way that takes place and he dies and he turns his chest towards that village where people are repenting then both the angels the angels of good and the angels are bad both come and they won't take him the angels from the heavens say that we will take him because he want to repent but then you'll form the bad deeds the hell they say no he has not committed a single good deed we will take him so allah subhanahu wa intervenes and he asks the village where people are repenting that it should come closer to the person who's committed murder and he commands to the place where he's committed the crime that it should go further away so when they measure the distance they find out that the person who committed the murder he was one span closer to the village where people are repenting so then allah grants him jannah so this is an example that a person commits hundred murder and he wants to repent only the knee of repenting and traveling towards that place and a different version of the same hadith says that while dying he pushes himself towards the he looks towards the place where you can get forgiveness so this shows that only the niyyah and the intention to foster forgiveness there is another example in say muslim verb number three in the book of hadith number 4207 there was a lady from the time of johanna she comes to the prophet and she had family adultery and she was pregnant so she comes to the prophet and says that i have done so and so sin please give me punishment so the prophet calls her master and says take care of this woman till she delivers the child and after that get her to me so the master takes care of her and after she gives birth to a child he gets the woman then the prophet says because of the adultery she has to be given the penalty and the lady she's asked to wrap around herself with a cloth and the people stone her to death and after she dies the prophet he prays for her so umar men alive pleased with him says that no prophet you're praying for a woman who has committed adultery then the prophet replies that the way she has repented even if you distribute this repentance to 70 people of madina it would be sufficient for them to go to jannah who can repent better than the woman who is willing to give her life for the sake of allah a similar example is given in say muslim volume number three in the book of hadith number 4205 that ma has been malik will i have peace with him he come to the prophet and he says that please purify me the prophet says vote to you go and ask forgiveness for allah and you repent the person he goes back again he comes and says hello messenger please pardon me he says vote to you ask for forgiveness allah and you repent again the person goes again he comes for a third time oh messenger of allah please purify me he says go away from you ask for repentance again the fourth time he comes says to the prophet please pardon me the prophet says from what so mars malloy plays within he says that from adultery so he says are you mad have you gone crazy so the person says no i'm not mad then the prophet asks that are you drunk did you have hammer did you have wine so the other people get up and the smell is more they said no prophet he said no hammer he said did you really come in adultery he said yes i've come into adultery and i want the punishment for the sin i've committed so prophet muslim asked the people to stone him and he was stoned to death after stone to that there is a controversy between the summers and the two groups of people one group of people say that he has been undone that means it's a pity that he will not get master abandoned the other group said allah ta'ala has accepted my life allah has accepted his repentance and he shall go to jannah this happens for two or three days then the beloved prophet comes and then it is to the sahabas that pray for malik because he has repented for a sin and if you distribute his repentance even in a large number of people in a group of people it will be sufficient here it shows that the people they committed a major sin but they repented they were even willing to have themselves killed because both these people knew very well that the punishment for adultery was death it was known to death so here it shows that the high level of taqwa they had the sincere repentance from allah and allah"
