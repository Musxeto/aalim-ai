  "transcript": "and you pick up any religious scripture i am a student of compared religion i have read the ramayana mahabharat bible old testament new testament six scriptures giant scriptures i have read it and you find that in certain occasions or the other almost all the scriptures some way or the other they have mentioned fighting they have mentioned killing i can give quotations if you read the bible in the book of exodus of the old testament chapter number 22 verse number 18 to 20 it says kill exodus chapter number 32 says kill numbers say skill new testament if you read luke in the gospel of luke it's a skill and if you remember the story of jesus christ peace be upon him when he goes to the garden of gethsemane he tells one of the apostles to take a sword and stand there and that apostle he uses a soft up of the ear so you find that fighting has been prescribed in almost all the scriptures you read in the scriptures mahabharat is a scripture it is what bhagavad-gita chapter number two and you know that when arjuna when he feels sad that when he has to fight his relatives arjuna says how can i kill my relatives the thousands of people ahead in front of me how can i kill them so lord arjun arjun he is given guidance by lord krishna and lord krishna tells him that as far as for the truth when you're on the truth you don't have to see who's in front of you whether the relatives or who it is and that is correct truth prevails much more higher than the blood relations same thing the quran says in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 135 all you believe stand out firmly for justice as truth to almighty god even if it be against yourself against your parents against the rich or against the poor allah protects all so if you study all the scriptures all the scriptures somewhere or the other sometime or the other they have mentioned about fighting that doesn't mean you pick up that verse of exodus you pick up that verse of bhagavad-gita and say that you know bhagavad-gita says that i have to kill your relatives it's out of context here we have to analyze that to get a communion harmony the best thing we have to do is we have to go back to our scriptures if you go back to the scriptures you will come to know what is mentioned in the scriptures which is the authentic source of every religion and we find that the quran says in surah maidah chapter number five verse number it says that if anyone kills any human being whether it be a muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for creating mischief in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity the quran says if any human being whether muslim or non-muslim kills any other human being whether muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for creating mischief in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and the verse continues and if anyone save then human being it is as though he has saved the whole nation"
