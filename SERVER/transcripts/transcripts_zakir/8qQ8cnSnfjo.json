  "transcript": "the topic of this last short talk in the month of Ramadan is from this Ramadan to the next Ramadan and I pray to Allah and I hope that almost all the viewers who are watching they may have fasted for the complete month of Ramadan and inshallah I hope and I pray that all of you may have done your qayam prayed in all the nights of Ramadan and surely you may have kept awake for the last 10 nights so that you get the latest Quran chapter 41 verse number 30. that those who say that Allah is my Lord and they are steadfast and firm the Angels descend down from time to time and they say that do not fear not have any grief for there is Glad Tidings that inshallah you shall enter Jannah you shall enter the Bliss in this verse chapter number 41 verse number 30 that all those who say that Allah is the Lord they believe in tahit and they steadfast and firm the Angels descend down and they tell them they do not grieve nor have any fear and they give them Glad Tidings the bashara of Jannah of paradise of Eternal Bliss a similar message is repeated chapter number 46 verse number 13 where it says indeed those who say that our Lord is Allah and the steadfast and firm they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve and the next verse says verse number 14 that they shall be Companions of the garden of Jannah said it's mentioned in sahih Muslim volume number one Hadith number 450. Allah messenger said that the five daily Salah the five daily prayers and from one Juma to the next jummah and from Brand Ramadan to the next Ramadan is expansion of all your sins as long as you keep away from the major sins a beloved Prophet has said that when you purify time Salah or from one jumma to the other or from manram to the other Ramadan as long as you are steadfast in this Allah will forgive all your sins as long as you stay away from the major sins and it's mentioned in say buhari word number eight Hadith number 6465 she asked the prophet that which deed is the most beloved Allah and the prophet replies that Allah loves those deeds which are constant are the regular even if they may be small the Deeds that are done regularly are more beloved to Allah even if they are small that means we have to be constant in it we have to be steadfast we have to be firm in it alhamdulillah we pray to Allah that may he accept our fasting our qayam and may He forgive all our sins now since we hardly have in Malaysia hardly one hour 45 minutes before Ramadan ends in other parts of the world few hours and some parts of the Indian subcontinent one day and few hours since Ramadan is going to end what is our duty what is our role from this Ramadan to the next Ramadan and it's very important that all of us that we were so steadfast in our in our charity in in our Dua in our supplication in our repentance and all these things we pray to Allah may we remain the same throughout the year the best for us Muslim is to continue doing all the Deeds that we have been doing in the month of Ramadan if we cannot then at least continue most of it but one thing that minimum that what you were doing before the start of the samdhan in the earlier months of Shaban and rajab Etc after this Ramadan it should be better than the months that were prior to the month of Ramadan minimum this is minimum let me give you an example that may be some of the Muslims may not be very particular and the Salah may be the offering only three times the four times Salah see to it this was before I'm not see to it that after Ramadan you pray all the fight time for us Allah if maybe you are praying at home and didn't go to the mosque before this Ramadan see to it that after this Ramadan you pray five times in jamaat in the mosque because it's a further for the men to pray in Jama in the mosque and some Scholars like Imam Dhabi says it is a major sin if you do not pray in Jama in the mosque without a valid reason maybe some of us are praying five times Salah but before I'm done we were not praying the Sun after ramnan see to it that you start praise if you are praise foreign after sunrise if you are praying all these then at least after Ramadan you start paying that standard you should see to it that you should pray much more than what you were praying before the start of this Ramadan so your Salah should increase more there are other things that it should take care of if you are giving charity see to it that you increase in your charity if you were not giving any extra charity besides the zakat which is first see to it that you start giving charity after this and my suggestion is that you commit a percentage of your earnings in charity in the way of Allah besides the further zachar that you have to pay maybe you can start with five percent of your earnings every month given charity increase to 10 percent and believe me the more charity you give the balanced amount which is pending with you you will be much more than what it was before my physician is make Allah your partner in your business give maybe 20 of your income whether it be your salary whether it be a business earning thirty percent my suggestion is that if you want to be on the higher level see to it that you give more of your earnings in charity and keep less give more than 50 percent of your earnings of your salary of your income of your profit to Allah make him your partner make him your major partner see to it that you will benefit more than what you were before even in this worldly way even if you're poor Allah looks at the percentage not at the amount maybe that the rich person who's earning a million dollar a month and he gives ten thousand dollar a month in charity there may be a poor man who may be earning a thousand dollar but he he may be giving 100 charity the rich person is earning a million dollar and giving ten thousand dollar in charity he is giving one percent of his earning in charity the poor person who's earning a thousand dollar and giving hundred dollar he's giving ten percent of his earnings that means the poor man insha Allah will get 10 times more sabab even though he's given hundred dollar as compared to the rich man who's given ten thousand dollars and my suggestions that all of those who have not committed commit a percentage of your earning in the way of Allah if you have committed increase your percentage if you are giving five then give ten percent if you are giving 10 give 20 if you are giving 20 give 30 if you're going 30 40 if you are getting 40 50 my suggestion is give more than 50 percent of your earnings in the way of Allah and the baron is remaining with you will inshallah be much more than what it was before increase in charity and Allah promises chapter number two verse number 261 that if you saw one grain of corn in the way of Allah Allah will give you seven years each year having 100 credits that means one grain you give in the way of Allah Allah will give you 700 creams that means 700 times profit in in business terminology Allah will give you seventy thousand percentage of profit in no business I know do you get seventy thousand percent profit 700 times you have faith in Allah increase your charity increase your recitation of the Quran increase your fasting now in the month of Ramadan it's the first this is the only first pass for a Muslim after Ramadan see to it that you continue your fasting as the Beloved Prophet said that all those look all those who keep the fixed fast of after the first of Ramadan it is as though they are fasted for the full year now how does a person calculate why did the prophet say six fast why did he say five fast or seven fast the focus they say as Allah says that he increases the reward minimum 10 times so if you calculate the full month of Ramadan that you fasted one loon a month have got 29 and a half days sometime 29 sometime 30. so 29 and a half multiplied by 10 becomes 295 days then additional six days multiplied by 10 becomes 60 days so 295 plus 60 is 255 and a lunar year has got 254 years 254 days one lunar year has 254 days that that is in the prophet said that if you follow up with your fasting of Ramadan you fasted with the full year follow up with six days of shawwal it is as though you are fasted for the full year then after that there are other fast that you can keep and we know that a beloved Prophet Muslim said that the best fast after the first fast of Ramadan is the first of Muharram and if you fast in Ashura a beloved Prophet said that all the sins of a previous year are forgiven the other fast which is very important after that I'm after Ramadan first it the fast on arafah the day of arafah the ninth of zillaj and the prophet said that if you fast on the day of arafah if you are not doing pilgrimage if you're not doing Hajj then Allah will forgive your past the sins of your past one year and the sins of one year ahead the future year and the best is to fast all the first nine days of silica and along with the fast of Ashura if you can fast the ninth day or the 11th day is good if you fast 9 11 9 10 11 that's the best is that you fast on the ayamul bid the white days the days of the full moon that the 13th 14th and 15th of the lunar year and the prophet said if you fast three days three days every month it is as though you have fasted the full year again the same logic three days multiplied by ten becomes 30 days so every month if you fast for three days you're fasting for the full month if you fast every three days of every if you fast three days of every month you have fasted for the full year the prophet also recommended us that we should fast on Mondays and on Thursdays and these were the two days that the prophet fasted and for these adoption that I've been given by the prophet that after the first fast you can fast and one of the best fast is the maximum get fast is the fasting of the other Islam and the prophet said that though there is fasted every alternate day of the year that's the maximum to fast all the days of the year it is prohibited the maximum you can fast is alternate days but natural besides the days which are recommended as I mentioned earlier so the option is yours so once you have finished the fastening of Ramadan you continue fasting as much as you can in the option that have been given and a request that at least you don't miss the fasting of Ashura the fasting of villajja and the fasting of sharwar if you can as I am will be also if you can fast also fast on Mondays and Thursdays and the maximum anyone can do is the fasting of the Islam every alternative of the year as I mentioned first about the cam I mentioned about the charity I mentioned about Psalm fasting then is reading of the Quran read the Quran as much as you can maybe in the manually you're reading the Quran but after Ramadan you stop reading start reading if you were reading maybe for 15 minutes before ramnan after Ramadan did at least half an hour if you're eating half an hour before Ramadan start eating for 45 minutes read as much as you can there is a great deal of Sava increase in your supplication as many do as you can after the Salah the other Dua for daily activity see Twitter increase increase in asking for forgiveness asking for repentance if as much as you increase it's better so after Ramadan you should find a mark to change in most of your ibada as compared to before Ramadan and today is the last day of Ramadan in most parts of the world some parts is the second last day we hardly have about maybe one and a half hour left in Malaysia before we end Ramadan few are the other parts of the world maybe more as in other parts of the world see to it that before the devils are Unchained you make a decision you make a commitment to yourself that inshallah after Ramadan I'll pray more beside the foreign ends see to it that you have you keep more form what you were keeping before Ramadan increase in your recitation of the Quran in your supplication in your specify in asking for forgiveness see to it that your ibadah and as a whole what your life was before the start of this Ramadan should be much more after this Ramadan ends people normally ask me that why very often the Muslims after Ramadan you see that many of the Muslim they bada goes down then to the Adam goes down why what is the reason one of the reason is that many of us Muslims we do the activities of Ramana and more as a custom rather than you know it's customary for most of the Muslims come okay we have to pay taravi they will not be saravi they may miss the Fajr Salah in the morning you know but but because it's a custom they follow more of the culture rather than the Deen so the particular about the custom and the neglect the variety the other reason is because many of the friends are doing the activities they join them and as though it's part of a friendly Gathering rather than and they do the activities without paying attention on the main reasons and the purpose of these activities of Ramadan the third reason can be because of the weak fit that the enthusiastic they do in the month of Ramadan and they will do it and you find in in many countries in the first few days of Ramadan the mosques are full fataravi then it keeps on declining and it is the least towards the end it should not be the case and the last and the major reason is because the Satan and the Devils they are chained during Ramadan so you find the ibad that has more the activities more after Ramadan Unchained and that's the reason that we go back to our old wrong habits what is the solution for this the solution for this is that number one you should have faith in Allah Allah says Imran chapter 3 verse 160. if Allah helps you know if Allah forces you then who is there then who can help you so let the Believers put their faith in Allah put the trust and Allah number one is have faith and trust in Allah if Allah is with you no one can overcome you no one can defeat you if Allah forsakes you then no one can help you the best do all you can do is from chapter number three verse number eight which says oh my Lord let not my heart deviate let not my heart deviate after thou has guided it you are the one who a giver of bounties and you love forgiving people sin so here we are praying to Allah that let not my heart David after you have guided her that means we were at the highest of ibadah we were the best so we praying to Allah that once you have guided us let not the heart deviate and you are the one who are Giver of bounties and of mercy and blessings so ask Allah for help pray to him that he keeps you on the same path and steadfast as you are in the month of Ramadan number two see to it that you are in the company of the king and the company of those who are more Pious who are more righteous because the company influences you a lot see to it that your friends are those friends that offer five times see to it that your friends are those which keep away from the major sins as well as from the minor sins see to it that you have friends who always do all the parayas who do as much as muslav as possible so when you and the company and with the Satan tries to debate you these friends will keep you on the straight path so it's very important that you keep friendship of the people who according who are righteous who are devout who on the state path number three regularly as often as possible keep on attending the durs the lectures talks of the scholars authentic and who get you closer to Allah and his and his soul number four read books read the Quran read it along with the translation so let your heart soften let your heart cry read the translation of the Quran if you don't understand Arabic if you know Arabic read the Quran it's sufficient read the book of the seed of the Prophet off of the rashidin of the sahabas hear the lectures of the scholars the videos you can hear the audios you can go on the social media of the Islamic sites with authentic like Islam q a you can go on my website Zakir nike.com which has been launched recently on the first of Ramadan you can go to other authentic side to the social media but see to it that you goes to those social media those sites which are authentic so this will keep you reminding of Allah of the Beloved prophet of the akhirah and you see to it that keeps you on the straight path this was in short the guidance that I can give to the viewers regarding the activities of from this from the next Ramadan so that our ibada increases I will close this to Allah increases and inshallah our chances of entering the Jannah also increases"
