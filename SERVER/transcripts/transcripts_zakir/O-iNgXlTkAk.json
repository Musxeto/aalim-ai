  "title": "What to do with Salaah since I am Having Non Stop Menstruation - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I have a question regarding my Menses and was hoping to get an answer from Dr Zakir Nik my name is Hiba age 25 years from Hyderabad India I did not get my periods for more than five months then I started spotting for around a week during which time I did pray after taking gole or changing pad according to whatever information I could find then after a week of spotting my period started and so I stopped praying and now my periods have been going on for 17 days Non-Stop and I haven't prayed I found somewhere that a woman has to resume prayers if it has been more than 15 days of bleeding but this 15 days is for people who get normal periods right because in that article it said you should calculate when your period normally would end and then pray but my periods have never been normal I never had fixed date also my mom is saying that because you didn't get period for five plus months they are longer now and this period only and this is a period only now I'm confused should I consider this period and defrain from praying or should I start praying as it is more than 15 days and I do not want to miss prayers but I also am having like heavy flow bleeding so I feel weird praying in such a condition as I'm not sure regarding your question that you have not been having paid for five months and then you had spotting for a few days then one week you had no spotting and then you had bleeding and now you're bleeding continuously for 17 days as far as the duration for a woman for the menstrual period is not fixed it can be 3 days can be 5 days can be 7 days can be one week can be 10 days it's not fixed as far as what is the duration in which after so many days can you consider at that means a non-menstrual bleeding or a vaginal bleeding which is not menstruation so this vaginal bleeding is called as so there is no fixed period or number of days mentioned in the Quran or in the Hadith there is scholarly difference regarding what days can you consider after so many days of bleeding can you consider at or a non-menstrual bleeding or a normal vaginal bleeding majority of the scholars they say that if the bleeding is for more than 15 days you can consider it at meaning a non- menstrual bleeding or an abnormal vaginal bleeding but there are Scholars who say that since there is no definite number of days mentioned the Quran or the Hadith some scholar says that it can be a menstrual cycle whether it's for 2 days 5 days 10 days 17 days even until if it's for more than a month if it is for 30 days then you can consider it as or if it stops for two or 3 days so the scholarly different between the two opinion majority of the scholars says that if it's more than 15 days you can call it as a non- menstrual beaing or or an abnormal vagina bleeding but scholar some Scholars say that no only if it touches 30 days or more or crosses 30 days can you call it as an abnormal vaginal bleeding or non- menual bleeding or if it stops for 2 days in between but majority Scholars they say more than 15 days as you mentioned talk now coming to your question but there can be no periods even for a long duration of 1 month 2 month 3 month four month five months medically it's possible so when sh was asked the question so he said that there is possibility a woman may not have bleeding for 1 month 2 month 3 month even 5 months and suddenly she may have a bleeding even for a month so maybe Allah subhana wa ta'ala held her menstrual cycle and all came out together so has two views even more than 15 days you can consider and one of his view is that if it is 30 days or more it is then only called and the same question was asked to binas he said that if it's for more than 15 days yes you can count but a lady asked that she bled for 17 days and after that stopped so shik bbas said consider your Min cycle was for 70 days after that I have a Gul and you can start praying the lady asked him that I bled for 18 days and then it stopped so shbb said consider your minister cycle was 14 days and after that have Gul and you start praying and if it's the month of Ramadan you start fasting so here we come to know that there is scholly difference of opinion after how many days can you count it as or a Minal bleeding now if you read the Hadith of may Allah be peace with her she says that Fatima B may Allah be pleased with her she asked the prophet that she has been having and she's not praying and she's feeling uncomfortable so the prophet said that if it's if it's a non- menal beaing it may be a vain so what you do is you see what were your periods earlier and for those days you don't pray count those days as your menstrual cycle and after that have Gul and start praying if it is the month of Ramadan you start fasting the similar this mentioned in in about Allah be pleas with her mentioned inkari there in Muslim where it says that umh she went to the prophet and said that I'm having and my bleeding is continuous so the prophet said that you check what was your normal cycle previously and based on that calculate those number of days and you think that is your menstrual cycle and have a GLE after that and start praying for example if a woman has a menstrual cycle from first day of the month for five days then you think and if you start having and when you come to know that more than 15 days have passed or more than one month have passed and you realize then you start thinking okay now this is so my main menst cycle is only from the the first day to the fifth day for five days and after that you have your Gul and start praying and think that the rest of the bleeding it is or maybe a woman has a menstrual cycle from the fifth day for the next seven days so when you start having you have been bleeding for more than a month then you consider that your fifth day is your cycle for next seven days after the next seven days are over you have Gul and even if it bleeds you you think it's and you can pray so from these two Hadi it is very clear that the prophet said if you have is then you follow your previous cycle now regarding there are three conditions the first condition is that before having the abnormal vaginal bleeding you had a normal minous period maybe for many years you are a woman who's having a menr period and the cycle was regular every fifth day you had for about 5 days or 6 days the cycle May Vary some people have for 5 days some for 6 days some for 10 days it was regular so when you're having regular menstrual cycle for many months or many years and then starts then you follow the Hadith of the Prophet that based on your previous Cycles whether your cycle your menstration was for 5 days or seven days or eight days count those five days or 7 days or 8 days as your men cycle and after that you do your gusul think your pure and then don't count it as mination count and you start praying so this is the first type of the second type that what may be similar to the question asked that you never had a regular menual cycle in your life before and suddenly you start having this the abnormal vag so you don't know what has happened in the past so in this case where you do not know what is your normal V cycle you never had any experience and you start with this without having a regular menal cycle then the scholars and the fukas say then you have to see the thickness of the blood and you have to see the color of the blood what is brown then became red smell the order so first you can feel the thickness of the blood second is you can see the color of the blood the third is you can smell the order there the order for a menstrual blood and a non- menstrual blood and you can see a white discharge that means the menstrual cycle has ended so if the thickness reduces then the count the number of days where the thickness is there that's the menstrual cycle when it becomes thin that's the that is not your menual cycle if the color is dark and then becomes Light fresh blood then think the dark part is your menstrual cycle and the fresh red that's a normal bleeding if the order is that of a menstrual cycle think those days where the blood is the order is that of menual cycle that is the days of a menual cycle and after that it's normal so this is the second type of where you didn't have any history in the past but the thickness changes or the color changes or the order changes the third category is of where there is no change you're having a continuous vaginal bleeding that's a non- menal bleeding and there is no change in the thickness of the blood there's no change in the color there's no change in the order so here there's a Hadith that is mentioned by Ahmed which has been mentioned byi and even Hassan by Imam bukari that a lady by the name of hna Al goes to the prophet and says that I've been having and there is no change in the color or the thickness or the smell so the prophet says that you consider six or seven days as a menal cycle from the time it starts and after that have GLE and you can pray now here this is the third type of that you never had a history of a regular period in the past and your is no change in color no change in thickness no change in order so here the day it starts the prophet said count six or seven days take G now six or seven days doesn't mean because according to Medical Science the majority the most common cycle for a woman is 6 to 7even days and even Medical Science say that but that doesn't mean as I told earlier the cycle of some wom can be for three days can be five days but the most common number of days is six or seven days it can even be eight days can can be 10 days can be 15 days so the prophet said from the time it starts count six or seven days and then you do go that doesn't mean that you can choose what you want so what you have to do here the scholars say that you have to check with the woman of your type your built your weight your structure your type of woman and check the women around you in your house in your Society in your neighborhood and then you can judge the people of my type what is the common days is it 6 or is it 7 so when you find it is 6 then from the time you get the bleeding you think the first six days are menr cycle have the good on the seven day and start praying if the women around you are more closer to seven days then think your menual cycle is for seven days so the day the bleeding starts count from first to seven days eth day have a bath and have gusul and start praying so this was in a nutshell what do you do when you have irregular menstrual cycle or abnor vaginal bleeding or and this is the opinion of the majority of the fukas and the scholars hope that answers the question"
