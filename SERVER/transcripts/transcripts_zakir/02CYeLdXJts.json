  "title": "God is Not the Appropriate Translation of the Arabic Word Allah â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "don't write God g o d with a capital g capital O capital D please always write Allah llh because there is no description of God in the Holy Quran this first message is correct and I've said that in my talks on concept of God the major world religion and other talks of mine that God is not the appropriate translation of the English word Allah and why do we Muslims prefer calling Allah a-l-l-a-h-o-a-l-l-a-h with that because Allah instead of the English word called because the Arabic word Allah it cannot be played around with it's a unique word whereas the English word God if you add s to it it becomes God's meaning plural of God there is no plural of Allah says if you add d e s s to God it becomes goddess meaning a female God there is no male Allah or female Allah in Islam Allah has got no gender if you add a father to God it becomes Godfather there is no Allah or Allah father in Islam if you add a mother to God it becomes godmother there is no Allah mother or Allah if you prefix a tin before God it becomes 10 God meaning of fake God there's nothing Allah in Islam that's the reason I say in my talks that God is not the appropriate translation of the Arabic word Allah so the right word that Muslims should always use is Allah but when you use this word god when you are speaking to non-muslim they have got no objection because the non-muslim may not be aware what is the meaning of the report Allah because English language cannot comprehend they are because Allah when you are speaking to non-muslims so they understand for example when we say there is no God but Allah so when you use the word God to translate Allah because the non-muslim doesn't know what a life I think there is no problem but when Muslims speak among themselves they should use that because Allah for Allah and not the English for God or the word Buddha Etc"
