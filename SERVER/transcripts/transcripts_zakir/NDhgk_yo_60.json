  "transcript": "is it permissible to use toothpaste whilst fasting as far as using toothpaste is concerned most of the scholars say that using toothpaste is permissible including shake bars me alive mercy on him he says that using toothpaste along with toothbrush is like using savak and the prophet has never prohibited using sevak it's perfectly all right it doesn't break the fast but it will be careful that you should not swallow any of it so following any part of the toothpaste is forbidden that there isn't some scholars say it's mahuru thinking oh if someone has toothpaste that has a strong taste and someone solos so that's the reason some say it's discouraged but the right ruling is that as long as you're careful that you don't swallow any part of it you can use a toothpaste and a toothbrush it does not nullify your fast okay excellent"
