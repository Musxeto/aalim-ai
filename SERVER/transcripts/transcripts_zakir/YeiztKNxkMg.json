  "transcript": "there's another question that came on the facebook just now from sheikh for khan why prophet muhammad peace be upon him did not do miracles like the previous prophets to say that prophet muhammad peace be upon him did not do miracles is totally wrong there are various miracles that the prophet did for example the prophet he split the moon it is mentioned in the quran and even scientifically today if you do research you come to know that the moon has got fissure they don't know what the reason is but since the quran says about shakka kamar that the prophet split the moon there's a book written which talks about the miracles of the prophet and there are a couple of hundred miracles mentioned in that that the prophet spoke to animals the tree came and shaded the prophet when you're going for the call of nature there are various miracles but but we muslims don't boast of these miracles the reason we muslims do not boast of these miracles because at the time when the quran was revealed it was not the age of miracles previously was the age of americans at the time of muslim at the time and the remaining miracles which are mentioned in the quran even the prophet miracles but all the miracles that were done by the earlier prophets you cannot prove it now for example musa islam is pretty the sea it mentioned in the quran muslims believe in it can we prove it logically scientifically did musa islam split the sea we cannot isa ala salaam gave life to the dead it's mentioned the bible is mentioned in the quran can i prove it today he gave life to the dead without doubt no prophet split the moon can i prove hundred percent scientifically no i can give okay there are indications that there is a fissure in the moon it may be bigger but no so the miracles are things which science cannot justify at that time so what was the miracle that time may not be a miracle today what we have to analyze today the miracle of the miracle given to the prophet muhammad was the glorious quran quran is the miracle of miracles which can prove itself at that time can even prove today and if we analyze quran has proved itself with the word of god in all the ages when it was revealed it was the age of literature and poetry previously age of miracles quran is a miracle of americans when the quran was revealed it was not the age of america it was the age of literature and poetry the non-muslim the pagan arabs at that time arabic was at its pinnacle the moment they heard the verses of the quran they realized this cannot be from any human being the way it is the words it has to be from god and they accepted islam today is not the age of literature and poetry if i say in a very poetic fashion the world is flat will a modern men believe the answer is no today the age of science and technology today if we test the quran with science and technology you can easily be satisfied that there is not a single verse in the quran which is against established science and though the quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c it's a book of signs s-i-g-n-s it's a book of ayats and there are more than six thousand signs six thousand ayaats in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about sans and i've given a talk on quran and modern science compatible or incompatible if you put the test of science to the quran quran is the only religious book on the face of this who passes the test all the other scriptures they will fail the test and later on there may be another age we don't know what age it will be so alhamdulillah almighty allah gave the miracle of miracles to prophet muhammad and allah says in the quran in surah and kabut chapter 29 verse number 48 that we gave the book to a person who is unlettered the prophet was unlettered he could not read or write so that even the blabbers of vanity would not object that means this quran no one can say that the prophet is author he sought to it that the last and final messenger was unlittered so that no one could lay an allegation the prophet wrote the quran knows bella even the most intelligent man cannot write but even that smallest excuse hardly big enough to hang a fly allah did not give them so that's the reason alhamdulillah the greatest miracle actually was given to the prophet that is the quran which can not only be proof that time it can be proof today and will be able to be proved to be the word of god will eternity inshallah"
