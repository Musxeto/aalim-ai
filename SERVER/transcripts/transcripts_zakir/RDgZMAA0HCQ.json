  "transcript": "the next question from the brother yeah Salam alikum my name is Ry Ahmed I'm in sales and marketing profession well my question to doctor is uh we all know that that the Western media is giving a wrong picture about uh Islam and Muslims we all agree that but the worst part and the painful part is how come in some of the Muslim countries and also in this part of this world even the media is using the same title terrorist and all to those people brother as the question that the non-muslims are using media and unfortunately some of the Muslims are using that word so that's why I'm asking you have to go and ask those people not me you have to ask those people and what happened that many of the Muslim due to ignorant they start agreeing as I give you the example a Muslim coming and telling me the talibans are bad he was ignorant not that he was against Taliban so many of times we get so convinced with the media what what we hear what we see we start believing in it so what we should do we as Muslims should remove the CB even from the eyes of these type of Muslims besides answering the non-muslim media and inshallah we should be logical not just by saying we are right we are right we should prove logically that Islam is the religion of Truth is the religion of peace and only way that there can be total peace in the world is no other way but by Islam Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter number three verse number 19l the only way of life accepted is Islam that is Peace accquired by submitting a will to Allah subhana wa tala"
