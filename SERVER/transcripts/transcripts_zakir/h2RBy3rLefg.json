  "transcript": "and since most of the Muslims they do not understand Arabic as a language and we are non Arabs so there are high chances that our mind will wander to prevent our mind from wandering besides reciting the Arabic text we should simultaneously recall the meaning of what we are reciting in the language we understand the best whether it be in English whether it be in Hindi whether it be in marati whether it be in Gujarati you should recall the meaning of what you are reciting in the language we understand the best for example if you recite F in the name of Allah the most gracious most merciful alhamdulillah all Praises due to Allah the lord of the worlds the most gracious most merciful the master the king of the day of judgment thee alone we worship and thee alone we ask for help guide us to a straight path the path of Those whom you are pleased with not the path of those who deserve your anger nor of those who have gone astray so when you are reciting the Arabic text you should simultaneously recall the meaning meaning of what you are reciting then inshallah your mind will not wander but after a few weeks or a few months even this will become mechanical because our mind it is so powerful so a portion of your mind is used in recalling the Arabic text and the other is used in recalling the meaning so even this will become mechanical but there are less chances that your mind will wander but yet your mind May wander so to prevent this besides recalling the meaning you should concentrate you should Ponder on what you are reciting because a human mind it cannot concentrate 100% on two things either 50% on two different things or 80% 20% on two different things a human mind cannot concentrate 100% or two things besides recalling the meaning we should concentrate on what we are reciting then inshallah our mind will not wander I start my talk with a quotation from the Glorious Quran from chapter number 29 verse number 45 recite from the book what is revealed to thee and establish prayer indeed prayer restraint from shameful and unjust Deeds so in Salah we are being programmed towards righteousness that we have to stay away from shameful and unjust Deeds so Salah Keeps Us away from many evils and for example if the IM after Surah fat he recites Sur MAA chapter number 5 verse number 19 oh you who believe most certainly intoxicant and gambling dedication of stones divination of arrows are an Abomination from Satan's handiwork then abstain from such abomination that he may prosper in Salah we are being programmed towards righteousness that alcohol is prohibited gambling is prohibited fortune telling is prohibited we are being programmed towards righteousness and if the IM after he recites chapter number 5 verse number three forbidden for your food are dead meat blood flesh of wine and any food on which Any Other Name besides Allah's name has been taken these four types of foods they are prohibited for us Muslims so in Salah we are being programmed towards righteousness that dead meat blood flesh of swine and any food on which Any Other Name besides Allah's name has been taken these Foods they are prohibited for us and if the IM for example after Surah fat he recite Surah isra chapter number 17 verse number 23 and 24 and the Lord has decreed that you worship none but him and to be kind to your parents whether one or both of them attain old age say not a word of contempt nor Rebel them but address them in terms of honor and lower to them the wings of humility and say my Lord have mercy on them even as they cherish me in childhood so we are being programmed towards righteousness in our Salah that you have to be kind to our parents we have to respect our parents and if one or both of them attain old age we cannot even say o to our parents we can't disrespect our parents in Salah we are being programmed towards righteousness"
