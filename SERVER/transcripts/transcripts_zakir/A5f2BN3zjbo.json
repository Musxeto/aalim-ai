  "title": "Why do Intelligent Non Muslims still Believe in their Illogical Scriptures? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there is a question from Rio from Indonesia I'm an entrepreneur if it is so obvious that other scriptures other than the Quran have many errors illogical things and invalid things why the smartest people of the world still believe in the scriptures isn't it public by now that their scriptures have errors fabrications concoctions etc we all believe that God's Word cannot be wrong unless those words are human beings words that's a very important question Myra no from Indonesia that how come the people when they know very clearly that Quran is true compared to other scriptures why do yet non-muslim no intelligent and who have the knowledge yet follow the Scriptures basically would have to understand led many a time when it comes to faith people get involved in mind belief and they may be very logically there may be scientists of NASA or they may be big doctors hard specialists but yet they do I know ship and India we have so we wonder how come this is because there's so much engrossed with the society that even if they know the truth they don't want to offend the parents or they say that if we know the truth if we followed we have to leave alcoholism we may have to do things which we don't like and if you read the Quran compared to other scripture Quran many a places that will they not then understand Quran telegrammed afternoon that will you not then understand many a time this is a book for people who understand so Quran is the most logical scripture on the face of the earth and if any non-muslim or any Muslim any human being read it he will understand but people when it comes to religion they believe move in the blind faith as though there is a screen put in front of the eyes and this is the major reason that even though people are educated etcetera they don't accept the truth and it is the Shaitaan who whispers and prevents a person from coming to the straight path so my request always would be that read the Quran with understanding so they're to come to the straight path and it is the duty of a Muslim that we should convey to these non-muslims who are intelligent who understanding who intellectuals to convey the true message of Islam and one of the best talks for such people is Quran and modern science compatible or incompatible and I've given this talk and it will be very beneficial for these people to come to the straight path"
