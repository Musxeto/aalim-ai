  "title": "Applying the Test of Science to the Quran and the Bible - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there may be many human beings who may not be knowing or having a knowledge of the Quran or the Bible so how can we diser which of the two is right or who has copied from whom the best test is the test of science if we put these two scriptures to the test of science we will know the difference of chalk and Chiefs when we read superficially we come to know that the Bible and the Quran are the same but if we do a research or we analyze it we come to know there the difference of chalk and Chiefs when we read the Bible it's mentioned in the first book of the Bible Book of Genesis chapter number one that almighty God he created the Heaven and the Earth in six days and these six days are 24 hours days mention in the Bible the Quran too speaks about the creation of the universe and says almighty God has created the heavens and the Earth in six aams aam is plural of Y one of the meaning of yum is a 24-hour day but the other Arabic meaning of yum is a long period and Epoch today scientists they say that our universe was created in billions of years so to say it was created in 624 days is wrong but the scientists have got no objection with the Quran when the Quran says the heavens and the Earth were created in six aams that is six long periods without defining them to restricted 24 hours furthermore it's mentioned in the Bible in the first book book of Genesis chapter number one verse number 3 to 5 that almighty God he created the day and the night on the first day and he created the light on the first day it later says in Genesis chapter number 1 verse 14- 19 the source of light that is the stars and the sun they were created on the fourth day imagine the effect is created on the first day and the cause of the effect on the fourth day the sun was created and the stars on the fourth day and the light from the sun and the star war sced on the first day it's illogical how can the effect come before the source Quran too speaks about the creation of the Heaven and the Earth but does not give this unscientific sequence furthermore mentioned in the first book of the Bible book of Genesis chapter number one verse 9-13 that the Earth was created on the third day and Genesis chapter number 1 verse number 14 to9 that the sun and the moon was created on the fourth day we know from science that the Earth and the moon are the part of the parent body that is the Sun so to say that the Earth was created before the parent body of the Sun is unscientific the Quran too speaks about creation of the heavens the Sun the Moon and the Earth but it says it was created simultaneously imagine Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam copied from the Bible and he changed the sequence he says no both were created together Bible further says in the Book of Genesis chapter number one verse 9-13 that almighty God created the vegetables and the vegetations on the third day and Genesis chapter number one vers 14- 19 he created the sun on the fourth day scientifically it's not possible that the vegetation can survive without sunlight it's totally unscientific furthermore the Bible says in Genesis chapter number one verse number 16 that almighty God created two great lights the greater light the sun to Rule the Day and the Lesser light the moon to rule the night the Bible says the light of the Sun as well as the light of the moon is its own light the Bible says the light of the moon has its own light but the Quran says in Surah fan chapter number 25 verse number 61 the light of the moon is not its own light it's a reflected light so imagine the prophet copied from the Bible and he made Corrections not the own light it is reflected light it's not humanly possible only one who has this knowledge is almighty God there are several examples you can give a talk only on this and I had a debate with Dr William Campbell on the topic the Quran and the Bible in the light of Science and there I've mentioned many unscientific points mentioned in the bible time does not permit me to go into details the various unscientific things mention in the Bible which is not mentioned in the Quran for example according to the Bible Adam peace be upon him he came into existence about 5,800 years before science tells us that the human beings came into existence millions of years before the Quran too speaks about Adam but does not give a date the Bible says in Genesis chapter number 6 7 as well as8 about Noah and the flood and it says that the full world was submerged underwater at the time of Noah that is approximately 21st 22nd century BC Quran too speaks about new Alam but it does not give it a date it even speaks about the flood but it says it was a localized flood only it flooded the umah the people of new Alam not the full world today archeological evidence shows us that the 11th dynasty of Egypt as well as the third Dynasty of Babylon they existed without interruption since 21st 22nd century BC so archaological evidence says that what is mentioned in the Bible is totally wrong there are various examples we can give hundreds time does not permit so surely this Quran has not been copied from the Bible neither it has been forged as mentioned in the Quran in Sur chapter number 2 verse number one and two it says that do they say he forged it n it is a truth from the Lord so that he may give admonition to the people to whom no Warner has come in the past so surely we can undoubtedly say that neither Prophet Muhammad peace be from the author of the Quran neither did he copy or plagiarize or learn it from any other source"
