  "title": "Religious Clothings Change with Time. Why has the Burka worn by Muslim Women not Changed?",
  "transcript": "my name is ritesh and i'm a student studying 11th standard my question is all the religions have limitations of clothing let me be specific to the women but they've changed with time but why is the burkha still the same why hasn't that changed with time the brother said that by the passage of time every religion has got clothing for women but by the passage of time the clothing keeps on changing but why the muslim woman yet to wear the burka as far as the clothing is concerned brother in islam there are six criteria for clothing for the man it's from the navel to the knee that is the extent it should be covered for the woman the complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and the hands of the rest there are certain scholars who say that even they should be covered the remaining five criteria are the same for the man and the woman the second is the closed way it should not be so tight so that it reveals the figure should be loose the third is it should not be translucent or transparent so that you can see through the fourth is it should not be so glamorous so that it attracts the opposite sex fifth it should not resemble that of the unbeliever and six it should not resemble that of the opposite sex these are basically the six criteria and most of the six criteria are even mentioned in the other scriptures if you read the bible it's mentioned in the bible in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 22 verse number five it says that the woman shall not wear clothes that will pertain it to a man and a man shall not wear clothes that will pertinent to woman all those who do this they are creating an abomination it further mentioned the bible in the first timothy chapter number two verse number nine that the women should be dressed up with shame-facedness and sobriety they should not be a costly array pearls and gold and further it's mentioned in the first corinthians chapter number eleven verse number five to six that the woman that prayed with the head uncovered her head should be shaved off there's no verse in the quran on the hadith which says that the woman who does not cover a head should be shaved off but the bible is stricter bible is stricter than the quran that if the woman that prays does not cover the head that should be shaped off the same thing in the hindu scripture if you read the hindu scriptures it's mentioned ramayan that when pasuram when it comes to rama he says to his wife sita that he the elder therefore lower your gaze and guard your modesty it's further mentioned if you read rigveda book number 10 chapter number 5 verse number 30 it says that the woman who wears the clothes of that of a man she is defiling it she should not be the clothes of a man further it's mentioned that in rigveda book number eight that brahma has ordered that the woman should cover ahead so in hindu scriptures christian scriptures muslim scriptures modesty is there covering the head is there by the passage of time i do agree with you that christianity now you only see the nuns covering the head they are called pious if muslim women cover their hair they are called as subjugated why double standards if you see a nun covered properly therefore you see the photograph of mother mary have you seen the photograph from mother mary like a muslim and she was a muslim muslim woman properly covered with the rest only face fee what i do agree with you if you stick to these six criteria by fashion the types of hijab the burka abaya has changed as long as you follow the six principles of islam and you change the color from black to blue to brown no problem as long as you don't break any of the six criteria therefore you see new new styles of hijab but some styles of burka they are so fashionable that they break the law of islam there are so many shiny sequences coming that are attracting the opposite sex so that is haram but otherwise you want to wear red you want to wear black color no pro people think black is compulsory black is not compulsory if you wear black maybe you may have to wash the porker once in a week if you wear white you may have to wash every day the choice is yours you wear white and wash it every day you wear black and wash it once a week choice is yours as long as it doesn't break any of the criteria's six criterias of hijab so now there are new types of hijab coming as long as it doesn't break you're allowed but it should be modest if it's modest it's accepted [Applause]"
