  "transcript": "And most of us know the dua. Most of the Muslim know this dua. Yes or no? It is a verse of the Quran of Surah Bakra chapter number two verse number 201. Oh my Lord give us the best in this world and the Akar and save me from the torment of hellfire. All of us know yes or no. Okay. Do you know one verse before this? Now who amongst you who's not afid Quran and knows one verse before this? Surah Bakra chapter 2 verse number 200 raise your hand who's not aidul Quran who's not aid Quran and knows the verse before surah bakar chapter 2 verse 201 that is verse number 200 who knows that no one person are you office are you in Quranist If you're half then no you don't qualify for the test. Even my son is half therefore he cannot raise his hand. I told those who are not half is it is such a it is one of the most common dua that Muslims do. Oh my lord give us the best in this world and the and save us from the torment of hellfire. The worst before this Allah says they are the people who pray for when we give them we do not give them and then the verse comes the best of those people who pray you pray for this world best of this world and the hereafter and save us from the torment of the hellfire. So it should not only be beneficial for this world. If your goal is only beneficial in making money in this world only, Allah will not give you a. What is our goal? Jenna. What is the goal of every Muslim? Jenna. What is the purpose of our life? Worshiing Allah so that we go to Jenna. Our purpose is worshiping Allah. What is our goal? Jenna, not dun. But yet you can ask for dunya. The mufaser they say in this dua you asking for three things. Oh my lord give us the best in this world number one the best in aka number two and save us from the torment of hell number three. That means one/ird is for this duny and 2/3 is for a. So the mufaser say that if you ask for dun see you ask for dunya less than a some say maximum not more than that. Some say maximum aka if you ask only for dun Allah will give duny but you will not give a in the other place in the Quran in surah hud Allah says if you ask for dun Allah gives you duny but not aka if you ask for a Allah gives you a and both so the higher level is only ask for a duny comes in that but if you ask for dun also you're permitted Allah says If you ask for a Allah gives you a and dunya both. So our main goal should be aka even if it is 100% aka no problem. Dunya will come as a byproduct. You know byproduct and I'll give you examples in the end of my talk. You do only for a Allah will give you dunya without fail. But if you do only for your akar is gone. And this dunya as compared to a is very small. Average human being live for about 70 75 years. Some may die early 50 years 40 years. Some may die 90 100 not more than that 110 compared to a eternal"
