  "transcript": "um the issue of a man and his wife um perhaps sitting on a sofa or some other place of comfort and the husband delivers a kiss on the wife's face let's say for or the lips of the wife is this an action which nullifies the fast or is permitted while fasting if a husband kisses the wife or hugs the wife or shows his love for the wife by kissing on the cheek or the lip or the hand or hugs or Embraces all these things are permissible as long as it does not encourage him to go into an act which is Haram for fasting and this is very well stated in theith of wasallam it's mentioned in say bukari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1927 that AA Allah be pleased with her she says that the prophet used to kiss and embrace his wives while fasting but he was the best amongst you to control himself that means the prophet had the power to control similarly it's mentioned in Sun Abu da volume number two Hadith number 2379 that Omar be pleased with him once whil fasting kisses his wife immediately he feels sorry and he goes to the prophet and he says that oh Prophet I have sinned I have sinned against you and Allah so the prophet says that what have you done he says that while fasting I've kissed my wife so the prophet asked him that when you goggle or rinse your mouth while doing woodoo does your fast break soed him he said no so why bother and IND to him that you can kiss and embrace your wife furthermore there's a Hadith which is mentioned in musn Ahmed volume number two Hadith number 6739 one of the saah he narrates that a young man comes to Prophet mall wasallam and asks him that can I kiss my wife while I'm fasting the prophet says no later on and old man comes comes to the prophet and asks him that can I kiss my wife while fasting and the prophet says yes so the sahaba look amongst themel that how come the answer differing then the prophet replies that this man can control himself so the basic ruling is that if a person knows that he can control himself after kissing or hugging his wife and sure that it will not lead into an act which will nullify the fast for example it will not lead into a sexual intercourse or will not lead into ejaculation as long as he can control himself kissing and hugging is permitted if he cannot control himself and he fears that he will go into the ACT which will nullify the fast like intercourse or ejaculation then it is prohibited for him"
