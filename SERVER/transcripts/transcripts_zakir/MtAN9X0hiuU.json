  "title": "Which comes First, Humanity or Religion? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there's a question posed by tufail fayaz from kashmir it's on the whatsapp just came which comes first humanity or religion regarding the question which comes first humanity or religion it depends upon which religion are you talking about some religions it may come later as far as islam is concerned a muslim is not a good muslim unless he's a good human being first so in islam all the aspects of humanity are covered so if you ask the question which will come first humanity or islam i would say islam because islam encompasses humanity it's like asking would you like to pass school or would you like to pass graduation when you pass graduation is understood that a passing school also without passing school you cannot pass graduation so islam is far superior it includes all the aspects of humanity there is not a single teaching of islam which is against humanity people may think it is but the moment you realize the logical reason why that rule has been prescribed in islam there is not a single teaching of islam which is against humanity as a whole so i would say between the two between humanity and islam of course islam is number one that is the reason it's clearly mentioned in the quran in surah ibraham chapter number three verse number 19 in nadine islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah is islam"
