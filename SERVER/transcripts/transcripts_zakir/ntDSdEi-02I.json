  "title": "Pascal Challenges Dr Zakir for a Debate to Prove 25 Points where Jesus (p) Claimed Divinity",
  "transcript": "my name is pascal i'm a christian by faith i'm 69 years old i'm embassy postgraduate in mathematics i'm a retired college lecturer for my government veterinary college now you quoted from the acts of the apostles what peter addressed to the people now the same peter says in john 6 chapter 67 68 69 then jesus said to the twelve do you also want to go away then simon peter answered unto him lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life also we have come to believe and know that you are the christ the son of the living god then christ said blessed are those solomon but jonah it is not flesh and blood that i've revealed it to you but my father himself who is in heaven now to your question i answered this question i got here 25 points to your asana who can say that christ claimed himself to be the son of god i have here 25 instances but i don't waste no time i need a public debate with you if you are ready to agree not just one day yes 7 day public debate with you i cannot contradict every statement of yours what you said about christianity and with my un maintain my stance pastor my dear pastor no pastor michael pastor has asked a good question no pascal gospel of john and he quoted that peter said that jesus christ for son of god i'll answer this so remaining 24 points my student will answer there are thousands of people in the world who want to debate with me what i say there's a criteria for me to debate i'll come to that afterwards first i will answer your question first i'll answer your question you quote from gospel of john that peter said jesus christ for son of god brother my statement was if you remember i will repeat it there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that i am god or where he says worship me i want to add and including you if any christian can point out a single statement from any version of the bible any unambiguous statement any unequivocal statement where jesus christ peace be upon himself says that i am god or worship me three words i am god or word ship me two words i am right to accept christianity today that is i am ready to put my head on the guillotine i am not speaking on behalf of my other muslim brothers they may not be well versed in the bible now what you quoted to me is not fulfilling my criteria yet i will answer what you quoted is peter is saying that jesus christ the son of god brother do you know in the bible there are sons by the tongues god has got sent by the tongues adam was son of god ephraim was son of god israel was son of god all those who are led by the spirit of god are sons of god so son of god is a word used in the bible means a person who follows the teachings of god almighty if you follow the teachings of god almighty according to the bible you're also son of god if i follow the teachings of god i'm son of god if you read in the romans chapter number eight all those that are led by the spirit of god are called sons of god so what is new about it i will help you i will help you your 24 points inshaallah your 24 points my student will reply i will help you you know christian mystery says no no no no no jesus christ peace be upon him is not normal son he is the begotten son and they quote gospel of john chapter number three verse number 16 for god soul of the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not die but of everlasting life whether this verse i'm quoting from king james version it's in red letter for god so loved the world he has given his begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall have everlasting life now this word begotten son which is there in the gospel of john chapter 3 verse 16 in the king james version brother are you listening to me yes yes if you can't do two things at the same time then you say i did not listen yes yes i listen so how can you read and listen at the same time are you a superhuman being i just referred to answer to your question whether you listen to me you can have a debate with my student you come now yes i want to debate with you with me you're not about debating brother i'll come to it later on so the begotten son is begotten means sired by god because it means it's a lower function of animal sex it's an insult to almighty god so that's the reason in the revised standard version revised by titus scholars of the highest eminence backed by 50 different corporate and christian denominations they said that this word begotten in gospel of john chapter 3 verse number 16 was the interpolation for the concoction was the fabrication and they threw it out of the bible who not muslims not hindus thaidou scholars of the highest eminence backed by 50 different cockpit denominations in the revised standard version of the bible rsv they have removed this word begotten as interpolation as a fabrication as a concoction so if you say son of god i really agree that jesus christ was son of god meaning he was a godly person where do i disagree but he never claimed he was god as far as the other part 24 questions that you have you want to debate me if you want to debate me there are some criteria there are some criteria i wouldn't mind debating anyone who on his own can at least gather 10 000 people if you can give a public
