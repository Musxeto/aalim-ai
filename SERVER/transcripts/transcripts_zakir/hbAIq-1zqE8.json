  "transcript": "the topic of this last short talk in the month of Ramadan is from this Ramadan to the next Ramadan and I played her last mahan hotel and I hope that almost all the viewers who are watching they may have fasted for the complete month of Ramadan and inshallah I hope and I pray that all of you may have done your km breed there Hamel L in all the nights of Ramadan and surely you may have kept a week for the last ten nights so that you get the laser cutter a last one services in the world for an inferior facility chapter number 41 what's the matter T that those who say that Allah is my Lord and they are steadfast and firm the Angels descend down from time to time and they say that do not fear nor have any grieve for there is glad tidings that inshallah you shall enter Jannah you shall enter the Bliss so yeah last manner that I say in this verse in surah fussilat chapter number 41 was the 30 that all those who say that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala is the Lord they believed in tawheed and they are steadfast and firm the Angels descend down and they tell them they do not grieve nor have any fear and they give them glad tidings the Bashara of jannah of paradise of eternal bliss a similar message is repeated in surah al-kahf chapter number 46 was the may 13 with faith indeed those who say that our Lord is Allah and they steadfast and firm they shall have no fear nor shall they grieve and the next verse says was the before team that they shall be companions of the garden of Jena a beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said it's mentioned in sahih muslim war in number one hadith number 450 a lot messenger said that the five daily Salah the five daily prayers and from one Juma to the next Jamaa and from randomed on to the next Ramadan is expression of all your sins as long as you keep away from the major sins our beloved prophet has said that when you purify time Salah or from one Juma to the other or form on remnant with the other Amin as long as you are steadfast in this allah subhanaw taala forgive all your sins as long as you stay away from the major sins and it's mention in say Buhari world number eight hadith number six four six five I shall read Allah on huh she asked the Prophet that which deed is the most beloved to allah subhanaw taala and the Prophet applies that Allah loves those deeds which are constant and then regular even if they may be small the deeds that are done regularly are more beloved to Allah even if they are small that means we have to be constant in it we have to be steadfast we have to be firm in it a hamdulillah we pray to allah subhanaw taala that may he accept our fasting our km i would do i lay together and me forgive all our sins now since we hardly have in malaysia hardly one hour 45 minutes before Amnon ends in other parts of the world few us and some parts in Indian subcontinent one day and few us since Ramadan is going to end what is our duty what is our role from this from none to the next Ramzan and it's very important that all of us that we were so steadfast in our km in our charity in our dois in our supplication in our repentance and all these things we pray to Allah samatha me we remain the same throughout the year the best for us Muslim is to continue doing all the deeds that we have been doing in the month of Ramadan if we cannot and at least continue most of it but one thing that minimum should be done is that what you were doing before the start of the Sun Don in the earlier month of Shaban and Raja etc after the from nan it should be better than the months that were prior to the month of Ramadan minimum this a minimum let me give an example that made me some of the Muslims may not be very particular in this Allah may be there offering only three times the four times Allah see to it this was before him that see to it that after I'm done you pray all the fight time for Salah if maybe you are praying at home and didn't go to the mosque before the sermon and see to it that after this Rahman you pray five times in Jamaat in the mosque because it's affirm for the men to pray in JAMA in the mosque and some scholars like him a murder beef if it did a media thing if you do not pray in JAMA in the mosque without a valid reason maybe some of us are praying five times Allah but before a man we will not bring the Sunnah Tim McDonough after him Nancy to it then you start facing the maquis de if you were pretty soon as I'm walking up before Amnon start varying tahajud the camel l or start praying the Salah to Doha after sunrise if you're praying all these then at least after amlong you start praying some of the girl mafada that's tender huh you should see to it that you should pray much more than what you were praying before the start of this from done so your salah your km should increase more after the sermon there are other things that you should take care of if you were giving charity seated that you increase in your charity if you are not giving any extra charity besides the zakat the default see to it that you start giving charity after the front line and my suggestion is that you commit a percentage of your earnings in charity in the way of allah subhanaw taala besides the farthest occurred that you have to be maybe you can start with five percent of your earnings every month giving charity increase the ten percent and believe me the more charity you give the balanced amount which is pending with you it will be much more than what it was before my physician is make Allah subhana WA Ta'ala your partner in your business give maybe twenty percent of your income whether it be a salary with a business earning 30 percent my physician is that if you want to be on the high level see to it that you give more of your earnings in charity and keep less give more than 50 percent of your earnings of your sanity of your income of your profit well mahalo make a me apartment may give me a major partner see to it that you will benefit more than what you were before even in this world levy even if you're poor allah subhanaw taala at the percentage not at the amount maybe there's a rich person who'll earning a million dollar a month and he gives $10,000 a month in charity there may be a poor man who may be earning $1,000 but he he may be giving $100 in charity the rich person was earning a million dollar in giving $10,000 in charity he is giving 1% of his earning in charity the poor person was earning $1,000 and giving $100 he's giving 10 percent of his earnings that means the poor man inshallah will get ten times more Sahab even though he's given hundred dollar as compared to the rich man who's given ten thousand dollars and my suggestion is that all of those who have not committed commit a percentage of your earning in the way of allah subhanaw taala if you have committed increase your percentage if you are giving five and if ten percent if you are giving ten give twenty percent if you are giving twenty if 30 percent if you're having 30 to 40 if you are getting forty to fifty my physician is give more than 50 percent of your earnings in the way of allah subhanaw taala and the barrel is remaining with you will inshallah be much more than what it was before increase in charity and Allah smart Allah promises in surah bakra chapter number 2 verse number 261 that if you for one grain of corn in the way of Allah's Muhammad Allah Allah will give you seven years each year having hundred grains that means one grain you give in the way of allah subhanaw taala allah will give you 700 grains that means 700 times profit in in business terminology allah will give me seventy thousand percentage of profit in no business I know do you get seventy thousand percent profit seven hundred times Rafi's analyst Muhammad Allah increase your charity increase your recitation of the Quran increase your fasting now in the month of Ramadan it's the front first this is the only furthest for Muslim after him done see to it they do continuing a fasting and the beloved prophet said that all those who Creek all those who keep the fig first of shawol after the first of Ramadan it is as though they are fasted for the full year now how does the person calculate why did the Prophet say six fast why didn't he say five fast or seven fast the focus they say Allah says that he increases the reward minimum ten times so if you calculate the full month of Ramadan that you fasted one lunar month has got 29 and a half days sometime 29 sometime 30 so 29 and a half multiplied by 10 becomes 295 days then additionally six days multiplied by 10 becomes 60 days so 295 plus 60 is 255 and a lunar year has got to 54 years 254 days one lunar year has 254 days that that is in the Prophet says that if you follow up with your fasting or from nan you first it was the full year follow up with six days of shore while it is as though you have fasted for the full year then after that there are other fasts that you can keep and we know that a beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said that the best fast after the first fast of ramadan is the first of Muharram and if you fast in a Shura a beloved portion of salah salem said that all the sins of a previous you year are forgiven the other fast which is very important after the room after Amnon first is the fast on Arafah the day of Arafah the ninth of the lodge and the Prophet said that if you fast on the day of Arafah if you're not doing pilgrimage it's not doing hajj then Allah will forgive your past the sins of your past one year and the sins of one year ahead the future year and the best is to fast all the first nine days of Cilicia and along with the faster of Ashura if you can fast the ninth day or the leaven that is good if you fast nine eleven nine ten and eleven that's the best there's the fast which I recommend by the Prophet is that you fast on the I am will be the white days the days of the full moon that the thirteenth fourteenth and fifteenth of the lunar year and the Prophet said if you first three days of I am will bid three days every month it is as though you have fasted the full year again the same logic three days Monday blind by ten become 30 days so every month if you fast for three days your fasting for the full month if you fast every three days of every if you fast three days of every month we have fasted for the full year the Prophet also recommended us that we should fast on Mondays and on Thursdays and these with the two days that the Prophet fasted and so these are the options that I've been given by the Prophet that after the first fast you can fast and one of the best fast if the maximum you can fast is the fasting of the other is Allah and the Prophet said that the less alarm fasted every alternate day of the year that the maximum to fast all the days of the year it is prohibited the maximum we can fast is alternate days but naturally besides the day which I recommended as I mentioned earlier so the option is yours so once you have finished the first we know from man you continue fasting as much as you can in the option that have been given and a request that at least you'll don't miss the fostering of Ashura the fasting of village' and the fasting of sure what if you can file the am will be the also if you can first also fast on Mondays and Thursdays and the maximum anyone can do is the fasting of the other ha every alternative the you as I mentioned first about the camp I mentioned about the charity I mentioned about saum fasting then is reading of the Quran read the Quran as much as you can maybe in them manually you are reading the Quran but after I'm done you stop reading see to it you start reading if you were reading maybe for 15 mins before I'm done after am landing at least half an hour if you are reading half an hour before a man start looking for 45 minutes read as much as you can there is a Glade in Essaouira increase in your supplication in your du'a as many as you can after the Salah the other door for daily activity feed with you increase increase in istaghfar and asking for forgiveness asking for repentance if as much as you increase it's better so after I'm done you should find a marked change in most of your Amada as compared to before I'm done and today is the last day of Ramadan in most parts of the world some parts in the second last day we hardly have about maybe one and a half hour left in Malaysia before we end up none few hours in other parts of the world maybe more as in other parts of the world see to it that before the Devils are Unchained you make a decision you make a commitment to yourself that inshallah after him that I'll primo beside the fourth fella so not a mocha - and nothing you're a mocha da you should read the kmk I'm longer if you're reading 15 minutes in if I have enough you ready - I read for one hour feet when you do read Salah to do as much as you can see to do increase in a charity before there are none ends see to it that you have to keep more form what you were keeping before him that increase in your recitation of the Quran in your application in your expect fire in asking for forgiveness see to it that you're a bada and as a whole what your life was before the start of this from none should be much more after from the names people normally ask me that why very often the Muslims after amnon you see that many of the Muslims they bother goes down there to the Adam goes down why what is the reason one of the reason is that many of us Muslims we do the activities of Raman and more as a custom rather than a bada you know it's customary for most of the Muslims norm Nana's come okay we have to pay sorry they will not mr. avi they may miss the Phi J's are high in the morning you know but for the father that I was from the machina but because it is a custom they follow more of the culture rather than the Dean for the particular what the custom and the neglect different the other reason is because many of the friends are doing the activities they joined them and as though it's part of a friendly gathering rather than I bada and they do the activities without paying attention on the main reasons and the purpose of these activities are from that the third reason can be because of the weak faith that the enthusiastic they do in the month of Ramadan and they will do it and you find in in many countries in the first few days of Ramadan the mosque a full father AVI and then it keeps on declining and it is the least towards the end we should not be the case and the last and the media reason is because the Satan and the Devils they are chained during them man so you find they bother as more the activity more after Amnon Unchained and that's the reason that we go back to our old our own habits what is the solution for this the solution for this is that number one you should have faith in Allah subhana Allah Allah says in the Quran in surah Imran chapter 3 was 160 if Allah helps you then you know for me if Allah fostex you then who is there then who can help you so let the believers put their faith in Allah subhanAllah put the trash nellis man number one is have faith and trust in Allah if Allah is with you no one can overcome you no one can defeat you if Allah for six you then no one can help you the best I can do if from surah al-imran chap number three was the eight receive rabbun allah to the illumina by the Sudeten bob lana min ladunka rama in the cantle Wahab RAB bana loud to lucuma rub-rub Anna the oh my lord let not my heart deviate let not my heart deviate after the how I see I did it you are the one who I give her bounties and you love forgiving people sin so here we're praying to Allah subhana allah rabbun allah to zero-lube on our bodies hidayet on our hobbling a min ladunka Rama in Antal Wahab that let not my heart give it after you have guided that mineral man we were the highest of a bada we were the best through a plane to Allah so Allah that once am guided has let not hot David and you are the one will give her of bounties and of mercy and blessings so ask Allah for help we read to him that he keeps you on the same path and steadfast as you in the month of Ramadhan number to see to it that you and the company of the MU Turkey and the company of those who are more pious one more righteous because the company influences you a lot see dude that your friend that those friends that offer fight em Salah in the mosque see to it that your friends are those which keep away from the major films as well as from the minor sins see to it that you have friends who always do all the Friars who do as much as most of as possible so when you end the company and in the Satan tries to deviate you these friends will keep you on the straight path so it is very important that you keep friendship of the people who are most turkey who aconitine who are what I chase what devote who on the straight path number three regularly as often as possible keep on attending the Duras the lectures talks of the scholars authentic and who get you closer to allah and his anniversary number four read books read the quran he needed along with the translation so let your heart softened let your heart cry read the translation of the Quran if you don't understand Arabic if you know Arabic reading the Quran is sufficient read the book of the seed of the prophet of of the hill for as dean of the sahabas here the lectures of the scholars the videos you can hear the audios you can go on the social media of the Islamic sites at authentic like Islam Q&E you can go on my website zakir naik calm which has been drawn recently on the first of ramadan you can go to other other authentication media but see to it that it goes to those social media those sites which are thirty so this will keep you reminding of allah subhanaw taala of the beloved prophet of the akhira and we see to it that keeps you on the straight path this was in short the guidance that I can give the viewers regarding the activities of from this from the tunics on done so that our a bada increases I will close this philosopher natal increases and inshallah our chances of entering the Jannah also increases"
