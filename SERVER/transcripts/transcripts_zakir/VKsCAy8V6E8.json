  "transcript": "the first question that we have that has been selected on the whatsapp is from abdul haman from india presently working in kuwait as a mechanical engineer you are my favorite in the field of dawah your speech is very logical and intellectual alhamdulillah i love you i love you too i feel you are one of my family members i feel the same all the muslims are brothers and to one another brothers and faith inshallah i am your follower since 2011. i always share your videos to my family members and encourage them to watch it as you know for muslims it is getting very difficult to live in india i feel allah is testing the iman of indian muslims through the ruling party the ruling government propagates false news about you and files false cases against you you are a very famous person and you have good links with other countries so you were able to do hijrah to malaysia alhamdulillah allah saved you there are many cases like this in india against muslims false cases are filed and false arrests are made under uapa act the common muslims don't have the opportunity or the option to do hijrah so what is your advice for common muslims who undergo a similar situation like you in india how muslims can handle or tackle this type of issue the brothers asked a very important question a very sensitive question seeing the situation of india as i mentioned in the message of the independence that since the last four to six years there is a lot of onslaught against the muslim minorities in india and you find a lot of lynching a lot of attacks on the muslims it has been difficult for muslims to live they are being harassed they are being persecuted they are being oppressed and so on and so forth so the question posed by with abdul rahman is that i was able to hijra what should the common muslims in india do in such a situation i can give my advice it can be in two different categories one is muslims as a whole as ummah in india what they should do and muslims on individual level as far as the muslims in india as a whole number one they should be united unfortunately the muslims are divided in india divided on bases of different sects in islam divided on bases of different organizations divided because they belong to different political parties they belong to different social organizations and this is the major problem amongst the muslims living in india allah says in the quran in surah al-imran hold all together strongly to the rope of allah and be not divided we muslims should be united holding to the rope of allah the rope of allah is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith of a beloved prophet muslim if all the muslims in india hold strongly to the glorious quran and to the authentic hadith of a beloved prophet muslim inshallah we will be a strong force we will be united and will be a forbidden power mashallah unfortunately we muslims as i mentioned we are divided into different sects in islam and the different groups the different religious groups in india they are fighting among themselves they are criticizing each other they're attacking each other this is totally uncalled for there is no problem that there are different groups as far as religious organizations are concerned as far a difference of opinion is concerned but as a whole the muslims should be united and the best uniting factor is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith we muslims should agree to disagree there can be many religious organizations no problem but we should not fight with one another allah says in the quran it's foreign number five verse number two that help one another in bir and taqwa in righteousness and good deeds number two we are divided politically some of the muslims they support political party a some support political party b some support political parties see and what happens our words get divided and the net result is zero do you know that we muslims alhamdulillah according to the official statistics of the indian government more than 10 years back it says that muslims are 14.2 percent and a few years back they said that we are more than 200 million muslims in india and i'm aware that they are not counting many muslims in assam and many parts of india actually according to me the muslims will be close to 250 to 300 million in india the actual figure the government suppresses the figure officially indonesia is considered as a country which has the maximum number of muslims about 240 million muslims are according to me number one in the world the country which has maximum number of muslims it is my beloved country india minimum 250 to 300 million but even if you count and you agree with the government statistics that we have about 200 million what we should do that politically we should have only one party we muslims should make another party exclusively only for muslims and this party should be a force by itself irrespective of whichever group of muslims you belong to whichever sect of muslim do we belong to whichever mother you belong to whichever religious organization you belong to whichever social muslim organization belong to we muslim should only have one political party and this political party should join hands with the other political parties which are not faces which are not communal number one they should join hands with the talents the dallas in india also are about 300 million unfortunately during voting they are counted as hindus and the dalits are not hindus babasa ambedkar had left hinduism and he loved islam but unfortunately the muslims didn't welcome them so he chose the second best which was buddhism so the new buddhists they are hindus but for the political gain these parties they count them as hindus and they take benefit of them but these ballots are also being persecuted in india so what we should do we muslims should join hands with the dallas so that we'll be close to 600 million more than 40 percent of the population we can join hand with the other minorities and then we will be a bigger force and depending upon the situation where you are even if you feel that we cannot come to power we should support those parties which are non-communist those parties which care for humanity not those parties will divide the country on the basis of religion not those parties that persecute the minorities that do not give the rights to the minorities and if you see in the islamic history the best religious group that ever gave rights to the minority other muslims the minorities in a muslim rule get all their rights and they are protected by the muslim rulers and even today you see that in muslim majority country whether it be the gulf country whether it be other muslim countries the hindus are there but they aren't being persecuted they aren't being forced to sell law so we should support politically those non-muslim parties we can join with them our muslim party have a coalition no problem but individually all the muslims of india should be united what happened nowadays that one muslim joined political party a the second muslim joins political party b third muslim joins political party c fourth muslim joint political party d one hindu comes and stands alone in a muslim majority area which may be having 75 percent muslims the muslim votes are divided and this hindu comes and wins the election in a muslim majority area why because muslims are divided we are foolish so if we muslims are united and we have one force unfortunately unfortunately we don't find a single good muslim politician in india who we can say that he really cares for the deen of allah and the muslims more than his personal gain so we muslims should be united under one political party and should keep our differences aside and keep our personal preferences today what we find that one non-muslim political party makes a muslim as a member of rajya sabha so he supports the political party even if that party is against the muslim he supports them unequivocally without any condition it's a shame these muslims are selling the muslims of india the major problem is that we muslims don't have a leader in india we have lack of leadership not only in india throughout the world so my suggestion would be that the muslims should join together forget our differences like if you see the history of the khulafarashideen when they ruled when they were khalifas they were first interested in seeing that they did not disappoint allah they were least bothered about their personal gain about the benefit of the family about the luxury they were more bothered about are they pleasing allah or not today unfortunately we don't have such politicians if we follow quran and sunnah and stick to it and the muslims are united inshallah no one will be able to trample us in this country of india this is number one requirement collectively as a muslim ummah number two individually as a muslim what can you do in such a situation what can you do when the muslims aren't joining together when they aren't uniting when they are divided what as you individual muslim who cares for the deen who wants to follow allah and his command what should you do number one as a muslim you should see to it that you are doing your eyes you are doing all the first as much as mustap that you can you are doing it freely and india is one of the few countries in the world which mentions the constitution that every citizen of india irrespective whichever religion he belongs to he can preach practice and propagate his religion and i did that for more than 25 years only in the last few years as i mentioned earlier that when this new government came the faces government came and they changed the full scenario of india we have proceeded that we get back where we had the freedom so number one a muslim should follow his deen if you feel that you cannot practice your eyes you cannot do most of your sunnah then allah clearly mentions in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 97 that you have to do hijrah and i've discussed this in detail in my earlier answer it's the first hijra can be of various types number one if you have the means and the possibilities to go to a muslim majority country that would be the best and the person who asked the question himself is living in kuwait which is the muslim majority country you can do hijab permanently you can do partially you can do temporary depending upon the situation number two i don't expect and i've given this in my early answer that muslims should leave india i don't expect that i'm talking of individual case that if you are and if the persecution gets so much like it happened in my case that's a different situation i don't expect all the muslims of india to live in they're not at all that's not the solution the solution is number one politically we should become united we should have one force join hands with dalits and the other people who have more human values and see to it that we follow the constitution of india of equality if you cannot and i don't expect people to leave the country what you can do is you can shift or do hijra to a different state which is more lenient towards muslims and one of the best examples that i can think of amongst all the states of india that we have 29 states the best state that i can think of it is kerala where kerala alhamdulillah has about one-third hindus one-third christian and one-third muslims and there the people of kerala are not communal nature the people of different religions they live harmoniously have been to kerala many times there is no friction between different religions they have their religious activities and all of them can propagate the religions peacefully and this government doesn't have much hold in the state of kerala so one of the best options that if you want to do hijrah to another state i would say kerala there are some states which are less communal they are but less as compared to some states which are very communal the less commonly would be bombay where i come from or maybe hyderabad or some other some are very commonly like up etc so depending you can uh to another state or maybe in your state to a different city which is less community or maybe in your city live in an area which is most safe like in bombay one of the safest place to live is dongri it is baikalla all these areas have got percent ninety-five percent muslim some are very diverse and muslim so depending upon the situation if collectively the muslim mumbai is not coming together and they are not doing the job they aren't following quran sunnah you as individual muslims should follow the quran sunnah and see to it that if it's difficult where you're living you do hijrah to another state or to another city or to another area in your city itself depending on situation i know doing hijra is not easy you may have to go to a new place you may have to sell your house we are living and go to a new house but this is the advice given to us in the quran if you are really a very famous personality and the government will come after you in any state then the best is to do hijrah outside the country if you cannot do permanently you can seek a job in a muslim country in the gulf country depending upon the situation but allah is very clear cut in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 97 98 99 100 that if you are living in a non-muslim content you cannot follow your deen you have to do hijab unless if you don't have the power if you don't have the capability and the capacity then allah will forgive you if you're among the weak and the oppressed this was in brief and i prayed for asthma they made the muslims of india they unite together religiously unite together socially the unite together politically and become one united force inshallah we will get back our past glory that we have inshallah hope that answers the question"
