  "transcript": "is it permitted in supplication to negotiate with Allah subhah wa ta'ala the question is he goes on to say for example ask Allah to grant me something or forgive me and take something else away from me instead like my health for instance when we supplicate to Allah subhana tala we have to remember that Allah subhana wa tala's Mercy is beyond limits his Mercy his grace we cannot limit the mercy of Allah subhana we cannot try and negotiate or neither can we ask Allah subhana wa tala to H the punishment or you know that you give me this good thing and take this away as they were negotiating we should realize that Allah subhana wa tala is the most Bountiful and most merciful and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 40 verse number 60 you ask me and I will answer your prayer Allah further says in Surah n 4 verse number 147 that what will Allah gain by a punishment if you believe and if you're grateful that means it's not worth negotiating Allah subhana tala what if you want you can ask him you cannot B with him because he is so merciful in fact it will be our loss if you do that and that reminds me of Hadi of say Muslim volume four book of Hadith number 6501 that once mamam he goes to one of the Muslims who's sick and he goes to see and the person is very sick Hadith says ask Fe as the chicken Prophet wasallam asked him that did you ask for something or did you beg Allah for something so the person says yes I pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that to hasten My Punishment what I'm going to get in let me have it in this world and then Allah's messenger says that you don't have the forbearance to Bear the punishment of Allah subhana tala in fact you should have asked that's what I quoted earlier that oh Lord give us the good in this world and the Hereafter and save us from the torment of Hellfire Surah bakar chapter number two verse number 2 And1 and after Prophet mallalli wasallam prayed for him then that Muslim became all right so we should always realize that the Bounty of Allah subana tala is beyond limits so whatever may be a sin whatever may be the sin we have committed we can always seek Allah's forgiveness and he is most of forgiving most merciful"
