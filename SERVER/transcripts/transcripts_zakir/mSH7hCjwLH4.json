  "transcript": "next question muhammad ali talal from islamabad pakistan recently i have completed my 12 years education and i have decided to become a professional dai masala in short i have decided to be like sheikh ahmad and you please guide me about such a proper path so that i can also earn enough to carry my dhawa mission throughout my life my parents are blessed enough to send me abroad for study should i go to madina in a city or somewhere in makkah or just study in pakistan should i go to some madrasa or some university should i first become a scholar of islam and then die or can directly jump into dhawa a similar question is asked by naseem from bangladesh i want to educate my son in islamic education please tell me the names of some islamic educational institutions inside and outside bangladesh from which my child can acquire knowledge of quran and hadith i want my child to acquire the highest knowledge of islam in the light of quran and sunnah as far as these questions asked is concerned in the first question the first part of the question was that how can that i want to become a professional die so how can i earn my living so that i can continue doing my profession of dawah and this question was asked to me during the last session i'll just repeat in brief the best is that if your parents are wealthy and they can support you and they can take care of your day-to-day day-to-day expenses and you continue doing dawah and you and you make your life work for us that is the best if your parents are well off and they do it is the best number two the second best can be that if allah has given you that acumen and and that knack of doing business and being successful in business you can spend a small portion of your time maybe five percent of your time in doing some business as a small part-time which can get you sufficient money so that you can lead your life as far as i'm concerned mashallah in the initial stages my my parents supported me fully completely financially they said you need not do any profession and alhamdulillah my parents and my brother and later on i started doing my own business and i have to spend about a few hours a week not during office time during you know normally people are one or two days off in a week you know one day off a few hours in a week maybe one or two days in a month and that time i have to do business and in that business allah blessed me so much that i started earning more than my parents more than my brother and al hamdulillah i have to utilize the small portion of it for my family and the major person has to give in charity so first is the family if they can support you number one second is you can do a business if allah has given the acumen and the best example is off of the sabbah abdulrahman bin of may allah be pleased with him people used to say that whatever we touched it became gold when when they migrated the sabbath to madina and when ansar were willing to help them he said no show me the place to the market he went to the market and came back with enough wealth because i had given him that gift number three as i mentioned earlier is that the rich muslims can make a fund for supporting the diets the dwats so that they need not worry about the living and they support them so the rich people get the sabab of the dawah which the guys are doing without the sabab of the day reducing number four you can join an organization you can join islamic organization which is of your school of thought which is according to quran and sunnah you join them and if they can pay you a salary even it may be less than the others you're doing both together doing dhawa in the organization and even getting a salary and the last resort the fifth is you can join a halal company it may not be an islamic organization it may be a muslim company not lit with dhawa it can be a non-muslim company as long as it is halal see to it that that company has two days off in a week the timings are less it is as per the government rules so that you have about 50 percent of your time more than that for doing dawah these are the various options that will take care of your day-to-day living inshallah as far as the second question is concerned that which university should you join should you go abroad madina makkah or pakistan or the lady who has asked in bangladesh which is the university that i would recommend according according to my knowledge one of the best universities that i feel that can give the knowledge of quran and say hadith it is yamunta imam it is imam in mohammed a south university imam mohammed bin saudi university which is in riyadh in saudi arabia but unfortunately this university is mainly for saudis only a very small percentage may be two three or four percent initially it was one person now i think it's four percent of the foreigners are allowed so very small portion allowed so to get admission you know like in india i think the court has won a year so thousands of people apply only one they select from the thousands playing similarly from each country they have a very minute number of people but alhamdulillah when i approached the dean director at that time i i said that why don't you allow all our students who have passed from islamic international school to join the university and alhamdulillah 14 that passed seven wanted to take the mainstream become doctors engineer seven wanted to take the dhawa field and all seven of them alhamdulillah got admission into the imam university in riyadh the other good university it is the islamic university of madina that's in saudi arabia this university one of its purpose was to give admission even to foreigners so 50 of the students are saudis 50 of foreigners so they have a quota maybe of 40 or 50 students from from india each year a bigger number from pakistan they have a quota from bangladesh here is is much easier as compared to getting into imam but yet it's difficult there are hundreds and thousands of flying and yet the quota is limited so according to me the other good university is the islamic university of madina the other good is also the from makkah for a foreigner i would i would prefer that for a foreigner he can go to islamic university of madina and but only going to the university is not sufficient besides studying the university you should also attend the truth of the scholars there are many scholars giving jurors giving lectures taking sessions in in madina in the prophet's mosque outside even in in makkah and even in ryan the kobar ulma there are many great scholars in riyadh and even in riyadh uk so the one of the thing is besides going to university i would also recommend that you attend the gurus of the great scholars this will help you more than studying university so doing simultaneously it is it is the best so i recommend that you can go to any any of this university regarding the third part of the question that should i first become a scholar of islam and then die or directly jump into dhawa see to become a scholar of islam is a very great word i don't consider myself to be a scholar of islam i'm just a guy scholar you have to have a great deal of knowledge so person who does graduation from the islamic university i don't consider that he's a scholar some may be but not all neither is the person who has done masters neither person will run his phd i consider these people are students of knowledge a scholar is someone who is a muslim someone who is an island there the difference between getting an alim degree from a madrasa or a university and being a true alim or a true scholar the world of a difference so the thing is there that i believe today in the world there are very few scholars of islam a scholar is a mushahid a person who is a fakhe not getting a degree of fake but actual fakey and a beloved prophet muslim said that propagate even if you know one of us so even if you know one verse about islam as long as you know it correctly you have to propagate it so you don't have to wait till you become a scholar you whatever you know you can start doing dawah immediately but the role of a good guy is that he listens to the scholar he reads the books of the scholars the the the teachings from the quran say hadith the sabbas the you have the khulafarasyadeen you have the ayamas then you have the mushtah they have the shekhal islam and you have the present day they read and what fatwa the scholars have given the daily makes it acceptable to the masses adai need not be a scholar he can be a scholar but a need not be a scholar and most of the guys in the world today aren't scholar even i don't consider myself to this call i'm just a student of knowledge but for a general muslim it is his duty that he should convey the message even if he's not a student of knowledge whatever little bit he knows he knows there's one god you know there's one allah okay convey that he knows that mohammed sallallahu the last and final messenger he has to convey that so whatever you know even one ayah according to the prophet you have to convey it to the others"
