  "transcript": "thank you you have any other question you said there had two question yes but then if the organizer okay has enough time no because we allow the other I would give the same thing to you brother okay so this is just a short question so earlier on you were talking about um Muslim uh should not pray towards the idol or object or any thing because God is formless and he is beyond our comprehension so from my understanding from just what I've observed it I probably believe it's wrong but when the Muslims perform their pilgrimage at meccah the direction of prayers are facing towards a stone pillar in the center so what is uh isn't this contradicting to what very good question the brother asked a very good question that if Islam is against idol worship I did not say God is formless I said God is imageless so the difference between formless and imageless if you interpret y there'll be a big big blunder I said God is imag I said God is formless the difference between formless and imageless coming to a main question that if Islam is against idol worship when you go to pilgrimage and you bow down toward the Caba isn't it same as idol worship and this is there in my book the most common question it is number nine the ninth most common questions asked by non-muslims about Islam is is Islam is against idol worship why do you bow down to the Caba When you pray and the answer is no muslim ever worships the Caba the Caba is our K it's the direction because we Muslims believe in unity for example today all the Muslim want to offer Salah on to prayer some may say let's face North some will say South some will say East some will say West there'll be disunity so for Unity wherever you are you face towards the Caba this is a verse of the Quran of Surah Bak chapter number 2 verse number 144 which says that when you pray face towards the Caba so Caba is the kah it is not we worship it furthermore Muslims were the first people who drew the world map and Ali in 11:54 was the first human being who drew the world map when the Muslims drew the world map South Pole was on top North Pole down Caba was in the center the Western cartographers came and they turned the map upside down North Pole top South Pole down yet Caba is in the center so if you stay in the north you face toward the South if you stay in the South you face towards the north if you stay in the west you face towards the east if you stay in the East you face towards the West Caba is the center of the world when when people go for umra when Muslims go for umra or we go for Hajj we circum ulate around the Caba what is the reason we circum ulate because it's the Commandment of almighty God but logically what I can think that every Circle has got one Center when we circle mulate around the Caba we testifying that there's only one God and the statement of the second khif of Islam Umar he said it's mentioned s bukari volume number two in the book of Haj chapter number 56 Hadith number 675 Omar is with him the second CIF of Islam he said that this black stone can neither benefit me can neither harm me I'm kissing it only because I've seen the prophet kiss it this statement that the Blackstone can neither benefit me or neither harm me is sufficient to prove that Muslim don't worship the Caba and lastly at the time of the Prophet there were sahabah who stood on the Caba and give the aan no Idol worshipper will ever stand on the idol he or she worships so this proves that no muslim ever worship the Caba the Caba is the K only Direction hope that answer the question okay thank you very much for your time thank you"
