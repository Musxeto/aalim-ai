  "title": "It is Difficult to Believe in the Quran when it says Birds Dropped Stones in the Battlefield",
  "transcript": "respected sir i have four questions first brother please please mention your name and one question there are some hard to believe instances in any scriptures for instance in quran like birds dropping stones in a battlefield on the enemy's [Music] context like that which is hard to believe that's my first question there's a question a certain thing mentioned the quran like birth dropping stones talking about surah refilled chapter number 105 there are many things for example quran says prophet muhammad spread the moon into two muslims put the scene to two these are difficult things yes these are known as miracles miracles are those things which the human mind cannot conceive how it happened for us human being to make the moon into two is not possible first human being to split the sea into two and have a pathway not possible so these are known as miracles which only god can do you and i cannot do so it's difficult for us to conceive the only way for us to testify is to go back into time we are sitting now we can't go back three thousand four thousand years back and check up with the musa moses did he split the sea or not so what we say these are miracles which doesn't allow us to go back in time but there are many things which quran has said which has come true today for example quran speaks about sans about the big bang quran speaks the light of the moon not its own light quran speak the earth the spherical quran speaks the sun rotates which to a man 1400 years back would sound what is this nonsense that the moon has its own light that the earth is spherical all these things about the big bang but today after science has advanced we have come to know it's a fact but to know what happened in the past we can't go back in time so what my logic says whatever the quran has mentioned certain things you can check up now certain things you can't check up we can't go back in time so that goes in the ambiguous lot so what things we can check up today out of those things whatever we can check up say 80 percent things we can check up so my logic says 80 percent of what the quran mentioned we can check up today and we have come to 100 correct whatever we can check not even one percent is wrong i think so yes i'm telling you brother historic for you to say that thing didn't happen you can only prove by going back in time if the quran says prophet moses split the sea you can't prove that he didn't split neither can you prove he split but we can't go back in time can we go back three thousand four thousand years back can we go we can't so what we say logically this may have happened may not have happened may have happened may not have happened the birds may have dropped stone may not have drop stone correct what we say this is ambiguous if we talk about the nuclear bomb thousand years back would they have believed would they have believed they would have said this is nonsense right or wrong but today you and i believe or not because science is advanced similarly there's nuclear bomb there's atom bomb so bird dropping stones what's the problem it is so easy nuclear bomb is more difficult so here we realize we cannot go back in time so what my logic says whatever we can testify today whatever we can analyze today out of that 100 percent has been proved to be correct twenty percent we can't analyze we cannot go back we can't go in future we cannot prove scientifically whether there's heaven or hell so you'll ask me brother zakir you're a medical doctor how do you believe in heaven and hell i said that goes in the 20 percent ambiguous lot so my logic says when 80 percent what we can check today of the quran has been 100 percent to be correct not even point one percent is wrong so my logic says what twenty percent is ambiguous inshallah god willing even that will be correct maybe science will advance after 50 years after 20 years we will come to know about life after death we may come to know about heaven or hell so my logic says it's a logical belief that when not even point zero zero zero one percent has been proved wrong of the quran 80 percent is 100 percent correct so my logic says inshallah the 20 which you can't verify by going back in time or going in future even that inshallah will be correct [Applause] you"
