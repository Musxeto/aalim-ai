the vooodoo the second knot is undone and when he prays the third knot is undone and the person is energetic and inshallah he'll be on the straight path for the full day on the other hand if he gets up without taking the name of Allah without doing W without offering Salah then he's lazy and his heart is misifus our beloved Prophet M further said it's mentioned in say Muslim volume number one in
