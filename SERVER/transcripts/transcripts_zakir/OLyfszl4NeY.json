  "title": "Is it Compulsory for a Muslim Man to take the Permission of his 1st Wife Before taking another Wife?",
  "transcript": "Islam allows marriages I mean a husband to marry more than one wife four wives is it compulsory to take the permission from the wife before marrying that second one because a lot of Muslim girls have told me that you know they have to take permission from the first wife so our interests are taken care of I hope you don't intend to become Muslim and marry more than one wife huh no I don't know because there's a new law in the Indian government if a Hindu converts to Muslim and marries more than one wife then there's a problem yeah to intern well I won't answer that now the other question that is it compulsory that the husband should take the permission of his first wife before he marries a second wife as a general rule because it is mentioned in the Quran that a man can have more than one wife it is not required for a man to take the permission of first wife but it is preferably takes permission or at least informs her during a marital contract a man or a woman before they get married they can put any conditions which are permitted if the woman puts the condition in the nikarnama that my husband will not take a second wife as long as I live because Manning more than one wife is optional so if she puts the condition then it becomes compulsory for the husband to take the permission of the wife otherwise he cannot marry if this is not mentioned in the nikanama if it's not mentioned a marital contact it's not a must it is preferable no hope to answer the question"
