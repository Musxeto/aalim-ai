  "transcript": "though allah has given us the first guidance in the glorious quran that we should read but unfortunately we realize that the muslims in the muslim community everyone does not read and those muslims who are involved in the quran knowledge in reading they don't read as per the guidance of allah read in the name of thy lord so when we read when we acquire knowledge we should acquire knowledge in such a way that we come closer to our creator allah if the knowledge does not bring you closer towards your creator towards your rub then that knowledge is not useful for the akhirah and our beloved prophet muhammad said it's to say hadees which is mentioned in hadith number 224 our beloved prophet said talib seeking knowledge is obligatory on every muslim seeking knowledge is obligatory on every muslim man or woman it's compulsory that every muslim should acquire knowledge and it is the duty of us muslims to see to it that we acquire knowledge many of us we think that knowledge is only what we study in schools in colleges and universities education and knowledge starts at home and the best teacher is the mother it is the duty of the parents to see to it that they properly educate the children see to it that they give them proper education because the child when he or she is born they are not responsible for the environment in which they are born it is the duty of the parish to see to it that irrespective of the environment they give them proper education"
