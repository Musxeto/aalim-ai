  "transcript": "We have the example of the mother of your mishafi. May Allah have mercy on him. We know he was one of the four great imams. His mother saw to it that she let his son spend time amongst the scholars of Medadina. And she saw to it that he spent time with the scholars. So much so that one day he became one of the greatest scholars of time. We have the example of the mother of Imam Bkhari. Imam Bkari when he was a child he had a phenomenal memory but he was blind and all the doctors had given us hope that he will never be able to see in his life. But the mother was persistent in praying to Allah subhana wa t'ala. She prayed every day to Allah that please restore the eyesight of my son. And one day she gets a dream in which Ibrahim Islam comes and says that the eyesight of your son will be restored and Imam Bkari again starts seeing and we know that he became the best mouadis. So much so that the Sai Bkari that he compiled is the most authentic source of Islam after the Quran. There was the striving of the mother in making Immab Bkhari. Let me give you one more example of Sala and Faruk. Sle and Faruk were two people. They were couple who loved each other. They married and within few months of marriage there was a call for jihad. So Farukq goes for jihad and when he goes for jihad he says I'll come back soon within a few months and he gives to Sala his wife 30,000 dinar. Now 30,000 dinar according to a person in UK calculated it and he says it is equivalent to 2 million pounds 2 million pounds not dollars pounds dollars will be close to £3 million. So he goes for jihad and few months pass 1 year 2 year after about two two and a half years somebody comes and tells Sa that he had seen Faruk that he was injured and he fell in a ditch. Then few more years pass and then she thinks that my husband is dead. 30 years later Faruk he's alive he comes back to Medina but before he goes to his home he goes to Majid Nabi when he goes to Majid Nabi he sees many scholars discussing among themselves and the best that he could find was Shik Abd Rahman who was about 30 years old and he's impressed mashallah uh see the city of Medina all talking about knowledge and ilm what a beautiful city and see these scholars especially she Abdman then he goes to his house and he meets his wife Slea and she's overjoyed to know that her husband is alive so they overjoyed the union after 30 years and Later on, Faruk asks his wife, \"You remember I had given you 30,000 dinar and I told you keep it safe don't spend it.\" She says, \"Yes, I remember. Where is it?\" So she asks that before coming home did you go to the mosque which is a habit? He says, \"Yes, I went to Majid Nambi. I went to the mosque. She asked what did you find there? I found there many scholars discussing among themselves. Then she asked who is the best you like? So he said there was a young boy of 30 years old his name is Shik Abd Rahman. He was the best. Then Saul asked him that how much would you give to gain knowledge for you to gain knowledge as much as Abd Rahman. So he said I wouldn't mind giving all my 30,000 dinar to acquire the knowledge like she raman. Then she asked what if you had a son how much would you spend on your son to acquire knowledge like shik abdamman? He said I wouldn't mind spending multiple times more than 30,000 dinar to make my son as knowledgeable as shik abdamman. So sorry tells after you left after few months I had a son and I spent all the wealth you gave me in giving him knowledge of the dean and that man that young boy Abdul Raman Shik Abd Raman is your son. Imagine both of them love Dean and the mother spends the full saving not on herself but on educating her son and the father also said I would spend multiple times more in making my son like Abd Rahman imagine two 30,000 dinar 2 million pounds"
