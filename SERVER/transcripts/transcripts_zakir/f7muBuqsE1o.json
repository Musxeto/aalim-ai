  "transcript": "there's a question just that's come on the facebook by yogesh nima india if fasting has so many benefits then why don't you muslims fast for the entire why only one month in a year that's a very good question the fasting has so many benefits why don't you fast the entire year by only one month if you have heard my talk in the second session of this ramnard doctor saket i said that fasting is like overhauling once a year of the complete body of the human being it is like servicing like how if you have a vehicle you have to service once a year once in six months so fasting is like servicing so and everyone knows that servicing is good for the car if i say okay servicing is good then why don't you keep on servicing every day and people will start laughing so fasting is the overhauling of the body so that's why once a month for one full month there are various medical benefits but if you do it throughout the year it will not be beneficial and the prophet said it is haram to fast all the days of the year yes you can fast twice a week on mondays and thursday it's a sunnah the ma the maximum we can fast is every alternate day but fasting every day is prohibited it will not be beneficial for the body that's the reason muslims don't fast every day of the year but fasting once a month has got maximum medical benefits then after that if you want more you can fast twice a week on mondays and thursdays and the other option is fast whether it be of shawwal whether it be of whether it be of uh it will be of arafah hajj fast etc"
