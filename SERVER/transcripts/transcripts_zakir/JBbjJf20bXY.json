  "title": "Fasting every day of the Year is Prohibited - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "fasting has many benefits and you know you've explained so many of those over the last three weeks or so could you explain to the viewers why shouldn't we fast the whole year through why is it just one month particularly that we're being told to fast as far as fasting the whole year is concerned the reason Prophet Muslim has prohibited fasting every day in the full year of fasting for the full life is it would lead to one's physical ruin it can lead to one's moral ruin it can lead to religious exorcism all of which are prohibited in Islam and there may be health problems medical problems it would be rather over doing and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 4 verse number 171. do not commit excesses in religion so that's the reason the prophet has prohibited and um says inside bukhari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1977 that he says that anyone who fasts every day thought in life he has not fasted at all foreign have I heard that you fast every day and you pray the full night and replied yes a prophet so the prophet replies that you fast for some days and you break the fast for some days you pray for part of the night and you sleep for part of the night your wife has right over you your body has right over you your relatives have right to you your guests have right to owe you so if you do this you're ruining your social life Etc and your family life and the prophet continue then says that if you fast for three days and every month it has they are fasted for the full year but Abdullah replies my life please with him but I can do much more than the prophet says fast like the fast so you ask what is the fastest the prophet replied he fasted for half a year let me fastly alternate days one day kept a fast one day broke the fast one day kept the fast and that is the best of fast so this is the reason why Prophet sallam prohibited fasting every day of the year every day of the life"
