  "transcript": "we will take the last question my name is ishaq yusuf from nigeria christians say jesus is the only salvation to eternal life what is your comment on this it is mentioned the gospel of john chapter 14 verse number 6 jesus christ peace be upon him said i am the way the truth and the life no man commit unto the father but through me many christians they misunderstand this verse and they think that jesus christ peace be upon him he claimed divinity but in fact this was simply means that the people at the time of jesus christ peace be upon him they had to follow the commandments of jesus christ peace be upon him and whatever jesus christ peace be upon him said it was a revelation from almighty god so he was the truth and the life that means whatever he commanded the people to do they had to follow as it was a revelation from almighty god jesus christ peace be upon him he was only a prophet of god and every prophet at his time he was the truth and the life no man commit unto almighty god but through that prophet moses peace be upon him at his time he was the truth and the life no man cometh unto almighty god but through moses peace be upon him david peace be upon him at his time he was the truth and the life no man cometh unto almighty god but through david peace be upon him prophet muhammad peace be upon him he is the truth and the life no man committed to almighty god but through prophet muhammad peace be upon him so we have to follow the teachings of prophet muhammad peace be upon him he is the truth and the life that means we have to follow his teachings we have to follow the commandments of almighty god that was revealed to prophet muhammad peace be upon him so this was in no way it says that jesus christ peace be upon him he claimed divinity jesus christ peace be upon him he never claimed divinity in fact if you read the bible there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says i am god always says worship me in fact if you read the bible jesus christ peace be upon him said it is mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 14

muslim and jesus christ peace be upon him he never claimed divinity in fact if you read the bible it is mentioned the gospel of matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17 to 20 jesus christ peace be upon him he said think not i've come to destroy the law or the prophets i have come not to destroy but to fulfill for till the heavens and the earth shall pass not one jot or tittle of the law or the commandment shall be broken for if anyone breaks one of the least of the commandments and teaches men to do so he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven for if anyone keeps the commandments and teaches men to do so he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes in the far seas in no way shall you enter the kingdom of heaven jesus christ peace be upon him he never claimed divinity in fact if you read it mention the gospel of john chapter number 17 verse number three this is eternal life that you may know that there's one god and jesus christ peace be upon him who thou sent furthermore to mention the gospel of matthew chapter 19 verse number 16 and 17 a man approaches jesus christ peace be upon him and he asks him oh good master what good things i should do that i shall attain eternal life jesus christ peace be upon replies and says why thou call it me good that is only one good and that is the father in heaven that is almighty god and if you want to enter eternal life you must keep the commandments jesus christ peace be upon him never said that if you want to enter eternal life believe that i am god believe that i died on the cross for the sins but he rather said if you want to enter eternal life you must keep the commandments and jesus christ peace be on he never claimed divinity in fact if you read it is mentioned in the book of acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 yemen of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles and signs which god did by himself and your witness to it so jesus christ peace be upon him he never claimed divinity and he repeated orbit him what was said by moses peace be upon him it is mentioned the gospel of
