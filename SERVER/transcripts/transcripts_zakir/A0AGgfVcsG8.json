  "transcript": "and unfortunate certain fact there are many Muslims who have a very superficial respect for the Quran in terms of touching it placing it in the right place Etc covering it um but unfortunately when it comes to actually adhering to the principles of the Quran and implementation of those principles there seems to be a lacking tell me which is more important the undue care and love and attention to the Quran or the implementation of the virtues of the Quran as far as giving respect to the Quran meaning the outward respect is that more important or reading understanding and implementing on the guidance is important both are important a Muslim should respect the Quran as much as he can at the same time we should read the understanding and Implement on the message which Allah subhana wa tala has given us but unfortunately there are some Muslims who only give outward respect that mean superficially you see the respect but they don't imp Implement on the guidance for which the Quran was revealed so defeat is the very purpose for example many Muslims they keep the Quran on top of the Shelf it's the topmost book and they keep it so much on top that it catches dust and if a person has to read the Quran you think 10 times you know that oh it's so high you know it's difficult to reach the Quran should be a book which is a guide for your day-to-day life it should be kept handy like a guide a textbook which is referred daily it's kept at a shelf which is easy for approach so that you can have it at any opportunity that you require it that's the way we should treat the Quran as a guide for our life every day furthermore some people they tie the Quran securely in a silk cloth and keep it on top and if a person has a few minutes maybe 10 minutes time he would not bother read the Quran the thought of him getting the Quran down and untying it and again tying it securely in the silk cloth that itself will take 10 15 minutes so he says what's the use of spending the time reading the Quran so it should be handy and whenever a person feels he should be able to approach it many of the Muslims they have a thousand question before they touch the Quran as though the Quran is an RDX bomb you're going to explode thousand questions that are you in woodoo is it all right can I touch the Quran you know can I read the Quran while standing can I while traveling having the shoes and reading the Quran it is Haram where do they get this from that which Hadith or which quranic vers say that you can't read the Quran with your shoes on so defeat the very purpose it should be a daily guide for the Muslims and it should be handy and at every opportunity that you have you should read the Quran and we find this very often if you go to the mosque in the Gulf countries that if a person who comes to pray to the MOs if he has a few minutes he doesn't waste time he picks up the copy of the Quran and he reads and we find that most of the people that come early they read the Quran but in the mosque in the subcontinent that's India and Pakistan you may see a few people reading the Quran maybe in the first row and if someone in the second row reads the Quran they will immediately stop him the back your back is facing the Quran it is Haram so these things all superficial respect outward respect it's not really what the Quran has been revealed for it revealed as a guidance for humankind you should read it whenever you have an opportunity and that reminds me of an incident that in the Gulf country once an Indian Kari he had G to Saudi Arabia to visit the country and because he a very good Kar they allowed him to lead the M Salah so the recited in the Salah Sur fa then Sur Yu and with a very good voice melodious voice with alhamdulillah after he finished the Salah there was an Arab was smiling so the Indian Kar he asked him that why didn't you like my karat he said no your Kat was wonderful but I was wondering that in the Salah you put YF alisam inside the well but why didn't you get him out before the Salah was over the joke is that he read the Quran s Yu but didn't understand what he was reading so he putam in the well but before the Salah at least you brought him out of the well so it's very important that besides giving respect which is important you should give respect but the main thing is read the Quran with understanding and Implement its guidance in your life daily that's the best"
