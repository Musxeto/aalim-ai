  "title": "Is not Allah Unjust to put Non-Muslims who are more Righteous than many Muslims in Hell?",
  "transcript": "the next question is from hamza from india allah says in the quran that he is not unjust in the least degree but i feel it is injustice to non-muslims who are more righteous than many muslims to end up in hell and also it is unjust to put muslims in heaven who are not as righteous as some non-muslims this is a very important question but asked that allah is not unjust in the least degree and it is unjust to put non-muslims who are more righteous into the hell and unjust for the muslims who are not righteous to put in heaven what the brother is referring to is the verse in the quran from surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 40 where allah says in the quran that allah is never unjust in the least degree that means allah is the most just he will not do even a minute fraction of injustice as far a question is concerned that why non-muslims who do righteous deeds will be put into hell fire and muslims who are unrighteous why should they be put in heaven we have to understand that what is the meaning of the word righteousness and who is the righteous person for me to make you understand i'll give you a fair example number one if there are total 199 us dollars divided into 64 notes the 64 notes if you total all the value of these 64 notes it is 199 and i distribute the notes to few people some get 10 notes some get 20 notes some get 30 notes some get less some get more a normal person who may not be aware of the notes and the value will so ever gets the most notes number of notes is the richest person no it's not like that we have to see what is the value of each note in these 64 notes one note is of hundred dollar note is of twenty dollar the hundred dollar note is for a person who believes that there is only one god and that god has got no partners and prophet muhammed is the messenger of that almighty god the number 20 bill u.s dollar is the person who prays five times a day then there's one ten dollar note there is two five dollar notes ten dollar note is for a person who gives a card for this charity five dollar note is the person who fast and five dollar note is the person who goes for hajj the remaining for all if you put together is 140 dollars the remaining 59 are one one dollar bill so all put together 64 notes so 59 notes are of one one dollar so just because somebody has 30 notes or 30 bills doesn't make him rich if he has 30 bills of 1 1 he has only a value of 30 dollars the person who has 100 dollar is more richer than all the other notes put together if all the 63 notes put together will make it only 99 but one bill of 100 is more valuable than 63 bills all put together a 99 dollar that's the reason the creator he has put this formula and he clearly mentions in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 48 and surah nisar chapter number 416 that allah will forgive any sin if he pleases but he will never forgive the sin of sheikh for anyone who has committed shirk has stayed far away has done the most heinous sin that means the biggest sin in islam according to our creator almighty god allah allah is doing shirk is associating partners with him it's the biggest sin and the best thing person can do is tahit believe in only one god and believe that there is no one worthy of worship but almighty god and prophet muhammad is the messenger of almighty god so he's the creator he said the rule we are the people who are undergoing an examination let me give one more example that in certain tests there are certain compulsory questions which you should pass separately like i did a medical examination in mbbs besides the theory papers we had viva was orals every student had to pass separately in my vows separately he may score 100 of 100 in theory paper but in the viva vos if he fails he fails the examination i cannot argue this is the rule set so the compulsory paper in islam is tahit you should believe in one god and worship him alone and no one else and the first pillar that i bear witness that there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah is compulsory if you fail in this you fail in the test you may get as many other marks in the other questions this is number one and let me give you a third example that if there is a question paper the total marks of all the answers in the question paper it totals to 1000 marks one question is compulsory most important which carries 501 marks and the minimum passing marks the minimum passing for this paper is 501 if you get anything less than 501 out of 1 000 that means you have to get more than 50 marks you have to get minimum 501 if you get anything less than 500 and one out of thousand you failed the examination that means this one main question which is compulsory it is tahit it is the first pillar of islam that there's no one worthy of worship except almighty god and prophet muhammad is the messenger of almighty god this is number one which carries 501 marks then number two is salah may be carrying 100 marks then would be giving charity zakat maybe 50 marks then fasting in the month of ramadan that may be 20 marks then going for hajj that may be the 10 months another maybe 100 hundreds of more questions two months one mark three marks one one mark but if you get zero marks in the major question of tahiti of the first pillar of islam you failed the examination so this is a test for the hereafter allah says in the quran it's chapter number 67 verse number two it's allah was created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds so allah subhanahu wa allah has sent us in this world as a test for the hereafter and the rules and regulations have been laid down in the quran in the last and final revelation he kept on sending revelations the moment it got corrupted he sent a new revelation he sent a new messenger the moment it again got corrupted he sent a new message and a new revelation there were many revelations sent on the face of the earth by knowing we know only four and the last and final revelation is glorious quran and the last and final messenger is prophet muhammad peace be upon him so you may be thinking this non-muslim he is very honest okay what is the marks for honesty okay maybe five marks out of thousand marks five marks he is very charitable okay maybe ten marks he is very kind ten marks but out of thousand marks these five marks ten months five months ten mark two marks one mark will not make him pass the examination you may be thinking okay doing 10 good deeds or 20 good deeds but if that one person who has the hundred dollar bill who passes in the vaiva votes the compulsory question the one who gets full marks in he is the person who is sure to pass the best would be a muslim who believes in tahit offers salah and also gives charity zakat also fast does the hajj is good to the neighbors loves people is honest who does not drive does not have alcohol does not gamble who helps others helps the neighbors loves his parents and so on and so he's the best maybe he'll get 90 marks maybe he'll get more than 900 out of a thousand there may be other muslims who may not be honest but yet believe in tahit but because they believe in tahit they have got the hundred dollar bill they have passed in the vaiwars they have got 501 marks already in that one compulsory important question so logically who would be higher in the examination a person who got 500 and one marks or a person who's got five five mark maybe ten times fifty more hundred months two hundred marks so what you have to understand we have to understand what is righteousness and allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 49 verse number 13 we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of allah is the person who has taqwa the criteria for judgment in the sight of allah it's not sex it's not wealth it's not color it's not race it is not gender it is taqwa it is righteousness it is god consciousness it is party so as you rightly said who is righteous imagine our creator almighty god who has given us this life who's given us the clothing the food clothing food besides the point how many of us thank allah for the water he has given us free how many of us thank allah for the air if we don't get for few minutes we will die how many of us so imagine if we are going to associate partners with the creator who has given us all these facilities in life who's given another body who's given us health who has given us food to eat has given us clothes and then you say you're righteous the biggest thing you can do is associate partners with him you worship somebody else besides the creator so what you have to understand what is righteousness is very important you have to understand that very clearly so if you understand this what is righteousness you will come to know and you will realize that who should get more marks so if you know this then inshallah you'll never object to the justice of allah hope that answers the question"
