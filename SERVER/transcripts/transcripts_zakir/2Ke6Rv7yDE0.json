  "title": "Why are there Shaikh, Sayyed, Mullah, Pathan, Brahman, Kshatriya, etc.? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "[Applause] came [Applause] [Music] foreign brother before asking his question he said that he says that there are likes hundreds of thousands of people gathered here and he wishes that peace be on all these people then he said that dr zakir naik has come here to give good message and he's asking the question that he's a hindu but he has read and he believes in the quran he believes in the bible he believes in the veda and he's asking that why are they pathan sheikh mullah brahman as far as the question is concerned why are they patan sheikh mullah these are family names just because a person is a sheikh or a mullah does not make him superior to any other human being the quran says in surah chapter number 49 verse number 13 um we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other not that you shall despise each other and the most honored in the sight of allah is the person who has taqwa the criteria for judgment in the side of allah subhanahu wa it's not sex it's not caste it's not color it's not age it's not wealth it is taqwa it is god consciousness it is party just because a person is born in a mullah family or a khan family or a sheikh family will not take into jannah but piety righteous deed god consciousness will take him to jannah but this is the islamic concept in the concept of hinduism the vedas say almighty god created from the head the brahmanas god from his abdomen or his thighs created the vaishwas that is the business class and from the feet the shudras that is the servant class that is a slave this is the concept of veda in islam no human being is superior or inferior because of birth there is no caste system in islam it is their hinduism and for more details why this is you can refer to my video cassette similarities between islam and hinduism now coming to your question first part you said that you believe in quran you believe in bible you believe in veda i request the people at least believe that one book is hundred percent the word of god not two three four at least one book so the christian will say i believe bible is hundred percent the word of god the hindu will say i believe the veda to be hundred percent the word of god the muslim will say i believe that quran is hundred percent the word of god you mashallah believe in all three now do you know there are many contradictory things in the quran and the bible and the veda let's not discuss that i'm asking you today at least follow what is common at least what is common in the veda bible and quran which you believe at least follow that all these three scriptures say that god is one this god has got no image he has got no idol he has got no picture it's mentioned in the bible in the book of deuteronomy chapter number six verse number four moses peace be upon him says shama israel euro israel the lord our god is one lord if you read the hindu scriptures it's mentioned chandogya of peninsula chapter number six section number two verse number one it come evident god is only one without a second it's mentioned that upanishad chapter number four verse number 19 and yet chapter number three verse number three of that god there is no prasima prathima in sanskrit means an image a photograph a painting a picture a portrait a sculpture a idol of that god there is no prathima of that god there is no image of that god there is no photograph there is no picture there is no portrait there is no painting there is no sculpture there is no ideal there is no statue quran says the same in surah class chapter number 112 verse number 1-4 say there's god one and only the absolute the eternal he begets not noisy begotten and there's nothing like him i'm asking the question do you believe in one god brothers foreign [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] [Applause] means sent from almighty god if you say that i've got no objection if you say ram is a messenger of god maybe he is maybe he's not because our beloved prophet muhammad sallallahu assalam said there were 124 000 messengers sent on the face of the earth by name only 25 are mentioned in the quran may be a messenger of god maybe he is maybe he's not i cannot say for sure but even if rama was a messenger of god even if krishna was a messenger of god he was sent only for those people and for that time today all the human beings whether they live in india whether america whether canada whether uk whether saudi arabia they should follow the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him he's also prophesied in kalki purana as kalki author that is mother's name will be sumati that's amina his father's name will be vishnu yash that's abdullah he will be born in a place of peace zambala that is makkah he'll be born in the family of the chief of the village of sambala that is chief of makkah that is quraysh he'll have four companions talking kulfa rashid on and on if you really believe in your scriptures you have to follow and believe in the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him do you believe in prophet muhammad peace be upon him oh [Music] [Applause] the brother said he wrote 20 million times ram ram ram but ram hasn't come to him yet so therefore i'm telling you believe in one and only creator allah and believe in all his messengers as well as the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him hope to answer the question [Applause]"
