  "transcript": "the third pillar of Islam zaka every rich person who has a saving of more than 85 grams of gold more than the nisab level should give 2.5% of his saving every lunar in charity if every Rich human being in this world give zaka charity will be eradicated from this world when we give zaka it's an obligatory F charity most of the times two .5% you have to give and Allah says in the Quran who is the one who can give a beautiful loan to Allah and he will multiply it to you does Allah require a loan Allah does he require a loan what does he mean by this verse that means if you see a poor man you give charity if you see someone who wants some money you give it to him as loan as though you're giving it not Allah doesn't require you're giving because Allah commands you when Allah says who is there to give a loan to Allah Allah doesn't require to him belongs everything it means Allah is checking do you follow his commandment or not do you help the poor people or not do you see to it that you fulfill the needs of the poor people or not when you give food to a needy you're feeding Allah Allah doesn't require to be fed Allah say in suram chapter 6 verse 104 he Feth everyone but does not require to be fed suram chapter 6 verse number 14 so here when you're giving zakat it's the Commandment of Allah subhana tala and I say Zak is additional charity is must it is must so minimum if you give 2.5% it is your minimum Muslim but you give more you're a better Muslim and I tell the people that zakat is but try and give more charity okay give 10% of your income or give 20% of your income and the more percentage you give to Allah the balance with you will be more in quantity than the earlier and I told my son that when you do business minimum you should give 51% why make Allah your partner in business in business and you cannot make Allah a small partner 10% 20% if Allah is a partner he has to be a major shareholder so minimum 51% he knows how much I give but man is a different case it's a different level he's just starting business so minimum you have to give 51% of your profit every year to Allah in charity minimum because if you make Allah the partner in business you cannot make him a small partner he should be the major shareholder then you keep on increasing 60% 70% the more you increase the balance that will be with you will be bigger I remember that in Bombay where I lived more than seven years back I us to pray to Allah subhana tala that Ya Allah let my life and wealth be sacrificed in the way of Allah so when we did Hijra in 2016 because I'm I had to leave my country for sake of Allah it's a Sunnah of the Prophet what with all my wealth went away hundreds of millions of ring it we left it I prayed to Allah Ya Allah you fulfilled half my dream I'm waiting for Allah to fulfill the next half my wealth is gone I'm waiting for my life to be sacrificed I was telling my friend just a few days back I pray to Allah that whatever the assets of the um there in the country let us get back but as far my wealth I don't want it back he's saying why because I have already invested in the way of Allah if I get it back I'm afraid I not get the reward in the year after so never do I pray because my wealth in India was taken away by a non-muslim government because I'm a d so whatever hundreds of millions of rings you have sacrificed I don't want it back because I know in I'll get minimum 700 times or more so this is the implication of that if you have faith in Allah subhana wa ta'ala you're not bothered about wealth you're bothered about Allah says if you stri for dun Allah gives the D if you st for Allah gives and both within the next next few years we did businesses Allah got part of the wealth back to me not from India I'm a die fulltime for the sake of Allah maybe two hours a week 2 three days a month I do business and Allah blesses me"
