  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum sir i am mursaleen ahmad i am from dhaka bangladesh i am a student i am a practicing muslim alhamdulillah i have a question regarding dawah a person told me it is not mentioned in the quran that dawah should be given to the non-muslims dawah should first be given to the muslims for example muslims not performing salah you have to first give dawa to them for prayer please could you reply there are several verses in fact there are hundreds of verses in the glorious quran that talk about dawah allah subhanahu wa says in the glorious quran chapter 16 verse number 125 wisdom and beautiful preachings and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best and most gracious allah says in the glorious quran in surah chapter 41 verse number 33 who is better in speech than the one who calls others towards allah works righteousness and says that i am a muslim allah subhana wa imran chapter number 3 verse number 104 calling towards what is good enjoying what is right and forbidding what is wrong they are the ones to attain felicity so there are several verses in the glorious quran that talk about giving tawa to the non-muslims it is the duty of every muslim to convey the message of islam to the non-muslims to those who are unaware of it and allah says in the glorious quran surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 64. see your people of the book come to common terms as being us and you which is the first term allah that we worship none but one almighty god this verse is telling us to call the jews and christians towards tawheed towards the oneness of allah subhana it is clearly referring to doing tawa to the non-muslims and if you look at the lifestyle of a blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him the first 13 years of prophethood during the meccan period the prophet peace be upon him spend this time inviting the mushrikeen inviting the non-muslims towards the hate towards the wonders of allah subhanahu talaha and when the mushrik india asked one and only we muslims we already believe in one god this verse is telling us tell the non-muslims call them towards tawheed that is the oneness of allah subhanahu ta'ala and all the prophets their basic message their basic mission it was calling their people towards tawheed that is the oneness of allah ibrahim he called his people towards tawheed he called his father towards tawheed towards the oneness of allah subhanallah same with salam so all the prophets they call their people towards tawheed that is the oneness of allah and isla is also important so based upon the opportunity and when the opportunity arises you do what is necessary it is not important that you make the muslim salman first and then you do tawa that time will never come of prophet muhammad peace be upon him said propagate even if you know one verse even if you know one was about islam as long as you know it correctly it's your duty to propagate to the non-muslims so based upon the situation when the time arises you do isla when the time arises you do dawah but i would like to give you an example if there are two patients who approach a doctor who come to a doctor one of them has heart attack and the other he has common cold or a minor headache and if the doctor has less time and he can treat only one patient who would he treat but naturally he will treat the patient who has a heart attack if he has time he will treat both the patients but the first priority will be given to the patient who has heart attack similarly if you have the opportunity you should do isla as well as you should do dawah but if there's less time so priority first should be given to dawah because the muslim he is already into the fold of islam the non-muslim if he dies in that state of sheikh he will enter hell fire and he will be there in forever so we should do tawa call the non-muslims towards tawheed towards the oneness of allah"
