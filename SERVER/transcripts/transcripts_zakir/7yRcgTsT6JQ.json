  "title": "How can we Answer the Non-Muslims who Ridicule the Issuance of Fatwas on Small Issues ...?",
  "transcript": "this question is regarding the fatwas that are thrown at us every day for the past week every day in the newspapers we've been reading about fatwas regarding everything and anything even on what Sanya Mirza wears you know in fact it has come to a point that the non-muslims are ridiculing and mocking the Muslims because of the fatwas so how do we answer the non-muslims this is that's a very important question a very good question which are discussing yesterday with the person from the media that about Sania Mirza and we find in the newspapers Wimbledon and recently she lost with the top seed if not mistaken and the issue is there that Sania Mirza is a Muslim and she's wearing clothes short skirts diving quite a large portion of the body Etc so the question posed to her is often that you are a Muslim half my wedding so she gave a good reply that why are you asking me the question are you asking this question to every other contestant no why only to me just because I'm a Muslim so my argument is that if you asked any player I can prove to the players of all the major religions whether Christian whether Hindu or whether the Muslim that very close is Haram Serena Williams who's a top seed number one not in the U.S open world number one I can prove to her from the Bible the Bible says in the first Timothy chapter number two verse number nine that wear clothes which are modest a woman should be dressed up modestly with sobriety and will save his Fitness and should not wear costly array pearls and gold so bread is this sobriety is it chim-facedness I can prove d it says that Brahma has made you a lady a woman they follow your gaze and draw the will over your head so according to Hinduism very such close is wrong according to Christianity such close is wrong according Islam it is wrong so why the reporters only asking Sania Mirza why not the others the problem is the reporters have lack of knowledge of the other religions yes fine the Muslims are more practicing alhamdulillah so just because the Muslims are more practicing that's the reason you are asking a Muslim they should ask each and every lady contestant that most of them are going against religion so why aren't they asking them they selectively pick up because it is news if there is a hand to you and neither will the Christian World object to because at least bothered in following the scriptures for example what happened in 911 after the 9 11 attack on the Twin Towers in Canada there was a survey that what do the Muslims think about the Twin Tower blast almost all of them said it is wrong we condemn it now the 14 year old boy in Ottawa who said what they did inside and they bring his clipping headlines oh this Muslim boy says what 11 September what happened Twin Towers right so they're fishing they want some answer and the hunting when they get that they blow it out of proportion so it is nothing but a gimmick of the media which we unnecessarily should not be involved in that but the question is very good how do we reply and yesterday we were discussing with the people who opened media and I told him that every religion says it's wrong so why isn't the media highlighting that isn't that news so one is the fault of the media I would even blame the Muslims and we find in the newspaper that had several comments and I'm told on the television people give several comments fatwas of the Muslims whether a religious person or a politician or whether it be a businessman there were views of Muslims taken across the world and most of the religious leaders they said it is Haram some men think that we should not come in a minority of those said that in sports it's allowed so even though they have different but the majority of those wrong blah blah blah and the other so-called so-called secular invert come Muslims they said what you're doing is fine with her and many women gave their comments those women most of them I did not hear of any woman in hijab giving the comment that what she's doing is wrong although we are not doing hijab they are giving the comment what's the name is that it is right that she is uplifting the name of the country of Islam Etc blah blah blah blah and all these politicians giving oh he's telling these religious people they don't know what is sports therefore they're giving the reply and people are clapping well they don't know about sports does he know about Islam so from Islam is more important than sports that puts him down now coming to the other issues of politician saying oh we are proud of Sania Mirza and Etc that's political vote bank I would like to ask these politicians you know what they're saying that see Sports is an international game so what is right for the international game that Sports man a woman should be allowed to do I said okay agree with your argument I'll ask the next question do you know there's a sports called beach volleyball mainly for the girls do you know that will you send your daughter wearing a bikini on the beach will you yes or no I'm asking the so-called politician Muslim or non-muslim will this Muslim politician send his daughter wearing a bikini for the beach volleyball will they okay fine tomorrow there may be nude swimming where do you put the limit if tomorrow nude swimming becomes the international sport will you agree your daughter doing swimming nude and I'll prove it to you being nude is better than wearing clothes it's better for swimming voila if you want to ask logically if someone proves tomorrow that nude swimming is better than wearing even that so will you agree with that where is the limitation we'll draw a line previously adultery was wrong long by hundreds of years back when adulty becomes common homosexuality was wrong today homosexuality is right fine pornography is legal today's paper I read that UK is spending millions of pounds in restricting child pornography I said why pornography was prohibited several years back today it has become a part and parcel of life so pornography has become legal in many countries but child pornography most of the countries prohibited tomorrow child pornography will become common so you legalize that also now we have gay marriages in Canada a few years back it was prohibited so where do you draw the line we should have our values of life so I'm asking this politicians will you send your daughter for a beach volleyball in the bikini so we should know how to reply rather than get entangled as far as the muslimas are concerned I'm sorry I don't want to speak against them but I am educating them because this is my field but the Fatima is given by the ulmas that was Sania Mirza said is wrong I am with them but how to reply outline didn't change the style Quran says in Surah chapter 6 invite all the way of the Lord with the wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways the best musgravation I am asking the question a simple any ulma you ask which not offering Salah or wearing shorts and skirts if a difference between a woman and a cafe is Salah right that means next to shirk the sin is not offering Sana I'm asking these Indian cricketers male cricketers I want to name them do all of them of us Allah so do they give a fatwa that this Indian cricketer is doing wrong why the actors they're doing majority of the Muslim actors of Bollywood they are doing the worship on the screen they're allowed do they pass the Fatima against them maybe someone has in the past so when the reporter comes you tell them that that's a bigger issue than this that doesn't mean that but at least we are told that Sania Mirza offers five times Allah so what she's doing is not wearing proper clothes I disagree with that but yet she's better than the Muslim Cricket are not offering Salah so this is the way if you answer the whole media hype will go down that doesn't mean you agree that what Sania Mirza doing is right you don't agree what is wrong is wrong but you should know how to turn the babies over if the media comes to me which I'm not giving them bites for reasons best known to me I will tell them that if you ask me the question I'll give a general answer if you're talking about Sportsman even the cricketer who's a Muslim is a sportsman you can see Salah time is he's on the field he's not going for a Salah Haram which is a bigger Haram it's not offering Salah for a cricket game and the people who watch also known of Masala that is also Haram trying to people playing the game and trying to millions of fools watching it so the person who's playing Cricket you can see with your eyes he's not offering Salah is that a bigger Haram or wearing less clothes any answers which is the bigger Haram not having Salah Fridays are also the missing or some Cricket on there Friday also has not further you should offer alhamdulillah so if they will not miss a year 52 Salas in a year the problem is you tell the press in Islam more important is Salah so according to me Sanya Mirza is a better Muslim than whatever little bit I know about her I haven't interviewed her I have not read much about her whatever three four things and she's a good friend she offers Salah and her dress code is not correct the other few things I know but I don't know about a personal thing neither do I know the personal things about the Indian cricketers whether they have been caught in a betting match or what has happened or they've been exposed right or wrong but at least I know that there are many cricketers Indian who don't offer Salah but that will not come as headlines that the Muslim people give a fatwa that the Muslim cricketer is doing Haram will that come it may come as a news brief we have to educate the Press we have to educate them about Islam and then find at least I congratulate Sanya Mirza that even if she's wearing such clothes which is Haram in Islam she's at least offering five times that doesn't mean I'm agreeing what you're doing is right about wearing clothes please don't misunderstand me that I'm here to support Sania Mirza I don't know also how to reply I'm educate them how to reply in the media how to turn the tables over non-muslim I said most of the major religion the private are very such close and you see in the past if you see women and badminton of the previous few years back 10 years back 20 years 40 years back though were full clothes I am asking the question that if Sania Mirza if she wears a loose tracksuit even that's not fully Islamic but it is better than this what will be the difference in our performance one percent two percent three percent not more than that surely Allah's help is more important the question yet remains can a woman play in public that's a different question so don't say Dr Zakir and I said that woman in hijab can play that's a different question altogether so please when I give answer ah doctors in front of public no I am trying to get the Lesser evil but that you need not tell to the public to the non-muslim Press whether playing in public or not for a woman is the second question and then he gave his view that wearing clothes is wrong at least that was one album which I thought to give a right answer that whether a woman displaying her ability in the general public but yes there are views that if a woman is in hijab she can give a talk in the Public Defense opinion is there which you cannot say for sure so that is yet there so in that context fine if woman is properly dressed up Etc and she's not exposing whether can she plays yet debatable I'm not saying it's Haram but at least we can say that she should wear proper clothes and there are women playing badminton in Iran wearing scarves find a few ways cars you can take another two three percent in performance down so if the performance goes down at least you can expect help of Allah so I will tell these non-muslim press that we believe in the help of Allah more important than help of a skirt if you say that wearing a skirt is preferable to win the game I say fine it may be one or two percent better but Allah's help is more important Allah's help is more important I know in our office it's compulsory every person coming to office should read about 15 minutes one Ruku translation of Quran in Arabic and the translation in the language you understand the best if you calculate if there are 200 people working 15 minutes means in a month I'm losing lots of rupees calculate at least three sellers they offer in jamaat three Salas if you calculate 15 min so every day one hour of how many people a couple of hundred people in a month of rupees going business yes loss no two dot about it but it's an investment account to me investment that the person in the Quran be honest he'll be honest don't see it do Hardware Strife in the way of Allah one hour he may give two three hours additional output for me even if he doesn't do Allah will give me no problem so what we are doing here believe me what we are doing if I have to put all my brains together one love you couldn't have done without Allah's help our thing will be 0.000 one person our efforts it is Allah's help come only when you put effort it is because of Allah but Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 29 verse number six nine if you strive in the way of Allah Allah so the media is their sister we should know to reply the answer again to non-muslim the strategy will change the answer means the same so the answer is that that wearing clothes is wrong but yet we have to give the other aspect of Islam and be able to turn the tables over rather than become part and parcel of making Islam a skateboard hope that's the question"
