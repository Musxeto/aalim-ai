  "transcript": "the brother as very good question that is it compulsory for a Muslim man to wear his toow above the ankle and is it a label the best answer is Quran and sayth it's mentioned s bukari Vol number seven in the book of death chapter number four it says that the prophet said that the part of the trouser that hangs below the ankle that part will be in the Hellfire following that there are additional five or six Hadith say bukari volume number seven book of death chapter number five it says that anyone who walks arrogantly with his trousers hanging on the ground Allah subhana wa ta'ala will curse him so it is a commandment of the Prophet that any part of the trouser that goes below the ankle it should be above the ankle it's a requirement any part that goes below the ankle it is prohibited according to the Beloved Prophet you ask me is it a label yes I would say it's part of the label may not be a very identical label as compared to the cap in the beard because not that you have to always look at the trousers but it is a label and if you have more tawa and the person follows this it is alhamdulillah a person has more TAA who wants to follow the Commandment of the Beloved Prophet therefore you find that those who are more in the they see to it that they keep their trousers above the ankle you can call it a label it may not be as significant as the beard of or the cap which you can see from even a distance you know from here I can see alhamdulillah trousers I may not be able to see but if you say it's a label I've got no objection considering even that to be a label"
