  "title": "A Muslim Lady was Raped by her Father-in-Law. Fatwa given that She was Haraam for her husband",
  "transcript": "first of all I'd like to congratulate Dr Zak Naik because not only the Muslims but everyone here is actually proud of you so basically my question is recently in the Indian news channel there was a case like the daughter-in-law was raped by her father-in-law and was a Muslim so basically the Maldives gave it like that she has to marry her father-in-law and her husband is no more husband do you have your say on that the brother again has picked up a very important issue of the media and people may be aware that a few months back there was a girl by the name of imrana she was read by her father-in-law and the fatwa was given by the majority of the Indian Scholars almost gave the fatwa that because she was raped by the father-in-law she cannot go back to her husband she is Haram for her husband now the moment the media finds something which is interesting and can Milan Islam they pick it up and they blow it out of proportion as though there's nothing else in Islam but this issue to the Indian press what they did most of the channels carried these news that the old Mass the sheikhs the mawlana's of Islam they say a girl she is raped by the father-in-law she's a victim but what does Islam say instead of supporting her now Islam is telling she cannot go back to a husband she's Haram for the husband and they use this news and they blew it out of proportion even till this day today again I always say that if you don't know how to answer the media the people should be trained and later on after a few weeks there were some other Muslims called said no no no she is not Haram for the husband she can go to husband whoever is giving fatwa that's the Haram for the husband is wrong we are fighting like cats and dogs in front of the non-muslims we are washing our dirty Linen in public the joke is that both the groups of Scholars are quoting the same most of the Quran to give your fatwa the group of Scholars who say that she is Haram for the husband they are quoting of us from the Quran from Surah Nisa chapter number four verse number 22 which says that you cannot do nikah with the woman who your father has the Nikka with now in Arabic Nikka has got two meanings one meaning is marriage and the other meaning is sexual intercourse and you ask any Arab who is well versed with Arabic he'll tell you yes Nick I have got two meanings one is marriage the other sexual intercourse now this first group of Scholars which are majority belonging to a group of they take the meaning of Nikka as sexual intercourse so if you take the meaning of section and the cause the verse of the Quran says that you cannot have section in the cause with your sister you cannot a section into cause with a paternal Auntie with a mitten and auntie and you cannot of sexual intercourse with that woman who has had sexual intercourse with your father So based on this they say that father did sexual intercourse with the woman now that woman cannot do sexual intercourse with the son therefore the husband becomes Haram the other group is fighting no it is and we are fighting like accent dogs we should use a hikma in the plane Point number one what happened with Imran was not sectioning the cause it was Jabra rape so the difference between rape and sexual intercourse and rape is not called Nika in Arabic Point number one that answers no no no no you're playing with words it's the same no problem see as I told you if someone says something wrong there's a technique of debating if someone says two plus two is equal to 5 instead of arguing I will say okay take 200 000 Dirhams take 200 000 Dirhams Now give me 500 000 he'll say no no no turn the tip is over so when I was asked this question I told that I agree with you for sake of argument that nikam is section intercourse so the verse of the Quran would read that you cannot have sexual intercourse with your sister with the pattern in Auntie with your maternal auntie and with the woman who has had sexual intercourse with the father that means Quran gives permission you can have sexual intercourse with the neighbor woman with the woman on the street they said no no no I said why if you mean the communication intercourse so Quran says don't do sexual intercourse with your sister with a paternal anti maternal auntie and the woman who your father had intercourse with but you can have sexual intercourse with the neighbor woman with the woman on the street and the answer is no so the right meaning is marriage which reads you cannot marry your sister you cannot marry your paternal Auntie your maternal auntie and you cannot marry the woman that has married your father but surely you can marry the neighboring woman you can marry the woman on the street so with without fighting who is right you give this and no ulma will ever say that you can do section into with a girl on the street so use your hikmah and the problem is solved but unfortunately we are fighting like cats and dogs in front of the media and making a mockery of Islam hope to answer the question doing what's up [Music] [Applause]"
