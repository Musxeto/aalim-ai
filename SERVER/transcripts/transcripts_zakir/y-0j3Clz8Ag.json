  "title": "Can the Interest Money which is Haraam be given in Charity? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the third question is from seiful hussain annoy i am rubell from bangladesh my question is i have a savings account which provides me interest and i want to give it to the poor people is it possible a similar question is posed by farnas fatima can we give interest money in charity a similar question from hasa abubakar sir i have a bank account which has interest could i remove the interest amount without taking it from the account but giving from other source what can i do with this interest from the question posed by these three questioners it is clear that they realize that interest in rabbi is haram and allah mentions the word riba in the quran know that is that eight times and allah clearly mentions in surah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and 279 that if you give up not your demands for iba for interest then take notice of a war from allah is a major sin in islam and according to imam abdhabi he places riba interest as twelfth major sin in islam our beloved prophet muslim said there are 73 levels or 73 types of rabbah and the lowest level is equivalent to doing zina with your mother it's a say hadith the lowest level of riba is like doing dinner with your mother that's what a beloved prophet said and allah says that if you give up not your demands of riba of interest take notice of a war from allah and israel's soul there is hardly any sin you can find in the quran the hadith in which allah says allah will wage a war against you if you indulge in that sin imagine it is such a grievous hideous sin brava regarding the question posed by all three questioners that what to do with the interest money can you given charity can i take out from the bank and given charity can i keep the money in the bank and give from outside equivalent amount and charity as far as taking interest money and giving a charity if you have to take the interest money and give in charity before giving you have to take so taking so even if you take riba and give in charity even that hara the moment you take interest you are waging a war against online israel so there is no question of taking even taking the riba and giving in charities haram you have already done that by giving in charity you are lowering the degree but yet the haram act is done if you ask me the question i did not know till today rabbi's haram and i already have interest what to do that's a separate question but if someone says i'll keep the money in the bank and i'll give the interest to the poor people i would ask counter question and i've asked this question to many i know there are some scholars who say that no problem keep it in the bank take the money and give it in charity it's permitted i disagree with these columns totally i would like to ask them that if i ask you that can i deal in drugs in cocaine brown sugar or can i open alcohol factory and i invest 1 million and full 100 profit i get more than a million dollar a year i give that full seven and a half crore indian rupees in charity is it permissible hundred percent will say no i said why it's haram if that is haram having alcohol or dealing in alcohol or in drugs it is the nineteenth major sin in the book of imam dhabi khabar majesty and riba is twelfth magician so when you can give me permission for 12th the higher sin mind to giving me permission for the lower sin and imagine when you deal in alcohol though it's a major sin allah and his result doesn't wage a war against you but when you are dealing in riba whether giving or taking allah and riskull is waging a word against you when you are giving me permission to take the profit of interest money and given charity and no problem you should also give me permission to have an alcohol company hundred percent are given charity let me deal in drugs cocaine brown sugar no scholar will give you permission to deal in cocaine and say hundred percent you can give me charity because it's haram finn of city same thing in ribba when you're dealing in rabbi it is spoiling the society i've given a full talk on interest-free economy promulgated by the glorious quran it makes a poor man more poor and allah and his result of war so according to me taking interest and giving a charity is also haram there may be a situation that today you have come to know it is haram and you already have interest money what to do that i can answer but if you say keep on continuing keeping in the bank and take the interest and given charity that is totally haram allah and the school will wage a war against you it is totally prohibited if you did not know till now and today you have come to know then what can you do with the money that can be understood and many scholars give you an option for example sheikh bin basa said that this money you can give in paying debts of the other people but naturally all the scholars say that the interest money you cannot utilize for yourself though you cannot take interest but if it's the last resort it has come due to unwillingness for example there is pension in the pension without your permission they keep it in some interest based investment it's coming without your willingness that's a different question or you have someone in your job or your company it comes indirectly in which you have no control but you cannot yourself open a saving account or a fixed deposit and then give the money inside t no that's not permitted if you did and you say i will never do it again then i can tell you what can you do with the money number one you can give it to the debtors those weren't it number two you can use it for building toilets or bathrooms number three you can give in charity to the poor people but you can't give it in charity to your dependents you can't give it to your son or your daughter they are your dependents you can't give to your mother and father they are dependent in short you cannot give it to those people who you will inherit from in short and neither can you give it to those people which is your duty to take care of them you cannot give it to someone who you're supposed to take care of you can give it to a third party who is not under your care but as far as debt is concerned according to sheikh natamiya you can even give to those people who are under your care whether it be your son whether it be a father because that is not your liability your liability to take care of the day-to-day living so if your father or if your son or if your daughter is in debt you can use your zakat money for them also normal zakat you can't use for a dependent but for debt you can similarly this money what you have which unwillingly came to you you can use this interest money for paying the debt even of your dependent or anyone else you can use it for poor people or not your dependents you can use for charity or for building toilets but see to it that you do not continue indulging in the ripper because allah is very clear-cut that if you want to repent there are minimum five things that you should do number one agree it is wrong so now you have agreed that rabbi is wrong okay number two stop it immediately that means if you change your account you can't sell continue you have to stop that account put in a current account if you think it is a requirement to have a bank account okay i have a current account i lived in india we live in non-muslim countries and you can have a current account current account doesn't involve reply talk see to it that you open an account in which there is no report some accounts have river open a current account which is absolutely free of rama because when you open a savings account you're signing you're giving them permission to use your money and give you reba if you open a fixed deposit then you're giving them permission to use your money and they're giving your riba that's totally haram so if you have an account which is fixed deposit or if you're saving the account convert it to a free current account then what money you have you can give it in the ways that i've told you regarding if you have money in the bank and you have outside money yes you can swap it no problem but see to it but you cannot continue with that account even that's wrong what you have to do you have to come out of that account and open a current account if you feel that keeping money in your house is difficult it is not safe you can keep in the bank or you may have to involve in making transaction by cheque which may be a legal requirement open a current account which is absolutely free from it but best is to open an islamic bank and current account next best is if there's no islamic bank in your country or in the area where you're living second best is you can open a conventional bank but see to it it is a current account free from briber what rebar you had because of your ignorance that you can give a charity to the poor people it is permissible"
