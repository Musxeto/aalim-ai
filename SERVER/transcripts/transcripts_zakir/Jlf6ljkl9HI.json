  "transcript": "don't write Mohd that's the short form from Muhammad don't write Mohd always write completely Muhammad m-u-h-a-m-m-a-d because Mohd short form for Mohammed means a dog with a big mouth I am personally not in favor of writing mhd short form for Muhammad sallam that's the name of a prophet but I did not know that Muhammad means a dog with big mouth or not so I went on the Google and I switched and I found out in the Google search according to Dr Zakir Naik um means dog with a big mouth that means this social media post became so viral millions of people saw it so Google Search now has said okay according so Google doesn't have that intelligence of you know of trying to find out whether it's authentic but or the backy neck or not so when you search does Mohammed Mohd means a dog with the big mouth it will pop up doctor exactly that and this will post you'll see Muhammad means a dog with big mouth please let me make it very clear I never said this now's billah and I never said that Mohd short form from Muhammad means a dog with big mouth this is baseless I personally believe that it's preferable when you're writing right Muhammad the full form but in my mobile I use the word m-o-hd short form by I have a reason because the spelling of Muhammad are various I think there are more than 50 types of ways in which you can spell Muhammad some and there is m o h a m m e d eight letters in this eight letters for a variable m in the starting H the third letter and the first M and the last B these four are constant the remaining four letters can change so they can be various permutation and combination how you can spell the word Muhammad it can be m-o-h-a-m-m-e-d second letter can have two option is the m o or n u so it can be m-o-h-a-m-m-e-d or m-u-h-a-m-m-e-d the fourth letter m o h a can again be changed into variety Muhammad Muhammad you know again the second name m-o-h-a m m the six letter M can be there cannot be there some people spell Muhammad with single M some people Spell Mohammed with with a double n and the second last letter e can either be e can be a so when you do a mathematical calculation because of these four variables the second letter and the M can be they are not be the the seventh letter e or a the various permutation and combination you can have more than 50 different options so in my search when I write the name some people spell m o h some people spell m u h when I write the way they write in the visiting card I don't remember which spelling has each Muhammad used for himself so when I used to search because I don't know what spelling has he used so in my mobile all the Muhammad I spelled as Mohd coming so that there's no confusion it's easy to find though personally while writing I never prefer writing the short form emojc I don't like it but because there is a technical error of the different types of spelling available and when you search similarly I know that I've mentioned this Yusuf in my mobile when I type it's not coming y-u-s-u-f it's not there oh it's not coming I'm sure of it then I realized later on when I get some other way he spelled it y-u-s-o-u-f Yusuf the same way there are some names which can be spelled in multiple ways so in my mobile I use one common spelling irrespective how the person has spelled his name I use it same so that when I search for his name in my mobile I find it so in my mobile I do use the word Mohd for short form of moment because if I type Muhammad there will be a few hundred mod it is the most common name in the full world the most common name in the 8 billion human beings in the world out of which approximately 4 billion would be male and out of that out of 2 billion Muslims one billion Muslims would be would be Muslim male surely millions of them have been named by the name Muhammad it is the most common name but this message that don't write Muhammad Mohd short form because it means a dog with a big mouth is faceless it's totally wrong but I do suggest that it's preferable not to write short forms when you're writing a letter or referring to someone better write the full form irrespective the spelling maybe moh or m-u-h or double M or a single M or whether it be Ed or ad whatever it is that doesn't make a difference but preferable in the full form so just to cap it up that this message was not circulated by me and I tried to find out it's some say that it was already there in 2016. so 2016 means how many years back about seven years back when did original no but it's very common become very famous so in this message the first one is almost correct the second the third one is partly correct the second and the fourth one is completely wrong and I've given you the reply to each of these four words what is the correct rule hope let's answer the question"
