  "title": "Why Should the Holy City be Spelt as Makkah Not Mecca? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "don't write Mecca m e c c a always write correctly Makkah m a k k h because Mecca Mecca means a house of vines and this message is partly correct because I have said in some of my lectures earlier that the right spelling of the Arabic word Makkah is m a k k a h and don't spell it as m e c c a and I have a reason for that to say that Mecca means m e c c a a house of wines is baseless English means a place which is of a gathering of a people attracted for an event that's the English meaning but the right word for the city in Saudi Arabia where the Prophet were born is Makkah and the more correct spelling if you translate it from Makkah is m a k k a h I'm not so much particular someone makes small mistakes in transliteration and that's common but why do I say don't say Mecca Mecca because Mecca if you search it's Mecca Bingo is a chain of gambling Dems and casinos in UK so Mecca Bingo is known for gambling because Mecca Mecca Bingo is a chain of gambling dens and casinos so to differentiate between these two I said that but this information that Mecca's House of Minds I'm not aware from where did this person get from so therefore I said that the third message is partly right"
