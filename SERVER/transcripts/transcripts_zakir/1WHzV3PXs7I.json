  "transcript": "how do you think a Muslim should react to dating before marriage and whether in hajis there is any punishment to sodomites lesbianism they mentioned like that without the question that is dating allowed before marriage and is there any punishment for sodomy sodomy and less medicine is there any punishment as far as sodomy and lesbianism is concerned it's totally Haram Allah says in the Quran that do you prefer in lust men over women means send to the men that are you going after men rather than women talking about common Luth so it's Haram in Islam and lesbianism homosexuality is Haram and even involving with children there are Hadith is totally Haram there is no permission coming to dating in Islam dating if we're talking about the modern style like what people do what we think dating that is not allowed going meeting a girl outside Going In The Garden Alone with her and seeing whether trying and finding out what our views and going to move and sitting on the last bench going to movies wrongly was at last bench so the thing is that all these things practices that are prevalent normally is not allowed in Islam they're nothing like love before wedding lbw lbw haven't created nothing in like love before wedding but fine but the prophet also said that it is a Sunnah it is preferable to look at the girl they're going to marry like there was one of the sabbas who told the prophet I'm going to get mad the prophet the new look at the guy said no he said go and look at her so that doesn't mean you cannot interact with her that you cannot select that you cannot choose the prophet said that when you have to choose a life partner there are four things in which a person looks at one is virtue second Is wealth nobility and Beauty and the best is about you so that means you can if there is a proposal if someone gets to you or you fine and you come to know fine you can have a meeting with the would-be spouse the girl that would be husband the boy the would be wife but when you meet there should be a mahram along with you either the boy's sister or the girl's brother because the prophet said that if two foreign males Nam Haram alone in a closed room the third person is the devil so maintaining the modesty maintaining the hijab level surely you can meet the would be husband or would-be wife interact exchange views find out the views no problem speak once twice Thrice one hour two hours no problem but not in seclusion not outside in a garden alone or in a movie theater or going to McDonald is fine so within the purview of the Islamic Sharia you can surely meet you can choose you can reject you can reject and go and look for another one but within the purview of the Islam Sharia so if you're done within there's no problem it is preferability so this is what you call this dating it's about Islam meditating is allowed non-islamic reading is not allowed if you call the deity of the answers the question"
