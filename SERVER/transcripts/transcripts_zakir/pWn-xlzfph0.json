  "title": "Why is Homosexuality condemned in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the main doubt on homosexuality like is it prohibited in Islam and why so because like I had like from the past five years I've been with so many homosexuals it's like uh I mean their feelings that they have for the for the same sex or whatever it is it's so true I mean it's like the same kind of pain what we might feel for for maybe our husbands or whoever it is if it's wrong why is it wrong sister has a question that what does Islam say about homosexuality and if it's wrong why it is wrong Allah says in the Quran in Surah Israel 17. verse 32 that come not close to adultery for adultery then evil opening other roots to evil besides that Allah says chapter number seven that telling to men that do you practice Your Lust after men in preference to women that means homosexuality is prohibited in Islam in the Quran because almighty God made the human beings Allah says in the Quran in Surah Room chapter number 30 verse number 21 that he has put love between the hearts of husband and wife almighty God has made the human being in such a way that they love the opposite sex generally naturally no human being loves the same sex I'm talking about the love which is required in husband and wife not the platonic love which you have between your brothers and between your sisters now initially there was a research which said that homosexuality is genetic so during question answer time somebody asked me the way you're asking if homosexuality is genetic then how is that human being to blame it came from his parents so why is he to blame like you're saying if someone loves someone else so why should he be blamed I said this is a research this is a hypothesis it's not a fact and later on we came to know that this hypothesis was wrong and the person who propounded this hypothesis himself was a homosexual so homosexuality is not genetic it comes today science tells us how do homosexuals evolve because what almighty God has given permission for a human being what's permitted you get married do Nika you can have sex with your wife and Islam says that while doing having sex with your wife is also worshiping Allah because you're preventing the Haram you are not going outside the marital bond to satisfy your urges that's Islam Today science tells us today research tells us that those people we have multiple life Partners outside the marriage bond as compared to those who only have with their spouses they enjoy the sexual life much better than the others and what happens today when you get tired with it you go to the Western countries you have Mistresses 5 10 20 no problem you start then doing unnatural things when you start doing unnatural things you don't follow the law of the Creator and you try and satisfy your urges in the wrong way the moment you keep on doing the wrong way then you keep on going beyond what is natural and that's how the person becomes homosexual it is not genetic because you go beyond the limits what almighty God has permitted you you try other things you try unnatural things and finally you land up by saying you you no longer enjoy having sex with the opposite sex so you have sex with the same sex so sister because they've broken the law of almighty God and they do unnatural things that's how psychologically they become a homosexual so but naturally if you break the law of almighty God that's totally wrong and that's how it lands up a person be homosexual so they are to blame and Islam prohibits homosexuality even Christianity private homosexuality most of the religions are against homosexuals it's now the Western countries are saying because in democracy whatever majority says you win majority wins in Islam majority doesn't means the truth wins I remember when I had gone to Canada in 1996 the first time I went to give a lecture in the front page I saw a man kissing a man a man kissing a man and it says that they have married each other today in Western countries if I speak against homosexuality it's a crime it's a crime so what we realize that previously previously all the countries homosexuality was a crime then some Western countries like Canada gave legal sanction to it today most of the Western countries homosexuality is legal even India is a country where they come from they are thinking the thinking to make it legal so what we realize what is truth is truth majority doesn't mean what is wrong is wrong and in Islam and most of the major religion of the world homosexuality is a sin it's a crime it will not take you to heaven it will take you to hell hope that answers the question"
