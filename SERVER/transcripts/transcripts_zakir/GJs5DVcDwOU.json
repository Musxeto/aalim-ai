  "title": "How to pray Salaah with Complete Concentration and thinking about Allah? â€“ Fariq Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is abdul rahman raziq assalamu alaikum my question is how to pray a salah with full concentration and thinking about allah allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran in surah minoon chapter number the believers they are successful those who they are in their prayer humbly submissive so you need to have khushu in your prayer and it is common that our mind wanders during the prayer many people their mind wanders during the prayer if you are a businessman you will think about your business how much profit you've made during the prayer if you are a student you'll think about your studies if you have appeared for an examination you will start reviewing the examination paper during the salah for question 2 i should have written so and so answer question 3 i made a mistake in the answer so it is common that our mind wanders during the prayer how do we prevent our mind from wandering during the prayer the first thing that we need to do is to focus on the meaning of what we are reciting if you know arabic as a language this is the best if you do not know arabic as a language then we should recollect the meaning we need to memorize the meaning of what we are reciting for example when we recite surah fatiha alhamdulillah in our mind we should recollect the meaning all priests to allah the lord of the worlds the most gracious the most merciful we should recollect the meaning but after a few days after a few weeks even this will become mechanical so after recollecting the meaning we should ponder upon the meaning of what we are reciting and if we do so inshallah our mind may not wonder and i would like to share with you an incident once the people they were offering salah and the imam and the muqtadi the people who are following the imam after they completed their prayer they were confused did we offer 2 raka or do they offer 3 rakah in the maghrib prayer so one person he says that i am sure that we have offered only two raka in the maghreb prayer so the people they ask him how do you know how can you be so sure how can you be 100 sure so he says i am hundred percent sure that we have offered two raka instead of offering three raka in the maghrib prayer because whenever i offer the magri prayer in each raka i do calculation of the profit that i have made in my shop i have three shops in each raka i do calculation of one shop so in three raka i do calculation of three shops but in this salah i did calculation only of two shops i did not do calculation of three shops so that's the reason i am sure that we have offered only two raka so it is common that people their mind wanders during the prayer and the reason our mind wanders is because our mind is not occupied an empty mind is a devil's workshop he mentions in his book on page number 200 that every individual stands in front of his lord on two different occasions the first is while he is offering salah and the second is on the day of judgement when he meets his lord ibn al-qayim rahimahullah he said these two different occasions that an individual a believer stands in front of his lord but if you do not offer salah correctly then your accountability on the day of judgment it will not go with ease now let's discuss a few ways in which we can attain and concentration in our prayer the first is bearing in mind who you're standing in front of knowing the greatness of allah subhana wa tala knowing how great allah subhanahu ta'ala is if you know how great allah subhana tala is inshallah you will have hushu and concentration in your prayer the second is knowing that allah subhana wa tala he is keeping an eye on you and he is watching you the third is offering your salah with the intention of gaining complete reward from allah the fourth and as i mentioned earlier it is a very important point that recollecting and concentrating upon the meaning of what you are reciting you should concentrate on the verse of the glorious quran and also you should concentrate on the ad card that you say during the prayer so this is very important besides this you should also see to that your mind does not wander during the prayer you should also see to it that there are no objects around you that could distract you for example images people making some noises there may be music people causing disturbance when you offer salah you should pray in such a place where there is no disturbance and i would like to share with you a small personal tip concentrate and focus only about the salah and make your mind set in such a way that you are going to face your lord and then start your prayer inshallah you will have too and concentration in your prayer and our blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that allah turns towards a slave as long as he does not look around in his prayer so do not look around in your prayer so we should not look around in our prayer and we should also remember death we should offer our salah as though it is our last prayer and if we offer our salah in this way inshallah we'll offer it correctly with khushu in surah and kabut chapter number 29 verse number 45 prevents from shameful and unjustice salah prayer prevents from shameful and unjust deeds if we offer our salah correctly with khushu with concentration we will have a righteous life and salah will prevent us from shameful and immodest deeds the first thing among the deeds that will be questioned to us on the day of judgment it is our prayer if it is done correctly the remaining deeds it will follow so we pray to allah subhana with allah that may he accept all our salah all our prayer and may he help us to get ultimate hosho and concentration during a prayer"
