  "title": "If Allah has Power Over All Things, Does This Justify Our Sins - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yes brother I I have read in the Holy Quran that Allah put everything on this a person argued that since Allah is poent over everything uh he argued with me that if I do a sin or I do a good deed Allah is poent over that also and if I'm a Muslim or a non-muslim or be of any religion Allah is poent over that also so I was not satisfied with this argument but I wanted to know your answer to it ask the question that one of his friends asked him that the Quran say the right translation is Allah has power of all things if Allah has power of all things if someone does a mistake he has the power of all things if someone is a Muslim Allah is potent mean Allah is power of all things so what is the question potent means I know the meaning of potent but if someone is a Muslim Allah has power all things Allah has power if someone makes a mistake he has the power to forgive he has the power to forgive if someone is a non-muslim Allah has power over him yes power over him do you mean to say that does Allah have power to forgive him ah this is a wrong quotation I thought why is talking about that what talking about is is destiny that Allah almighty God writes the destiny and everything happens according to Destiny so the ver of the Quran what we quoted is wrong Allah destines and most of the religions whether it be Hinduism Islam we agree that there's something like Destiny and we follow the destiny the question is that if it's mentioned my destiny I'm going to rob and I Rob who's to blame Allah Allah wrote in the destiny I'm going to rob therefore I robbed who's to blame Allah why am I to blame if it mentioned my destiny I'm going to murder someone if it Destiny I have to murder and I murder who's to blame Allah has to if it mention my destiny I'm going to become a non-muslim and I become who's to blame Allah so why should you put me in Hell brother we have to believe in KH in Destiny but people misunderstand what is this what is Destiny and for example I give an example that if in a class the teacher is teaching 100 students and at the end of the year before the examination the teacher says you you will get a first class first you will get second class you will fail and the examination takes place the test goes on the results come out he comes out first class first he gets a second class you fail I'm example don't feel bad so I'm asking the question that the person who failed the student who failed can you blame the teacher because you predicted I will fail I failed can you blame the teacher no because the teacher taught for one year she knew that you know this student is very studious he does his studies properly he get a first class first second class this person bunks sees movies hookies will fail so because the teacher predicted can you blame the teacher no similarly Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala not like the teacher far superior he has he has knowledge of the future the teacher told about experience but almighty God he has Gap he knows what's going to happen in the future almighty God writes in advance for example you come at a crossroad now there are five roads Road 1 2 3 4 5 you can choose any five you choose Road two now Allah in advance knows that when this person will come at a crossroad he will be choosing Road two so Allah writes in advance this person when he comes at the Crossroad he will choose Road two it is not because Allah is writing that you're choosing is because you will be choosing Allah has written in advance have you understood Allah has now now after you pass your 12th you can become a doctor or you can become an engineer you choose to become a doctor it is not because Allah has written you're becoming a doctor Allah knows when you pass the Standard 12 you can either become a doctor or engineer you have go good marks in both pcbm physics chemistry biology and maths good marks you choose to become a doctor so Allah knows you had two choice you will become a doctor so Allah writes in advance you'll become a doctor now when you go and live your life you can either earn th rupes honestly or Rob th000 rupees choice is yours you choose to Rob Allah knows that when this person grows up he'll have option to earn money honestly or Rob he chose to Rob because he will be choosing to Rob Allah knows after he become the age of 25 he will rob Allah knows in advance and written in advance it is not because Allah has written that he is robbing because he will be robbing Allah wrote in advance do you understand so the destiny is nothing but Allah is written in advance some things are fixed when a person is born Etc but remaining thing is your choice is yours you choose therefore he said that make yourself so great that before Destiny God should himself ask his follower that what is your wish it's the sh therefore we are to blame for our Deeds we are to blame so therefore if the person says I do a sin who's to blame he's to blame Allah had given him Choice here the guidance follow it if you follow it fine if you don't follow you to blame to similarly for non-muslim question that if non-muslim who to blame our beloved Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said every child is born in he's born as a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits the will to God every child when he's born his heart beats according to the way of Allah he breathes according to the way of Allah his desires are the way of Allah later on our Prophet said he is influenced by his Elders by his parents then he starts doing idle worship then he starts doing fire worship and then he may become a non-muslim therefore whenever a non-muslim becomes a Muslim convert is not the correct word the right word is revert every human being is born as a Muslim he goes to the wrong track and when he comes back the more appropriate word is revert so tell your non-muslim friend yet here is the Quran follow it you have a choice to become a Muslim tell him read the Quran follow it if you have any problem come and ask me if you cannot ask go to other institution by the name of a and they will help you out take this book now tomorrow you cannot tell anyone that you had no chance to become a Muslim fine and if he counters and says that that you read the Bible and you read the V and become a Hindu or a Christian give me and you can see my cassettes and you can argue both ways you have BL way traffic not a one way traffic if you do the same thing with you yeah the Bible read the Bible become a Christian so you tell him I'm more Christian than you right or wrong so two-way traffic you not oneway traffic I always believe open oneway traffic is wrong we give equal chance to both and Allah has given us this brain Allah has given this Logic the reason that we are higher human me beings is not because we look very good or very handsome so we have to use this gray matter to come to the truth so tell your non-muslim friend that yes Allah has given everyone you have a right to choose but Allah knows in advance that this person after you give the Quran may become a Muslim the first person second person no Allah knows first person yes he'll become second person won't become you and I don't know I'm just an example I really don't know whether the first person who will become or second person will become or none will become or both will become I'm just give an example so if he becomes even that was mentioned in the the Quran was given and he read he accepted or did not accept so on the day of judgment the Quran says all those who reject the truth none will ever say that oh God you have been unjust they only say please forgive us Allah say it's too late too late so Allah says that none of the people who will be put in the Hellfire will ever object to the justice of almighty God because everything will be in front of them like today we doting and what happened yesterday we can see that time I don't know how will Allah do Allah says that orans will be witness against you your eyes will be witness against you so they will not be required of anyone you yourself will realize what your mistake was and then you will plead to Allah that please forgive me Allah it's too late the chance was given here you have made so many mistake Allah gave you chance you made a Allah gives you chance here after this life next life day of judgment and then based on your Deeds you will be put your deed your IM all put together with Than Hell or Heaven hope that answer the question"
