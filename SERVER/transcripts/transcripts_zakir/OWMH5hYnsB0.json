  "title": "Sanjeev Asks Dr Zakir, “Is not the Hindu Concept of Rebirth or Reincarnation more Logical...?”",
  "transcript": "the first question we have is from shell cut Aziz Kashmir India why can't we believe in reincarnation or rebirth which the Hindus believe we believe in the life hereafter which is quite tough as compared to rebirth that is samsara scientifically the similar question asked on the same topic by Sanjeev a businessman from India what will we do in Jannah forever till eternity will we not get bored with unlimited time given in hand the rebirth concept seems more logical than that given in the Quran maybe the concept of eternity is misunderstood by the Muslim Ummah and instead rebirth theory holds its place am I correct or not the two question posed by a Muslim brother the first that isn't the concept of samsara the cycle of birth and rebirth more scientific and the second question posed by the non Muslim brother that Sanjeev who says that what will you do in general what do you get bored and is in the concept of Hinduism of rebirth much better than the concept of you are after in Islam when we study Hindu scriptures we come to know about the concept what is mentioned in Hinduism but what the common in the belief is in the concept of the cycle of birth death rebirth called as samsara by the Hindu scholars or it's also called as the cycle of reincarnation and when reading the scriptures we come to know it's mentioned in bhagavad-gita chapter number 2 was the Mitanni - that like a person wears new garments and new clothes and thrown away the old clothes similarly the soul puts on a new body and gives up the whole body based on this they have the concept of samsara but when we read the Vedas the way those are the most authentic and the highest amongst all the in the scriptures it is highest in authority when we read the Vedas it talks about the Pune genome Pune in Sanskrit means mixed Jannah means but super nerdy nummies next birth no way does the way that speak about birth then death then rebirth then death then rebut no way this is the concept given by the Hindu scholars and pundits but the Vedas which is the highest scriptures amongst all the Hindu scriptures speak about Pune genom means next life they misunderstand and they say it means death birth death but it's Nova mentioned in fact it is similar to what is mentioned in the Quran that we are born in this world then we die then we were resurrected in the next life the Muslim we believe in the concept of year after next life exactly the same what is mentioned in the Vedas now let us try to understand why do the Hindu scholars speak about the samsara that is the cycle of birth death rebirth or the cycle of reincarnation because they could not justify or could not logically prove that why are some human beings in the world they born handicapped some are born healthy some human beings are born with congenital defects some are born rich some are born poor so how can God be unjust so to justify this concept that how can God be unjust by making some people born in a rich family some in a poor family some healthy some with congenital defects they came with the concept that if a person does sin in the next life he will be born with the defects he may be born poor he may be born with congenital defects he may be born handicapped so this is how they justify as far as the Islamic concept is concerned regarding why some people are born rich or poor handicapped or healthy we'll discuss that later but first let us try to understand that is this concept of samsara the theory of reincarnation or the cycle of birth death and rebirth is scientific or not what the Hindu scholars they say that the living creatures keep on being born in different types and the highest is the human being and if you do a sin in the next life you are born with a lesser category and with a lesser degree you'll be more handicapped you may be born poor my basic question is that if we compare life what was 200 years back 100 years back as compared to today is there Phin in the world increasing or decreasing and the criminal activities increasing or decreasing and any logical person will tell you that sin in the world is increasing the criminal activity is increasing the illegality is increasing so if the sin is increasing logically the human beings in the world should decrease but when we check the population of the world every year the world population is increasing previously it was a few thousand human beings then became a hundred thousand then became million then became billion today it is seven point seven five billion so if the sin is increasing and if they agree that if you do sin you are born with a lesser category or you are demoted so human beings logically they should keep on decreasing in population so scientifically this concept doesn't hold water again if we will change the scriptures it talks about sward and nerd talks about paradise and health so if a person does good deeds his Karma are good he goes to work if it has bad deeds he goes to work now the reasoning goes to forgive it is a reward given by Almighty God to him and the reason he was to narc hell it is a punishment so imagine Almighty God puts a human being into sorry because he wants to reward him for his good deeds then he puts him into Newark because he wants to give punishment so once a reward is given or a punishment is given when the human being comes back to the earth when he's reborn why the born as handicapped why he born poor if the punishment is already given to him in hell it is illogical for God to make him reborn in this world with the congenital defect make him reborn as a poor person why so the concept of Heaven and Hell together with the cycle of birth rebirth doesn't match logically at all you cannot have both be there at one of them if you believe that if he's done some bad deeds in life he'll be born inferior or with residential defect or in poverty then where is the concept of heaven and health so saying that the Hindu philosophy that is explained by the pundits is totally unscientific and illogical but what is poking in the way that is correct the Veda speaks about Pune genome the next life same as what the Quran says and what the disease so logically and scientifically the Vedas are correct but the explanation of the Indo scholars of samsara is against the Veda is against or on the concept of the way that matches with the concept of the Quran and regarding what will the people do in heaven the question posed by our non-muslim brother Sanjeev they will get bored in the heaven but naturally what you want you'll get it will be bliss it will be peace Salaam Salaam peace but the highest level in the Jannah in Paradise Fe the verge of Allah subhana Allah I think the face of Almighty God and that is what people would yearn for besides having all the other of the peace the serenity no problem it will be only trying to leti seeing the face of Allah subhanAllah people will yearn so of course there will be something to look forward in the Janna so the brother because he doesn't know about the Islamic concept he's not well-versed with the hadith of the prophet musa alehsalaam the highest level if he in the face of allah subhanaw taala and will not always see the faithful as monotonic only those who have reached the higher level will see and there was some time when Allah wants to show it to the human beings now coming to the basic question how can you logically prove that why are some human beings born handicapped sama born healthy some are born in poverty some are born rich allah says in the quran in surah milk chap number 67 verse number 2 allah we collected more towel hata it is Allah who has created that a life to test which of his green deeds this life is a test for the hereafter and based on this test Allah will check who is good indeed and if you pass this test you go to paradise you go to general go to work if you fail you go to hell you go to Newark so this life is the test for Hereafter and Allah subhana WA Ta'ala tests different human beings in different ways when you have the examination every year the examination paper keeps on changing you don't expect the teacher will give the same paper the teacher to are the same question is the same question as other than where is the test so similarly Allah subhana WA Ta'ala tests different people in different ways and depending upon the test Allah has given you he will judge you accordingly for example those people who are rich are born in rich family all I have given wealth for them one of the pillars of Islam the third pillar of Islam is zakat that is every rich Muslim and that Muslim who are the favor of more than than the sub level more than any pogroms of world he or she every lunar year should give 2.5% of that excess wealth in charity this is called as a hat if every human being gives a hat poverty would eradicate from this world they will not be a single human being who'll die of hunger now many people would say that the poor man oh how sad it is such a pity that he is born in poverty but for the poor man in the test of zakat he gets hundred out of hundred one hundred percent months because he doesn't have to give the cut he doesn't have a saving of more than 85 grams of gold for the rich man he has to give minimum two point five percent if he does not give you get less marks if he gives you get full marks he may get 50% he may get zero percent but for the poor man he already gets handed out of hundred in zakat because he's poor for him in the test indifferent every Muslim should do his job but the rich man who has an apartment of many bedrooms and when guests come that cetera for him to maintain the job is much more easier because he wealthy have got many rooms for a poor man who may be living in just a small studio apartment or maybe living in hut for him to maintain the job is difficult so each one has a different test accordingly we think with our logic oh the man is poor how sad and a beloved prophet said it is easier for a poor man to go to Jannah and the nourishment so we think poorer person actually for him it is easier he has a different set of rules a different test but it is easier for him to go to Jannah then rich person now someone asked me that why is a baby born with congenital heart disease why some human beings a born handicapped every human mean according to a beloved prophet is born as a Muslim he is born in benefit on the innate nature he is Masumi sinless it is not because they did a sin in the previous life that is born handicapped this concept is totally logical but it is a test it may not be a test for young child it's a test for the parents Allah wants to test the parents that do the parents yet have faith in a last man at all or not the parents may be good Muslims they may be purified on the day they may be fasting in the month of Ramadan they may have given the the card then they have a child which is born handicapped so Allah subhana WA Ta'ala wants to give a higher level of tests to the parents that after they have done all these good deeds and after have rewarded them now when I give them a child who's born handicapped do they yet have faith in Allah not a good Muslim will say this is from Allah be accepted and they will yet continue thanking Allah and doing the duties more difficult the tests higher as a reward for example if you appear for a bachelor the nuts the chances of passing are very high but chances of passing bachelor's in science is little bit more difficult if you appear for a medical examination the chances are much less so higher or more difficult is the test higher is the reward but when you pass a bachelor Vinod's in front of a name your name will yet have mister in front of you but when you pass the examination of medicine bachelors in medicine in front of your name there'll be a dr doctor because it's more difficult to pass the honor is more you start being called as a doctor so higher the test higher is the reward so allah subhana WA Ta'ala - different human being in different ways that very then there is different levels of richness and poverty health and wealth this is a logical concept nowhere does the Quran say that if you are born poor will go to hell or if you're born handicapped will go to hell all the children all dealing means I'm assuming they're born depending upon the test and how well you pass it will you get a reward in the Hereafter so the concept of Islam of year after and Heaven and Hell Jannah and those are if the same as what is mentioned in the highest Hindu scripture that the Veda talking about pune genom just because the Hindu scholars could not justify this inequality in the human means they came with the philosophy which is again the Vedas but if you read then the Scriptures into the same concept at that and Islam hope that's a question"
