  "transcript": "i'm mrs bhavna and sorry so kindly please bear with me and please excuse me humbly and peacefully i have been born in a gen society living in a hindu society educated in a pure convent and married a muslim i have married as per the indian marriage act and i'm staunchly eagerly waiting to accept islam as my wholehearted religion but please my brothers and sisters what you preached what you said about islam i'm very thankful to you for enlightening me i am really reborn today but what you preach and what you say and what is in islam excuse me i don't find people practicing that wholeheartedly they are not attracting me can you please give me a solution because when you speak of fundamentalism in islam it is positive when you speak of intolerance it's positive but in practice i don't find so can you please guide me mr a good question first of all i'd like to congratulate her and i welcome her and as the statistics reborn the right word in islam is revert because according to a beloved prophet allah every child is born in dunal is born as a muslim muslim means a person who submits his will to almighty god every human being initially when he's born he submits his will to almighty god later on the prophet said that he's influenced by the parents by the elders by the teachers then he may become a fire worshipper may go on the wrong track so therefore when a person comes back to the original faith the right word is not convert not reborn it is revert so sister i welcome you back to this faith of peace and submitting evil to almighty god as far question is concerned that you have heard the lectures and you agree with the points you have read about islam but one objection is that muslims or most of the muslims according to you they are not following the teachings what is the solution sister i do agree with you i do agree with you that many don't follow but according to statistics the religion which is the maximum followed i'm not talking in numbers if you count the heads those who profess a religion number one would be christianity somewhere close to 2 billion islam 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion but the percentage which practices and follows the religion maximum is islam number one maximum but yet i do agree with you that in terms of numbers because 1.3 billion followers even if it be a small percentage the numbers will run in millions of muslims don't follow the religion therefore sister to understand islam don't look at muslims please and always say to understand a religion don't look at the followers of the religion but look at the authentic sources please don't look at me don't look at the muslims around you and i gave you the example of the car and the driver if you want to know how good the car is and the person who does not know how to drive sits behind the steering wheel and he has an accident he bangs up the car who will blame the car or the driver he'll blame the driver so please don't understand islam by looking at the muslims that's the reason we are giving these lectures for both muslim the non-muslims alike those muslims who have shortcomings we are trying to get them closer to the truth because they may be namesake muslims we are trying to make them practicing muslim at the same time we are driving the message of islam to the non-muslims also so that you understand this religion and though you were born you were born in a jain family and you had non-muslim around you you're married to a muslim but today maybe after hearing the lecture and after learning about islam you have come back to the faith and as you said that previously maybe only for the sake of name you may have adopted the surname ansari but today you have come back to this true faith and we congratulate and please sister if you want to look at a muslim to understand islam the best example is the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him this book the quran and the sayings of the prophet have the solution for the problems of humanity don't look at the muslims some muslims may be close to islam some may be far away from islam so look at the main source understand it follow it inshaallah will get peace in this world as well as the hereafter inshallah thank you very much"
