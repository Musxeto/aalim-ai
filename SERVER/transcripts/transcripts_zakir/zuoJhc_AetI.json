  "title": "What Needs to be done to Galvanise Global Solidarity against Atrocities - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "you talked about the need you know for the global Community you know to rise up against this speak against this atrocities and so on uh even among the Islamic countries for instance there has been this luster you know attitude towards coming out to condemn this or to speak with one voice that is to say within the Muslim umah there is also not a united front you know against some of these atrocities why are we here and what need to be done you know to be able to Galvanize that Global solidarity against this atrocities first I'll answer that this time I would like to really appreciate the divers at the Muslim I'll come to it later on the non-muslims also are voicing their opinion and they saying what's happening in Israel what the Israeli force is doing against the Palestinian is nothing but genocide you have mass protest not only in the Muslim countries and non-muslim Muslim countries in USA in UK the countries which are supporting Israel but the people are against the government what they're doing is wrong that's one thing good as far as the Muslims are concerned I gave a talk on 13 Point action plan for the Muslim umah as far as Palestine is concerned 13 points what high points I give the first seven points can be done by each and every Muslim the next sixth Point can be certain people number one I'll just say in brief the talk is very long one I'll say in a few minutes number one is that every Muslim has should Dua the least he can do do Dua that let let Allah subh give sub to the Palestinians let them let the martys inshah to J so first pray for them minimum you can do is pray for them because we Muslims are like one body if one of them is hurt if one part is hurt the full body is in pain yes and we have to be like a brick wall together unfortunately Muslim number one we have to do Dua number two we have to talk about the atrocities the Israelis are doing on the Palestinians whether on your Facebook whether on your social media whe on whatever way you can you should and everyone today in the world it's a global village you have an account you may have 1,000 followers 10,000 followers 100,000 whatever it is you have to do your job so number two is spread this message that TR it is done by Israel on the Palestinians how they are killing innocent people they are targeting imagine it is against International War crime International rules say in a war also you cannot Target civilians you cannot kill children same thing what Islam says in the Quran what they're doing they're targeting hospitals and then they're putting a fake news that it was the Hamas missile which misfired all lies and the Hamas missiles are homemade small thing nothing compared to the Israeli which can destroy the full building namas is you know homemade all weapons this is the best so and they saying go to see to Al jaaz They are all getting fabricated news then they say that Hamas killed 40 babies all wrong we Muslims should let us spread this this is number two I've got 13 points number three is that see to it that we can make this popular amongst the people that we know the VIPs we know we should tell them personally whoever you feel in your list is this to see what they can do for the cause of Palestine number four you should make it on billboards or on your colleges on your universities this information number five you should take a protest M as many people protest you know protest could mean VI peaceful we should have peaceful protest we cannot be like them just because they do some atrocities it should be peaceful protest large numbers that is number five number six see to it that we can boycott the products if he boycott starting have products what the Israeli products it will be an economical yeah so number six is uh boycotting the products number seven we can give whatever charity we can for the cause of Palestine whether for aid for reconstructing the country for rebuilding the hospital for rebuilding the school whatever you can and Allah subhana wa taala looks at the percentage of the donation not about the amount so I tell that if a person who earns $1,000 a month and if he gives $100 it is better than a person who earns a billion dollar and donates a million a person who earns a billion dollar a month and donates a million dollar he's giving .1% of his earnings and the poor man who's earning $1,000 and giving $100 he giving 10% so the $100 will get him 100 times more blessings than the billion person who earning a billion dollar and giving a million dollar so Allah subhana wa ta'ala almighty God looks at the percentage not at the amount so give charity then and this seven points any Muslim can do you can donate at least at least 10 n 100 na he can the remaining six points are for some people like you have a satellite channel everyone the N so you can promote these things on your satellite channel yes in the media yeah we can have a W for the cause of Palestine you should have a battery of lawyers to fight in the international court of law so that you know they can file International case against Israel this is point number 8910 then on a political the country should give to the Embassy if they have in Israel Embassy they should give official letter from their country to the ambassador of Israel in the country protesting against it on a high level they can be trade byot not buycotting good trade backout we will not allow any Israeli Goods to come to our country and if you go on a high level that is the 13th point is we the um should be United right and the um is not if we are united like how we were previously in the caliphate right therefore when I went to soot was happy at least Soo as a caliphate maybe only Soo MH but we are talk about the calip of the full um so if we have a caliphate like aifa like before then we'll be United and they will not be able to play around with us right and if we have like how they have uh interpole International police we should have Islam pole Islamic police how they have a natto you know natto North attic North Atlantic Treaty or I'm to politics why don't we have AO Muslim country organization the NAT says now there are 30 members or 31 members if you attack any one of the country as though you're attacking all 31 countries together so why don't we Muslims get together and the 57 Muslim countries get together and say if you attack any one of the Muslim country as though you're attacking all the Muslim majority countries if you can do that that would be wonderful"
