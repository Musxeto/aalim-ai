  "transcript": "okay can we have the last and the final question from the sister please [Music] now [Music] and asking about the obligatory of straightening the rule while performing so long like our brothers said yes now it is hard for some people to straighten the rules while performing towards so doctor can you explain what's the connection between the significance of straightening the rule and the unity of the human and also the impact of not doing so and why did our prophets urged the Muslim to do that thank you the sister has the question that what is the importance of treating the rose and when did the Muslim ummah see when we talk about Unity people talk about Theory Islam shows you practically when we talk that we are Against Racism we practically demonstrated five times in our Salah that will become together with the King of Pop or when we stand for Salah we stand in the same row shoulder to shoulder said that the king cannot stand the rich one stands first and the poorer won't stand behind no whoever comes early he's in the first row whoever stands in the first row he gets Muslim up and the Beloved Prophet said do not let anyone get up from the seed for a person who comes late that is also prohibited foreign man comes first he gets most of up the prophet said the one in the first row gets the maximum then the second row then the third row the prophet before starting this Allah he said he turned behind and said state in your rules the feet should touch the feet and the shoulder to shoulder why so that if we have any racism that I am white and he's black I am rich and he's poor that racism is removed shoulder shoulder feet to feet with him he said that when me sahaba stood our shoulders touch the shoulders our feet touch the feet when they went in Ruku if it was instead the Sabbath used to State it when you go in Brooklyn you realize that the that this that the stuff is not correct that time but naturally when the in the Ruku they can see their feet they stated it is what is the importance the importance is so that if there is any ill feeling between your brothers that ill feeling is removed do not leave any gap for the city meaning what I mean through that the love of the Brotherhood is increased it's very important but again if some people don't have knowledge and they don't want to do it don't fight because that will be a fitna straightening is important but if your neighbor who's a Muslim he doesn't know the Hadith he thinks it's not required and he runs away from you you don't fall your Salah do you understand it's a Praying Salah is more important straightening is upside we should but if the person doesn't know he doesn't want to come close to his running away from you I know some people you go close they go running what do you want to do you cannot chase them the full Salah you tried once happens good so don't make it troublesome but according to say Hadith yes we should straighten the room you should stand in the same room it's important don't leave any Gap and that's what most of the Imam before starting the Salah say this increases the Brotherhood of Dance"
