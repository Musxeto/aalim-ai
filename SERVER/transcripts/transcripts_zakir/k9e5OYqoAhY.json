  "title": "Dr Zakir Naiks Public Lectures are Less. Why?",
  "transcript": "there's a question from the YouTube I a creativity assalamu alikum my name is isbah from Pakistan why don't you give public lectures as you used to give before the question asked by isba is that why don't I give public lectures as I used to give before the answers can be divided into two or three parts number one I remember when I started doing dawa in the early ' 90s you know I got inspired by shik in 1987 I do mainly one to1 dawa then in the early '90s I started G public talks and then I started traveling the first talk I think I gave was in South Africa 1994 my first talk outside India and then I remember I us to give a lot of talks I remember when I went to Kuwait in 1998 in one day I gave eight talks one is immediately after F early in the morning and last talk was 2:00 in the night eight talks eight public talks in a day I remember when I to travel towards the end of the '90s and the early parts of 2000 has to spend maybe a few days and has to give tens of lectures on average few lectures a day maybe more than one lecture a day two three lectures a day on average so I spend the about five days and about maybe 10 15 lectures may spend a week and may give maybe 20 lectures later on by the help of Allah subhana wa tala as as time went on growing alhamdulillah Allah gave more power in my speech Allah put love and mercy Into the Heart of the people previously when I to give lectures my audience I remember the person who inspired me Allah gr J he had told me when you come to Saudi Arabia expect few people don't expect the way you get in India thousands of people and the first talk I gave in Saudi Arabia it was in 1996 if I'm not mistaken my first talk in cheda I was expecting maybe 10 15 people and mallah more than a thousand people came so Allah is blessed that initially when it started only the numbers were in thousands okay Western countries were initially few hundred thousands but as talks as Allah kept on putting love of me to the hearts of the Muslims and even many of the non-muslims then the strategy changed and maybe in the year 2010 onward Etc I preferred giving few lecture with larger audiences and that's how my talks became few but the numbers became large and then then we were more involved in the media we used to record the program and see to it that many people used to watch so that's how most of the talks abroad you know used to have large Gathering maybe in if you see from the year 2010 to 2016 we has to travel a lot the audiences abroad 5,000 10,000 20,000 50,000 you know large gatherings in India it was 100,000 200,000 500,000 1 million so few lectures larger audience if you count the number of people in public talks every year increased mean if I gave I went to a city and spend 5 days and give me 15 talks or spend two weeks and give 20 talks now I go to to a country I give talks only on the weekends but the number of people coming for the talks for those two talks are much more then 10 talks put together that's number one but that's not the only thing we also record this on the media and when it goes on the social media the social media people watch to a larger number on social media and on the satellite channel so when we started the satellite channel in 2006 our main focus was see to the program on the satellite channels are good so my talks became less but the reach became more now the satellite in 2016 a p tv English alone had 100 million viewers then uru mashah had 80 million viewers bangl had 50 million viewers Chinese at 20 million viewers now the viewership has a little bit declined so previously it was about 250 million all put together now it may have reduced to maybe 200 million all put together you know because more people are watching social media but the television yet has its Advantage so now because of social media we're coming on the social media the Facebook is there now my Facebook at 23.9 million M subscribers The YouTube has 3.89 million subscribers and the Instagram so on so forth so in terms of lectures I do agree with the public lectures I do agree it has reduced and you know because of the onslaught of the Indian government 2016 after that 2016 I only started traveling to countries which are more friendly to Muslims as well as those countries which I know doesn't have good hold of India as you know that because of the onslaught of the Indian government the BJP government nendra mod had to do Hijra in 2016 from India to Malaysia after I did Hijra of course the Indian government was after me so after 2016 whenever I traveled to any country where the musl mlim or non Muslim country I did not travel to the country until I had invitation from the head of state or the home minister so all the country that have traveled after 2016 all it was an invitation or it was a sanction or a nod from the head of state whether it be the prime minister or the president or the shik or the king or the person or from the home Ministry because I wanted to be safe and secure because India is a very powerful country and you know that Modi is very powerful and it's close to many countries especially Muslim countries so any country I went I saw to it that it was hosted by the government by the head of state or by the home minister so that's the reason after 2016 one of the reasons that the countries we to travel before without this condition I stopped going the invitation are yet coming anyone invites me I say if you give me the invitation from the head of state or from the home minister I come I remember in 2020 April I was invited a couple of months I think January 2020 invited there's going to be a program in April in Canada where Justin trudo who is the president of uh the prime minister of uh Canada he was going to be the chief guest I was called as a guest of honor and there the Muslim MP was invited and accepted that because it was through the government and indirectly the head of state of Canada was there but unfortunately because of covid because of covid the program was cancelled so one thing that in between okay in 2016 I traveled to many country 17 I travel but during the span when I came and I migrated to Malaysia I was here for one or two one year rest and then I started traveling again but then Co came so in 2020 and 21 I did not travel because of covid but one thing good that happened is I started the session as Dr Zakir in 2020 I remember in Ramadan it was in April the lockdown came in March and I said okay now I cannot travel all the programs have been cancelled there were no talks not in Malaysia not outside what to do and I'm I like giving talks so we started this as Dr Zakir and that time when we started in Raman in April 2020 I used to give twice a week but then I realized that giving twice a week reading the questions you know we thought it would be easy only the talk and maybe you know couple of hours of preparation and giving the talk you know we realize that average in a week 20,000 questions started coming so the biggest ordal is to read this question so I had a team and my team doesn't read all the 20,000 maybe 5,000 6,000 whatever they read from that they passed me 100 questions from that I select 20 questions to answer approximately so then after Ramadan it's you know because of all my other activities the satellite Etc I reduced it to once a week and when the co ended maybe in 2021 2022 when my son faric came to Malaysia or he was in Saudi that time used to join I used to handle one and a half hour my son half and but when he came to Malaysia then I handle as Dr Zakir on the 1 and the third Saturday and my son handles as shik far on the second and the fourth Saturday so marri but because reduced I change from one and a half hour to two hours so the length has remained approximately same previously was in Raman it was one hour twice a week then became one and a half hour once a week now it becomes 2 hours to 2 hours 15 which twice a month so it comes to approximately 1 hour a week for me and but far addition takes 1 hour every forn night so 2 hours a month but natur the audience on the social media live on the Facebook on the YouTube on the Instagram on the pach TV the thing is large but coming back to your question yes public talks has reduced now one thing is there I prefer public talks because in public talks I enjoy and I'm giving a talk standing I can see the audience live different than talking in front of a camera both are different but one good thing that happened in ask Dr Zak sessions we are in the 12th season the first Ramadan season had about nine uh sessions now each of the season have normally six sessions sometimes seven so already 12 so already more than 70 sessions have taken place you know for one and half to two hours and more than thousand one one and a half thousand questions have been answered the difference in this and the public lecture is the public lectures is good of course inspiring you know lot of cameras ordinances there 5,000 10,000 20,000 50,000 and even in this time in Malaysia before the co I had I had given the talk just before the co 2019 and I gave a talk in in Malaysia in Clan there were more than 100,000 people in 2017 when I gave in Indonesia there were 110,000 people in Jakarta so the audiences of course those STS with number of cameras 12 it's much better in terms of impact it is 10 to 20 times better but as far as the talks are concerned excellent as far as the questions are concerned there were many questions which were repetitive and we cannot say this question has been asked one year back I cannot answer I cannot say this question was yes if it's asked same day I can refuse answering or if for asked yesterday in another talk in the same city I can say it was answered yesterday but I cannot say it was answered one month back in Nigeria or one month back in Qatar I have to answer so there were questions which were repetitive so if you remove the duplicate suppose every public talk I may handle about 10 to 20 Questions out of which more than 50% of repetition or some question which asked twice some three times some 10 times so the net impact you could say unique question you could say 25% only absolutely unique in this program ask Dr Zakir the reputations are very few maybe less than 10% if I so when we get this 20,000 question my staff has been trimmed that if the questions normally which have already answered in public lectures avoid them if it already answered in this avoid them sometimes there are prediction if it has a different angle so there are questions which are repeated therefore I a 10% less than that it may have a different angle so have the answer may be same half may be new so the questions are are unique so in these three years 2021 22 know this three three or four years the question on my ask Dr Zakir is more information than all my questions in about 15 years of my public lecture yes I purposely do not repeat what I've already given so most of the comparative question that have answered in the public I'm not answering here most of the common question I'm not it's being asked but I'm not selecting it so the difference in this is that which is more beneficial for the umah so I feel that this question answer session of course the impact of the audience is saw better I personally love it more I like the audience I give the Life field but the benefit for the umah is that this question session has its own impact the talk has its own impact but the second part of the talk with the question answer session this is better so I feel both are required that the reason I've given my editors more vage for editing the question answer session they asked Dr Zak so both of course the impact of a public lecture with the audience with the Jimmy there only be three cameras that is the 10 15 20 cameras and now coming to your question again that there was a gap for about 2 years and when it restarted I remember the first talk I gave was in 2022 in Malaysia in Peis it was the first public lecture allowed in Malaysia after the Restriction of covid and there the authorities put a restriction not more than thousand people so thousand people came it was Dr Zakir History Dr Zak story you know from mombay to Hijra to Malaysia and it was a 2 and a half hours lecture now the situation is that when I started sending the request I'll only allow I will only accept invitation if it's from Head of State in this year 2024 I got invitation from about 14 countries normally normally for public lectures in 2016 2015 I normally accept invitations you know pure public lectures about three or four three or four countries and in the Gulf country Gulf country was common going to Dubai going to Saudi going to Qatar was common so besides the country where have to go repetitive every year additionally maybe three countries now in this year I received invitation from 12 to 14 countries fulfilling this criteria so I decided okay I will go to at least eight countries this year so because of that mallah we recently just a couple of months back we purchased the best of cameras you know when we used to travel before to any country abroad we us to Trav with a crew of about 50 to 55 people crew with me and my family about 60 people used to travel so when we went to Gambia we went to Nigeria that time you know so crew used to go along so and that time we us to with 14 cameras this time we purchased again the best cameras that's available in the world just a couple of months back we purchased the Sony V 2 which is 8.6k and we purchased the on lens which is the best lens in the world what we did that we purchased the seven high quality best cameras in the world and we are continuing with these cameras that we're recording these are the fx9 which are cinematic cameras but of a lower end so we'll do the recording with 10 cameras and we decided to travel with about 15 20 people 20 people previously it was 50 to 60 people now we decided we will make the crew a bit less so 20 people and because we accepted the invitation that's the reason this as Dr Zakir did not happen for the last last six months out of the way but naturally there was Raman in it there was Haj not only lectures but even now I was supposed to travel to an African country but because there were some problem and rs that got postponed and inshallah it will again start from September September October November December again I'll be traveling and when I travel as Dr Zak doesn't take place because they're busy with there so both has the pr and cons Allah knows best he had the ask Dr Zak n you know for about 3 years and then it reduced it's yet continuing now inshallah from this year onwards from 20124 there'll be more public lectures and inshallah I hope it'll benefit for the um it will benefit me in this world and also in the so the public lectures inshallah will not be the same as before in the '90s and 2000s but inshallah go back to what we used to do in 2013 14 15 16 we travel at least to four or five countries and have large audience and we pray to Allah subhana tala that now the audiences will be larger there are new topics that have come so the matter in terms of available to the public on the social media on the video on the satellite has increased multiple times more in terms of duration it may be similar but in terms of uniqueness it is more and I also spend time in doing more research that if these questions are asked the selection takes a lot of time reading takes a lot of time and then selecting is main thing and then we are more selecting those questions which are supposed asked by against Islam asked by those people who while posing to Muslim they can get deviated so it has its own benefit that's the reason I enjoy the session of Al Dr Zak but I also miss the the program what I miss one thing wasn't asked by you which I missing it is the peace conferences the peace conference is something what I miss the most since I've left India especially Bombay the thing that I missed the most besides my family that's my parents and brothers and sisters the thing that I really missed in terms of dawa is the peace conference other things alhamdulillah but the peace conference the way we used to have in Bombay you know we had for many years and the audience used to be hundreds of thousands in one sitting over 10 years about a million people you know the audience is coming large numbers 30 more than 30 speakers coming from different parts of the world this this we missed and I was hoping to have this and I spoke to a few people about which is the best place to have it you know which country would be the best and unfortunately unfortunately most of the Muslim countries not like having such large audiences and large number of speakers coming but there's good news for you inshallah inshallah after 6 months in January that is in the last week of January from the 20 4th 25th 26th for 3 Days Friday Saturday Sunday 2025 we'll be having not the same level of the peace conference what we used to have in in Bombay but we be having the PE Sunnah convention this year there were six speakers and I spoke to the Muti and the authorities and they agreed this time they'll have 18 speakers going to be for three days and 18 speakers International speakers most of them will come on PE TV will be there it'll be for three days it will not be the same large audience but at least the speakers will be together what we had done in 2022 because we could not we didn't have a peace conference we had a brainstorming session in Qatar in 2022 immediately after Ramadan in April and May for about 5 days and we had the top du 14 coming and discussing about the various aspects in this time we'll be having the PE sunah convention after 6 months in January 2025 and inshallah it may not have that large audience but we expect at least 10 at least 10,000 people to attend this convention so so the peace conferences that are there where large number of audiences that used to have you know unlike any other conferences be largest in the world inshallah inshallah Allah will make it possible that we'll have these large conventions and conferences very soon inshallah in the coming years we'll have bigger conferences the large number of duats see to it that the entry is free absolutely free so more number of people can benefit from it and I pray to Allah may make instrumental inpiring the"
