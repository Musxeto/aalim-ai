  "title": "Paul Asks Dr Zakir, “How do you Judge which Part of the Bible is Authentic?”",
  "transcript": "my name is paul i live here and i'm a manager i have about three parts i want to ask you um i've been storing it up for three hours the first one is the two types of death there's a spiritual death and there's a physical death and a brother was asking about if you leave islam you should be to death for this um in the christian bible god says if you don't know me i don't know you and i think those simple words sum up a spiritual death that when the person who has chosen to ignore god and is standing before god on judgment day god will just simply say you didn't know me and i don't know you that is a spiritual death i just say that as a comment my wife and i were walking through the streets of dubai and we were passed a cd and a book about islam i've moved from singapore i'm british but i've lived in singapore for 23 years i've rubbed shoulders with many muslims hindus and buddhists and i'm pleased to say i've learned more about my fellow mankind having been away from britain than ever i would have learned in britain this thing that you're doing tonight is wonderful and i wish i had had this many years before one of the signal absences in this treatise on islam was nobody talked about the devil nobody talked about sin and i was puzzled because in christianity it is always constantly the fight between good and bad in the old testament which was the first thing that i learned there were a lot of similarities with islam people are slaughtering cows and sheep and goodness knows what to atone for their sins and the more thy i gather the worse the sin the more animals that were killed and in the big temple courtyards there were just vast areas for burning these animals on the altars why has that stopped if islam is drawing on a lot of the old testament things what i know as the old testament abraham had a wife called sarah how do you know this you know it because it was recorded would you agree therefore in the new testament that the people who wrote and recorded those things are they telling the truth i'm asking you a question which i hope you'll answer in a minute are they telling the truth or is this made up and therefore why are we not even today slaughtering animals left right and center to atone for our sins because there is another forgiveness the last point i want to make is i was absolutely amazed i learned this in singapore that there were historians at the time jesus was observed to have been crucified who were not christians there was no reference to what religion they had but they recorded that this man jesus lived yes we know he lived you acknowledge as muslims that he lived but he was observed to have been crucified and it is recorded in the bible by the same people who i'm asking you do you believe that mark matthew luke and john existed was this a made-up story because if all the other things have been observed jesus said this or jesus said that in the red writing in the bible um where is the line between something happened and something didn't happen i'm sorry it's a long question answer the question the brother asked a very good question he said that in my talk for example i mentioned that abraham had another wife by the name of sarah may peace be upon him how did i come to know from the bible so he's asking me that many things of islam the similarities in the old testament now when we go to the new testament how do i pick and choose why don't i believe in the writers brother anything whether it's part of the old testament or new testament whereas part of a hindu scripture or any other scripture i as a muslim i consider if i'm concerned i'll come up with the others later on as far as the muslim is concerned this quran is my fur khan furukan is the criteria to judge right from wrong and a beloved prophet um said baaligo and evil of ayah propagate even if you know one verse and there is no problem if you quote from the scriptures of the ali kitab now as far as the scriptures of the jews and christians are concerned there are three rules to be followed rule number one if it matches with the quran we have got no objection in accepting that portion to be the word of god point number one point number two if it goes against the quran we reject it it cannot be the word of god irrespective who wrote it paul matthew mark john whoever rule number one if it matches with the quran because this has been proved to be the word of god as far as we are concerned scientifically everything even a logical person if he finds out this is the word of god and then if he compares whatever matches with the thing which has been proved like this is our ruler you know we have a measuring tape once it has been confirmed this is correct then we use this as a furqan as our mizan so what is there in the old testament new testament buddhist scripture hindu scripture what matches with the quran we have got no objection accepting that the word of god what is contrary to the quran and the say hadith we reject it it can't be true now what is not matching with the quran but not even contradictory it is optional you want an optional optional means may be right may be wrong so those things which are mentioned in the bible old and new testament which match with the quran is what i quoted today 100 we have got no objection in accepting this portion of the word of god there are many things which go against the quran which i can give our talk on differences between islam and christianity there are certain things which optional neither go against the quran is neither messing with the quran so these portion which is neither going against the quran or matching with the quran are optional for us so those writings which go against the quran i cannot accept the word of god so all those authors of the new testament which go against the teachings of the quran i reject it what matches i say can be the word of god what doesn't match neither goes against is optional as far as a non-muslim is concerned we use logic if you keep the quran aside today due to advancements of science and technology today this age of science and technology now if you use the astic of science and technology to the bible you will find hundreds of mistakes about the creation of the universe there's a mistake the bible says as i mentioned earlier that almighty god in genesis chapter 1 verse number 16-19 he created two great lights the greater light the sun to rule the day the lesser light the moon to rule the night so moon doesn't have a right of its own it's a contradiction it's a scientific error there are various such errors various only in genesis chapter number one you can find plenty errors there are mathematical contradictions there are scientific errors there is obscenity so leave aside quran even if a normal human being who keeps his mind open and reads we can surely not agree this portion can surely not be the word of god if the scientific errors if there are contradictions if this pornography any normal human being who has an open mind will never accept this thing to be the word of god the remaining things becomes optional so this is what we use brother as a strategy to identify so a student of comparative religion whenever he picks up a scripture he uses a strategy and he tries and reads the scripture and then he analyzes how good how authentic is the scripture brother so this if we use with the bible also you find there are many errors there are many contradictions even if you don't have the quran a normal human being cannot accept this to be the word of god as a whole but because quran says that there was a revelation given to jesus christ peace be upon him what we say that portion which matches with the quran we have got no objection accepting as the word of god hope to answer the question it partly answers the question the point i was trying to get to was about sin and the devil the point i made was in the islamic literature i was given there was barely any reference to sin the forgiveness of sin the condemnation that we would all feel if we had no way to be forgiven for our sin this was one part of the question yes therefore one question at a time it will be better yes as you told that you gave a short speech i was trying to yes cover as much as i could i apologize that the literature that was given to him that literature did not contain sin so i don't know which literature was given to you but if you read the quran the quran also speaks about sin it speaks about hell it speaks about punishment now the literature that was given to you may be a particular topic like today's talk i never spoke about sin because the topic was similarities between islam and christianity but i've given other talks we speak about sin so the literature that was given to your brother was maybe dealing in a particular specialized subject it may not be dealing with sin but to say that islam doesn't speak about sin is wrong so quran like the bible or speaks about sin but the difference in the bible and the quran what the church teaches about the original sin quran doesn't believe in that which i gave dan earlier which i don't intend repeating that nowhere does the bible speak about the original sin it is the teaching of the church so quran does not speak about original sin and like the bible as bible says in ezekiel 18 verse number 20 that the soul that sin shall die the father shall not bear the indicator of the son neither shall the son bear the iniquity of the father the righteous of the righteous shall be upon him the wicked of the wicked shall be upon him similarly the quran says no bearer of burden can bear the burden of others if you commit a sin you will be responsible no one else can bear the burden so quran also speaks about rewards peace about punishment speaks about sin various things in my talk though i didn't mention sin but indirectly i did mention also about sin if you have alcohol it's a sin if you have pork it's a sin if you're adultery it's a sin but i was speaking the positive aspect don't have alcohol don't death poke don't do adultery so even the quran speaks about sin hope that answers the question brother you"
