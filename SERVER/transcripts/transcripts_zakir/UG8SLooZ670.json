  "title": "Dawah and the Test of Money - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "We started a Dava organization which a budget of $80 a month, $1,000 a year. I told my father, you give so much thousands of dollars in charity, give me $80 a month. He agreed. We started in 1991. In few years, we became the largest and had the biggest budget in the private dation in the world. There's no private daggers in the world which even has 10% of a budget because for us money is not the most important. Unfortunately most of the Muslim organization money is everything for them. I say if money is important is the least important. If 10 important things are there 10th is money not the first not the second not the third not the fourth not the fifth. Wealth is a fitna. If Allah gives you wealth how you spend it is important. And that reminds me of Shikh Solomon Raji. You might have heard of Shikh Salman Raji. He's a very charitable person, maybe as rich as blegates, mashallah. And he's very close to me. He told me that in his w he wrote in his wak, \"Anyone who's my trustee, he's a billionaire. $20 billion wak 20 billion or much more only one that my any trustees if they travel with my trust money will travel only in economic class and when he travels at the age of 80 also he travels in economic class so he told me once I went to the ticket counter and the ticket person said your son is traveling in first class, you travel economic class. He said, \"My son's father is a rich man. My father was a poor man.\" So this is the reason she shakes Solomon Raji became Shik Solan Raji. But today most of the D want to travel in in business class. If you don't give business, they don't want to come. And unfortunately most of the Muslim organization have to comply with it. We have a policy. We don't give business at all. Want to come, come don't come. All not that we can't afford it. We are the biggest organization in the world. Only one conference we spend $5 million but we give economic class. Why are you rough and th excuses why I want business class? I've got thrombocytoenia long flight disease. Long flight is a misnomer. I'm a doctor. You don't require a business class. You take a seat and the problem is solved. business is not the solution. So if you know how Allah has given us money, we should know how to spend it. Should not do Allah has blessed us. I can travel in the first class. I always travel in economy. Once there was a RS point against me. So there was no tickets. So once in my lifetime only I purchased a business class. That's the different thing. Allah blesses me and upgrades me. Most of the time they recognize me. She shake come to business class. That's different. It's complimentary. We can afford it. Allah has given us wealth. I can afford a Rolls-Roy. We drive in a Toyota. You know, this is Allah gives you wealth and Allah checks how you spend it. When I go to a hotel in my full life, I've never spent more than $100 or $110 for a room. Never. Not that I can't afford. I can afford $10,000 a day. Allah is testing us. Allah is giving wealth and seeing how you're spending it. We spend on what? cameras. That camera is my Rolls-Roy. Each camera costing $300,000, that's my Rolls-Roy. Each camera costing $300,000. That's my Rolls-Roy. Allah gives you wealth. Allah checks. Where do you spend it? So this is a test. Wealth is a big fitna. Allah checks. How do you spend it? If Allah made it the biggest organization, do you buy car for yourself? No, we spend it's everywhere I travel with no ticket and I tell no one should charge ticket for my lecture otherwise I won't come if you charge I won't come I pay for one ticket I say I will pay for my own hotel if they force and then says the hotel owner is owner doesn't take money that's a different thing we set standards this is a test and the bigger the d is a test bigger the test oh more Oh no more test. So we pray to Allah subhanana wa tala in tajut every day. Let not the Satan get the better of us. Let not the popularity come into your head. Not the wealth come into your head."
