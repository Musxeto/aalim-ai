  "title": "Terrorism is not the Monopoly of Muslims - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "why why are they targeting the muslims particularly it's a question it is a ploy of the western media the media controlled by the politicians and when we analyze we can surely say without any doubt that terrorism is not a muslim monopoly not only is it not a muslim monopoly it is not even a speciality of the muslims it is not even encouraged by islam it is prohibited in islam i being a student of compass religion i cannot say that all the religions say that you should not kill innocent human beings but i can surely say that most of the religions the majority of the religions if you read the scriptures they say that you should not kill innocent human beings and the leader of all these religions is islam islam says it's mentioned in the quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 32 the ayah the verse which were recited by the qari it says that if anyone whether a muslim or non-muslim kills any other human being whether muslim or non-muslim it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity i know of many religious scriptures we say that you should not kill innocent human beings but quran does not only say that it says that if anyone kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for creating corruption or for spreading mischief in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity quran goes a step further and says that if you kill any innocent human being it is as though you have killed the whole of humanity i don't know of any of the scripture which says that if you kill any innocent human being it is as though you have killed the whole of humanity and further quran goes on to say that if you save any single life any single human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humankind islam is derived from the arabic word which means peace it comes from the arabic word film which means to submit your will to almighty god islam in short means peace acquired by submitting a will to almighty god islam condemns all forms of terrorism all forms of acts which kill innocent human beings irrespective whether it's 9 11 where the twin tower attacked or the 7th of july where more than 50 innocent people were killed in london bomb blast the new york towers more than 3 000 people were killed in the london bomb blast more than 50 were killed or whether there'd be the serial bomb blast in 93 of bombay where more than 250 people were killed all the bomb blast that took place recently on the 11th of july 2006 when more than 200 people were killed are to be condemned it is prohibited you cannot justify killing of any innocent human being many muslims many times to appease the government they put a full stop there i never put a full stop here i continue and say we also have to condemn the thousands of afghanis that have been killed in afghanistan the thousands of innocent people that have been killed in iraq the thousands of people that are killed in gujarat the thousands of people killed in palestine thousands of people killed in lebanon we can't put a full stop who are you afraid of all sorts of terrorism in which innocent human beings are killed have to be condemned whether done by muslims are non-muslims we don't have records that 9 11 or 7 july or the recent series bomb blast in the train confirmed a call done by muslims it is just a hypothesis but irrespective after we come from the truth whether it's done by muslim or non-muslim it is to be condemned it is prohibited we know that most of the religions they don't preach that you should kill innocent human beings terrorism is not the monopoly of any religion it is not but when we analyze we have terrorists that claim to profess certain religions and when we analyze they are from all types of religions we have christian terrorists we have catholic terrorists we have jewish terrorists we have hindu terrorists we have muslim terrorists we are buddhist terrorists we have sick terrorists terrorists professing very different fates but most of the religions they condemn the killing of innocent human beings and when we do a survey that though we know that religions don't encourage killing us human beings when we do a survey and try and find out that the people that have killed the maximum innocent human beings which religion do you profess number one the human being that has killed maximum innocent human beings who is he who is he hitler he has incinerated 6 million jews and indirectly if you count all the people killed in the world war 2 60 million people number one was he a muslim he was a christian joseph stalin called as uncle joe he has estimated to have killed 20 million human beings he has starved 14.5 million human beings to death when we go to china mao see sun he has killed 14 to 20 million human beings he was a non-muslim he was not a muslim we know from record that mussolini in italy alone has killed 400 000 human beings innocent human beings the person after whom the french revolution is named maximilian spear he has starved and tortured to death more than 200 000 people and executed more than 40 000 people ashoka we know in one battle alone in kalinga battle he has killed hundred thousand people more than hundred thousand people was he a muslim he was a hindu we have our own black sheep also requested is responsible for the death of a few hundred thousand people but the embargo put by george bush on iraq alone has killed half a million children in iraq alone half a million in one shot only on the embargo put by usa un on iraq half a million children have died in indonesia mumma sato even he has claimed to have killed 500 000 people but nothing compared to hitler nothing compared to uncle joe joseph stalin nothing compared to mouse horsing of china each individual will put all the muslims together to shame i am not trying to say that the followers of this religion they were practicing religion they were not religious otherwise they wouldn't have ever killed innocent human beings"
