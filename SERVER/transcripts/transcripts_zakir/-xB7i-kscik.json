  "title": "Original Sin and Status of Women in Christianity: Exposed â€“ Leads a Christian Women to accept Islam",
  "transcript": "there's this uh question about uh I did it on a atheist article which said that um like when Allah had created the Garden of Eden he put an Adam and Eve there and uh but because they broke the rollers and they had the fruit of uh I don't know what it is yeah the fruit which was forbidden they were banished from the garden they were thrown out and because of which it was told that uh like you have to work for your daily bread you need to work and only then will you earn to have your daily bread likewise it was also told that uh women they would uh their pain and pregnancy would increase it's like till now the same thing is happening we have to work hard we have to struggle we have to do everything necessary to earn a daily bread and uh the same thing with the women like they are dying in pregnancy their pain is increased uh why is it that uh if Allah himself had punished them so badly till date uh they are like with the same punishment how is it that it is an example for others to forgive other people when Allah himself has not forgiven or guide me right sisters ask a very good question she rightly said that what your quoting sister is about the Bible what they're saying is mentioned in the Bible there are many people with them when they were in the Garden of Eden they disobed the Commandment of almighty God it's mentioned in the Bible and it's mentioned in Genesis chapter number three verse number 23 that almighty God punish them and he threw them out of the garden and almighty God says in Genesis chapter 3 verse number 16 that you women because they have to submit God you shall give birth to children in pain and a desire shall be that of the husband so according to the Bible pregnancy is a curse on the woman this is what you're quoting is the Bible and I agree with you that how can God not forgive in Christianity the full blame in the Bible is put on the woman Eve Eve Eve may Allah in Quran if you read there is not a single place in the Quran where the blame is put only on Eve the blame is equally put on Adam and Eve may Allah will be pleased with them if you read in the Quran it's mentioned in Surah araf chapter number seven verse number 19 to 27 that Adam and Eve both of them they disobeyed God both of them they repented and both were forgiven the blame is put equally on them there is not a single verse in the Quran where the blame is only put on Eve may Allah will be with her but there is a verse in the Quran chapter number 20 verse number 121 which says that Adam peace be upon him he'd submit God so there is one verse which speaks only about Adam peace be upon him but as a whole if you analyze the Quran puts the blame on both of them Adam and Eve both of them in the Bible the blame is only put on women and because of that almighty God says you shall bear children in pain and your desire will be that of the husband so pregnancy account the Bible is a curse but if you read the Quran pregnancy is not a curse pregnancy uplifts the woman Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 4 verse number one respect the womb that Boe you further mukran says chapter number 31 verse number 14 and Surah chapter number 46. verse number 15 that we've enjoined on the human beings to be kind to the parents interval upon travel to the motherboard and in pain did she give you birth so here we realize that the Quran says that we have to respect your parents especially your mother and a beloved Prophet Allah said especially inside in the book of Adam chapter number two Hadith number two a man approaches Prophet Muslim and asks him that who deserves the maximum love and companionship in this world for the prophet replies your mother the man asked after that too the prophet against his mother the man asked after that too again the prophet savior mother the man asked after that too then for the fourth time the prophet says your father that means 75 percent three-fourth of the love and companionship goes to your mother 25 percent one fourth goes to the father in short mother gets the gold medal she gets the silver medal as well as the bronze medal the father has to be satisfied with the mere consolation prize once almighty God has forgiven these human beings how can you keep on punishing them so this is the difference between Islam and Christianity sister so are you convincing the answer yes definitely do you want to accept Islam now yes do you believe that there's one God yes I do you believe Jesus is God no do you believe Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him with the last and final messenger yes I do is anyone forcing you to accept Islam No are you doing out of your own free will yes are you doing out of your own conviction yes is there anyone giving you a bribe no inshallah so it's in Arabic and you can repeat it I bear Witness I bear a witness I bear witness that that there is no God there is no God but Allah but Allah and I bear witness and I bear witness that that Prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is is the messenger the messenger and servant of Allah and servant of Allah masha'allah you are a Muslim and I pray to Allah to guide you and help you guide your family members also and to give you the best in this world as well as in the next life and inshallah foreign"
