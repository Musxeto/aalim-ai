  "title": "Why does the Quran Command Us to Strike the Necks of the Non-Believers - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is wum mish one wum Mish so my questions go like this it has been preached severally that Islam is a religion of Peace then in the Quran I found out in Surah 47:4 and I quote 47 verse4 what does it say when you encounter those who disbelieve strike at their neck then when you have rooted them bind them fth firmly then either release them by Grace or by Ramson until what lay down in burdens had God will he could have defeated them himself but he T Test some of you by means of others as for those who are killed in the way of God he will not let their deed go to waste so if Islam is a religion of Peace then why will God now ask you to kill a fellow person that because he doesn't believe your very good question brother is quoting the verse of Surah Muhammad 47 verse number four but out of context you know out of context out of context he is quoting therefore when he meet the unbelievers in fight he forgot the word in fight Smite at the neck at length if you read the earlier verses it's talking about a war a war with unbelievers and verse number four says in the war when you meet the UN Believers you smite at the neck I'm asking you a question if a robber enters your house what will you do will you give him a cup of tea no but he's not talking about I'm ask I'm asking you will you a cup of tea suppose the robber come tries and rapes your mother what will you do I'll fight him why and your man of Peace talk about that if a robber comes and wants to rap your mother what will you do I'll fight him then my other question is because I seen by this is not a robber this is talking at a read one number one go from verse number one those who reject Allah and hinder in their part those who believe and do righteous deed this because of them reject the then they come to war the enemies of Allah when they come to war don't get scared I'm asking question if if Nigeria has a war with another country another country the Army General of Nigeria what will he say oh soldiers don't get scared fight them he not say okay go when they come you give your neck at them what nonsense are you talking so why ask this question let me complete the answer you asking the question now you know you're trapped let me complete the answer so this is talking in the battlefield in the battlefield when you kill the enemies who come to kill you this is peace okay what does the police do the police of Nigeria supposed to keep peace correct how why do they carry a gun those who want to disrupt the Peace So the rule is you can use violence as a last resort to maintain peace those who want to disrupt peace do you understand that means you can use violence against those people against those Criminal Who want to disrupt peace this is the Golden Rule that the reason every country has a police has a army just because Nigeria has a police force that does Nigeria doesn't want peace it wants peace that Avid as police the same way God is telling in the Quran when the enemies come to attack you in the battlefield don't get scared you strike at the neck so what is wrong with it it doesn't mean because you have to follow the Quran as a whole verse number Sur MAA 5:32 says if anyone kills any other human being whether Muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for spending corruption in the land he has killed all of humanity that's the part of the Quran two vers canot cont ICT that mean these people are spreading corruption in the land do you understand so if you're spreading corruption in the land that time you can kill them do you understand but killing any any innocent human being is like killing the whole of humanity is there any worse in the Bible which says if you kill an innocent human being you have killed the all of humanity is there any verse in the Bible so which is better for p Quran or the Bible PE which is better PE Quran the Quran says if you save any human being innocent human being whether Muslim or non-muslim it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity is there any such verse in the Bible so which is better at the same time in the battlefield when the enemies come and disrupt peace fight them kill them no problem but do you understand let me say something why I ask this question is have you understood the answer yes I have understood now do you understand that Quran is talking about peace okay sir why I ask these questions because last year no why you asked I don't want to know you asked a question I don't want to know why you asked you got the answer Class Matter is over I want to give you a reference to the question when I came up I want to give you a reference you already give the reference I already give the answer something happened last year in a university in Soo or a PO Technic where a Christian lady was killed that she blasphemed against Muhammad I can't hear you that a Christian lady was killed that she blashe Against Woman yes sir you get so and I observe that when a Christian and a Muslim are interacting religious discussion and the Muslim get provoked he kill that you Blas the brother asked the question there was a Christian lady who did blasphemy so the rule of the Quran is Sur MAA chapter number 5 verse number 33 anyone whoes the war against Allah or his rasool you either execute them or you chop off the opposite hands of live or crucify them or Exile them there are four option anyone who wages a war against Allah and his rasool anyone does blasphemy either execute either execute either chop opposite hands and legs or crucify or Exile four option now why they took the option of that they have to ask them so this is the rule of Allah in the Quran you cannot blashe God it's a big sin okay so this is the rule this for peace because if we don't do that that lady will do more corruption the full world will be unpeaceful hope that answerers the question"
