  "transcript": "next question from anush from kashmir india can a muslim girl become an ias officer in india with the intention of serving the ummah i would like to ask the sister that why does she want to become an ias officer in india to serve dhumma there are multiple things better that a woman can do why should a woman go out of the way to become an ias officer and will she be able to maintain the rules of the quran and sunnah so if you want to serve the ummah number one is you have to follow the rules and regulation of allah and israel the best act of a muslim of the muslim woman is to be a good mother there's nothing better than that the status that a muslim gets because she's the mother is phenomenal our beloved prophet muslim said that paradise lies beneath the feet of the mother and the child even if you give mountain of gold to the mother he cannot compensate what the mother has done by keeping that child in her womb for nine months the very hadith now how can you overlook all these hadith you want to become ias officer now do you think becoming an ias officer as a woman will you be able to maintain the hijab will you be able to maintain the rules and regulations that have been prescribed in the quran and say hadith and the answer is no and then iis office so you may have to work closely with the mail which is not permitted you will not be able to maintain the hijab your dress code will be different so but natural the best profession if you want to do a profession after being a mother if you want to do something for them number one is the profession of adai allah says in the quran in surah fusilla chapter 41 verse number 33 woman who is better in spirit than one who invites to the way of thy lord walks righteousness and says that i'm a muslim the best profession for a muslim is a so even for the muslima this is for the muslim male yes even for the muslim the best profession in the fadai and that's the reason that when i wanted to marry someone i want to marry adaya because the sabbab that a woman will get but naturally she is supposed to dhawa with the woman a woman doing dawa to a woman is far more serving the ummah and doing isla to the muslim who may not be knowing the teachings of islam so if you are doing the award to non-muslims the non-muslim woman and doing dawah to the muslim woman getting them closer to quran sunnah that's a million times better service than you becoming an as officer being an ass officer there are high chances that you may go away from the deen you will not be able to follow the rules and regulations so number one best profession after becoming a mother is becoming number two you can become a teacher you can teach an islamic school or islamic college treat them deen give them education number three you can become a counselor you can be a child counselor you can counsel the muslim the children get them closer to islam if you want to serve the ummah you can become a doctor you can become a gynecologist if you become a gynecologist you're preventing hijab being broken by a muslim sisters becoming a doctor it's a noble profession a gynecologist or become a pediatrician you can do speciality there are various other options why should you become an is officer first is officer is not a job to be done by a woman and that too by a muslim woman you will not be able to maintain your hijab will not be able to maintain all the principles so my advice is it is not at all permissible for a muslim to become an is officer in india you will not be serving dhamma you will be in fact going away from the deen and live aside dhumma you will be paving your pathway not to heaven but away from the heaven so inshallah i hope that you become a good mother become adaya or become a teacher or a child counselor or a doctor hope that answers the question"
