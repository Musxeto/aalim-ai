  "transcript": "let's understand the concept of god in islam the best reply that any muslim can give you regarding the concept of god in islam is quote to you surah class chapter 112 verse number one to four which says say he is allah one and only allah the absolute and eternal he begets not no is begotten there's nothing like him this is a four line definition of almighty god given in the glorious quran any person says so and so candidate is god if that candidate fits in this foreign definition we muslims have got no objection in accepting that candidate as god and this is exactly what is also mentioned in the scriptures the same four points the first is say he is allah and only same as chandogya panishan chapter number six section number two verse number one which says god is only one without the second the second point allah allah the absolute eternal same thing you mentioned in bhagavad-gita chapter number 10 verse number three that almighty god is the supreme lord of all the worlds point number three he begets not noise begotten the same thing which is mentioned in swaitasharupanishad chapter number six verse number nine that almighty god has got no parents he has got no master he has got no mother he has got no father and the fourth is there's nothing like him the same which is mentioned in upanishad chapter number four verse number 19 and rejuvenate chapter number three to verse number three which says of him there is no likeness there is nothing like him so if any person says so and so candidate is god if that candidate fits in this four line definition which is mentioned the glorious quran is for a class the hindu scriptures we muslims have got no objection in accepting that candidate as god for example there are many people who consider bhagwan and rajneesh to be god during question at the time one of the hindu brothers said that we hindus don't believe him to be god i know i never said that the hindus believe him to be god i said some people believe him to be god i have read the hindu scriptures nowhere do they in the scriptures say that bhagavan rejected but yet there are many people who consider bhagavan rightness to be god so let us put this bhagwan rajnish to the test of surah class and the verses of the hindu scriptures the first is say he is allah one only god is only one without a second was rajneesh one and only was he the only man who has claimed divinity there are thousands of men who have claimed humanity and especially in this country of us india we have thousands of slim divinity he's not the only one but a rajneesh bhakti will say no he's unique he's the only one so let's go to the next test the absolute eternal was rajneesh absolutely eternal we read in his biography that rajnish was suffering from diabetes from asthama from chronic back ache imagine almighty god suffering from asthma chronic backache from diabetes the third test he begets not no is begotten we know that rajneesh was born in the state of madhya pradesh he had a mother and father in 1981 he goes to america and in the state of oregon he starts his own township known as rajnishpuram and he takes thousands of americans for a ride later on the american government they arrest him and they put him behind bars and he says that the american government they gave me slow poisoning in the jail imagine almighty god being slow poisoned and in 1985 the american government they kick him out of usa and he comes back to india and in the city of puna he has his own center which is today known as the osho commune and if you go to his center osho commune it's mentioned on his tombstone bhagavan rajnesh never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990 never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990. they forgot to mention on his tombstone that he was not given visas to 21 different countries of the world imagine almighty god coming in this world to visit the world and requires vedas to enter different countries and the arc bishop of greece said if you don't remove rajneesh out of this country we'll burn his house and the house of your disciples and the last test there's nothing like him is so stringent that no one besides the true almighty god can pass the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god we know that rajneesh you have a white beard here two eyes one nose one mount two hand like the human beings the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god wala miyako love for example if someone says that almighty god is a thousand times stronger than anna schwarzenegger you may have heard the name of arnold schwarzenegger the person who got the title mr universe the strongest man in the world if someone says almighty god a thousand times stronger than arnold schwarzenegger the moment you can compare god to anyone whether it be thousand times a million times whether it be anuas forshnagar or dhara singh or king kong the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god walam yakullah kuffwan ah there's nothing like him this is a four line definition of almighty god given in the glorious quran which we call as the touchstone of theology so all the gods that people are worshiping put into the test of surah class if your god passes the test of surah class and the hindu scriptures have mentioned then he's a true god if he fails he's not a true god"
