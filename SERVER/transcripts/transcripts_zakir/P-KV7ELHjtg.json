  "transcript": "the first question asked on the whatsapp is by periar alamsha from tamilnadu india and brother periyar is asking the question how can muslims coexist peacefully with hindus while allah hates kafirs and commands muslims in the quran to do jihad against their faith quran is indeed a terror manual against hinduism muslims want to abolish hinduism and convert hindustan into islamistan they want to fulfill the command of allah i fully support modi ji and amit ji for a muslim free hindu rashtra kick muslims out to pakistan or kabristan jai hind our hindu brother brother paryar has asked a very important question and he's asking the question that how can muslims and hindus coexist peacefully while allah he says that hates kafirs and commands muslims in the quran to do jihad against their faith there are about five six questions in this one wrong question the first is that how can muslims and hindus coexist when allah hates the kafir what is the meaning of the arabic word kafir the arabic word kaffir comes from the root word kofra which means to reject which means to hide so kafir means those who reject i would like to ask a simple question to by the periyar that if you have a company and there are hundreds of employees that you have and if your employee rejects the commandment that you have given him or the work you have given him what will you do will you praise him will you love him or will it is like him and mind you they are only employees here allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is the creator he is almighty god he has created all the human beings more than seven and a half billion human beings today in the world that are there all that came in the past he's the creator and then after he's the creator he asks you to follow few of his commandments and you do not follow what you expect him to love you but natural so he will not like you so allah wa ta'ala you rightly said that he hates the kafir kafir means those who reject the commandment of almighty god so anyone who obeys the commandment of almighty god he loves them those who reject his commandment who disobey him he will not like them this is but natural so what is wrong in it and the second part of your first question is that quran says that we should do jihad with this kafir you are right if you read the quran the quran says in surah furqan chapter number 25 verse number 52 that do jihad with the quran against the unbelievers with the kafir here allah is advising us that jihad is the arabic word which means to strive which means to struggle unfortunately the media has promoted that jihad means something to kill or jihad only means that you go for a war this is not the right concept the real meaning of the arabic word jihad comes from the arabic word jahada which means to strive which means to struggle so jihad basically means to strive and struggle here allah is telling that you strive and struggle against the unbelievers those who reject the quran you strive and struggle with the quran that means allah is telling us to convey the message of the quran of allah of almighty god to the unbelievers so what is wrong in that this is good that allah is telling to strive and struggle to convey the message the commandment of the creator then the question asks quran is indeed a terror manual against hinduism let me give you an example that every country has a police force and they have laws in the country what you should do what you should not do and if you go against the law there are punishments which are mentioned every country has a law that if you rob there'll be so and so punishment if you murder someone so and so is the punishment and if you cheat so and so the punishment if you do fraud similarly quran is the future world constitution it is a law book of our creator how a human being should lead his life if you allow me to call a human being a machine it is the most complicated machine on the face of the earth the glorious quran is the instruction manual for the human being the do's and don'ts and if this instruction manual to prevent people committing crimes has given a punishment for robbing or for murdering innocent human being or for cheating then why do you call it terror manual if you call the terror manual that means all the countries the court of law which has the constitution and where it says in the law book the punishment for the crimes then every country will have a terror manual so it's a misunderstanding it is the guidance given by allah subhanahu ta'ala to the human beings about the do's and don'ts and if you do not do certain things which are commandments of almighty god like how you have rules in the country if you break a signal there are punishments for it so similarly this is a book to prevent the wrongdoing by the human beings it is a misconception that it is a terror manual actually it's a manual for peace if someone calls the law of the country as a terror manual that means the person hasn't understood the law of the country it is actually a peaceful manual so that peace prevails in that country if this law wasn't there in the country the country would have been in chaos so because of this law peace is maintained similarly this is the law book of our creator allah to let peace prevail throughout the world in the next part our brother perya says that muslims want to abolish hinduism and convert hindustan into islamistan they want to fulfill the command of allah regarding a question that muslims want to convert hindustan into islamist first let me tell you that the word hindu is a misnomer where did it come from who gave this word hindu according to historical books we come to know that the word hindu is not present in any of the scriptures of hinduism according to jawaharlal nehru in his book discover india he says the first time this word was used was in the 8th century it is never found in any of the hindu scriptures it was first used in the 8th century when the persians when the muslim arabs came to india and even historians say that this word was given by the muslims so the word hindu is given by the muslims for the people living in the land of the indus valley the real name of the religion those who follow the vedas should be vedantist so this hinduism is a misnomer and really if you come to know that allah almighty god has only sent down one religion for the whole of humankind it is later on that human means kept on manipulating it and the moment the message got changed allah sent a new messenger with a new message to get the people to the straight path so all the messengers of almighty god allah they taught nothing but submitting your will to almighty god and the religion of submitting your will in arabic we say islam islam comes from the root word salam which means peace it's also derived from the arabic word film which means submitting over to god so islam means peace acquired by submitting a will to almighty god and anyone who acquires peace by submitting evil to almighty god he's called as a muslim so here muslims want all the human beings in the world not only in india the muslims want all the human means in the world that they should follow the commandment of almighty god they should worship only almighty god and no one is because we love our brother human beings and we want them to follow the commandment of the creator almighty god which all the major religions if you read the scriptures all the major religions the scriptures basic messages that you worship only one god do not make images of god and worship him alone and follow his command the brother further says that i fully support modi ji and amit shaji for a muslim free hindu rashtra regarding as far as our prime minister narendra modi and our home minister amisha is concerned according to me both these people they do not follow the hindu scriptures they don't follow the vedas they are breaking the rules of their own scripture what they are promoting is not hinduism or vedantism they are promoting hindutva their own brand and if you read the vedas there are many things that our prime minister and home minister are not following from the hindu scriptures they are killing people they are torturing people all this is against the scriptures if you analyze and read the teachings of the vedas i can proudly say that i follow more of the teachings of the vedas than amit shah and modiji put together because i've read the in the scriptures i doubt whether narendra modi has read the vedas i doubt whether amit shah has read the veda and even if they read the veda i doubt whether they've understood and i don't think so they practice there are so many things that they violate there is so much of anarchy going so much of oppression going out in india so much of innocent people are being killed on the advice so much of cheating is there so much of corruption is there all these are against the teachings of with us so if you want to judge a person only on the teachings of veda then alhamdulillah i doctor zakir naik who is a muslim can proudly say that i follow more of the teachings of vedas than narendra modi or amity so what they are doing is they are taking the people away from the true teachings of hinduism and regarding your last statement that you said that kick muslims out to pakistan or kaprastan let us understand what is the meaning of the word pakistan pakistan pak means sacred holy stan means land holy land i am not referring to the pakistan country our neighboring country and i'm not talking about that but if you literally say that the muslim should be kicked to pakistan to a holy land that means you don't consider india to be holy you don't consider india to be sacred you don't consider india to be a good country i consider india to be a good country it is few politicians who are changing the atmosphere and are causing chaos in the country but as a country india was a very good country for many years it is yet a good country there are some politicians who for their ulterior motives they are spoiling the name of the country and they are causing chaos and violence in the country so if you say that muslims should be kicked out to a holy land again pakistan park sacred or pure something which is pure to a pure land you are not considering that to be pure i am not talking about our neighboring country pakistan and king the muslims to kabrastan it is every human being has to die allah says in the quran he gave life and he will cause you to die every human being no one can save you no modi na meshaji can save any human being when allah has stand you the day you will die you will die no one can save you if allah wants to keep you alive no one can kill you so every human being is born in this world and he has to die so every human being whether muslim or non-muslim they have to die so my aim is to make the whole world a sacred place whole world a park place whole world so all the human means in the world should follow the commandments of almighty god and if you truly regarding the first part of the question that how can muslims and hindus coexist the best way they can coexist that both of them should read the scriptures with understanding and at least agree to follow what is common if the hindus read the vedas with understanding if they understand sanskrit and if they read and if the muslims read the quran with understanding and let us agree to follow what is common what is different we'll discuss tomorrow at least let us agree to follow what is common the hindus believe that veda the word of god the muslim belief that the quran and the word of god let us come to common terms let us agree to follow what is common in both the sacred scriptures and when we do a comparative study i have given a lecture on the topic similarities between islam and hinduism and i have given various similarities number one is both the religions say that we should worship only one god both the legends say that you should not make any idols any images of almighty god both the religions say that the last and final messenger to come is prophet muhammad peace be upon him both religions say that when we pray we should do sujood we should do frustration both the religions say that we should give charity both religions say that we should fast there are many similarities so why don't we agree to follow what is common why are we creating fictitious animosity so those people who believe in getting the human beings together on the common platform are the real good human beings those who for the ulterior motives want for the personal benefit they create the animosity so that they can get a benefit in this world but in the hereafter surely they'll be amongst the losers so i request my hindu and muslim brothers of india that read the scriptures and let us at least agree to follow what is coming what is different we can discuss tomorrow and inshallah if the hindus and muslims in india united will be a superpower india was superpower a few centuries ago india was the superpower it was number one country in the world if we go back and unite go back to our scripture and unite and follow it inshallah again will be superpower hope that answers the question"
