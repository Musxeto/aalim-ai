  "title": "Dr Zakir Naik's Views on \"The Message\" and other Islamic Movies",
  "transcript": "my name is Normand work in the field of Internet travel and marketing my question revolves around the strongest form of media today is movies movies originating from hollywood bollywood hollywood and probably now Dollywood in Dubai fortunately for their benefit it gets the message across in many forms passion of the christ' was one form that related a story about Jesus Christ it was the script was in Hebrew I wanted to first ask how much of that was in line with what Christianity preaches and how much we can relate to Quran as well obviously there's some deviations as well but again the masses took that understanding and absorbed it and that's what the understanding is my second part to the question is how can we use the media in form of movies to effectively communicate the message of Islam like it was done in the form of the first movie called the message from which I understood a lot of people converted to Islam after watching that movie is Allah he has a question that movies do play an important role in creating opinions and conveying the message Hollywood Hollywood Noah of Gollywood not a new word let's come to a media city and here's the example of Passion of Christ what are my views of such movies whether I haven't seen that movie Passion of Christ do I wanted to see it I haven't seen that movie normally I don't see movies but this being a particular movie I wanted to see it but I read reports that after this movie made by Mel Gibson the way he portrays and he kept it in the original language there were a lot of criticism and the way he did it and which was slightly against the Jewish lobby because of that there was a hue and cry but it also became popular in the negative sense when you speak something negative it became a box-office so there did break the records he was walking on the edge of the sword he melted so much money if it weren't a flop he would lose millions of dollars it went ahead and it had many things which were right many things would ugly with the Islamic point of view many would not agree summing point of view as far as the second question is concerned on message and I've seen that movie Merced made my Mustafar cut and Anthony Quinn was acting as Hamza Allah be pleased with him the way the movies were made were excellent I really appreciated all the best movies on Islamic line I would say is the message al hamdulillah without showing the hero without showing Prophet Muhammad's Allah Allah without showing his picture without showing his voice hamdulillah the whole picture was revolving around the hero prophet mohammed salah salaam without showing his picture without his wife once they show his camel and his staff that's it but the way the angle of the camera was that to show that the Prophet did not like any turn the faith away the angle of the camera changes so the direction was superb it was a masterpiece and we do require such more movies but the budgets of this movie double it runs into millions of dollars millions of dollars so the budget is there but it did make a lot of money mustafa cut then he made any the film called a thermograph talking about not 100% islam or talking about a muslim which also did create a box-office and now we do require such movies but we see to it that whatever you create it should be on lines on Islam Quran and Sharia there was something which I don't agree everything of message is right as a whole it was good there were things which were wrong also in the messenger but as a whole it was good as a whole it was good what we have to do that we have to create online of this islamic sharia without breaking any laws of the hora and SI hadith and portrayed in a way same may not only movies we have to make docudramas we have to be he is we have to make documentaries because in the media it is a white elephant white elephant you know if you know about coal mining a for potty it was a copy of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire on an average they spend 1 million dollar more than 400 rupees only on one episode one episode only 45 to 50 minutes in Bombay where labor is cheap Amitabh Bachchan is expensive so the thing is that the budget is there surely those people or philanthropist would like to sponsor such they should sponsor such film that make such films so that we convey the message but I had believed Muhammad SAW Allah Allah Hal McRae the new movie that has been made the kingdom of heaven it was made by a very famous director and he ported incidents how the Crusaders attacked and they killed thousands of people and then surrounding the hero he comes and he should have the hero there is a big hue and cry in the Western media that how good he make such a flim he's a Christian he only portrayed what was fact in history but it did not go down the throat of the Westerners they'll be hue and cry but because the person was a very female director alhamdulillah I did not do much damage but if a non-muslim makes us film the Kingdom of Heaven that film also I did not see but I read the reports that it did a marvelous job it conveyed the true picture to a great extent so such films should be encouraged hope the answer the question [Applause]"
