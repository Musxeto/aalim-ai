  "title": "The Most Sinful Act in Ramadhaan - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "of those 10 things you've mentioned could you now tell us which is considered to be the most serious and sinful act which invalidates the fast the act which is the most sinful and most serious amongst all of them which invalidate the fast it is sexual intercourse that when you have sexual intercourse and when the two private parts meet then your fast is invalidated whether ejaculation takes place or not and you have to repent for that you have to complete the fast for that day and have to make it up later and you have to pay a penalty that's kaffara according to the say hadith in which a beloved prophet said it's mentioned in say bihari verb number three in the book of fasting hadith number 1936 where a man comes to the prophet and says that i am ruined oh prophet i am ruined the prophet says what is the matter the man says i had sex with my wife while i was fasting so the prophet says that can you free a slave so the man says no i cannot then the prophet asks can you fast consecutively for two months can you fast continuously for 60 days the man says no i cannot then the prophet says that can you feed 60 poor people and the man says no and hadees continues in short we come to know from this hadees that if any person does a sexual intercourse it is one of the major sins it is the most serious and sinful amongst all the things that break the fast the person who does this sin he should immediately repent on allah and ask for forgiveness he should complete his fast for that day and make up for that fast later on after ramadan and he has to pay a penalty and the penalty we come to know from the hadith says that he either frees a slave if he can if he does not have the money to free the slave or he cannot find a slave to free then he should fast for two consecutive months fast for 60 days if you cannot do that also then you should at least feed 60 poor people and these are the three options that have been given for a person to pay as a penalty as a kafara but if a person can do the first thing he should not jump to the second or the third the first is freeing a slave if we cannot do that if he doesn't have the money or cannot find a slave then he can go to the next option that is fasting consecutively for 60 days if he cannot do that if he is unable to do that continuously fasting for 60 days if he fast for a few days and then one day doesn't fast you should start again you should fast consecutively for 60 days if it doesn't have the capacity to do that then what he can do is he can feed 60 poor people and each poor person should be fed with approximately half sah each side is equal to three handful of our stitched hand of wheat so half sa per person or the food that is there of the land so 60 poor people you should feed this is the kaffara the penalty for a person who breaks of us by having a sexual intercourse the amount of food just to clarify that for my own benefit if you like do you think that that's equivalent to about a day's food a product in short it should be a day food that's normal in that land it may change in america it may change in uk it may change in india but at that time it was like one of these says that one man because half south meat and each of meat is outstretched two hundredths of stage and the amount of wheat that comes in that's equal to so half of three the other hadith says that one month of meat that is equal to one or stitched hand of wheat say that equivalent to fill a poor man's appetite you know his stomach so in short you should feed a poor person 64 people you should feed approximately what is the food of that land that should feed him and if you can't find people in your land who are poor then you look for the nearest place or yes anyway and that's difficult in today's world that you cannot find 60 people to feed i don't know any place in the world where you cannot find 60 people to feed it may not be locality but if you just go to the next locality in your city surely in your country surely you can find it i wish to allah may that time come i mean i mean which will come in challenge inshallah"
