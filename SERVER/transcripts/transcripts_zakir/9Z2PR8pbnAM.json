  "title": "Having Missed Salaah for Years Should We Make Up for Them All? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "hello Mr Zakir Nik it's Iman from Afghanistan I'm 15 years old and I'm a Muslim I have two questions when does Salah become f for a person is it the age of puberty or age of 10 number two what should we do about missed prayers I unfortunately missed prayers for years should we just repent or cover it and if I must cover it how many years should I cover because I became adult in 14 and now I'm 15 should I cover just one year or five years the question posed by Iman from Afghanistan is that at what age does it become f for a person to offer Salah is it the age of puberty or the age of 10 first the name Iman is also of a girl also of a boy so I don't know whether the question posed by the questioner is it a male or is it a female is it a girl or is it a boy we know that you are 15 years old but we don't know whether you're a girl or a boy because Iman is a word is a name used for a boy as well as for a girl but IR respect what it is the correct age at which the Salah becomes f is at the age of puberty and the age of puberty differs between different people between different sex whether it's male or female whether you're coming from from a cold country or a hot country whether you're living in India or Afghanistan or USA it differs if you are a girl the right age is that puberty when you start having menstrual cycle a girl can start having menstrual cycle even normally it's between the age of 13 14 sometime it can be even 12 it can even be 10 I being a doctor I'm aare that girls even at the age of nine they start the menstrual cycle so the day a girl starts having menstrual cycle is the day she reaches puberty and from that time it becomes F on her to offer Salah and for a boy also so the average age may be 13 14 sometime it can delate to the age of 15 and since you said that you reach puberty at the of 14 so that from that time Salah becomes for you if you're a boy but natural from the time you start having pubic hair and the signs of puberty comes that the time when Salah becomes for and for a boy also it's similar it may be the age of 14 can be 15 can be 13 it varies between individual so as far as you are concerned since you said that you read the age of puberty at the age of 14 then your Salah becomes F from the age of 14 and you said that now your age of 15 so you missed your F Salah for one year not five years regarding a question that should you cover up or should you catch up or should you make up for the F Salah that you have missed for the past one year or should you just repent there are two opinions I for this there's one opinion which says that you should make up for it and as many times as you offer your F or at the same time you keep on offering an additional for the time that you have missed this is one opinion but the more correct opinion is that if you have missed the Salah intentionally and purposefully there is no experation our beloved Prophet wasallam said mentioned in ofari and Muslim that if a person forgets to offer Salah there's no expiation and the moment he remembers he should offer it another narration says that if a person sleeps and doesn't offer Salah the moment he wakes up the moment remembers he should offer there is no expiration for that the moment he wakes up he should offer Salah So based on these and various had the prophet was very EMP Tic and clear that if you forget if you miss your Salah because of forgetfulness or because you're sleeping like Salah you you over sleep so there's no appreciation for it and the moment you remember it you should pray it immediately you should not wait till your next Salah is there immediately and Allah will not hold responsible there's no sin on that so the second opinion which is the correct opinion of the scholars is that if you you miss it intentionally out of laziness or saying okay I'll read after after then the Salah time is over or you know it is far then you may only offer once in a day or you may not offer at all for many years according to the second opinion which is the more correct opinion there is no experation for the Salah that you have intentionally missed it is a major sin it is a major sin so if you intentionally miss any Salah it's a major and the only remedy for this is that you repent to Allah subhana tala you ask for forgiveness to Allah subhana tala and you repent and inshallah Allah will forgive you and to compensate for that which you have missed there's no experation but the scholars say that you can increase your Salah the you increase that and do more Good Deeds for example give more charity give more of donation so do more Good Deeds which will compensate for the sins you have done but you don't have to repeat the Salah you have missed and this is the more correct and authentic opinion which was even followed by the second CIF of Islam that is Omar may Allah be pleased with him including his son Abdullah Omar and various sahabas so there are various hadiths that reaffirms that for this it's a sin and there is no compensation like don't have to repeat your Salah it's a sin you have to ask for forgiveness and this was a view which was also there Byam may Allah have mercy on him even bylam even even by sh all these Scholars even by contemporary Scholars whether it be all of them say that if you miss your Salah intentionally then you don't have to repeat it you have to ask for forgiveness and do more Good Deeds whether the charity more of Na Salah more of the Sunnah Salah and this is the correct opinion even those people who say that you have to read they don't say that once you read it is like you if you have forgotten and if you offer your Salah immediately remember there's no sin they don't say that if you have missed and if you offer Salah there's no sin they say that it's a major sin but if you read then your sin becomes but the more correct opinion is what I gave earlier that you don't have to repeat it because imagine suppose you realize at the age of 50 that I should offer Salah and the time that you had to offer Salah was when you became an adult When You Reach poity maybe at the age of 14 so now you say for 36 years I did not offer Salah now if I have to read for all the 36 years will I live that long so maybe you'll say Okay since I did not read Salah for 36 years I will not read for the rest of the life so logically also it doesn't make sense you have to ask for forgiveness inshallah I'll forgive you you can read as many more and do other good deal like extra fasting and giving more charity so this opinion which is more authentic opinion so for you also you missed your Salah for one year because you reach puberty at the age of 14 but you don't have to repeat those Salah which you miss for one year just see to it that you increase your you offer offer offer in the last one third of night fast more give more charity inshallah may Allah subh forgive you and may Allah increase in your blessings hope that answer the question"
