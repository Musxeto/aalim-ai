  "title": "Is Organ Donation Permitted in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "a software engineer i embraced islam at the time of my marriage i just have only one question which relates to humanity our topic is about peace to humanity this islam or in anywhere in quran is it specified about the human organ donation if it does so is it allowed or like why is the reason that it is not also as i heard from some of my friends just as the question that is there any mention in the quran that organ donation can be done or not there's no verse in the quran or any authentic hadith or again transplantation organ donation can be no no no not done but all the scholars have got together and there are several conferences taking place in makkah in riyadh and malaysia and the scholars many agree that organ donation and organ transplantation can be done if three criterias are fulfilled number one the person donating the organ it should not cause a major loss to his health i can't give my heart if i do it in heart i will die but doctors say that i've got two kidneys one kidney sufficient and if my mother both the kidneys have failed i can give a kidney to her even she will survive and even i will survive so point number one the person donating the organ should not cause a major loss to his health point number two the person receiving the organ should be a major benefit for his health point number three it should not be for money for economic reasons person can't sell his kidney so if these three things are fulfilled the scholars say under these conditions organ donation can be done organ transplantation can be done hope that answers the question"
