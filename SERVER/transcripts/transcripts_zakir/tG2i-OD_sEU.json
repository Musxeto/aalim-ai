  "title": "Misconceptions about Islam 7 - Hijaab Subjugates the Women Part 2 - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "allah says in the quran in surah azab chapter number 33 verse number 59 oh prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the believing women that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak they should put on the jilbab so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested quran says hijab has been prescribed for the woman so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested i'd like to ask you a question that suppose two twin sisters who are very beautiful who are equally beautiful if they are walking down the streets of dubai walking down along the cornish and if one twin sister she's wearing the islamic hijab the complete body covered except the face and hands up to the wrist and the other twin sister she's wearing the western clothes the mini skirts or shorts and if both of them are walking down the streets in dubai along the cornish and if on the side there is a ruffian who's waiting for a catch who's going to tease a girl i'm asking the question which girl will it is will it is the girl we were in the islamic hijab or will it is the girl wearing the western clothes the mini skirts are short which girl abilities which girl but natural the girl wearing the western clothes the mini skirts are short if you are inviting then you will receive quran rightly says that hijab has been prescribed to prevent the woman from be molested and after this if anyone rapes any woman the islamic sharia says death penalty many non-muslims say death penalty in this age of 21st century islam is a barbaric religion it's a ruthless law but when i ask this question and i've asked this question to thousands of non-muslims that suppose god forbid someone rips your mother or someone rips your sister and if you are made the judge and the rapist is bought in front of you what punishment will you give him believe me all of them said hundred percent we will put him to death some went to the extreme of saying we will torture him to death so someone rapes your mother your wife your sister you want to put into that someone named somebody else's mother somebody else's sister you say death penalty barbaric law why these double standards why and do you know america usa which happens to be the most advanced country in the world do you know it has one of the highest rates of rape in the world the country which has one of the highest rate of rape in the world is usa according to the fbi statistics of 1990 every day 1756 cases of rape took place according to the statistics of u.s department of justice in 1996 every day 2 713 cases of rape took place 1990 1756 1996 2007-13 maybe the americans got bold bolder in six years time they got more bold if you calculate every 32 second one rape is taking place in america you know we are here in this auditorium for the past one and a half hour already 150 rapes may have taken place in usa till the time we are here i am asking you the question that if you implement the islamic sharia any man looks at a woman he should lower his gaze the woman should be modestly dressed complete body covered except the face and hands up to the wrist and after that any man rapes any human capital punishment death penalty i'm asking the question will the rate of rape in america will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease it will decrease it's a practical law you implement the sharia you get results that's the reason the least rate of rape in any country in the world it's in saudi arabia you implement the sharia you get results the western society claiming to uplift the woman when it speaks about women's liberalization it's nothing but a disguised form of exploitation of a body deprivation of a soul and degradation of honor the western society claiming to uplift the women have actually degraded her to a status of concubines butterflies and mistresses which are mere tools in the hands of pleasure seekers and sex marketeers hidden behind the colorful screen of art and culture in the name of art and culture the westerners they're selling the daughters they're selling them others and you see it very common in most of the ads invariably you have to find a woman you see an ad of a motorcycle how many women ride motorcycle yet you see a woman in that motorcycle in a head of a car percentage-wise a small percentage of women drive cars yet you'll find a woman in that of a car and i was told about a very famous advertisement ad of the bmw you know bmw car it's in competition with mercedes the youngsters they prefer bmw it has a better pickup it's fast someone told me in one of the very famous ads of bmw there was a woman who was standing in front of the car with the bikini and the ad read driver now who the girl of the car so in the name of woman liberalization they are selling their daughters they are selling their mothers we love our daughters we love our mothers we love our wives if the hijab subjugates the woman and protects her we love this subjugation we love this subjugation and we love this protection if this is your freedom in the name of women liberalization selling your body selling yourself we are very happy with our religion islam has prescribed women hijab to protect her and to uplift her and we see today the same thing is happening in the western world same thing what happened in greek civilization roman civilization woman in the name of liberalization art culture modeling fashion tv all this you see what are they doing going back to the old age"
