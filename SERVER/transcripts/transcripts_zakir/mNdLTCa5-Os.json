  "title": "If Islam Propagates Forgiveness then why does it Permit Honour Killing? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "um my name is Caroline I'm a journalist I've got a two-part question here um does Islam propagate acts of forgiveness yes or no does Islam propagate acts of forgiveness as the question does Islam propag Act of forgiveness of course yes and every chapter every Surah of the Glorious Quran begins with the formula in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful so why does yes sister second part of the question and the second part of the question is why does it permit why does Islam permit honor killings honor killing yes what do you mean by honor killings honor killing the right to avenge your brother's blood in the name of Allah it might be out of context but I just need to know if there's an answer to this if I get you honor killing means if someone kills any human being to take revenge yes that's what you mean yes because I've read a few books and a lot lot of the times people have said that they allowed to kill their brother or to kill somebody else because their brother has been killed by another human being this as very good question that if Islam propagates Act of forgiveness why does it permit honor killing why it per that's a very good question sister if you Analyze This mention in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number 2 verse 178 the penalty the punishment of death on the basis of kasas and Allah also says in the Quran in Sur MAA chapter number five verse number 32 if anyone kills any other human being whether it be Muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for creating Mischief in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity so as a general rule if any human being kills any other human being it is as though he has kill the whole of humanity except under du circumstances unless it is for murder or for creating Mischief in the land now there are two acceptions where Islam gives permission where you can kill any other human being number one is if that person has committed murder which comes in your scope of question honor killing number two is if he's creating facad corruption in this land again this is not compulsory if someone kills someone it's not compulsory has to be killed Islam also says that if the relatives of the person who has been killed if they take blood money if they forgive the killer that person who has killed can be forgiven but under normal circumstances if suppose if he killed someone and if I want death on that because for death again the punishment is death like as it's mentioned earlier in the early scriptures even in the Bible and I for a tooth for a tooth it keeps on continuing here what we realize that suppose I know of a human being who's killing other people innocent human being if I don't kill him he will keep on killing other human beings so that law is not only in Islam it's the law of most of the countries that if homicide is done if someone has murdered someone in many countries he should be put to death or there life imprisonment even in Islam that if he killed someone if required he can be killed but the relatives of the person even can forgive the person if they want if they want they can forgive the murderer but if they want that he should be put to death then he'll be put to death and the second case where a person can be killed is if he's causing corruption in the land for example if someone is committing rape now rape is nothing but causing corruption in the land so in this case that person should be put to death because the sin is so heinous it is such a big crime that there's no other punishment but death penalty and I've asked this to many non-muslims that God forbid if someone rapes your mother and if you are made the judge and if the rapist is born in front of you what punishment you will give him and 100 person of the non-muslim they told me that we will put him to death some went to the extreme of saying we will torture him to death so why they double standards you know In America which happens to be one of the most advanced countries in the world according to the FBI statistics in 1990 every day on average 1,756 cases of rape took place according to 1996 statistics US Department of Justice every day 2713 cases of rape took place 1990 1756 1996 2713 maybe the Americans got more bold that means every 32 second one rap is taking place in America we are here in this autoim for the past about 3 hours already more than 300 rapes may have taken place in America so Islam has a system of hijab which I mention my talk that when a man looks at a woman he should lower the Gaze the woman should follow the Islamic hijab which I mentioned earlier after that if any man commits rape he gets capital punishment even the American law says that 7 years rigorous imprisonment for rapist but most of the time he let free so when you ask even a non-muslim what punishment will you give 100% said will put him to death there was one American who was a smart alec in America told me brother Zakir first I will give him five years reg imprisonment I told him do you know according to the States of America out of those that commit rape after the imprison and after they let free more than 95% commit rape again so if you want your daughter and your mother to be raped again you're most welcome I don't want that so he said if that's the case in the first time it put him to death so in such cases where this's Corruption of land like rape Etc Islam gives permission death penalty can even be given for that case hope the answer the question sister [Applause]"
