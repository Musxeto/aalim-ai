  "transcript": "same way if you go to The Vedas it says that the wom should cover the head so all the religious scriptures they talk about the women covering their head it is for modesty it is not to degrade the women and if you analyze there was allegation made against me saying that Dr Zakir n says that if they don't wear hijab you know that if you wear western clothes there are chances the women will be raped it is a misquotation again what I said that if women were revealing clothes they have more chances of being raped what I was doing the same Newspaper Sunday time we spoke against me one year before on the march of 9th 2009 Sunday Times sked an article in Britain one out of seven feel that the woman who were sexy revealing clothes she should be hit I'm sorry I don't agree with it this is the statistics that was given in the Sunday Times on the 9th of March 2009 that in Britain one out of seven britishers believe that the women who were revealing and sexy clothes should be hit I disagree with this"
