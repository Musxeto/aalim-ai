  "title": "Which is More Urgent, Dawah or Islaah - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the brother asking that which is more priority dawa that is inviting non-muslims to Islam or Isla that is correcting the Muslims are making mistakes actually both are important but if you ask that you have less time and you can do only one of the two then my reply is that if a person of heart attack comes to a doctor or a person who comes to a doctor with a small bruise or a cut in his hand the doctor should attend to him the person who has a heart attack or a person who has a bruise or a small minor cut in the hand but natur he should attend first to the heart attack because there are high chances he will die for the person who has a small cut he may bleed it may cause little pain but the chance of him dying is very very very negligible if it's a normal cut so similarly the best is doing both da and ISL but if your time is restricted and if two in front of you but natur speaking to a non-muslim and trying to get him closer to Islam removing the shik in his life and getting him closer to Allah subh tala so that he enters jna will take more priority than doing ISL to a Muslim getting closer to Islam but the best is doing both but between the two butal dawa according to me carries more priority"
