  "transcript": "alhamdulillah I welcome all the viewers with the Islamic greetings this is a special and an important and urgent message for my dear brothers and sisters of Bangladesh firstly I'd like to congratulate you that hardly two days ago today is the 7th of August two days ago on Monday the 5th of August you got freedom from an unjust regime and i' had given a message more than two weeks ago on the 20th of July when I started receiving messages on my social media and the banglades around me started speaking about it and as you may be aware that on my social media the maximum following I have is from Bangladesh on my Facebook alone out of 23.9 million followers more than 25% more than 6 million followers are from Bangladesh alone it has the largest following in any country in the world it has more following than India and Pakistan put together in India I have about 3 million followers in Pakistan I 3 million followers but Bangladesh alone has more than 6 million followers that's the reason it becomes my moral duty and also an Islamic duty to give a suggestion and advice to my dear brother and sisters of Bangladesh on the 20th of July more than two weeks ago when dozens of students had been killed in the protest that was started by the students against the unjust 30% quota reservation and I appreciated the efforts of the students and I told them that dozens of students have been killed and inshallah they martys they Shahid and Allah will give them J fos I also give advice to the officials of Bangladesh that they should let Justice Prevail let peace Prevail and they should handle the situation with wisdom and with hikma but unfortunately the officials of Bangladesh did not heed my advice and they retaliated and they increased the atrocities against the students so much so that on Sunday alone on the 4th of August more than 100 people were killed by the unjust regime just 3 days ago and the total officially had to reached to more than 300 people had been killed and The Unofficial report said more than thousand some reports said thousands had been killed and because of this the protest intensified and on the 5th of August two days ago hundreds of thousands of Bangladeshi they marched in D and they went to the residence of the previous prime minister Hina so much so that the previous prime minister who was a dictator Hina had to resign and flee the country and Allah gave Victory to the students and the peaceful protesters and I would like to remind here that even after the freedom was achieved yet we are receiving news that there is AR sin there is vandalism that the houses and the shops of the supporters of hassina are being touched they are being looted and today morning and even yesterday I received information that some of the Hindus have been attacked also received information that the temple was attacked I'm not aware how many Hindus have been attacked but my request to my dear brothers and sisters the Muslim brothers and sisters of Bangladesh please do not attack any Hindu do not attack a single non-muslim do not burn the houses of the Hindus or the non-muslims please do not attack a single Temple do not burn or attack any non-muslim places of worship we as Muslims we should be an example to the world and let not any Muslim misguide you that attacking a Hindu is good or attacking a non-muslim is good attacking a place of worship is good please don't let any Muslim misguide you and regarding the conditions what should be done whether the attacking or place of worship is permitted or not I've given a detailed answer on my video on Heya Sofia and there have said that when there is a war where a Muslim army goes and there is a war and when there is a Jihad and at that time depends upon the leader to make a decision if that place of non-muslim worship is creating of f is misguiding the Muslims then if the destroy permitted but generally we have seen many occasions where the rash be with him he told the sahabas that don't attack the place of worship it depends upon the situation on the Other Extreme if a non-muslim has taken protection in a Muslim leadership or a Muslim regime it becomes the duty of the Muslim leader and the Muslims to protect the lives of the non-muslims not only protect the life even protect their property today in Bangladesh we don't have either of this situation we don't have a war taking place neither do we have a non-muslim taking protection in the Muslim regime but my advice to my dear Muslim brothers and sisters of Bangladesh my advice to you in this situation is see to it that you do not attack a single Hindu a single non-muslim do not burn the house of a single Hindu or a single non-muslim see to it you do not attack a single Temple see to it you do not burn a single Temple do not attack or burn any non-muslim place of worship in fact see to it that you protect the non-muslims you protect the places of worship of the non-muslims I request the students of Bangladesh and the Muslims of Bangladesh please don't take law in your hand if you find that there's any person doing Injustice if you find any non-muslim doing Injustice see to it that let peace previl in the country first and later on you can take them to the laws and authorities and see to it that they are brought to justice but now at this moment please stop vandalizing please stop attacking and destroying the properties of the people in Islam we have to protect our neighbors irrespective they Muslim or non-muslim see with that all the Muslims in Bangladesh if you find any non-muslim any Hindu living in your locality see to it that they're secure if anyone goes and attacks them you should protect them I would like to request the students body who started this wonderful movement against the unjust Kota that was launched by the government which also went to the extent of toppling the unjust regime my request to you is see to it that you form another subcommittee in your students body that sees to it that they Place some students outside the temples outside the non-muslim places of worship see to it that if anyone whether Muslim or UNM Muslim tries to attack these places of worship see to it that they should protect let the world come to know that this is how the Muslims behave like how at the time of fashid at the time of Omar the non-muslim were so happy and so peaceful they wanted to live under the leadership of an Islamic ruler see to it that you are examples please don't let someone misguide you and Allah has helped you now I would like to congrat rulate the students the Youth of Bangladesh that because of you now there is freedom for all the bangladeshis against the unjust previous regime against the previous dictator prime minister Hina Allah has helped you but let me remind you what you have got is only victory in the first stage of the battle that the previous regime has been toppled but now your real battle starts see to it that peace is restored in bangl see to it that Bangladesh has a just regime see to it that you follow the Quran and say you follow the teachings of Allah and the Beloved Prophet see to it that you are good Exemplar Muslims not only to the people of Bangladesh but even the people of the world and I pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may the problems of Bangladesh be solved May the problem of unemployment may be solved May the economy be restored May the Justice be restored May the peace be restored and have high hopes that the students have started this movement please don't let it die in between you have just won the first stage of the battle see to it that the peace is restored see to it no non-muslim no Hindu is attacked see to it that to protect the houses and the places of worship of the Hindus and since the last three weeks since we came to know that this problem has started in Bangladesh my son who usually often leads the Salah in the mosque where we
