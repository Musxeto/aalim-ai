  "transcript": "the next question fahim hassan from bangladesh she asks my father is an atheist but i am a practicing muslim alhamdulillah he says that if there is allah why is he so rude with those who are not muslims what will happen to them if they do not know about islam as they are spending a simple life the brother has asked the question regarding these non-muslims that why is allah subhanahu talah so rude with them and what will happen to them if they are leading a simple life brother i disagree with you that allah subhanahu ta'ala he is rude with the non-muslims but in fact allah subhanahu ta'ala he's kind he's merciful to non-muslims he has given them so many facilities he has given them the shelter the house food so many things in this life even though they are disobedient to allah subhana wa tala even though they are associating partners with allah subhanahu ta'ala yet allah subhanahu wa he is kind with these people and he is giving them all that they require allah he is not rude with these non-muslims the water that we need for living if we do not get it for a few days we will die the air that we breathe if we do not get it for a few minutes we will die the water the air all these things allah has given us human beings has given even to these non-muslims even though they are denying allah but yet he's kind and generous with these very non-muslims now what will happen to these people to these non-muslims if they're leading a simple life allah says in the glorious quran in surah fusilla chapter 41 53 him and soon we shall show them our signs in the furthest regions of the horizons and into their souls until it is clear to them that this is the truth allah he takes it upon himself that he will deliver the message to each and every human being and a blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that every child is born in deen or fitra it is later on that his parents they make him a christian they make him a hindu etc but every child is born on the fitrah that is he's born in the religion of islam later on his parents they make him a hindu they make him a christian etc that's the reason whenever a person embraces islam the right word that we should use is reward rather than convert and it is the duty of every muslim to convey the message of islam to the non-muslims to those who are unaware of it we have the example of the kapaku tribe and the australian aborigines they did not come into contact with modern civilization till late as 1950 and they believed in tawhid that is the oneness of allah it is an innate nature it is a fitra that whenever any person is born he is born in the religion of islam and this is the fitra that he believes in one god that is allah"
