  "transcript": "now I call upon dr. William Campbell to present his response to dr. zakir naik [Applause] well dr. Naik has brought up some real problems I don't agree with his answer about the Quran in terms of the alaqah and mu Dhaka I still think it's a big problem but that's his opinion in my opinion so everybody will have to go home and think about it themselves he spoke about he hasn't mentioned met any person that took the poison test I can't present the person because he's already gone to be with the Lord but I have friend Harry Radcliffe and he lived in a town in the south of Morocco and one of his people who he thought was a friend invited him over for a lunch for our dinner and he invited the wife and son also and so when Harry agreed to go somebody came and knocked on the door and said the man's going to poison you so they went harry took this very verse that you've read and he decided that he should go because he had said he would so he went he waited hoping to find a time when when the man brought in the couscous he could turn the way the man would go out and he could turn the couscous around but there was no such time so he dug in and he ate his wife was too she wasn't able would eat very much and they had fed their son before they went but Harry ached and that night Harry got pains in his tummy and he had some blood but he lived and so two days later he went knocked on the door and the man came and opened the door and his face went absolutely white and Harry thanked him for the meal I thought so I give you this one example anyway now you have said about Jesus was only sent to the Jews go only go to the for the Jew - and not to the Gentiles well in the Koran itself it talks about Mary and then she says I don't know any man in sort of 1921 then it says that Jesus is to be a sign unto men and a mercy from us in Matthew 4 9 a lady came and anointed Jesus feet he said whenever there wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world what this woman has done will be told and in Matthew 28 when Jesus is about to ascend into heaven he says go into all the world and preach the gospel well this is not a contradiction he did say to his disciples go only to the Jews because the Jews were given a certain chance there's a story in the Bible shouldn't use a story where it's story I suppose about history where Jesus came to a fig tree and the fig tree had brought no fruit for three years and so they didn't done he said shall I tear it down and then Jesus answer was no leave it one more year and we'll fertilize it and see if it brings any fruit this was all a parable about Israel he had preached to them three years and he would preach another half but then there are other parables that he told where he said all right it'll be taken away from you the blessing and given to the Gentiles dr. Naik has talked about the day and the periods the day in the Bible also can have the time of a long period doesn't have to be 24 hours as dr. buck I wanted to exist in his book and I believe that it was was long periods of time and there are so these problems that he has said and I don't deny them and I don't have good answers for them but I will tell about [Applause] he spoke about the the two kinds of salt the sweet water and the salt water I don't agree with his explanation the quran says has that God has let free the two barriers do bodies of flowing water meeting together between them as a barrier which they do not transgress then which of the favours of your Lord will you deny the word used here for barrier is barzakh means interval or gap or break or bar or obstruction or isthmus the same information is given in Al Furqan 25:52 3 it is he who has let free the two bodies of flooring flowing water one palatal palatable and sweet and the other salt e and bitter and he made between them a barrier and a partition that it is forbidden to pass the phrase a partition that it is forbidden to pass represents two words from the same route this is done in Arabic to stress or accent whatever is being discussed the word has your means forbidden interdicted prohibited all very strong words and the second word which is the last participle of the verb has the same past participle of the verb as the same meanings therefore very literally one might translate this as he God made between them a bar and a forbidden forbidding dr. bukai discusses this briefly and then he he says though he admits at the end while it mixes far out to see a scientist friend commenting on this said it is simply that the salt and freshwater are physically separated the affluent from the river displacing the seawater but there is no barrier thermodynamically the mixing is a spontaneous immediate process highly favored by entropy the only barrier is kinetic it takes a long time for that much stuff to mix I myself of it have had its tiny example of this I had a friend in Tunisia and he used to collect he used to a hunt for for four octopi so I went there once and I jumped out of the boat and was swimming around and it was right at the at the where our small Creek came in and the the top water was cold and the bottom water was hot I thought how can this be the top is cold and the bottom is hot and then I realized the cold water was coming off of the fraud of the river and the salt water is heavy so the water salt warm water was on the bottom and the cold light water was at the top so there is but there is no barrier dr. Naik spoke about languages and of course I am NOT able to answer about the languages in in India well I couldn't answer about the Indian languages in America either so it's no difference between India and America however the place that he talks about in the Bible the disciples were given languages as a miracle but they were the Mary main languages that the people who were there knew they weren't weak languages that were unknown if somebody came from Spain an apostle spoke to that person in his language from Spain if another person came from Turkey and different apostles spoke to the other person in his language from Turkey I'm going to go to something that I've prepared to give and talk about witnesses in Deuteronomy God told Moses the way to know true prophet was did his prophecy come true Elijah is an example Elias in the Koran and he went to the king and he told him it's not gonna rain till I say so and so it was six months and no rain a year and no rain once in Tunisia there was a whole year with no rain then two years with no rain in three years in three and a half years and then Elijah went to the king and he said we're gonna have a contest and they went up on Mount Carmel and they had this contest and the king lost and in the Quran it says that Elias had a major wonderful victory but then Elias fell down on his knees Elijah and he prayed for rain and the rain came well Elijah is the first witness when he said it's not going to rain till I say so he was the first witness when God made the rain come when Elijah fell down on his knees God Himself was the second witness another example is Isaiah 17 BC the Jews were sent into exile prophesied they'd be sent to exile and then Cyrus would bring them back Cyrus who's Cyrus 250 years later Cyrus a Persian pagan King sent the Jews back to Israel back to Palestine and there's a cyrus cylinder in London that talks about it so it asked the question did Jesus fulfilled prophecies did Jesus do miracles did Jesus make prophecies we're going to make a mathematical study of prophecies it's called the theory of probabilities estimate and will estimate the possibility that these prophecies could be fulfilled by chance an example of this is supposing dr. Naik has ten shirts and I know he has a red shirt and I say tomorrow he's going to wear the red shirt and tomorrow he does and so then I say I'm a prophet well my friends are going to say no no that just happened by hit chance well then supposing dr. samuel name and he has two pairs of shoes and his pair of sandals so then the next day i prophesy what shirt that dr. Naik is going to wear and I practice prophesy that dr. Samuel naman is going to wear his sandals and dr. Zebulon had he has five hats and I say he's going to wear his turban well what are the chances that I could have all of these right by chance well gone away anyway all right you multiply 1 over 10 by 1 over 5 by 1 over 3 and you get 1 over 150 and that's my chance of getting it by luck is it possible to have the slide projector down please I mean these the screen down while the time is going and we're going to look at 12:10 prophecies and then one which we will not count because of just what we want to prove the first one is a prophesy and Jeremiah prophecy in Jeremiah 600 BC that the Messiah must be from the posterity of David the days are coming declares the Lord when I will raise up to David a righteous branch a king who will reign wisely and do what is Justin right in the land he will be called the Lord Yahweh our righteousness and the fulfillment was in the six month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to Mary the angel said to her do not be afraid Mary behold you will conceive in your womb and bear a son he will be called Jesus he will be great and we call the son of the Most High and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David and if his kingdom there will be no end and the angel said to her the Holy Spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you therefore the child to be born will be called holy well when David was first he was just from a small family but after he became King and his family was known then everybody would remember if they were the fifth cousin of the king so I'm going to assume that one in 200 Jewish people belong to the family of David the second prophecy is an everlasting rulers to be born in Bethlehem Micah 750 BC but you O Bethlehem Ephrata who are little to be among the clans of Judah from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel whose origin is from of old from ancient days in the fulfillment though Jews Joseph and Mary lived in Nazareth because of an order from Caesar Augustus Joseph had to take Mary to Bethlehem his native town in the fulfillment it says and Joseph also went up from Galilee from the city of Nazareth to Judea to the City of David which is called Bethlehem because he was of the house and lineage of David and while there she gave birth to her firstborn son well what's the chance of being born in Bethlehem there's about 2 million 2 billion people were born in the world from Micah until now and 7,000 live in Bethlehem so one man out of every 280,000 men was born in Bethlehem the third prophecy a messenger will prepare the way for the Messiah this was done by Malachi in chapter 3 1 and 400 BC behold I send my message to prepare the way before me and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple the messenger of the Covenant is whom you delight in whom you delight behold he is coming says the Lord of Hosts the fulfillment the next day John John the Baptist yeah but even Zechariah saw Jesus coming toward him and said behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world this is he of whom I said after me comes a man who ranks before me for he was before me and to this the Quran agrees also in the story of the family of imran 390 39 45 when it says that yet he has to come witnessing the truth of a word from God whose name will be Christ Jesus the Son of Mary well how many leaders had a four-runner well that's hard to say but when I put down one man in a thousand was a leader who had a forerunner the fourth prophecy the Messiah will do many signs and miracles and Isaiah 750 we read say to those with fearful hearts be strong and do not fear your God will come and he will save you then will the eyes that the blind be opened and the ears of the Deaf be unstopped then will the lame you leap like a deer and the sons tongue of the dumb shout for joy the fulfillment the gospel states it does the core and that Jesus did many miracles the Bible speaks of only four prophets who did many miracles Moses Elijah Elijah and Jesus Jesus is the only one that did all four types of miracles mentioned in the prophecy and he sometimes healed all who came to him well since many Muslims believe there were 124 thousand prophets we will use that number and say that Jesus was the one man in a hundred and twenty four thousand the fifth prophecy in spite of these signs his brothers were against him in the psalm of David a thousand BC he says I have come become a stranger to my brother and alien to my mother's sons and in John he gives the fulfillment so his brother said to him leave here and go to Judea for even his brothers did not believe in him our question might be one ruler and how many would have find his family against him well many kings were overthrown by their own relatives therefore we will say one in five or two times 10 to the first power and the sixth prophecy it's given by Zachariah and 520 BC rejoice greatly o daughter of Zion shout o daughter of Jerusalem behold your king comes unto you he is just and having salvation lowly and riding upon an ass the fulfillment the next day the great crowd took palm branches and went out to meet him shouting Hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord blessed is the king of Israel and Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it well obviously Jesus chose to sit up on the donkey that's no miracle it's nothing unusual but the crowd was there and the crowd came and and praised him and said blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord well how many rulers enter Jerusalem how many rulers enter Jerusalem on a donkey nowadays he come on a man in a Mercedes but one roller I said one ruler in a hundred the seventh prophecy Jesus foretells the destruction of the temple he himself did the prophecy so jesus said this in some time in 30 AD and as Jesus was going out in the temple one of his disciples said to him teacher behold what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings and jesus said to him do you see these great buildings not one stone shall be left upon another which will not be torn down in the fulfillment about forty years later in 70 AD the Roman general Titus captured Jerusalem after a long siege Titus had intended to spare the temple but the Jews set it on fire well for the Jews to revolt and then be crushed would be common so I said one chance in five for the eighth prophecy the Messiah will be crucified in Psalms David wrote a thousand BC a band of evil men has crucifer has encircled me they have pierced my hands and my feet well Jesus David didn't die this way he died in his bed his feet were not had where his feet and hands were not pierced Luke gives us the fulfillment when they came to the place called the skull there they crucified Jesus along with the criminals one on us right the honor on his left our question is one man and how many has been crucified well I said one man in 10,000 the prophecy 9 they will divide his garments and cast lot for his robe again this is David speaking they divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing well John gives us the fulfillment in chapter 19 when the soldiers crucified Jesus they took his clothes dividing them into four shares one for each of them with the undergarment remaining this garment was seamless woven in one piece from top to bottom let's not tear it they said let's decide by lot who'll get it well how many criminals would have a seamless garment well you can make your own decision but I said one in a hundred [Applause] the 10th prophecy though innocent he would be counted with the wicked and with the rich in his death I say a said in 750 BC he was assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth he was numbered with the transgressors Matthew gives us the fulfillment they crucified two robbers with him as evening approached there came a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph a disciple of Jesus going to Pilate he asked for Jesus body Joseph wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and placed it in his own - well how many executed criminals were innocent well I said one man intent and how many innocent man or how many criminals were buried with the rich I say one man in 100 that gives one in a thousand finally the prophecy after dying he will rise from the dead in Isaiah again it says for he was cut off from the land of the living he died and though the Lord makes his life a guilt offering he will see his offspring and prolong his days so there is a there is a prophecy that he will be come back to life Luke tells us Jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you and then Paul gives us a summary in 1st Corinthians 15 that Jesus appeared to Peter and then to the twelve after that he appeared to more than 500 the brothers at the same time most of whom are still living then to James Jesus half-brother then to all the apostles well that's not something you can give a value to so now we're going to look at the calculation one man and how many men the world over will fulfill guilt fulfill all 10 prophecies this question can be answered by multiplying all of our estimates I'm not have time to read them but the answer is one chance in two times two point seven eight times ten to the twenty eight twenty eight zeroes let us simplify and reduce the number by calling it one times ten to the twenty eight the best information available indicates the number of men who ever lived to be about eighty eight billion we'll call that one times ten to the eleventh by dividing these two numbers we find that the chance that any man might have lived down to the present time and fulfilled all ten prophecies by luck is 1 in 10 to the 17th that's written out this way with 17 zeroes well let's try and imagine this if you took the state of Texas and you covered it with dollar coins one meter deep 3 feet deep silver dollars and then one coin was marked electrically and then I say there go walk out into the state of Texas and pick the right coin that's your chance of picking the right coin by chance in other words it's no chance I'm having trouble just a minute there are many more prophecies these all show the Prophet David are aasaiya Isaiah as the first witness God causing fulfillment is the second witness and God caused the disciples of Jesus to write it down these are all proofs that the Bible is true and from Yahweh Elohim the gospel says that Jesus came from God and paid the penalty for our sins this is good news the Quran has hard news sir and now he'll 1661 says if Allah were to punish men for their wrongdoing he would not leave on earth a single living creature the problem is that the Quran states very clear that even those who have done their best are given only a maybe in the surah of their narration ELCA says it says but as for him who shall repent and believe and do right perhaps si an he may be one of the successful in the forbidding at tehreem it says o you who believe repent toward Allah with a sincere repentance it may be that your Lord will repent from you your evildoing deeds in the surah of repentance a Toba it says those only shall worship in the mosques of Allah who believe in Allah and the last day and observe proper worship and give arms and fear none except the law and it might be that these are other rightly guided in the end it's very lonely if a person does not believe then he's sure to go to hell but if he does believe on the day of judgment he stands there all by himself in front of a law there is no intercessor our friend and he can only hope that maybe perhaps he might be among the blessed this is hard news where in his next edition dictionary translates si an as it might be it could be that possibly maybe perhaps in the oxford dictionary it's English for English Arabic perhaps it's translated as ISO and this may be true but it's hard on the other hand the gospel has good news jesus said I did come to be served but to serve to give my life a ransom for many another verse from Paul the Apostle says if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead you will be saved straight out this is wonderful good news you read with me these fulfilled prophecies as proofs there were 500 people who saw a Christ after he rose from the dead there are many archaeological finds confirm the Bible I heard you get a copy of the Bible of the Gospel read it you will find good news for your soul may God bless you all thank you I now call upon dr. zakir naik to present his response to dr. William Campbell [Applause] alhamdulillah what salatu was-salam ala awfully lavalla liebe sabias main I'm a baaad how was the billahi min ash-shaytani r-rajim bismillah ar-rahman rahim half Alya the Bruna piranha what a fine I'm in the gorillas know what you do Fick the laughing kuvira bismillah r-rahman r-rahim Rob Bashar al-assad ree why yes certainly hungry Mahalo looked at a Malay Soniyo golly respected dr. William Campbell they are the people on the dice my respected elders and my dear brothers and sisters I welcome all of you once again with Islamic greetings as-salaamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu may peace mercy and blessings of Almighty God beyond all of you but a William Campbell only touched on two out of the 22 points I made only two [Applause] the first point it is was he thinks that the days mentioned in the Bible he refers to have long periods how did he give the reply in my talk that if you consider the days to be long periods like the Quran you can only solve two problems the six-day creation problem and first day light came and third the earth but the remaining four problems yet is there so dr. william campbell chose to say days a long period and out of six he solved two scientific errors the remaining four of the creation of the universe he does agree to it that's good and he said it's difficult to answer the second point he touched on was regarding the scientific tests of Mark chapter number 16 was from 1718 and he said one of his friend by the name of Harry what are the name was in Morocco in Morocco he ate couscous the Bible says the King James Version as well at the New International Version with dr. William Campbell refers to drink deadly poison not eat drink yet yet I don't mind even a person each deadly poisonous are no problem but imagine one man in Morocco I am told there are two billion Christians in the world no one can come forward not one out of the two million and I thought dr. William Campbell was a true Christian believer and I asked him to pass the test not his friend who only died and he said that blood came out of the mouth dr. William Campbell and even I know variable being medical doctors that having poisoned blood comes out and we cure many people of poison it's also great test is they should come forward and do all these things and yet you should be able to speak for instance and order William Campbell said that at that time if you read Gospel of Mark chapter 16 those people there they spoke the language if people knew and foreign tongues dr. William temple have another Indians out here surely many may know karate Marathi even I know suppose ever asked you which a if I ask you to put your language near good miracle Tamils no reply foreign tongues me recruit anyone knows Tamil or Malayalam Meryem yes very good are you a Christian believer I am asking that person there you are Muslim anyway fine this was supposed to be a safe path by Christian believers there are many people know foreign languages out here only thing you had to do was speak to them like what is their name how are you fine I'm the calf I look an Arabic which you know new languages which you didn't know and you proved my point and yet I have not come across a single Christian who has passed the test in front of me not a single or to the thousands that met personally and now it can be thousand and one after meeting dr. William Campbell only attach two points not a William Campbell did not reply to my twenty points and he start speaking about prophecy what does prophecy to do with science in the Bible if prophecy is the test if prophecies the test the Nostradamus book should be the best book Nostradamus books with the best books to be called the Word of God it is not he spoke about theory of probability for the definition of theory of probability how you can analyze with the Quran with scientific facts refer to my videos I said in the Quran God's Word it's terrible in the fire I prove scientifically how can you use theory of probability dr. William Campbell user on the base of prophecy if I want I can try and prove is prophecy wrong I don't do it I take it for granted for sake of argument using the Concordat approach that whatever prophecy said was right for sake of argument but even if there's one one fulfilled prophecy the whole Bible is disprove with the Word of God I can give you a list of unfulfilled prophecy for example if you read Genesis chapter number 4 was number 12 it says God told Cain you will never be able to settle you will be a wonderer few hours later on Genesis chapter 4 verse 17 says Cain buildable City unfulfilled prophecy if you read Jeremiah chapter number 36 what's the method P it says that Joakim the father of Georgian no one will be able to sit on his throne the throne of David no one be able to sit after juror him if we root later on Pugh Kings chapter number 24 verse number 6 it says that joy I came after he died later on Joe Hachem sat on the throne unfulfilled prophecy one is sufficient to prove it's not the Word of God I can give plenty if it's easy kill chap number 26 it says that name each other he will destroy tyre we come to know that Alexander the Great was a personal destroyed tyre and fulfill prophecy Isaiah chapter number 7 verse number 14 faith prophesizing of the coming of a person who will born to a virgin his name shall be a manual they say the Christians it refers to Jesus Christ peace be upon him born to a virgin the Hebrew word Dave Amla which means not a virgin a young lady the word for virgin in Hebrew is batula which is not there even if we argue we are using concordance we agree virgin virgin no problem it seems he will be called Immanuel no when the Bible is Jesus Christ peace be upon him is called as a manual unfulfilled prophecy I can leave several plenty and fulfill prophecy one is sufficient to prove the Bible wrong I've given a few according to your theory of theory of probability Bible is not the Word of God but William Campbell said that along in the Quran Elijah won the battery according to Bible either laws about what about this that doesn't mean that Bible is correct and Quran is wrong if the statements define the Bible and the Quran you are a looming Bible is the Word of God if both are supposed to be analyzed it can be possible that Quran is right and Bible is wrong it can be possible Bible is right and Quran is wrong it can be possible both are wrong it can be possible both are right for do we have to do if you have to analyze which of the two is wrong you have to get a third source from outside which is authentic just because Bible say the lies are lost and Quran say Elijah 1 therefore Quran is wrong is illogical another William Campbell besides replying to the scientific errors I mentioned I'll just touch on the points which I could not do the lack of time there are an additional six or seven points which he mentioned in his talk which inshallah I give the reply briefly he spoke that the Quran save according to me and he should make a set of four into brother Shabbir Ali that the light of the mood is reflected light and he said it doesn't mean that I'm quoting again the Quran mentioned in surah Furqan chapter 25 verse 61 that blessed is he who has placed in the sky constellation place therein lamp Sun and Moon having borrowed light Munir arabic word use for moon is comer it's always described as Moony or nude meaning reflection of light reflection of light Arabic word use for Sun it's um it's always described as war hide diya which means a blazing torch by shining glory and I can give references for a new chap number 71 fifteen and sixteen so you know step number ten was number five and so on and he said that if it means a reflection of light and he quoted the Quran surah nude chap number 24 was number 35 and 36 that allah subhanho wa taala is not a Marathi Allah is the light of the heaven and the earth read the complete verse and I'm like what did it say it says unless the light nor it fails Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth it is a similar dude like a niche and within the niche there is lamp the lamp world is there so Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has got light of its own and even reflected light like you see a halogen lamp you know which are here the lamp inside his legacy right but the reflector is like moon it is reflecting light the lamp the tube the tube is having a light of its own but the reflector of the halogen lamp is reflecting light so both 2 & 1 so allah subhanallah al hamdulillah besides having light of its own as the Quranic verse says in the niche the river lamp and that lamp light of Allah subhana Allah its own light and Allah reflected on light the william campbell says that the Quran says that Quran is nor is reflecting light of course the Quran is reflecting the light and the guidance of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala regarding prophet mimosa Rasul means her eyes yesyes the hadeeth of the beloved prophet is giving aid into us so mimosa loss column is also nude he's also Suraj he has his own knowledge also alhamdulillah he has a guidance from Allah subhana Allah alhamdulillah so if you use this word nude as reflected light and moon en effect light yet hamdulillah you can prove it scientifically that the light of the moon is not its own light but it is the reflected light there the points the william campbell raised was regarding foreca half chap number 18 was 96 that circle name sees the Sun setting in murky water in turbid water imagine Sun setting in murky water unscientific that a big word used here is it is watch other meaning it appeared to zul qarnain and not a William Campbell knows Arabic so why do that means if you look upon additionally also it means it appeared so allah subhana wa ta'ala is describing what appeared to zul qarnain if i make a statement that the student in the class said two plus two is equal to five and you see Ozaki is a two plus two equal to five I didn't say I'm telling the student in my class that two plus two is equal to five I'm not wrong the student is wrong there are various ways to try and unless this verse one is this way according to Mohammed Assad that was Adam is it appeared - it appeared to zul qarnain point number two the Arabic word used is Maghreb it can be used for time as well as place when we say sunset sunset can be taken for time if I say the sunsets at 7:00 p.m. I'm using it for time if I say the Sun sets in the west it means I'm taking it for place so here if you use the word Maghreb for time so Zulu can name not reach that place of sunset use it at time he reached at the time of sunset the problem is solved furthermore you can solve it in various ways even if dr. William Campbell says no no the basic assumption is too much it is not appear to it is actually this let's analyze it further the Quranic verse says the Sun set in murky water now we know when we use these words like sunrise and sunset does the Sun Rise scientifically Sun does not rise neither of the sunset we know scientifically the Sun does not set at all it is the rotation of the earth which gives rise to sunrise and sunset but yet you read every live in the papers mentioning sunrise at 6:00 a.m. sunset at 7:00 p.m. oh the newspapers are wrong one scientific if I use the word disaster oh there's a disaster disaster means there's some calamity which has taken place literally disaster means and even start so when I say build disaster everyone know what I mean the calamity not about the evil star not - William Campbell and I know when a person was mad we call him a lunatic yes or no at least I do and I believe dr. William Campbell also will be doing that you call a person a lunatic he's mad what is the meaning of lunatic it means struck by the moon but that did how the language had evolved similarly sunrise is actually it is just a usage of word and Allah has given the guidance for the human beings also he used it so that we understand so it is just certainly not that he's actually sitting not the Sun is actually rising so this explanation clearly gives us a clearer picture that the verse of the Quran of Sarika half chapter 18 verse the middie 6 is not in contradiction with established science that is the way how people speak he quoted surah Furqan several 25 verse 45 46 that the shadow lengthens and prolong its we can make it stationary the Sun is its guide and in his book he mentions does the Sun move where does this verse say the Sun moves in surah Furqan chapter 25 verse 45 46 doesn't say the Sun moves and he writes in his book we were taught in elementary school and he said that also in his talk that it is due to the rotation of the earth that the shadow prolongs and gets small but what the Quran says the Sun is its guide today even a person who has not gone to school knows that shiner due to sunlight even a layman who has not gone to school knows that shadow is due to sunlight so Quran is perfectly right it doesn't say the Sun moves and the shadow has caused he's putting his own words in the Quran Sun is its guide its guiding the shadow without sunlight you cannot have shadow yes you can I've shared with all the light it's a different thing but yeah it's referring to the shadow which you see which is moving for longing and becoming sharp for a William Campbell spoke about Solomon's death sorry sabha chapter 34 verse number 12 to 14 and said that imagine a person standing on the stick and he dies and no one comes to know etc there are various ways to explain why number one Solomon peace be upon him you are the prophet of God and it can be a miracle when Bible says that Jesus Christ peace be upon him could give life to the dead see this guy was born of a virgin but which is more difficult to imagine being born of a virgin birth giving life to the dead or standing on a stick for a very long time which is more difficult so when God can do miracles through Jesus Christ peace be upon him why can't he do a miracles to Solomon in the salam musa alehsalaam party to see he threw a big stick became sneak Bible says that Quran says that God can do that why can't God let a man rest for a long period anyway I give him various different answers nowhere does the Quran say that Suleiman s-salam rested on the stick for very long period no what does it say it just says that animal may be some say and maybe other animal of the earth came and bit many possible maybe not Suleiman s-salam was just dead and any animal may have shook the stick and Solomon Osama has fallen down but I assume i use the conflict approach with the quran because irrespective whether you use the conflict approach or the Concordat approach the ayah i quoted in the beginning of my talk surah nisa chapter 4 verse 8 who says after lies at the brunel quran well how can i mean in the gorilla lovers you defeat the elephant cathedra do they not consider the quran' with care had it been for many one besides allah' there would have been many contradictions irrespective whether you use the conflict approach or the company's approach if you are logical you will not be able to take out a thing a verse of the Quran which is contradicting neither a single verse which is against established signs I agree with dr. William Campbell that polymer Salam stood for a long time the answer is given the same verse that after Solomon Saddam fell down the Jin said that if you had known that Solomon peace be upon him died we wouldn't have told so hard indicating that even the jinns don't have ilma gap they don't have knowledge of the unseen brother Jin thought themselves a very great while life treating them that even they don't have in Miguel the William Campbell touched on the production of milk infra a chapter 16 verse 66 the first person who told about the circulation of blood within the feasts 600 years after the Revolution the Quran and 408 Octavian a feast with him how he made it coming to the Western world that's 1,000 years after the relation various Quran the food you eat go into the intestine and from the intestine the food constituents reach the various organs via the bloodstream many a time via the portal system of liver and it even reaches the mammary gland which is responsible for production of milk and Quran gives this information of modern science in a nutshell insulin the hell's up with 16 verse 66 verses that verily in the cattle a lesson for you we give you drink from what is within the body coming from a conjunction between the constituent of the interest time and blood milk which is purer for you to have hamdulillah what we came to know recently just recently in science means 50th back hannelius back quran mentions this information for 10 years ago and repeat this message in surah mama noon chapter 23 verse 21 but a william campbell raised the point about animal living in community the quran says in surah anaam chapter 6 verse 38 we have created every animal that lives on the earth and every bird that side in the air to live in communities like you and our william campbell says you know the spider kills the mate and and the father etc do be killed and the lion does that an elephant does that he's talking about the behavior the Quran is not referring to behavior if dr. William Campbell cannot understand the Quran that does not mean Quran is wrong the Quran says they live in communities talking about the animals and the bird live in groups in societies like the human means it's not talking about behavior and today science tells that all the animals the birds and the living creatures of the world they live in communities like the human mimi they live together and I didn't have time to touch on all the points on embryology I've touched on all of you the eight nine topics which he spoke on embryology I'll go more in detail the point we raised in embryology besides the one I clarified in my talk he said that the stages of development were mentioned by Hippocrates and by gallon and he showed the various slides the point to be noted just because someone says some things which are matching with the Quran that doesn't mean that Quran has been copied from that suppose I make a statement suppose if I make a statement which is correct which was said by somebody else earlier that doesn't mean have copied it may be it may not be to use the conflict approaches the Quran yes you copy okay fine but let's analyze the Quran doesn't take the things which were wrong from Hippocrates if you will have copied you would have copied everything it is logical unless he's a scientist okay this is correct oh this is wrong I won't copy that this is correct I'll copy that all the stages of Hippocrates and Galen is not the same as the Quran Hippocrates and Galen doesn't speak about leasetech substance they don't speak about moosegal at all maybe they speak he progresses and gynae and that time they said that even the women have got semen who say that even the Bible said that if you read in the Bible it's mentioned in Leviticus step number 12 was not one to two that women give out seed so actually Bible if copying from your pockets and Bible says in job Bible says in job chapter number 10 most number nine and ten that we have made them in me from clay like poured out milk and curdled cheese poured out milk and curdled cheese is the exact Pledger evasion from Hippocrates my pleasure ization because surely that's not the Word of God that portion is unscientific it first said my pocket is and gallon the grease that remained meals are created like curdled cheese and Bible copy that exactly but Quran al hamdulillah as if you and I read the book Scientology even of dr. Keith mode he said that he poked at this and the other people like Garen etc they did give a lot of think embryology initially I feel a distorted many were right many of our wrong and further he goes to say in the Middle Ages or at the time of the Arabs the Quran speaks about something additional if it was exactly copied why would dr. Keith Moore in his book give due credit to the Quran he even gives due credit to a distorted who poked at it but mentioned there many were wrong daddy Devin mentioned with the Quran that is enough proof that Quran wasn't copied from the Greek time regarding light of the moon ladder of the moon was copied from leaks you will tell me that the world is fair it was covered from Greeks I know the pythagoras the Greeks lived in sixth century BC who believe that the earth rotated they believed that the sunlight was reflected if Prophet Muhammad knows Billa copied why didn t copy they believe the Sun was stationary they believed Sun was the center of the universe so why did Prophet Muhammad copy the correct things and delete the things which were not correct this is sufficient proof that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon did not copy he goes to give a list that from Greek to Syria Syria to Arabic and big research one statement of the Quran is sufficient disproved the Quran says in Sri Lanka booth chapter 29 verse number 48 that how was not able to recite any book before this know was now able to stand scribe with the right hand if it was so the talk of the vanity would have surely doubted the Prophet was that domi he was an illiterate this fact of history is sufficient to prove the he didn't plagiarize from anywhere enough imagine even a scientist who very literate cannot do this thing but Allah and His divine guidance made the last prophet ever known me so that the Tahoes of like people who write books against Islam they cannot open their mouths the Prophet Azumi there are various things that I can continue speaking on the Bible I have covered up all his arguments against Quran hamdulillah not a single point to prove Quran is against science he has not touched on 22 points of mine touched on - not proven so all trying to get proof that Bible is incompatible modern science point number 23 in the field of zoology in the field of zoology it is mentioned in Leviticus chapter number 11 verse number 6 that hair is a culture we know that hair doesn't look at previously peoples thought by the movement of the hair now we know hair is not a culture neither does it have a compartmentalized stomach it's mentioned in the proverbs chapter number 6 was number 7 that ant has got no ruler north here no chief today we know that ants are sophisticated insect they have a very good system of labor in which their chief therefore men their workers they even f queen they may have a ruler therefore Bible is unscientific furthermore it's mentioned in the Bible in Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 and Isaiah chapter 65 verse number 25 that serpents eat dust no zoological book says open leaders which mentions Book of Leviticus chapter 11 verse number 20 among the abomination things falls with four feet they are an abomination and some scholars say that follow the wrong translation of the Hebrew word of in King James it should be in fact a winged creature and a New International Version it's a real creature but it says all insects which are four footed are an abomination they are detestable for you I want to answer to William Campbell which insects have got four feet even a student who has passed elementary school knows that in fact I've got six feet there is no bird in the world there is no fowl in the world there is no insect in the world which I've got four feet furthermore there are mythical animals and fabulous animals mention the Bible as though they exist for example unicorn it's mentioned in the book of Isaiah chapter 34 verse number 7 talking about unicorn as it exists look up and additionally it says the animal which has got a horse's body and a horn which is only available in myths my time is over only I'd like to tell that apologize ever heard the feelings of any Christians that was not my intention it was just a reply to dr. William Campbell book to prove that Quran is compatible with science and Bible though portions we do consider maybe the world of God completely not the world of God it's not in conciliation and I would like to end my talk with the coalition of the glorious quran from surah chapter 17 verse 11 which says local Jogja kawasaki battle in the la batalla con azúcar when truth in halogen falsehood falsehood parishes for falsehood is by snitch about to perish worid r1r hamdulillah rabbul aalameen there are certain people who try and reconciliate and say that the sixth day is mentioned in the Bible it actually refers to epochs like the Quran wrong period not 624 days it's illogical you read the Bible evening morning it clearly states 24 it indicates but even if I use the Conchords approach no problem I agree with your illogical argument yet they will only be able to solve the first scientific error of security excretion and second that first delight and third the earth the remaining four yet they cannot solve some for the say that if it's a twenty four period why can't the vegetable survive for one twenty four day without sunlight if they're fine if you say that the vegetables were created before the Sun and can survive for one twenty four day I have got no objection but you can't say that day is mentioned are twenty four as well as epochs you can't have the cake and eat it both if you say it is the long period use for point number one and three the remaining four are yet day if you say that these are 24 days you solve only point number five the remaining five are yet there it becomes non scientific I leave it dr. William Campbell whether he wants to say it is long period and say that there are only four scientific errors or say it in the twenty four days and still the only five scientific errors in the creation of the universe regarding the concept of Earth there are various scientists who have described how is the world end hypothesis some may be right some may be wrong but either the world will perish or the world will live forever both cannot take place simultaneously it's unscientific but this is exactly what the Bible says it's mentioned in the Bible in the book of Hebrews chapter 1 verse number 10 11 and the Book of Psalms chapter number 102 was number 25 and 20 fixed that Almighty God created the heavens and the earth and they will perish exactly opposite is mentioned in the book of Exodus this is chapter 1 verse number 4 and the Book of Psalms chapter number 78 verse number 69 that the earth will abide forever I leave it to dr. William temple to choose which of the two verses unscientific the first pair or the second pair one has to be unscientific both cannot take place the world cannot abide forever as well as perish it's unscientific regarding the heavens the Bible says in job chapter 26 verse 11 that the pillars of the heaven will tremble quran stresses we'll look man chapter 31 verse number 10 that the heavens are without any pillars don't you see don't you see the heavens without any pillars Bible says heaven has got pillars not only do the heavens I've got pillars Bible says in the first book of Samuel chapter number 2 verse number 8 as well as the book of Job chapter number 9 was him a six and The Book of Psalms chapter number 75 verse number three that even though out have got pillars in the field of diet and nutrition let's and live what does the Bible say the Bible says in the book of Genesis chapter number one verse number 29 that God has given you all the hobs bearing seeds the trees bearing fruits those that bear seed have meat for you New International Version says the seed-bearing plant and the trees bearing fruit bearing seeds are food for you all of them today even a layman knows that there are several poisonous plants like wild berries strychnine datura plants containing alkaloid oleander Buckeye poit that which if you ingest if you eat their high possibility may die how come the creator of the universe and human beings doesn't know that if you have this plant you will die I hope dr. William Campbell doesn't give this vegetarian diet to his patients the Bible has a scientific test how to identify a true believer it's mentioned in the Gospel of Mark chap number 16 verse number 7 18 it says that there will be signs for true believers and among the signs in my name they shall cast out Devils they shall speak foreign tongues new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink deadly poison they shall not be harmed and when they place their hand over the sick they shall be cured this is a scientific test in scientific terminology it's known as the confirmatory test for a true Christian believer in the past 10 years of my life I have personally interacted with thousands of Christians including missionary I have not come across a single Christian who has passed this confirmatory test of the Bible I have not come across a single Christian who took poison I am not come across any who took poison and was not died and in scientific terminology this is also called as a falsification test that means if a false person dies and does this test takes poison he'll die and a false person will not dare attend this test if you are not a true Christian believer you will not dare attend this test because you try and attempt the falsification test you will fail so a person who's not a true Christian believer will never attempt this test I have read the book the Quran the Bible in the light of history and science written by dr. William Campbell and I assume that he is a true Christian believer and at least I would like him to confirm to me about the falsification test [Applause] please be rest assured please be rest assured I will not ask dr. William Campbell to have deadly poison because I don't want to jeopardize the debate what I'll do I will only ask him to speak in foreign tongues in new languages and as many of you may be aware that India is a land which has more than thousand languages and dialects only thing I request him is to say these three words 100 rupees in the 1700 Fisher languages there are only 17 official language in India and to make it easier for dr. William Campbell I've got a 100 rupee note and this has all the 17 languages mentioned here besides English and Hindi I will help him I'll give him a beginning x4 rupiah in India the remaining 15 languages are you I request him to read I know the test says they will speak foreign languages on their own without help of reading but I want to make the test easier I want to see someone passing the test I have not seen anyone so if we can't say it on his own or from his memory at least read it I don't mind I will accept it and I request the chairperson to give it dr. William Campbell he has reported 15 languages XO rupiah three words only what does the Bible say regarding hydrology Bible says in Genesis chapter number nine verse number 13 to 17 that after God at the time of Noah's submerged the world by flood and after the flood subsides he said I put up a rainbow in the sky as a promise to the humankind never to submerge the world again by water to the unscientific person it may be quite good or in boys the sign of Almighty God never to submerge the world by flood again but today we know very well that rainbow is due to the refraction of sunlight with rain or mist surely there may have been thousands of rainbows before the time of nor will be upon him to say it was not there before Noah's time you have to assume that the law of refraction did not exist which is unscientific in the field of medicine the Bible says in the Book of Leviticus chapter 14 verse number 40 hundred fifty-three it gives a normal way for disinfecting a house from plague of leprosy disinfecting a house from plague of leprosy it says that take two birds kill one bird take wood scarlet hyssop and the other living bird dip it in water and under running water later on sprinkle the house seven times with it sprinkle the house with blood to disinfect against plague of leprosy we know blood is a good media of germ bacteria as well as toxin I hope doctor William Campbell doesn't use this method or disinfecting the OT the operation theater it's mentioned in the Book of Leviticus chapter 12 was the one to five and we know medically that after a mother gives birth to a child the postpartum period it is an eye genic to say it's unclean religiously I've got no objection but Leviticus chapter number 12 verses 1 to 5 says that after woman gives birth to a male child she will be unclean for seven days and the period of uncleanness will continue for 33 days more if she gives birth to a female child she'll be unclean for two weeks and the period of uncleanness will continue for 63 days in short if a woman gives birth to a male child a son she is unclean for forty days if she gives birth to a female child a daughter she's unclean for today's or glide or to William Campbell to explain to me scientifically how come a woman remain unclean for double the period if she gives birth to a female child as compared to a male child the Bible also has a very good test for adultery how come to know a woman has committed adultery in Book of Numbers chapter 5 verse number 11 231 I'll just say in brief it says that the priest should take holy water in a vessel take that from the floor and put it into the vessel and that's the bit of water and after cursing it give it to the woman and if the woman has committed adultery after she drinks it the curse will enter her body the stomach will swell the thigh will rot and she shall be cursed by the people if the woman has not committed adultery she will remain clean and she will bear the seed a normal method of identifying whether a woman has committed adultery or not you know today in the world there are thousands of cases pending in different parts of the world in different courts of law only on the assumption that someone has alleged that the woman has committed adultery I had read in the newspapers and I came to know from the media that the president of this great country mr. Bill Clinton he was involved in a sex scandal about two years back I wonder that why didn't the American code use this bit about to test fire adultery he would have gone scot-free mmediately why didn't the Christian missionary of this great country especially those who are in the medical field like my respected author William Campbell use this bitter water test to bail out the president immediately mathematics is a branch which is closely associated with science with which you can solve problems etc there are thousands of contradiction in the Bible hundreds deal with mathematics I just touch on few of them it's mentioned in Ezra chapter number 2 verse number 1 and Naima chapter number 7 was number six of the context that when the people returned from exile from Babylon when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon many released the men from Israel they came back from captivity and the list of the people are given the list is given in Ezra chapter 2 verse number 2 to 63 and Nehemia chap number seven was number seven up to 65 the list is given with the names as well as number of people released in these 60 verses there are no less than 18 times the name is exactly the same but the number is different there are no less than 18 contradictions in less than 60 verses of these two chapters this is the list I don't have time to run through the list there are no less than eighteen different contradictions in less than 60 verses further it's mentioned in Ezra chapter number two most more 64 that the total congregation if we add up if you add up it comes to 42 thousand three hundred sixty and if you read in the Jemez chap number 7 verse number 66 they also totally the same foil two thousand three hundred and sixty but if you add up all these verses which I had to do my homeboy uses a list this is a list of Ezra this is a list of Nemea happen number two Nehemia chap number seven if you add up I had to do my homework if you add up in every step number two it doesn't come to foil 2,000 360 it comes to twenty nine thousand eight hundred eighteen and if you add up name match up number seven even there doesn't come to fall two thousand three sixty it comes to thirty one thousand and eighty nine the author of the Bible presumed to be Almighty God does not know simple addition if you give this problem even to a person who's passed elementary school he'll be able to get the right answer if you add up all the 60 versus it's so easy Almighty God II didn't know adding knows Bella if we presume that this is the Word of God for they've read in Ezra chapter number 2 verse 65 it says there over two hundred singing men and women named Mia chap number seven verse 67 there were two hundred and forty five singing men and women but they two hundred over the 245 singing men and women context is the same a mathematical contradiction it's mentioned in the second Kings Chapter number 24 verse number 8 that Georgian was 18 years old when he began to reign Jerusalem and he reigned for three months second chronicles chapter number 36 was the mind says that Georgian was eight years old when he began to reign and he reigned for three months ten days was George in 18 years when he began to reign or was he eight years old did in for three months or didn't for three months ten days father is mentioned in the first Kings chapter seven verse 26 that in Solomon's Temple in his molten sea he had two thousand butts in second chronicles chapter number four verse number five he had three thousand bars did he have two thousand bars or did he have three thousand bars that I leave it upon her william campbell decide which is correct there is a clear-cut mathematical contradiction it's mentioned in the first Kings chapter 15 verse number 33 that Basha he died in the 26th year of reign of oz' and second chronicles chapter 16 verse number 1 says that Basha invaded Judah in the 26th year of the reign of ASSA how can basa in wait 10 years after his death it's unscientific to make it easier for dr. William Campbell to answer to the point where there is I'll just mention it in brief the point that I mentioned the first point was the creation of the earth in heaven the year was one in 624 days light was there before the source of light point number 2 3 they came into existence before creation of Earth point number 4 came into existence before Sun find number 5 vegetation came into existence before sunlight point number 6 light of the Moon is its own light point number 7 the earth will it perish or will it abide forever point number 8 the earth has got pillars point number 9 the heavens have got pillars point number 10 God said you can have all plants and all vegetation including the poisonous plants point number 11 the scientific test the falsification test of mark chapter 16 verse number 17 18 point number 12 a woman remains unclean for double the period if you give birth to a daughter as compared to a son point number 13 using blood to disinfect the house I gives plague of leprosy point number 14 how do you find out the bitter water test for adultery why number 15 18 different convictions in less than 60 verses of - and near matchup number seven I didn't count them as eighteen different I've counted in the only have one why number sixteen the total is different in both the chapters point number seventeen are the two hundred singing men and women are they 245 singing men and women point number 18 was George in eighteen years old or was the eight years old when he began to rain point number nineteen did it rain for three months or three months ten days point number twenty there solomon had three thousand parts or two thousand bucks point number 21 is that Basia how could invented a ten years after his death point number 22 is almighty god he said I put up a rainbow in the sky as a promise to the humankind never to submerge the world again by water I have listed only 22 out of the hundreds available and scientific points in the Bible scientific errors and a request ought to William Campbell to answer them and irrespective where they uses the Concordat approach or the conflict approach as long as is logical he will never be able to prove scientifically all these 22 aspects I've told him we agree in Jesus Christ peace be upon him to him was revealed the injeel this is not the injeel it may contain part of god but the other unscientific portion is not the Word of God I would like to end my talk by giving the corrosion of the glorious quran from spray bottle chapter 2 verse 7 which says for by little 11f to gu- ibid him so my Apollo has Amin in Villa leaves to be his son and kalila for a lunar mimic adabot ID him of a little gnome in maxi Boone woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from Allah to traffic with it for a miserable price bow to those for what they write bow to those for what they earn Walker Dhawan are hungry Larry Bellamy [Applause] I would request our audience to bear bear with us and maintain due decorum for the continuation of the dialogue yes I'd like to post this question or rather this test to dr. William Campbell why don't you attempt the falsification test of the Bible given in the book of Mark chapter 16 verses 17 and 18 and prove to the audience here right now that you are a true Christian believer my question is just dr. zakir naik the christians explain the concept of trinity scientifically by giving the example of water which can be in three states solid liquid and gas in the form of ice water and vapor similarly one God is a trait triune God Father Son and Holy Ghost is this explanation scientifically correct the word Trinity is not in the Bible but it is in the Quran dr. lacquer you said there isn't any mistake in Quran I see more than 20 mistake in Arabic grammar and I will tell you some of them in to a cyber wound in battle and in lovina Emmanuel Levinas odd to Assad in which Assad in rather one question at the time yeah the same thing he said in 63 in vanilla Saharan mistake in the in Iran can you explain that and the book is referring to Babel Fadi abdelfattah correct is the Quran infallible can see some things yeah and Allah my head is good [Applause] dr. Campbell since you are a medical doctor could you please explain scientifically the various medical aspects that in the Bible regarding because you didn't answer them in your rebuttal for example blood used as a disinfectant bitter water test for adultery and most importantly that the woman is unclean for double the period when she gives birth to a daughter then as compared to a son okay dr. Campbell if you cannot answer the contradictions in Genesis regarding the creation don't you think that the that proves that the Bible is unscientific and therefore not from God I admit that I have some problems with this the Muslims yeah stick the Quran is far superior to Yahya stick the signs therefore you should believe in Quran which is far superior dr. Kamble agreed to dr. Naik that the errors he showed are not wrong and that he can't answer them so does this mean that dr. Campbell agrees that the Bible has errors so it's not the Word of God there are things in the Bible that I can't explain that I don't have an answer for now how can a son be two years older than the father believe me even even in Hollywood flim you will not be able to produce it [Applause]"
