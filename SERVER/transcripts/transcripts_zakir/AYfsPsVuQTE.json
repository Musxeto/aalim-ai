  "title": "What if a Muslim Makes Promises and Oaths to Allah but Fails to Keep them? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "this question from the WhatsApp njba from Bangladesh if someone promises to Allah that he will not commit such and such a sin he did that and he makes an unreal promise to Allah which he cannot keep what should he do and if a student observes three fast in the name of Allah as an experation for breaking an oath and if he hears from many that 10 poor people should be fed or clothed if he also promises Allah that he will clothe or food give clothes or food to 10 poor people for all the promises he has made to Allah in his life which he could not keep and he breaks his oath now he has to give clothes of food to 10 poor people as expiration for breaking the same oath again n for Bangladesh that if someone promises to Allah and does not keep that promise what should he do here you have to make a differentiation between a promise to Allah and oath to Allah there's two difference when you promise something it is you're telling Allah okay I will do this I will do that that's different than taking an oath if you take an oath it should have certain claws like how Allah takes an oath of fig Allah takes an O of then then of the mountains so when you take an oath you take oath of something and take it oath is of different types what Scholars say that so promises something is that okay I promise that I will do something that I promise I'll be good I'll promise I'll be truthful that's different I'm making a commitment to Allah but taking oath is different and oath normally the prophet saidah always said there are many say said that the prophet discouraged us from taking Oaths oath means you said that if I pass the examination I will go for or if I pass the examination I'll give charity of $1,000 to the poor people so this type of oath the prophet discouraged it says that taking oath does not change the it only makes a miser person give in charity so when you're taking an oath there are different types of O some Oaths which are good to take some oath which are not good to take some am the oath that if you ask and you take an oath of Allah that if so and so thing happens I will do this sort of worship it's not encouraged it's not Haram because you are putting a stipulation to Allah that okay if I pass the examination I will pray I'll go for that and if you do that act if you pass the examination it is as though you forced to do it you're not doing it out of your own free will that's one of the reason second is that as though you're battering with Allah that if my sickness is cured I will go forra if my sickness is cured I will Fast 10 days or whatever it is so the prophet said the is not changed so what is going to happen you will happen what's WR in your destiny will happen so if you take an oath with battering something with Allah it's not encouraged in Islam it's not Haram but it's not encouraged the prophet said it only makes a miser person get charity so Miser person say that okay if I get healthy I will give ,000 okay the my person doesn't give charity so at least he'll give ,000 so the prophet personally preferred give charity okay I decided I'll give charity today $1,000 very good I decid I give charity 2,000 very good but if you say I will pass then I'll give charity it's not encouraged so oath means you are Bing something if this thing happens I'll do this so these sites of oath Allah says in the Quran in Surah MAA chap number five verse number 89 that that if the oath is unintentional Allah will forgive it but if it's an intentional oath then if you do not keep it if you do not fulfill the oath give a kafar kafar mean give kafar give experation of feeding 10 poor people misk people and feed them the same way how you feed your family so if you're a rich person and you spend maybe $100 on per meal so feed 10 people with $100 each if you're a poor person who feeds maybe $1 per meal so feed 10 people with $1 or clothe 10 people same how you clo your family or free a slave so this is the condition put by Allah subhana tala in Surah ma chapter number 5 verse 9 that if it unal Allah forgive but it's intentional if it is old done by you and if you not fulfill it feed 10 people poor people how you feed your family or clothe 10 people or you free a Slave if you cannot do this then you fast for three consecutive days so if you make an oath the best the prophet said is do it as long as the oath is not a Haram oath now there are some Oaths which are Haram for example you say that I will go to D and put 10 candles on the D so this is wrong or if you say that I have taken an oath or we done commitment one is a commitment one is a promise the is the difference and if you say that if this thing happen I'll do this if this thing happen I do idol worship idol worship is Haram so anything you say if I pass the examination I will do idol worship idol worship is Haram so in these conditions if you commit if you take an oath of doing a sin then the prophet said don't do the sin give the kafar so if you have given an oath to commit a sin or given a promise to commit a sin don't do that sin do a kafar or feeding 10 people or clothing 10 people of freeing a slave if you cannot afford it then you can fast for three consecutive days there are some things which is not a sin but you can't afford to do you say that if I pass the examination I will give $10,000 charity you don't even earn $1,000 I will give $10,000 suppose you say that if I pass the exam I go for and you're sick that hell doesn't permit you so if you make an oath which you cannot fulfill it's not a Haram going to HJ is good giving 10,000 CH is good so then you give kafar that is feed 10 people four people equivalent to how you feed your family or clo 10 people or free or slave if you can't afford this then fast three consecutive so one oath with which Haram you should not do it only give kafar one oath is which you have committed but you cannot do it because you can't afford to do it or you're not healthy you don't have the money then the third type is which is muba okay if I pass I will give charity and you have the money then you give charity this is optional one thing is there which is Oaths which are good that they have asked you have said you'll do this without putting a condition to Allah subhana tala I have have committed to Allah that this year I'll give charity of $10,000 and your business goes down all is good it's not against anything it's not saying that only if this happen you have given a commitment you have given o to Allah that this thing I will do this year and your business goes down you got the intention so if you're given do and your business goes down you cannot give $10,000 okay feed 10 people can't feed 10 people CL 10 people or free a slave canot do this fast so one is something which is Haram you should not do it one is you have said something you don't have the capacity one is you had the capacity but then the business didn't go well so at that time the best is to fulfill the oath whatever oath you have given to Allah unless it's a sin unless it's Haram best is to fulfill you cannot say if you have the money your business is done very well you promised $10,000 why give $10,000 feeding 10 people will only cost me $100 cost me only $200 why give $10,000 so this is wrong the prophet said if your business is done well if you have given o fulfill the oath first if you cannot then the kafar is there or if it's a oath which is committing a sin so you have to differentiate between this so based on all this the answer is very clearcut that if you promise something if it not a you have to do it and then again the question has asked that he has made many promises he hasn't fulfilled for each promise he hasn't fulfill he has to either feed 10 people or he has to each oath that he has taken if he doesn't fulfill either feed 10 people or clo 10 people or Fe a slave or three consecu days so then if he says okay I will feed 10 people or clo 10 people or fast and he doesn't do this also so if he has not done 10 Oaths he hasn't kept and this 11th one so he has to give 11 times to 10 people you can't say only once is sufficient no if you cannot afford it at least he should fast for each oath three days so if 10 proom 10 Oaths he has taken and he has not fulfilled it then he has to fast 10 into three 30 three days you want to take a gap take a gap again three day and the last one which he did he did not fulfill again he has to fast and St is for that so for every oath that or commitment you have given to Allah subhana tala there's a difference you should understand that that I will not do a sin you're telling Allah that's different than doing an oath and a commitment so both are different so if you have given an oath and a commitment then you have to fulfill can't fulfill then is the hope that answer the question"
