  "transcript": "now inshallah we throw the floor open for the question answer session and we will take the first question the first question is from ibrahim asif from lahore pakistan assalamu alaikum we as muslims are thankful to you for your wonderful service to islam especially for broadcasting dr israel ahmed's lecture for the urdu and hindi audience his lectures on quran and global affairs are now largely being viewed these days what are your views about dr israel ahmad's quranic thought and his vision on global affair we know that you hosted him in india what did you find in his personality when you met him and finally do you agree with his ideology of political social economic system that every muslim must do struggle to establish the islamic system of government a similar question is asked by another brother by the name of asif from pakistan what are your views about dr israel ahmed how did you find him when you met him this question has been asked to be several times since the time i have launched this program as dr zakir naik regarding my views and how did i spend time with shakir madidad and dr israel but i knew that the answer is going to be long so i was trying to delay it because when i give long answers the number of questions in the program session becomes less so basically the question asked by our brothers from pakistan is what are my views regarding dr israel ahmed and what do i think about his teachings of the glorious quran and on the political social economic system as far as many of you may be aware that the person who inspired me the first and who made me change from a doctor of a body to a doctor or soul is none other than sheikh ahmadi dad and may allah grant him jannah the other personality that affected my life to a great extent besides sheikh ahmadi it is dr israel ahmed sheikh ahmed the first person when i met him in 1987 i was inspired by him and because of him i left my profession and became a full-time die the other personality which was instrumental in making me leave my profession and become a full-time die was dr israel ahmad regarding the question that i met him and what are my views regarding him the first time i met dr extra ahmad was in the year 1991 when i traveled from india to pakistan i have only been to pakistan once that is before i started giving public lectures that was in 1991 and my main reason to travel to pakistan was to meet dr israel ahmed and to see his organization after i was inspired by sheikh ahmadis i started watching many other speakers in english and also in urdu and my second most favorite speaker that i started watching video cassettes after sheik ahmadi that was dr issa and after i watched many of his video cassettes i had the desire to meet him so in 1991 i traveled from bombay to lahore and when i met him in 1991 i was impressed by his simplicity masha'allah such a great personality and i was touched by simplicity his organization that is quran academy when i went to lahore it is massive it is huge it has got many buildings and when i went to his office his office was so simple and according to me he's a stalwart masha'allah the two speakers that i feel can move the audience unlike other islamic speakers it is sheikh hamadidad and dr israel hammer even today when i watch the programs of dr israel ahmad and sheikh ahmad the moment i started hearing them it is difficult to stop the videos and even when we hear a short clip we are moved by the way they speak both of them alhamdulillah they are excellent orators and i feel in english language one of the best orators that we have in the islamic field is sheikh ahmadidad and in the urdu language one of the best orators that i know of it is dr israel alhamdulillah they apply excellence when i met him personally he asked me that why have you come to pakistan so i told them number one is to meet your doctor and to see organization and alhamdulillah then he asked me that what am i doing so i told him i've just passed my bbs i'm doing my internship and i intend doing my post graduation most probably in surgery and i told him that i've been inspired by shaykh and i would like to be a guy and a doctor both and my intention was to be a part-time die so he said that do you want to do as a die part-time omaha i said no i would like to do both maybe equal maybe later on after i finish my master's i would like to do both equally equally good in both i would like to be so dr israel replied that beta that is beta means sun in urdu he said son i tried to excel in both even i'm a medical doctor and as you may be aware that dr estrada the doctor in front of his name is of a medical doctor not a phd doctor like me he told for seven years i did medical practice and i tried to do both then i realized that if you want to excel you have to choose one you cannot excel in both so my son you'll have to decide whether you want to be an excellent doctor or excellent thai and that statement of dr israel really changed my future initially as you know that i was going through my post graduation so i requested my parents that i started this organization islamic research foundation now because it is internship i'm more free so i'm giving more time more than 50 of my time and once i start doing my post graduation when you're doing your master's in the medical field you have to be a resident doctor and you have to stay at the hospital maybe you can come home for a few hours a week so i thought when i get that half a day free or some hours free every week i will spend two hours for dawa in the organization every week so my initial plan was when we launched the islamic research foundation because it was internship i was like more than 50 of my time i had the time i requested my parents that once i start doing my master's i will give two hours every week after being dr israel ahmed and hearing from his past experience it is very important that when we hear the stalwarts the scholars and those who allah have given nyama we have to learn from them and when i returned back home then i decided that i have to choose between the two i chose to become a doctor because i wanted to serve humanity and after meeting sheikh ahmad dida then dr israel i realized that there is a better profession to serve humanity and that is the profession of a die as allah says in the quran in surah facility chapter 41 verse number 33 allah says who is better in speech than one who invites to the way of thy lord who works righteousness and says that i'm a muslim so then i decided later on before i finished my internship that i would not do my masters because when i do my masters in medicine i would be more involved in the medical profession and that would give me less time for dawah so i started practicing in my father's clinic and we had a diagnostic center so i told my parents i want to do 50 50 both not two hours a week dhawa and drink 50 percent for the hour and 50 medical practice and both my parents they agreed with whatever i said during internship asked me more than 50 of my time when i started at the diagnostic center and in the medical clinic though i said i'll give 50 for my medical practice even that time i was giving more than 50 for my dhawa and then i told my parents i want to give 75 percent for dhawa and 25 for medical practice they said no problem and after a couple of years i told them that i want to give full time for dawah and alhamdulillah both my parents were very welcoming they were very supportive including my brother including my sisters alhamdulillah so that's how my journey from a doctor of body to a doctor of soul in a span of just a couple of years not that it was very long and then al hamdulillah i was giving full time for dawah when i met dr israel in 1991 he told me one thing beta son if you want to be a successful die see to it that you make your needs and requirements to the bare minimum so i asked him that why what my requirement got to do with becoming a guy he told me that if you make your requirements and your needs to the bare minimum you will not be dependent on this so that when inshallah later on you become effective no one will be able to twist your arm because they need the less so you will not be tempted to give fatwas or give statements which are not correct since your needs are less you would not be bothered about the worldly things you will be more bothered about and this point of dr estrada ahmed that make your needs bare minimal really stuck into my mind and i made the policy alhamdulillah by the grace of allah my father my parents were very well off alhamdulillah so in the initial stages of dawa they were fully supporting me and my brother told me that i can continue and there is no problem at all i need not worry about my livelihood when i married in 1993 that is two years after meeting dr ahmad and passing my mbbs i told my wife that i can promise you minimum four thousand rupees a month four thousand rupees at that time i think the rate was about somewhere close to 40 rupees so it was a hundred dollar i told my wife that if you want to marry me don't marry me because i'm a doctor or because i belong to a rich family i can promise you 4 000 rupees a month and that time my wife she had passed a masters she was doing m fill and she was teaching in a college and her salary was much more than four thousand i promised a four thousand minimum but alhamdulillah i gave a little bit more so this was my view and this was the impact of dr israel and then later on mashallah when i started doing my own business spending a few hours every week or maybe one or two days in a month during holidays allah blessed me and masha'allah learning capacity was much more than my parents much more than my brother and i stole millions of dollars a year so much so that i could even afford a rolls royce but the guidance of dr israel that make your life simple was stuck in my mind that's the reason i thought to it that the car i owned was not a very glamorous car i remember we had a second and sumo and in the year 2000 and i think 10 it was somewhere close to that when i decided to buy a car we had a shura in the family maximum i thought i could buy was a toyota innova that was in 2010 if i'm not mistaken because more than that would not suit my personality i personally thought it would be extravagant though the amount i used to earn alhamdulillah i could even afford a rolls royce at that time the guidance of dr issa ahmad was there in my mind and till today more than 10 years have passed i it own a toyota innova when i came to malaysia i said i want to maintain the standard and where i lived in bombay i lived in a three bedroom apartment and when my guests used to come some of my friends who are billionaires when they used to come to my house they used to get shocked and what is the problem say such a small apartment i took on marshall it's very big me my wife and three children in bombay it was about 800 square feet that carpet area it was big which is so small for me it was big even in malaysia i'm staying in a three bedroom apartment the carpet would be somewhere a thousand square feet the built-up area is 1200 square feet and i feel it is big not that i cannot afford and malaysia the apartments are very cheap maybe one-tenth the cost of bombay so if i have to purchase cost wise i could have taken a 10 times bigger apartment the cost of bombay apartments are much higher but i stuck to that advice of dr israel that make your requirement is very minimal even today i feel masha'allah the apartment i'm living in is very comfortable for me and my wife and my three children it's very big other than me call it small so my lifestyle alhamdulillah was mainly based on that one advice of dr estrada ahmed and that has done wonders to me especially when i took hijra from india to malaysia and all the things changed we did not find any difficulty because we never let any luxury creep into our life so the life falls very good harmony in fact the life in malaysia is much happier much more comfortable than what it was in india even after all these difficulties so this advice of dr ishtar emma to make your life simple i have even given to my children that see to it that your requirements your daily living requirements is bare minimal and in bombay 2 the monthly expenditure of my personal family was very low and even here as i mentioned in bombay it was close to five hundred dollars even here me and my wife living per month is only two thousand drinking which is about 500 yes there are other expenses of when traveling that's different that's a large amount you pay on tickets we stay in the hotel ourselves that comes under our expenses and when i met dr israel and i told him that i want to purchase hundred percent all your video tips that you have you said what are you going to do with it i said we are making a library which is going to be the largest video library in the world i don't want to watch as many video cassettes of yours so we picked up somewhere close to 150 200 cassettes from his lahore center after a few days i went to the karachi center and we picked up another 150 200 cassettes from karachi center that was 1991 then two years later i went to chicago and picked up all the video cassettes then i went to his center in new york i picked up all his video cassettes so finally when i told him i have several hundreds of videotapes he told me you have the largest collection of mine under one roof so we had the largest collection of doctor israel rahman's video cassettes under one roof more than his own center his cassettes were divided in different centers i collected all his english cassettes all his video concerts and we made it open to the public library and then we had the largest collection of video cassettes in the world which were more than five thousand of which i think four five hundred were only of dr xlarim and later on we invited dr israel hamad to bombay for a lecture tour and he being a pakistani to have a public lecture of a pakistan in india you know it's difficult so alhamdulillah we used our political contacts we got the visa especially visa to give lectures and he came to india in 2004 if i'm not mistaken that is about two years before the launch of the peace tv english and alhamdulillah he stayed for a couple of weeks and alhamdulillah i was always with him most of the time that he was awake i was there at a service he stayed in our apartment and we shifted to the parents apartment so that we could give the full apartment to him and his simplicity was mashaallah striking and i observed him closely how did he live his life mashallah with simplicity and certain things i found though i was very young and i observed certain things and i asked him some personal questions also i won't go to the details i just asked him and i told him that this particular act that you're doing it is not according to the hanife school of thought so he said yes beta my parents are hanafi so generally i follow the 100 ruling but when i do research and when i come to know that there is difference of opinion and if the opinion of any other imam is correct i follow that i base my following on quran sunnah but when i don't do research because my parents are hanafi i follow the hanafi fix but if i do research on any particular topic i follow that which is ask for quran and sunnah after my research and that point also was very important for me and alhamdulillah his simplicity was striking and when we called him mashallah we had his program in bombay in a large open ground where he was reluctant he's saying how can i give a lecture an open ground i said we're expecting a large audience so no auditorium has this capacity the largest auditorium in bombay is only three thousand capacity and we're expecting more than ten thousand people so finally agreed but i told him don't worry inshallah the microphone system would be excellent and you will not have a problem you are wondering that maybe he won't be able to speak in the open ground and alhamdulillah the program was very successful we had all 10 days in one venue in the ymca open ground where we had more than 10 000 audience mashaallah for all the 10 days alhamdulillah it was a very successful program and at that time we used whatever ability we had because at that time also we were very small as compared to later on when we started the pitch tv to the best of ability that time we used the best of technology the best of cameras at that time which is nothing compared to later on when we started peace tv and till today alhamdulillah the best recording of dr espar ahmad that he has done in his life is when he came to bombay and when we recorded the public programs and even according to his son and yet masha'allah close to a son brother who handles the media and those programs are yet masha'allah in terms of technical aspects and those programs were one of our main attractions on the peace tv ortho i can speak for us together on whether it be sheikh ahmad or dr israel i can speak ask together but this is a question answer session i'll just mention one of the points that the question opposed that what are my views regarding the lectures of dr israel and about his teachings of glorious quran and particularly the political socio-economic system and should we muslims be involved in establishing the islamic government as i told you that he was par excellence he is mashallah one of the best urdu orators that i know that i've heard in my life alhamdulillah power his modulation alhamdulillah his urdu is a little bit high otherwise alhamdulillah in terms what i was attracted the doctor is his speech is mainly i would say broadly it can be classified into three types of course given on various topics imagine we have more than 500 video cassettes office each of average about three hours so imagine 1 500 hours his speeches mainly are about how to improve oneself individually secondly that is the society and third is the political socioeconomic system or establishing the islamic government broadly into three types at that time when i met dr sarah ahmed that is more than 15 years back at that time i was mainly hearing his lectures which were talking about one's own self about taheed about shirk about nefar oh these topics were fantastic and about how can we implement how can we improve the society and so on and so forth regarding his lectures on politics i did not really pay much attention to that because i am a person who was away from politics and i mean now i'm away from politics so basically i did not really watch many of his lectures on politics i heard very few and because that was in my field and the lectures were many i heard the other lectures and i was impressed now lately when i hear speeches talking about what's happening in the world global scenario it is phenomenal i would say that the foresight that dr esra ahmad had regarding the political scenario particularly regarding islam is alhamdulillah it is notable and very few people had that foresight imagine in the 1990s i met up in 91 and if you hear speeches of 92 93 94 at that time he was talking about how the hindutva would take over india if we hear his speeches in the late 90s or the mid 90s he spoke that time when there was no scope people didn't think that bgp would rule india at that time he said wait till these people come they're very organized they spoke about rss he spoke about the hindu agenda they will take over india then they will go and take over other countries and the far side that he had is phenomenal and now when we hear we are shocked he is talking about the jewish lobby talking about israel how are the muslim countries behaving how they should behave now when we hear now because after i've left india i'm more exposed to the global situation of islam than when i was in india i was aware of the global system but now i'm more involved and i'm more aware of the global situation and today when we hear the speeches of dr israel ahmed which are given in mid-90s and late 19th it is phenomenal the fourth side that he had his knowledge on the deen on the quran and his examples masha'allah the tafsir is on the quran it is par excellent and after he left india i told him personally that can you do me a favor he said what favor why don't you record your program with a better camera so he said beta i'm not so much into this field this is not my cup of tea my thing is to give lecture so then marshall at that time i think it was in 2000 we gifted him high definition cameras and told him that you should record on these cameras will be very thankful and because of that we gave a new series of suffering of pseudo quran saying that because dr zakir naik suggested i am recording again on a better format and because of that mashallah now today we have this program on a better format and alhamdulillah his son assaf amid who is in charge of the media he saw to it that he kept on upgrading and that's the reason when we started showing the programs of dr extra remote before he came to bombay we used to show on the cable network and we told him we are showing on the cable tv the hundreds of thousands of people watching so if you have a better recording you'll have better impact and better reach and more sava and when he came to india that time we had no plans of peace tv urdu at all a peace tv network over 0.2 years later and urdu was launched in 2009 that is more than five years after i left once peace tv urdu was launched i requested dr extra ramen that it's difficult for him to come back to india again because of the political situation between india and pakistan so i told him that i will arrange your programs to be recorded in egypt so i said beta sun egypt i will not feel at home hardly there will be any pakistanis how will i give lecture i like order in front of me so then first time i didn't agree then i saw to it i did my survey i contacted some pakistani then i told him inshallah when you give your speech in a studio it will be a big studio there will be at least 50-100 pakistanis in the studio who you will be addressing to so you will not feel fish out of water so finally agreed and we planned that inshallah we will have the recording i think it was the year 2010 if i'm not mistaken yes 2010 it was in the month of may that we had planned that we will call him in egypt and stay for one month but allah has his own plans it was planned six months to eight months in advance that is going to come but two months before he could come to i think one month or two months before he would come to egypt allah subhanahu ta'ala called him to himself and he expired and we did not have dr islam any longer so it was a loss for the ummah and a loss for me especially and a loss even for the peace to you urdu but we pray to allah that me he grant him jannah jennifer dos in the company of the beloved prophet muslim his foresight was exceptional regarding do i agree with his view that there should be an establishment of the islamic system in the world anyone who has the basic knowledge of the deen but natural if you have to follow islam on the whole then we have to follow islam completely you can't just follow one part of islam so what he spoke about the economic system like it should be an interesting economy i agree with it the social system i agree with it the political system kalafa i agree with it and that's what is mentioned in the glorious quran if you read the quran allah says in the quran in no less than three different places in surah chapter number nine verse number 33 in surah chapter number 48 verse number 28 and surah 7 chapter number 61 verse number 9 allah says that allah sent his messenger with guidance and religion of truth so that it will prevail over all the other religions over all the other isms whether it be christianism hinduism buddhism judaism socialism whether it be communism atheism islam is destined to suppose it all master them all and allah ends the verse by saying well of course however much the mushrik don't like it in two places and one place allah says wakafa will i say and enough is the lies of witness now this verse of the quran says that islam will prevail over the full world and when we read the the signs of the r and on my facebook i have just completed the major signs the minor signs were there minus signs that already occurred more than 40 minus signs not yet occurred more than 40 both put together approximately 87 have given and major signs are 10. i just recently finished all the 10 major signs and now i'm giving a summary of all these signs and in these times it says that inshallah islam will come imam will come and we muslims will rule the full world for seven years and when we rule this world we'll be following the islamic nisa whether you like it or not whether the mushrik like it or not the full world would be ruled there will be imam mehdi it will be and that would be the best rule in the full world for seven years with peace and justice so this is the prophecy of a beloved prophet it is mentioned in the hadith allah has given in the quran and then the hadith says that after seven years of rule they will be sweet to wind that will come and will put to death all the believers every moment even if it goes in the mountain that wind will come and they will peacefully die after that the kyama would come the sun would rise from the place of setting rise from the west there will be a fire which will gather all the people towards the place of gathering and that would be the end of the world for more details you can watch my facebook post so but natural inshallah whatever doctor is said it's surely going to happen it's given in the quran it's given in the hadith that finally the muslim will rule the world and that would be the best rule with peace and with prosperity this was in brief regarding my views about doctors otherwise i could speak for hours together and may allah grant him jonathan we grant him a place in jannah close to the ambiance close to hamas allah sallam and close to the khulafar shadeen and the sabbath amen"
