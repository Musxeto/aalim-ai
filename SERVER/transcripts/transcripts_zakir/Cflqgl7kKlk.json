  "transcript": "in the field of genetics today we have come to know that it is the sperm which is responsible for determining the sex of the child and today science tells us that the 23rd pair of chromosomes in the human being it determines the sex of the child if it's xx it's a female if it's xy then it's a male so it is the sperm which is responsible for determining the sex if the x of the sperm takes part in the fertilization then a female is born if the why takes part then the male is born and this is exactly what the quran says in surah najam chapter number 53 verse number 45 and 46 that we have created the human being from a minor quantity of liquid which is ejaculated minor quantity of liquid ejaculated means it has to be a male fluid the similar message is repeated in foreign chapter number 75 verse number 37 to 39 that we have created the human being from a minor quantity of sperm not foreign we have created the human being from minor quantity of sperm then made it into an alaka and made the kind of mudga and gave it sex male and female so the quran says that the sperm is responsible for the sex of the child whether it's male or female in this country of us this great country india for reasons known best to the indians in india mainly most of the people they prefer having sons rather than daughters and if a lady gives birth to a daughter very often the mother-in-law she will blame the daughter-in-law that why did you give birth to a daughter according to the science and the quran if the mother-in-law has to blame anyone she should not blame the daughter nor she should blame the son because it is the male fluid which is responsible for discipline the sex of the child male or female actually it's in the hands of allah he is the one who makes it male or female but if the mother has to blame anyone she should blame the son because he is responsible for sex of the child male or female"
