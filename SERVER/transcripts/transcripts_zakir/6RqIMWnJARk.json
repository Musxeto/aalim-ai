  "title": "Does the Quran specifically speak about Hinduism? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum one of my friends want to ask you this question is there any line or word which mentioned in quran about hinduism like jews and christian brothers has the question that is there any verse in the quran which speaks about hinduism like it speaks about judaism and christianity i don't know of any verse there's no verse in the quran we specifically mentioned about hinduism like it does about christianity and about judaism but quran says in surah chapter number 13 verse number 38 quran says in every age every century revelation by name only four revolutions are mentioned in the quran torah zaboor and the quran torah is the vahi the revelation given to moses peace be upon him the revelation given to david peace be upon him angel is the revelation given to jesus christ peace be upon him and quran is the revelation given to prophet muhammad peace be upon him but there were many other revelations besides these four books for example ibrahim if you ask me can you consider veda the word of god i say i don't know because there's no verse in the quran which says veda was a revelation from god there's no hadith of the prophet which says veda is the word of god so what i say maybe it is maybe it is not i don't know i'm not saying for sure it is but even if it was the word of god even if it was the word of god all the revelation that came before the quran they were meant for a particular group of people and the message was to be followed till the next revelation came so even if veda was the word of god it was meant only for those people and for that time but quran since is the last and final revelation from almighty god it was not meant only for the muslims or the arabs it was meant for the whole of humanity and since it was the last revelation and no other revelation will come it is to be followed till the last day of judgment so based on this even if you agree veda was the word of god hypothetically it was meant for those people and for that time today all the human beings in the world whether they're living in india or uae or pakistan or saudi arabia or usa or canada or uk they should follow the last and final revelation of god the glorious quran and last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him [Applause]"
