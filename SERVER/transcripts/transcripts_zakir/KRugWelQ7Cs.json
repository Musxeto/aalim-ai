  "transcript": "to go to office during this pandemic should I fast as some people say that one's humidity is decreased if one's fast and there are chances that one gets covered 19. this is again doesn't have any basis that if you fast your immunity goals or in fact if you heard my uh my talk on medical benefits of fasting fasting actually boosts your immunity so in no way I'm going to am I telling you that fasting if you fast will have less chances of covid-19 but to say that if you fast you have more chances also totally wrong but it does boost your immunity so if if if it's the month of Ramadan and if there's a pandemic and you are afraid please unless if you are sick if you have covid-19 and if you have no symptoms continue fasting if you have symptoms which prevent you from fasting it may be any disease the covid-19 you cannot breathe properly or can be any other disease so if you are ill as Allah says in the Quran chapter 2 verse 184 that those who are traveling or those who are ill can fast later on and compensate so if you are ill and if that illness prevents you from fasting or makes you difficult to fast that time yes you did not fast but make it up later but because you're afraid you will get covered and this is totally not allowed fasting is the first if you are not sick it is not preventing you from fasting continue inshallah inshallah you will get get the reward and inshallah your passage will be forgiven as the prophet said that if you fast with sincerity in the month of Ramadan see in the reward of Allah all your passage will be forgiven this is the most important so my request will that you should fast"
