  "transcript": "the next question if from abdul rehman from from ue and he's asking that in most of the muslim countries because of corner virus covered 19 the shopping malls are open but the mosque are closed is it correct to keep the shopping malls open but the mas closed if I'm aware I'm not saying that all the Muslim countries are following but I'm aware that a some of the Muslim countries the shopping malls have been kept open but the mosques have been kept closed now this means if it's a country in which majority Muslims are living and you keep the shopping malls open and you take all the precautions but you say the mosque should be closed I totally disagree with this because if you can take precaution of keeping the shopping malls open by having the physical distance sing and sing good that people are part and taking all the precautions why can't you do the same in the mosque when you are allowing a person to go in a restaurant and saying that you can't sit in a restaurant but there should be limited people so very well you can limit the Miceli's in a mosque so to allow the shopping malls to be open full day that means the Muslim is out for a few hours 5 hours 10 hours 8 hours and if he and if he has no place to pray even if the masala in the shopping mall is closed then how will he pray so this is mainly because people fear that the economy of the country will go down they are more bothered about the economy of the country than our Deen for me the Dean is the most important and I said that earlier for me the major loss of the coronavirus covered 19 is the closure of the mosque the other losses are much less the biggest loss for me personally is the closure of the mosque that not allowing to that we could not pray in Jamaat in the mosque and now you're opening the malls and your clothing the masala and and your clothing the mosque this is uncalled for our Prophet peace be upon him he said that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has written the risk of all the human beings fifty thousand years before the creation of the heaven India so the risk is there already written so do you think opening the wall enclosing the mall you'll earn less money or more money it was already strained by last month Allah that you are going to earn less in this month of April already in its time you cannot change it so here in such a situation because of economic opening the mall but not opening the mosque I disagree if a non-muslim country they do it we can understand they may not understand the Deen but in in in a Muslim country when you see in the supermarket there are in the big supermarket hundreds of people the thousands of people whatever precaution you take it cannot be forward completely in a mosque at least you can take you can take better precaution that in the supermarket then in the shopping mall so allowing the shopping mall and not allowing the masajid and the masalas to be open and if agree with it"
