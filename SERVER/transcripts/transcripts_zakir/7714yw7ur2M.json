  "title": "If one Woman Sights the Moon for Ramadhaan, will her Testimony be Adopted? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "can the testimony of a woman be accepted with regards to sighting of the moon for Ramadan as far as accepting the testimony of woman for sighting of moon is concerned the difference opinion according to the hanis Hani school of thought if it's a cloudy day then the testimony of a woman can be accepted the Tes of woman can also be accepted by the humbles and one group of Shafi also accept the testimony whereas the other group of shaf they say that testimony of the woman cannot be accepted and the malakis are unanimous that testimony of woman cannot be accepted so there are two groups of Scholars one group says that it can be accepted one they say it cannot be accepted Andi may Allah have mercy on him he says that the testimony of wom cannot be accepted and he gives reasons for that he says that because the Quran says that there should be two just Witnesses and the Arabic word used in the Hadi ofi book of fasting Hadith number 2118 it says Shah so he says the woman is a Shah not a Shahid So based on that argument he says that woman testimony cannot be accepted the other group of scholar they said can be accepted and as far Arabic word is concerned that many of times when the male word is used the even woman is included so to just pick on the word and say that so the other group of Scholars say that it's not right to pick on the word and say because it's Shah a woman cannot be accepted aced and furthermore they say the group which said that wom testimony can be accepted they say that when we ask a woman that which is the direction of kah and the woman shows the direction but naturally follow it and we can ask the timings of Salah to woman if you go to foreign land that what is the timing of Salah and she tells the timing it's accepted so when we accept this why can't we accept the sighting of the Moon that's what they argue and further they argue that many of the Hadith have been narrated only by one narrator the chain of narration and a the wife of the Prophet she alone has narrated no less than 2,220 so when her alone witness is accepted even this Hadith of the sighing of the moon is Hadith of so when you can accept her narration alone so why can't we accept the Shad of the moon so this argument is very strong you know that when we can accept that when she narrated theth of sighting of the Moon and we accept the Hadith so why can't we accept when she say that she has seen the moon so the group which says that woman's testimony can be accepted is much more acceptable though there are a difference of opinion in this aspect"
