  "title": "Reply to Allegations made by Christians that Shaikh Ahmed Deedat Suffered a Stroke because he Lied.",
  "transcript": "from aya Husain Egypt many Christians Alec that sheikh hamad edad got a disease that affected his tongue because he lied about the gospel such allegations make me really upset kindly advise how to respond to such claim to tell you that shady that there was it is wrong to say disease affecting the tongue sheikh d-dad may Allah grant him Jannah rahim allah may allah have mercy on him he had a stroke in 1996 and he was paralyzed from below the face downwards he was paralyzed you could not move to say that allah gave this as a punishment because he spoke against against the against the gospel or line against the gospel is not true and as I mentioned Malley answer that any calamity or any disease it may either be a punishment or it may be attached how do you realize that whether any calamity is a test or a punishment if the person is on the straight path then that calamity is a test and Allah was to test that servant of his that if I increase the calamity will the person yet have faith in me or not and if the person even after a calamity befalls him or her yet in the faith strong then Allah subhana Allah gives a higher reward and Allah will grant him a higher status in general so Allah tests his servant that very than a brother partners or assalam said the maximum difficulties among the human beings are put on the ambience on the prophets on the messengers of Allah because they have the highest caliber so compared to the other human beings all the ambience and a la smog Allah has sent 124,000 prophets on the face of the earth all these prophets were tested much more than a normal human being that means they will get a much higher status in Jannah than the other human beings if it's a punishment then before those people have committed a sin so if a person has sinned and I've gone against the command of allah subhanaw taala that calamity is a punishment and you come to know that in the punishment the person suffers whereas in a person if it's a test the person who's on the straight path his iman increases and as far as she did that if concern and hamdulillah I knew him very closely I was one of the first few people that when he got the stroke I just performed my Hajj and I flew from Saudi Arabia straight to South Africa and and hamdulillah I personally met him even though he had the stroke even though he could not move he could not speak he have to converse through the blinking of his eyes there was a chart that was kept behind him which had one two three four five rows each row had ABCD first row the second row F G H I and this way if we have to converse which are 1 2 3 stripling that means he the first he wants to choose a letter from second row then from second row we start F G H I brings an ayah so that I so in this way he could convey his message by spelling it out and once you get used to it you can do it very fast so he used to converse even by the blinking of his eyes and I know that even on bed when he could not move when he could not speak he ended Dawa there were there were Christians who came to meet him there were Christian missionaries who came to meet him non-muslims and through Dawa he was even a built to revert some of the non-muslim hamdulillah he wrote wrong messages and he even encouraged me and even he even dictated a message on the plaque the the best award that I've got from anyone at the best plaque is the plaque given by sheikh hamad did me in there mm in which he dictated the message that son what you have done in four years had taken me 40 years to accomplish al hamdulillah so this he dictated with his eye even though he could not speak and that plaque really masha'Allah gave a lot of encouragement to me and and if there is a person who is responsible who is a catalyst for me to change from a doctor of a body to doctor of a soul it is Sheikh Ahmed Deedat and we shall I mean he will get all the sabab that what I was a little bit I've done in the field of Dawa may he get the syrup without reducing Mesaba so alhamdulillah shake em adidas was for nine and half years on the bed he could not move but yet you could see his passion you could see his his his striving for Dawa so according to me if you see the striving you see the passion there was no remorse in his him that you know what he did was wrong he continued his Dawa this means Allah subhana WA Ta'ala foreign to me wanted to give a higher state refreshing tea that he he he got the stroke in 1996 at age when he was 78 years old and he was in bed for nine years allah tested him and I believe check D that alhamdulillah passed the test is flanking us and insha Allah Allah will reward him a higher status and that reminds me that many people don't know you know doctors are carry because these doing Dawa he's been harassed and he's been attacked by the enemies believe me I did Hydra I left my home country my home city that's Bombay left India and came to Malaysia and believe me Allah subhana WA Ta'ala supported me immensely if you have to think I can point out ten thousand difficulties but if you have to contemplate on the mercy of Allah I can think of millions of finger Allah has blessed me so depending upon whether you are an optimist or a pessimist and believe me I am very happy whatever difficulties that came they won nothing come to the blessing that Allah has given me did the near mother Allah has given me I'm convening madhava I'm not stopping Madhava so people a COC that can world a punishment and the Indian Norman went against him it's not a punishment it is my guru Maharaja macaroon macaron low helmet cream they then believers they plotted and planned and like to plan unless the best of planner this BJP government the Indian government they planned against the Muslims
