  "title": "It is Prohibited to Single outÂ Friday for Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "friday is an incredibly special day for all muslims wherever you are um so why is it that it can't be singled out on its own as an object of fast as far as singling on friday for keeping the warranty fast it is prohibited because friday is the main day for the muslims in the week you can call it's the weekly eid or a day is important day for the muslims and we offer congregation salah and we meet the relatives we meet our friends so to fast on this day it's not preferable and furthermore it is negating doing the opposite of what the jews and christians do they prefer fasting on the main day that is jews pray for fasting on saturday and the christians on sunday and this they consider the religious day and all the other days they do all their activities there's no problem so we don't believe in that they're only doing acts of good deeds on friday and not doing on the other days of the week so based on these two reasons the prophet muslim has prohibited singing on friday for fasting but this prohibition is not complete prohibition it is rather makru and he said that if you have too fast you can fast on friday along with fasting one day before or one day afterwards that means they're not singing out for fasting or if you're used to fasting on particular days you know like maybe three days in a month the yam will be and there happens to be a friday there's no problem or if you're fasting alternate day then that happens to be a friday then no problem otherwise singling out only friday is not permitted it's mentioned in the hadith of say buhari volume number three book of fasting hadith number 1986 that once the prophet met juvederm allah be pleased with her and she was fasting on friday so the prophet asked her that did you fast yesterday she said no do you have intention to fast tomorrow she said no then you break your fast prophet muhammad further said it's mentioned inside muslim verb number two in the book of fasting hadith number 2546 the beloved prophet said that do not single out the night preceding friday for offering the night salah night prayer and neither single out friday for a voluntary fast unless you're used to fasting unless accustomed to fasting and then friday falls on that so as i mentioned earlier that friday should not be singled out you know because we don't want to copy the other non-muslim the jews and the christians unless it's a normal practice and you have it and it happens to fall on the day no problem so if you fast on a friday if it's preceded by fasting one day before or one day after there's no problem or if it falls on your normal routine of fasting like alternate days or the three days like i am will be then it's perfectly fine"
