  "transcript": "alhamdulillah they are respected Scholars mawranas sheikhsis elders and my dear brothers and sisters I welcome all of you with Islamic greetings foreign it's a pleasure and honor for me to do this recording of a short video especially on the occasion of 50 years of Dr Israel ahmad's on the Revival of his revolutionary efforts and the movements of bringing people back to the Quran I am at present in Malaysia and it's a pleasure for me to make this video recording at the request of Dr Israel have mercy on him his son Asif he requested me to make a short recording of about 10-15 minutes for this special occasion which is going to be broadcast on the 27th of August in Lahore Pakistan I've been narrating the incidences my interaction with Dr Israel may Allah that he was one of the person who inspired me and was responsible for me to become a full-time guy and as you know one of the person who inspired me was Sheikh Ahmad and after I met him in 1987 for the first time he changed me from a doctor of a body to doctor for Soul at that time I was in second year of mbbs and the other person who inspired me was Dr srmal the first time I met Dr israh Ahmad was in 1991. maybe about three years after I started doing drama I made sure he did that in December 1987. so three years after I met Sheikh did that about three and a half years later I met Dr srmal after meeting Sheikh did that I was involved before that I was average could Muslim bring five times a day fasting the month of Ramadan but there's no passion of dawa no passion of spreading the word of Allah after she did that after hearing stocks I were inspired and started doing dawa in the Medical College and then the other person's speeches who inspired me was Dr Israel and but natural I have to hear his speeches in Urdu and that inspired me to make a trip to Pakistan I've been to Pakistan only once before I started giving public lectures that was in 1991. and I went to Lahore and I visited him and he asked me beta a Pakistan qi I said organizations to visit them must have replied and he said Pakistan means [Music] and after hearing his talks I realized what he meant what he wanted was to bring a revolution he wanted the ummah to return back to the Quran to turn back to the say Hadith to return back to the Sunnah and you can see that from his talks and when I heard stocks he was an orator mashallah per Excellence amongst the Urdu speakers from the library of many Urdu speakers that we have and even the Urdu speakers he had the auditory power which was par Excellence the passion with which he used to speak was phenomenal and I have washed hundreds of his video tips but naturally I was introduced to him by watching videotapes and then I met him personally in 1991. and when I met him I was inspired by his simplicity and he asked me so I said that I have just finished my BBF exams and I intend being a part-time guy while I'm continuing my medical profession because my father was a doctor he was a psychiatrist my elder brother the doctor so it was in the family told me that beta foreign he told me that it tried a lot but he could not succeed in doing both together you have to select one if you want to be a specialist between the two and that struck me and but natural I convinced my parents that how to be a full-time guy so the reason that the person besides Sheikh Ahmed did inspired me was Dr isaram and his words like guidance and I did not waste much time I hardly he spent seven years in doing both I hardly when I went back I finished my internship I was doing my internship when I met him I hardly practiced for maybe maybe less than a year and because my father was a doctor we had he had a routing practice we started a pathological lab and my brother was involved and then we did practice but not for long and he told me one thing and the advisors were engraved in my brief he told me son if you have to be a successful guy you have to make your life simple if your life is simple and your requirements of Life are less then no one will be able to twist your arm if your requirements are less you will not have to strive for the worldly gains so that you can concentrate on delivering the message of Allah this message that he gave to me of leading a simple life was a phenomenal advice which stuck in my mind Allah had blessed us and my father that we had all the facilities and we had a roaring business but this advice was stuck and because of that I thought to it that I led my life in Simplicity I do not wear any branded clothes but naturally good but not branded and not expensive things and that led me that even the car that I have should be the Allah has blessed us that I can travel in Rolls Royce alhamdulillah we can own a Rose Royce but we have a small Toyota to make life simple so that a requirements are less and because of that today whatever that we are that now I remember when we did Hijra my family and I did Hijra in 2016 from India to Malaysia when we realized that when we did not have any income for more than a year because we are used to living the Simplicity we didn't find it difficult at all and Allah has given us all the niyama in Bombay and we were happy that we sacrificed this for sake of Allah all the will that we had when we will Hijra we sacrifice for the sake of Allah and the advice of Dr Israel Ahmed was a blessing for us later on when I went back to India after meeting him I was more involved in in technology and we thought that we played his tapes and I collected his videotapes from different centers from what is Lahore whatsoever Karachi I went to U.S in the Chicago branch is New York branch from all the various centers that he has in different parts of the world we had the largest collection of Dr Israel's cassettes in the world more than even his own Center because his Center was divided Under One Roof organization had the largest collection of doctor is tape in English and Urdu Under One Roof hundreds of them and we started playing it on the video cables and in Bombay he'd be every famous in 2004 or 2003 we called them to Bombay and he came to India for a lecture for about three weeks and alhamdulillah I spent full three weeks with Dr Israel and I learned a lot from him the Simplicity with which he lived the passion with which he gave stocks and from his talks what I saw in the video and what I heard live I realized that he was specialized in three aspects number one was the fear of the Quran according to me he was excellent and we have in his videos Quran the second aspect of his speech was talking about Isla getting the Muslims closer to the Deen his lectures on they were fabulous and they created the impact in the lives of the people who are the stocks and the third aspect that he spoke on was on politics this aspect when I heard when I was in India didn't really inspire me okay politics I was saying I'm not a person I'm not a politician so I wouldn't used to get involved and I used to hear his talks on politics but did not really go in depth into it I was impressed by his knowledge of Quran and his talks on how to get the Muslims back to the Quran how to get the Muslims back to the Sunnah which was fantastic now I realize after I've shifted to militia and Allah has blessed me that I've met many Muslim head of States many multiple several many now I realize and when I heard and tried to recollect his speeches on politics it is unbelievable I remember he spoke in 1995 or close to that he spoke about the Indian politics and he said that in India the BJP party has only two seats and very soon they will be power and they will rule the country I thought how is this possible Congress was the way will be GP come but the far side it did that he had was really worth noting now I regret that why didn't I discuss with him about the third aspect I discussed with the Quran I discussed with other aspects of Islam and I really gained a lot of Knowledge from him but as far as politics was there I wasn't much interested because I said what has politics got to do with dawa now I realize that his farsightedness and his movement of Deen is really mashallah mashallah it was unfortunate that people did not really give the due respect that you deserve when you are alive now we really crave I wish that if you are alive now maybe you are a spend days with him discussing our service issue you know but naturally so elderly to me and I was very young I was like a son but we had a very strong relationship and now when I get messages from her son Asif who's in charge of his audio video I keep on getting every Ordinary Day his clips of two minutes three minutes and I'd watch every clip of this that is sent to me and though I've seen his lecture but again hearing him speaking with that passion the moderation that he has the impact that it creates is fantastic so these two speakers take Ahmad and doctor is when we called him to to Bombay and we organized a three weeks program all over India in Bombay we kept a 10-day lecture on its 10 favorite topics in one venue which had a capacity of about 15 000 people and he told me that was the largest gathering that he addressed for these 10 days at that time it was the largest program we organized because at that time we were smaller in 2004. and we use the best of cameras of that time maybe about eight or nine cameras of course after we started Peach TV we were on a different level so when we started Peach TV and we thought of starting the second Channel peace TV Urdu I invited him and said that why would you come to Dubai and I realized for him to travel to the Bible it's difficult then I said why don't we come to Egypt and he said better Egypt May there will not be any Pakistani how can I stock in front of cameras so I said don't worry we'll see through that we have at the 5200 Pakistan in the studio so we'll have a small setting it will not be a big lecture in the public reluctantly he agreed in 2010 and he agreed and we planned that we will we will have this program in Egypt in the studio everything was planned and you're supposed to come in May and unfortunately just maybe a couple of months before you could travel to Egypt Allah and and we lost a very great personality and I pray to Allah that me he Grant Dr ISR Ahmed I was your name the highest degree in German and may be close to the prophets and ambias and the whole farashidin and we pray to Allah that may he raise us also together close to him so that inshallah we are raised together in Jannah this was a short message that I could give in this few minutes that me he bless him and may his work the revolution that he created getting people back to the Quran and that we get Unfortunately today in the Muslim ummah I do not see a single Muslim leader which is even one percent like promised that the gene will prevail and this is the verse which was set by Dr Israel and madidar several times and every lecture another in the speech with the promise that Allah has given which is mentioned in chapter number nine verse number 33 in chapter number 61 verse number nine and Surah fatah chapter number 48 verse number 28 says that Allah sent his messenger with guidance of Truth so that it will prevail over all the other religions over all the other isms whether it be christianism Judaism Hinduism secularism atheism Marxism communism Islam is this time to supersede all mastered them all and Allah ends it in two places as well don't like it and one place that an inner physical fitness and I would like to end the speech and I pray to Allah that may we follow the guidance that he has left behind"
