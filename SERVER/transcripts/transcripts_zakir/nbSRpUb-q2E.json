  "transcript": "it's a fact today that the Glorious Quran is the most widely read book in the world today alhamdulillah ald it's obviously recited by all of these people most of these people in Arabic and unfortunately it isn't the language that they understand necessarily so the Quran is recited without understanding in many many cases what would you say or how could we encourage brothers and sisters to read the Quran with meaning and therefore being able to derive more benefit from recitation of it rightly said that the Quran has various benefits you can keep on listing them there are empty number of benefits hundreds of them the Quran is the most positive book in the world it is a proclamation to humanity it is a fountain of mercy and wisdom it is a warning to the heedless a guide to the aing and Assurance to those in doubt it is a Solace to the suffering and a hope to those in despair how is it possible to derive all these benefits if a person does not read the Quran if he does not understand it if he does not ponder over the verses if he does not implement the vers of the Quran and does not put it in practice as you rightly said that the Quran is the most widely read book in the world but unfortunately it is also the book which is maximum readed without understanding it will be a tragic Misfortune if someone comes to the Quran and goes away empty-handed Soul untouched heart un moved life unchanged to get the right benefit besides in the Quran it's compulsory that you should understand it you should ponder over the meaning of the Quran you implement the guidance which Allah has given to the humankind and put it in practice we have two types of people amongst um some people who think that only in the Quran is sufficient While others who think that reciting is not required only the meaning is important Allah says in the Quran in chapter number four verse number 171 do not commit excesses in your religion there is benefit also by reciting but with understanding you get multiple times more benefit Allah says in the Quran in anab chapter number 29 verse number 45 Allah says recite of what we have revealed by inspiration that means we have to recite the of the Quran recite of what we have revealed by inspiration further it's mentioned in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 242 several times it comes in the Quran do they not understand that means it is a book to be understood and it is important that we have to understand the book while reading besides reading you should understand it soing the Quran will get you many benefits as I mentioned earlier I beloved Prophet said it's a Hadi in Hadith number 2910 that every letter you recite of the word of Allah subhana tala of the Quran you'll get a reward each reward you'll get 10 blessings and alif Lam me is not a letter Al if is a letter lamb is a letter me is a letter so if it's alif Lam me you get 10 10 10 30 Saab so there is Saab in reciting there is blessing in reciting the Quran but as I mentioned earlier it's not sufficient only that you have to recite so we have to realize that both are important but understanding and implementing is more important Let me Give an example suppose you go to France for a graduation and you don't understand French but since you know English you know the script when you attend the college every day you are marked P that is present when you sit for the examination and don't understand a word what the teacher is saying when you sit for the examination you get the question paper since the script is the same maybe you can try and read by transliteration we don't understand a word there also in the examination you get a p p is not for pass it's for presence it's only indicating that you're present for the examination but that will not pass you so therefore if you want to go to jna besides reciting the Quran it's important that you even understand what Allah is telling us because Quran is a guidance for the whole of humanity you understand it and you implement on it I to give you one more example suppose there's a friend of yours since you're living in UK a friend of yours comes from Germany he's a close friend of yours he can speak some broken English when he goes back he writes to you a letter in German which you don't understand so when a close friend of yours he writes a letter to you in German and if you can't understand what will you do but natural you'll go to a person who knows German and you have it translated because you won to know what did your friend mention in the letter isn't it important that we should know what our creator Allah subhana wa ta'ala has mentioned in his last and final guidance that glorious Quran we don't have to go and translate the Quran the translation already available so it's important that besides reading if you can't understand Arabic we should read the translation so that we able to understand the message of Allah subhana wa tala and Implement on it"
