  "transcript": "the next question from Naveed Hamid and Afghan immigrant living in Canada I have a question about living in a non-muslim country I live in Brampton Canada where I can practice Islam in the best way we have mosque nearby and I have all the freedom in terms of clothing and practicing Islam do I still have to make his raro Muslim country my father being a good follower of Islam recommends me to take a decision to make his dad to a Muslim country I would appreciate to get a reply from you a similar question is posed by sad can Mississauga Canada in your talks they have emphasized not to migrate to non-muslim countries like North America as I was residing in the Middle East I couldn't continue because no one is allowed to stay there because of citizenship in Pakistan there is no Sharia law so is it permissible for us to migrate in such a situation to a non-muslim country where a life is safe and we can practice our religion a similar question is posed by muhammad sharif allah Flom from bangladesh is it permissible to move from one Muslim country to another non-muslim country for a better life one more similar question by Abdul Minh Anh residing in Ireland it's come on the facebook just now dr zakir naik we love you for the sake of Allah my question is what is the legal point of view of Muslims staying in our Muslim country question asked by the four brothers and many similar questions have come regarding Muslims staying in a non-muslim country this can be divided into two types a Muslim which is born in a non Muslim country what he has to do and a Muslim who migrates from Muslim country or non-muslim country Allah subhana WA Ta'ala clearly mentioned that and gives us guidance regarding this topic Allah says in surah nisa chap number four was the man in heaven when the angels of death come take the soul of the person who had died in sin against the soul and asked him what is your state and he replies that we have lived in oppression on this not our state was very bad oppressed then the angel replies that the earth of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala was vicious enough for you to migrate from the evil and for such people Allah continues the abode is hell a refuge of evil and this worse was revealed in context in Muslims living in non-muslim countries this was if you read the news value Quran and people write in bracket mentioning for the Muslim living in non-muslim country it says that when the angel of death comes to take the soul of the person who has died in sin against this whole and asked them what is the state the reply we lived in operation on this earth and the replies that the earth of allah subhanaw taala was vicious for you to move away from evil that means the world of allah's mother so be that if you are living in a space where there is operation where that is shake where there is activity with an Islamic we have to migrate and if you do not Allah says your abode is hell fire a refuge which is evil the next verse is insulin such a performer 19 after those who are in operation and men and women and children who don't have the power or do not have the facility to migrate verse number 99 says Allah will forgive them was the 100 faith that asked to those who sacrificed the home and leave the land Allah subhana WA Ta'ala gives them many a refuge in the world and if the person died as a refugee away from his home Allah subhana WA Ta'ala will reward him here last October dududu he died for the sake of Allah and a pencil with those who leave their home for the sake of Allah and his Horsell and take refuge the land is very big he'll find many refuge and if we died away from with home as a refugee for the sake of Allah and Rasool Allah was slowly rewarding but from this verse all the scholars they agree that if a person is living in a non-muslim land they gave me three options number one option is that he cannot practice his Deen freely but they seemed in hiding me to not accept if you cannot practise your Deen freely and you cannot call ourselves freely Muslims then it becomes compulsory for you to migrate complicity further if you are living in a country where you cannot practice as the in freely cannot call ourselves limbs cannot do your fair eyes cannot tell from the Haram in a non-muslim country it becomes the first for you to make it number two if you can practice your Deen very freely and there is no compulsion on you you can do all the fries you can stay away from all the Haram then migrating become mustahab but not a fart but they deliver stuff made from the most of the Quran so the scholar say if you are living in a non-muslim land where you can call yourself Muslim freely practice your Deen there is no harassment at all then migration becomes Muslim but not a further and for those people who are weak and do not have the means to migrate who oppressed women children don't have the power don't have the means for them if they continue to stay Allah will forgive them it is permissible so these are the three things now coming to the question of can a Muslim migrate from a Muslim country to normal slim that is another question all the scholar nationally agree those who own the Quran and Sunnah I know some scholars say aloud especially if you go to Western scholar they say no problem to migrate from Muslim country to a non-muslim country it is Haram unless it before education or for the purpose of dollar for education purpose you go your Hawaii education come back no problem or if you go there not as a part-time guy as a full-time guy to deliver the message then the scholars say it's permissible but if you just shift from Muslim 9th or non-muslim land for a better living as the question opposed it is not permitted at all and I know there are millions of Muslims who are migrating for Muslim countries from Pakistan from Bangladesh to Western countries USA Canada European countries only basically for a better living they talk about education do you ever come back the main purpose is for a better living because they can earn more money this is totally prohibited migrating from Muslim country to a non-muslim country for a better living is private if you are born in a non Muslim country then the options are three if you can not practice your Deen freely it becomes compulsory to migrate if you can practice the Deen freely it is most up to migrate not a further I know there are many Muslims more anonymous simple countries a large percentage of the Muslim Ummah and living in non-muslim countries if they are born there and if they can practice they have been freely according to me nowadays there are very few countries in the world non-muslim countries in the world where you can actually practice very freely and that also in those countries it will not be totally but to a great extent and I would agree that amongst the Western countries that available Canada would be better than the other western country it's Canada's much better than USA is much better than other Western countries in terms for a Muslim to live because I'd present you have I'm Minister that is Trudeau who has more care for humanity and who really care for giving equal right to human being unlike the other prime minister of other Western countries like France for us etc so amongst the Western countries the best of the worst countries would be Canada but coming to the question what is the reason that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has requested you to make it what is the reason and a beloved prophet said it's measuring us a hadith of Abu Daoud world number three hadith number two six four five and the hadith is mentioned Seibel money the Prophet said I before those Muslims who live amongst the mushrikeen I disowned those Muslims who live amongst the idolaters it's a hadith the Prophet is discerning all the Muslims who live among the mushrikeen the reason is true number one is a Muslim may not be able to practice Islam in totality they may be he can follow some aspects of death he cannot freely say he's a Muslim we cannot freely offer Salah etc and the second is the Associated factors of that environment is such that it prevents you from doing the Sunnah and the fries and takes you closer to the Haram activities let me give a bit of explanation there are very few non-muslim countries that really you can be proud to be Muslims and in those countries also certain areas not throughout the country secondly one thing you have to understand that almost all the Western countries that most fear is not very convenient for the Islamic lifestyle number one in almost all the Western countries there is obscenity the obscenity is coming on your face there is alcoholism that is drug addiction there is prostitution and being associated factor is RIBA most of the countries most of the places you get involved in the path it's difficult for you to stay away from River what you have to realize some people may argue that okay they live in Muslim countries I came with you there are but the levels differ you go to a Muslim country I don't know of any Muslim country in the world which is as close as America and obscenity as close as standardized absolutely not at all yes there may be it may be Haram but the level is less and in certain non-muslim country which I'm not the Western countries in the obscenity is less depending upon the culture what you have to realize that in the Western country it is coming at your face glaring the moment you walk or do you see billboards of ladies which scantily dressed which addresses of seem close difficult and emotional offender you may find but not as much as what you find in the Western countries so there is no comparison at all so imagine when you walk you have to lower again how can you live I know there are many Muslim live in Western countries and I've been to Western countries a lot I have traveled a lot for America I have traveled a lot to USA to Canada to Western countries I agree with my talk and there are situations where some of the Muslims come and tell me ok when I came to the western country I became more Islamic possible and that is yes I agree with possible but that small possibility the chances of a person a Muslim going away from his Deen is more in the Western countries than in the other parts of the world more in a western country than a Muslim country what I have to understand that there are possibilities that a person will go from Pakistan to American become more practicing may start reading Quran may start offering Salah but the percentage is very small for example because the salman rushdie wrote the book The Satanic Verses there are thousands of non-muslims accepted Islam that does not mean what Salman did is right for Salman did is to be condemned that's the different question that even though it is wrong in that wrong thing it has its own benefits the majority people that go to the Western country they go away from the Deen according to the PE W report and the PW report the pure report is supposed to be authentic done by non-muslims it says that in USA in USA 25% of the Muslims born in Muslim family they live their religion every year imagine 25% of the Muslims born in a Muslim family every year leave the team but the good part of it is equal number of people even come close even accept Islam so the number of Muslims in USA remains approximately same the number leaving and number coming a fame that's a reason the number of Muslims approximately different types fix a in a population about 350 million people in USA the Muslims some say 4 million some say 5 million some say 3 million some say to my it is approximately 1% but surely not more than 2% it is close to 1% 3 million imagine 25 percent every year leave they deem that means a plane is fair I know so many of the dogs who lived in USA got their citizenship got a green card but they came back nobody couldn't is their family I know many people tell me because when you go to USA when you go to Canada you know there is a Muslim community center the moment a person goes away from his country or goes away from the people of like-minded any stranger a minority there a possibility that you make your own community but that's a very small possibility after I will to USA so many times I have gone to many conferences what f2 realized that what you see is just the outside world I know many of the good guys whose children have got into drug addiction whose children have got into adultery into alcoholism you can't stop it it is coming on you yes I know even in Muslim country like Pakistan Bangladesh people I involved in all these evils but the percentage is less for the questioner to say there is no Sharia followed in Pakistan as socially as fall in Canada totally wrong between Guyana and bug is a bug if man will be a thousand times better than Canada I know that I evil practice in Pakistan in this but yet it is thousand times better than a non-muslim country with all the progress only way the non-muslim country can be better is you may get more money you may get more luxury you may be able to drive a Mercedes car but you are very bad businessman this is only for a few years we live in this world for how long on average for about 70 75 years you may dad the age of 10 20 as usual 90 average 70 years but what will happen in a car in the Acura you are sacrificing your luxury if you take pain fear and sacrifice the luxury here in a Shara will go in Jannah so I have a hamdulillah prevented thousands of Muslims from Pakistan from Bangladesh to migrate to America and to Canada USA thousands of them so migrating in out of the question if you are born then is the question migrating if earth or not but you migrating from a Muslim candidate or non-muslim country for a better living is totally prohibited even though it may be a country like Canada it may be better than the other countries I know there are many refugees going there but yet what they have to understand that Allah has made it very clear fact that if you are born in that country then you have option migrate or not migration is the best number one if you cannot follow a didn't become the fun if you can follow then it become mustahab unless you oppressed or weak or no means then it's permitted I know many guys today from USA who want to come to Malaysia I don't know take the name because they may never fall to others they spoke to me on one-to-one level and they want to migrate to Muslim country and I as I said in my earlier and from one of the best Muslim countries to live today amongst all the Muslim countries militia there are negative points but alhamdulillah as a whole it is the best available most of the dyes that I know of they know when I also go to give lectures the person may be a president of economic organization but we know that his parents come into law or the person is involve these wrong activities these are Mac tivities there were so many girlfriend he does then that's not known to the world Shana is very common so the percentage of Muslims living in western country doing zina is multiple time more than living in a Muslim country you cannot compare there are sins in the Muslim countries but the level in the non-muslim countries my child I know many guys who want to live there are few guys who promote and say oh I am very happy and because of America I become a good Muslim all this is nonsense they know no the Koran well they talk about the Quran but according to me don't they know the verse of this Quran and the context was Muslims living in non-muslim land of surah Nisa chapter for some 97 Waialae says if you live among the mushrikeen you will go to hell it is very clear that how can they say how can they misguide the people by saying or America is very good it has changed my life what you should do I am thankful to Allah subhana Allah even staying in America Allah say this should be a dying not promoting America for what the person which is again is a Muslim the country which is I means the Muslim at the whole how can you promote such a country so these dyes have actually I don't agree with them at all but every few in percentage-wise a very small number but the majority of the dye they win today I mean I meet them on a personal level they would love to migrate and some of them are staying because okay they want to convey the message no problem that's accepted in Islam but for a Muslim to migrate from a Muslim country to non-muslim country this according to the scholars is not permitted except for education for the particular time of what being a full-time guy hope the answer the question"
