  "transcript": "i am adoke you said in your speech that god is um allah is imageless and formless as stated in hinduism then why muslims during hajj pilgrimage they worship holy shine as a hindu when they worship that's a very good question the brother has posed that if almighty god has got no image in islam allah subhanahu wa with allah no form then why would the muslims worship the holy israel and refer to the kaaba in health pilgrimage whether it's a misconception no muslim ever worships the kaaba it's a misconception among the non-muslims that we muslims we worship the kaaba no muslim worship the kaaba we only worship allah who we cannot see in this world what we do is that kaaba is the qibla tribula in arabic means the direction kaaba is the qibla because we muslims we believe in unity always unity for example if we want to pray to almighty god allah if we have to offer salah some may say let's face the north some may say let's face south some may say east some miss the west where do we face we believe in unity so for unity all the muslims throughout the world they are asked to face in the direction of the qibla that is the kaaba it's a direction we don't worship it and the first people who do the world map were the muslims and when the muslims do the world map they do with the south pole on top and north pole down and kaaba was in the center the westerners came and they turned the map upside down north pole on top south pole down alhamdulillah yet the kaaba is in the center mecca is in the center and since mecca in the center any muslim in any part of the world if he's staying in north of kaaba he faces towards the south if he's staying in the south of kaaba he faces towards the north all the muslims throughout the world they face in one direction kaaba is the qibla it's the direction no muslim ever worships it and when we go for hajj to the pilgrimage we circumambulate around the kaaba we circumambulate around the kaaba because everyone knows that all circles have only one center so we circumambulate around the kaabah to testify that there is only one god not because we worship it and the statement of the second caliph of islam allah be pleased with him he said it's mentioned in say muslim in the book of hajj volume number two he said how the tomorrow please with him that i am kissing the black stone that is the kaaba sanghas word only because my prophet kissed it otherwise this black stone can neither harm me neither can it benefit me the second khalifa of islam california plays with him he made it clear for eternity that no muslim ever worshipped the black stone it can neither benefit us neither can it harm us and the best example is that during the time of the prophet the sahabah as the companion of the prophet they even stood on the kaaba and gave the azan azan is the call for prayers people stood on the kaaba and gave the azan i am asking you which idol worshipper will ever stand on the idly worships so these are sufficient proof that no muslim ever worship the kaaba kaapa is the qibla and we worship only allah subhanahu ta'ala who we cannot see with the eyes hope that answers the question"
