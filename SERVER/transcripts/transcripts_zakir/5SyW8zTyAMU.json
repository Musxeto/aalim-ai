  "transcript": "the conflict in the world is for various reasons one of the main reason is for power it is for money it is for status it is for land because most of the people think that world is everything but if you go back to the scriptures if you go to Quran Quran says in Sur M chapter number 67 vers number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of his good in Deeds so this life is temp it's a test for you so if everyone realizes that the life is temporary then you won't run after wealth and D so much for example when I'm traveling I come to Nigeria I stay in a temporary hotel I don't buy a house for me why because I know I'm going to be Nigeria for one week 2 week three week that's it so if you know that the world is temporary you will not behave like a person who wants to hold wealth so main life is the life after death and most of the religion say the same thing so if every human being understands that this life is temporary it's the test for the Hereafter then you find the difference"
