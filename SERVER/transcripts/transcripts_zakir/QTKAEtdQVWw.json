  "transcript": "I am Muhammad and I am from Dhaka Bangladesh my question is there is no contagious disease in Islam is it true no it's not true to say there is no contagious disease in Islam is not true at all and I quoted servant Hadith giving us what precaution we should take when the plague and plague is a contagious disease the prophet spoke about leprosy the first contagious disease that I can think of in the history of Islam is mentioned in the Quran chapter number 2 verse number 59 talking about the ban Israel that is the time of Musa the bani Israel they were transversing they were not foreign Allah will send a plague on them so the first mention in Islamic text the earlier that I know of any plague mentioned that I can think of is at the time of ban Israel at the time of Muslim when they were transgressing not falling Allah Allah sent a plague on them as a punishment if you read historical record by Tamari somebody says that in 18 hijri 18 ah after hijri in Palestine in a place known as amwas a plate came and 25 000 people died because of the plague and from the people who died there were many sahabas some were from the ashram for example that uh abujara uh he was one of the 10 people who promised paradise and he was amongst one of the people who died in the plane and 25 000 people died imagine at that time when the population was small if you read the historical records he writes that up to 100 131 hijri ah 15 plagues came and he quoted the time and the so plague is there since ages and centuries even in Islam it's there so it's wrong to say that there is no contagious disease in Islam the next question is I am abdulrahman from Riyadh Saudi Arabia a prophet peace be upon him said there is no adwa contagious disease is this not contradicting with the medical science yes there is the Hadith of a beloved Prophet Muslim it is number 5707 where the Beloved Prophet said there is no adwa disease what you have to understand that you have to read and it says that there are no bad women Etc and continues the Hadith but if you read the Shara and the commentary of this Hadith it says that hear what the prophet meant was when there is no adwa there is no contagious disease which can be conveyed without the permission of Allah it means that no one can acquire any contagious disease unless it is permitted by Allah it is not just a blanket statement that there is no contagious diseases otherwise as you mentioned correctly it would be against medical science there are and if you read the complete Hadith says there is no otherwise there's no contagious diseases meaning there is no contagious disease it is not conveyed unless with the permission of Allah and there's no Bad Romance Etc and it says that if you see a leper run away from it as though you've seen a line this indicates that leprosy is a contagious disease and the prophet is advising you when you see a person having contagious disease you run away indicating there is contagious disease so if you read the complete Hadith you understand that the context is that you cannot get any contagious disease or any disease unless with the permission of Allah and the other quoted that we have to take precaution during contagious diseases so that means of course there is contagious disease but have faith in Allah that nothing will be for you unless except with the permission of Allah so according to the Hadith there are contagious diseases according to forandra contagious diseases Quran says that Allah sent plagues on the beneath Royal and Surah baqarah chapter number two verse number 59 so there are contagious disease Allah and Allah says and the prophet said what precautions you should take but it giving indication that half faith in Allah it will not harm you except with the permission of Allah hope that answers the question"
