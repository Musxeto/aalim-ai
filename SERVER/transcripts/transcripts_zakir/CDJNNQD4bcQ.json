  "transcript": "alhamdulillah respected brother abdurahim green brother Zak Ahmed brother muhammadi my respected elders and my brother and sisters I welcome all of you with the Islamic greetings may peace mercy and blessings of Allah subhana wa ta'ala of almighty God be on all of you the topic of this evening's talk is similarities between Hinduism and Islam I started my talk by quoting a verse from the Glorious Quran from Surah Al Imran chapter number three verse number 64 which says say oh people of the book come to Common terms as between us and you which is the first term that we worship none but Allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and patrons other than Allah if then they turn back say witness that we are Muslims bowing our will to Allah subhana wa ta'ala to almighty God this verse of the Glorious Quran though specifically it mentions that the Jews and Christians but in general it can be used for different types of people according to me this verse of the Glorious Quran is the master key for conveying the message to different types of people for coming on a common platform Allah says come to common term as between us and you which is the first term that we worship none but one almighty God that we associate no partners with him in order to understand any religion it is not appropriate to try and understand religion by observing what the followers of that religion do because many of times the followers themselves are not aware about their own religions and about the scriptures therefore the best and the most appropriate method of understanding in religion is to try and understand the authentic sources the authentic scriptures of that religion if we have to understand Hinduism we have to understand the authentic sources the authentic Sacred Scriptures of Hinduism and the most SEC scripture in Hinduism are The Vedas the vas are followed by the upanishads by the IAS ramayan baharat bhagat Gita by the puranas Manus Etc so if we understand the Veda and the other Hindu scriptures we shall understand Hinduism in the correct perspective if we have to understand Islam we have to understand the sacred scriptures of Islam that is the Glorious Quran which is the last and final revelation of Allah subhana wa ta'ala of almighty God to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and in order to understand the Quran the supplementary Source in Islam is the Sunnah of the Prophet the authentic a Hadid the authentic seeing of the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so if we have to understand Islam we have to understand the Glorious Quran and the authentic sayings of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him"
