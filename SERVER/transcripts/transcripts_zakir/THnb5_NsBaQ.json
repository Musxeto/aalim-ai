  "transcript": "hi my name is Rahul Bhatia I am an engineer by profession I have a question in Quran verse 22 ayat 47 it says verily a day in the sight of the Lord is like a thousand years of your Reckoning also in Quran 32 ayat number five it says to him on a day the space whereof will be a thousand years of your Reckoning and in Quran 70 ayat number four it says the angels and the spirit Ascend unto him in a day the measure wear off is 50 000 years so which one the measure of a day is a thousand years or a 50 000 year and in the sight of Allah correct yeah I think the same person was yesterday about the seated and late days yes Marshall I love you brother thank you I love you too to be a scholar to know all these things go on the internet on the anti-islamic side and you'll get hundreds I am sure I will have you read the full Quran brother Rahul I know that I'm afraid that I'm going to get more questions sorry I'm afraid that I'm going to get more questions so I want to sort these outages that see if you want to know the truth yeah the direct source if I want to know Christianity and if I read the anti-christian books then I'll become biased so my request to you brother Rahul is first go to the good side read the Quran then don't ask me two questions ask me 200 yeah inshallah reply even now I'll reply okay but I've been in the field of dawa I realize that people go to the anti-islamic sites first and they see the negative point they get convinced and they against Islam if you want to know Islam go to the good side don't go to sites like answering Islam the thing is I can actually no the point is I can actually say speak for half an hour in favor of Islam as well so I'm not and I'm totally unbiased I'll give the reply this is all common for me it's nothing new yeah this has been asked to me several times before I can give reference to everything mashallah the brother has a question that two places in the Quran may Allah says that one day in the sight of Allah is equal to thousand years and one place in Surah reached up number 70 verse number four that one day in the side of Allah is equal to 50 000 years so he's in their contradiction like one place it says Thousand Years other places it says that 50 000 years in Arabic the word used is Yom the word use this yeah now John has got two meanings one of the meanings is day day like a 21st day the other meaning is a period Epoch can be any number of years or whatever it is so one meaning of Yom is the the other meaning is a period so now if you read it correctly that one verse says that for the options to go up to Allah it will take one thousand years of your Reckoning like one day one period which is equal to one thousand years of your Reckoning the other was saying Surah Chapter 70 verse number four that for the angels to ascend [Music] it will take a period of one period which is equal to fifty thousand years for example if I tell you that for me to travel from Dubai to Abu Dhabi takes one hour and for me to travel from Dubai to say USA in a very slow plane will take me 50 hours the period taken for me to travel from Dubai to Abu Dhabi is one hour the period taken for me to travel from Dubai to New York is 50 hours it is not a contradiction because both the things are different so here again when Allah says about the upstairs to travel it's a different time period and for the angels to go to Allah it's a different time period it's not a contradiction there are two different things therefore the time periods are different so if you translate day as 24 hours then there's a contradiction if you translate day as a period like Allah says he has created the universe in six days in Six ayams it cannot be six twenty first day then there's a contradiction it is six periods six epochs which scientists don't have any objection to so here to John is a period and all these answers you can go to a website irf.net www.irf.net so so basically it refers to two different things that's right excellent okay and and the word uh where it's the you're saying there are two different words yeah one is day in Arabic and the other one has got two meanings one meaning is 21st day there's the epoch or a period and is this the word Yom has been used in both the same 100 same word have been used to refer to a day all the three verses also including when Allah says they have created the earth and the heaven the same home is used ayam same thing the reference verse number nine to twelve the same ayam is used right so it and and that word can mean a day and or or it can mean yeah it only means a period any pop right and and a period Can it can be it can be one or can be tenants can be ten years one thousand years one million years one billion billion and the two things are actually referring to two different things I am I'm going at the back for my next turn thank you [Applause]"
