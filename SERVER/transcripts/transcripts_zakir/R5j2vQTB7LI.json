  "transcript": "and the first question I have for you is as we've often been doing first question what is the meaning of the term and can you give us the differentiation between that term and which is often misconstrued alhamdulillah as far as the word is concerned it is broken up into two words means to stand and Al means the night so literally it means standing in the night but in the Sharia in the Islamic context it means it is a voluntary prayer which is prayed after Isa and before the break of dawn and as we aware that Isa starts after the redness of the sky disappear after Sunset and you can pray thisam just before the break of dawn before the time of f so the word was given because a person in this voluntary prayer he recites long verses of the Quran so the standing is long long therefore it is called as standing in the night the prayer where you have to stand for a long time and there are various different words which are used for the same for example it's also called as Salat meaning the prayer at night it's also called as tud it's also called as V also as Salat as I mentioned means prayer at night similar to standing in the night but naturally for praying the other word use is tud coming from Lord which means to wake up so when a person sleeps and he wakes up to pray it's called as tud also the other word used is meaning odd and a prophet always say that we have to after is Salah we should offer in all raats and the other name used is t t comes from the Arabic word raah which means to rest which means to relax because after a few Generations after the prophet people when they used to read the in Ramadan especially this for is mainly used for in Ramadan so when they used to pray the in Ramadan after four they used to rest so this wordi from that time onwards it got stuck to this in Ramadan it's called as normally after four they used to rest and this has continued because they used to pray for long hour and even now though they pray for a short time a few verses yet in the during Ramadan they stop so the word is yet use but at the time of the Prophet this word t was never used even while praying during Ramadan this word was never used even the sahabas has never used this word it came down later on so the more appropriate word is is not the right appropriate word but it came later on but if a person when he reads for a long time Ramadan if he wants to rest he can rest but it's not forbidden to rest the person is tired and he wants to rest he can rest but it's not compulsary has to rest so the more appropriate word is and it's not"
