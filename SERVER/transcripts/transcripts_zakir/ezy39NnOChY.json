  "transcript": "the first question asked by muhammad abubakar from punjab pakistan he asks is it necessary to pray qatar of the miss sunnah prayers besides prayers a similar question by nazneen sultana from kolkata india she asks do we have to pray qatar of tahajud prayer if we miss regarding kada that is compensation of your miss prayer if the prayer that you have missed it is a further prayer that it is a compulsory prayer then it is a must that you need to pray qatar of it the moment you remember that you have missed the further prayer you need to compensate for it immediately as far as the sunnah prayer is concerned the sunnah can be classified into two categories the first is and the second is sunnah so the sunnah it is that sunnah which the prophet peace be upon him he would offer regularly and he would rarely miss it the sunnah is that which the prophet would sometimes miss it and he was not regular while offering it the sunnah al-mu'akada the most important is the qiyamal that is the tahajud and the witter prayer this is the most important in the sunnah and if you miss this it is recommended that you offer the kawa so the sunnah al maqqada if you miss it it is recommended that you offer cover of the sunnah the second among the most important in the sunnah it is the sunnah of fajr prayer the sunnah before the two rakah of fajr obligatory prayer this is very important and a blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him he said that the sunnah of the fajr prayer it is better than the world and the wealth in it this is how important the sunnah of the fajr prayer is if you miss the sunnah of the fajr prayer you can offer it after the 4th prayer even though there's a hadith or blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him where he said that there is no prayer after the fajr prayer until the sun rises but this is an exception because the fajr prayer it is very important so for example if you enter the masjid the imam has already started the prayer you have not offered the sunnah of your fajr prayer so you should join the imam complete your prayer with the imam the two rakah of fajr obligatory prayer and then after that you can offer the two raka of sunnah prayer that you have missed the second type in the sunnah is the sunnah and this is the one which the prophet peace be upon him he would sometimes miss it and he was not regular in offering it sometimes he used to offer sometimes he wouldn't offer and an example of this is the four raka of sunnah prayer before the asar prayer so if a person he is regular or if he offers sunnah quite often then if he misses it he has the option of offering the kada prayer of the missed sunnah prayer so basically in summary if you have missed a further prayer you need to compensate for it it is a must it is compulsory the second the sunnah prayer in the sunnah prayer we have sunnah that is the prayer which the prophet peace be upon him the sunnah which he offered regularly this if you miss it is recommended that you offer it but it is not compulsory whereas this prayer if you miss it you have an option to offer it or not to offer the kada prayer"
