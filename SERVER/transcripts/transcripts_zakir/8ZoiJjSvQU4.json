  "transcript": "the next question my name is hisham abdul haleem i am a student of msc physics from west bengal india assalamu alaikum my friend asked me a question that i could not answer please could you reply to it allah is neither male nor a female then why are all the names of allah masculine and gender like most of the languages they have three genders the masculine the feminine and the neuter for example the english language it has the masculine gender for the male it has the feminine gender for the female it has the neuter gender for inanimate things so most of the languages they have three genders but in the arabic language there are only two genders so every word in the arabic language it is either male or it is female even the inanimate objects they are either male or they are female in the arabic language and there are certain rules and regulations certain signs for a word to be or female for example if a word it has a tam or bhuta in the end then the word it is feminine for example saturn that is watch sayaratu that is fan navarro that is specs these words are ending with tam or bhuta therefore they are feminine the second is that if the word it is feminine by itself in nature for example um that is mother bintun that is daughter that is sister these are feminine in nature the third is that if it is spare and it is parts of the body for example yaddun that is hand ozone that is yours aynun that is eyes ridgeline that is legs so these are rules and regulations these are signs these are that a word its feminine nature in the arabic language now if a word it does not have these or sign by default it is masculine the word allah it does not have tam or buddha in the end it is not pair allah 112 it is not feminine in nature allah subhanahu wa is not feminine nature so because the word allah it does not have the signs of the feminine words therefore it by default it is masculine similarly the names of allah subhanahu ta'ala all his names and attributes they are also masculine the word itself is masculine allah subhanahu wa he has got no gender but in the arabic language there are only two genders so if a word it does not have the science of the feminine gender by default it falls in the masculine gender so that's the reason even the names and attributes of allah they are masculine"
