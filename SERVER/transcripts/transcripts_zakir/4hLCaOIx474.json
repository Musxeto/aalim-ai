  "transcript": "am I allowed to ask for the Forgiveness of the sins of other people in my personal supplications if I may then how should I do so it is not that you can it is recommended that when you pray you should pray for your other believing Muslims other Muslim brothers and sisters it's mentioned several places and it further mentioned in the Quran in Surah Muhammad chapter number 47 verse number 19 it says ask for forgiveness for yourselves and the believing men and women that means you ask for yourself for forgiveness as well as forgiveness for the believing men and women and there's a Dua of n Alam Prophet Noah in Surah chapter number 71 verse number 28 where it says that Noah peace be upon him he pray to Allah subhana tala that forgive me my parents and those who enter my house in faith forgive me my parents and those who enter my house in faith and the believing men and women and our beloved Prophet M wasallam it's mentioned in the Hadith ofi Hadith number 3385 that the prophet Muhammad sallu alaihi wasallam whenever he used to ask forgiveness for others first he used to start with himself that forgive me and then say forgive my Muslim brothers sisters Etc but if you have to be careful you cannot ask forgiveness for the unbelievers for the mush for Allah says in the Quran in Surah TBA chapter number n verse number 113 that it is not befitting for the prophet and for the believing men and women to ask forgiveness for the pagans who are sing partners with Allah subhana wa ta'ala even if they be your kit and kin for those who you know are surely going to go to the Hellfire but you may ask for other things you can ask for the health for unbeliever you can ask for the wealth for an unbeliever that's perfectly fine the best Dua you can do for the mush for unbeliever is the which I beloved Prophet wasam said it's mentioned in Hadith of Hadi number 3681 where the Beloved Prophet said that out of the two Omar may Allah give to one Omar and om be pleased with him Allah gave him and he accepted Islam so you can always ask for of the unbelievers that's the best Dua you can do for them Subhan Allah may Allah give my mother hi in that case inah aan"
