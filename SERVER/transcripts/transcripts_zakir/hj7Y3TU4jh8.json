  "title": "The More Popular One is, the More Criticism One Receives - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "that why if I'm a man of peace and I speak about peace some people are against me some Muslims some non-muslims Home Secretary brother you have to understand that any person who's popular they're bound to be people are against him irrespective whether the popular person is doing good work or bad work and the best example I can give you that today according to Michael H har he wrote a book saying the 100 most influential people in the world history though he's a Christian he put number one most influential human being as Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him today do you know though Muslims consider him to be the most important and the most influential person in history there are many non-muslims who think the same but today if you analyze the maximum books written against any human being on the face of the Earth it is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the second person he named in his list for Isaac Newton but because he's not a common man for common human being he's a scientist the third person on his list was Jesus Christ peace be upon him if we analyze today the second person in human history who has maximum books written against him it is Jesus Christ peace be upon Him based on this argument do we have to agree that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and Prophet Jesus peace be upon him they were not good what we have to realize when a person gets popular there are bound to be people against him"
