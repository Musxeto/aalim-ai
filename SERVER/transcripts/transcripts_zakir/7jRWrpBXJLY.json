  "transcript": "shastri Bihar pravasi maharashtriya or Bombay maybe um foreign foreign or is he a yacht Quran again um or kahina kahin Ayah um that's a very good important question he has said that in Hindu philosophy we believe that the full world the whole humanity is like a family and everyone should live happily in the family earn money live happily enjoy life out of this question is it similar in Islam any facial in Islam it will be somewhat similar and then you come to his question and asks that this Quran it should reach the full world is there a mistake in the Muslims they're spilling the Quran or is there a mistake in the people understanding it that today we find Muslims are being labeled as terrorists as fundamentalists as extremist so what is the real problem as by the first question I do agree with him that Hinduism does say that the whole world is a family we should live happily earn enjoy Islam says somewhat similar except for the ending Allah says in the Quran chapter number 49 verse number 13. oh humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into Nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other so the Quran says that all the humankind has got one common grandparents with them both and Allah has divided us into Nations and tribes different colors different languages so that you may recognize each other and the criteria for judgment in the sight of almighty God it's not wealth it's not cast it's not color it's not sex but it is and God Almighty said most honored in the same verse of Surah chapter 49 13 Allah continues and says and the most honored amongst you is the person in Hinduism he said that we have to lead a life happily earn in Islam we have to lead your life happily yes but on the basis of the only criteria in which makes you Superior it is taqwa it is righteousness it is God Consciousness it's not money it's not wealth it's not sex it's not curse now coming to this question that the Quran is such a good book is it that this problem in communication regarding the preachings of Quran or are we not able to understand that's the reason whether we're having this talk Islam the solution of humanity the problem is in media portraying Islam and we Muslims it's our fault I do agree with you we aren't expert in Media we Muslim them to blame as it is the duty of every Muslim to convey The Message of Islam to convey the message of the Quran to the whole of humanity we are doing a full job we are trying we are trying a level best today the best way you can teach the massive now see the Gathering surely hundreds of thousands I don't know how many but yet for us it is retail hundred thousand is retail for me we believe in millions therefore showing life on the satellite channel and the estimated viewership of more than 60 million people watching 60 million the hundred thousand two hundred thousand is peanuts I can give Shada to Allah that we have delivered the message to humankind and 60 million is at least one percent yet there is nothing one percent of humankind if you counted to be 6 billion what we want that we Muslims should be more forward in media there should be more channels it should spread much more and I do agree with you there is a problem in understanding that's the reason have you mentioned that we are being labeled as extremist as fundamentally as a terrorist and my talk was based on that that how should you reply when a person says that you are a fundamentalist you are a terrorist you're extremist so hopefully inshallah you get the translation after this lecture hopefully hope that's the question [Applause]"
