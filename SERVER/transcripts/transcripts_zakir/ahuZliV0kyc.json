  "title": "Consequences of Neglecting the Sunnah - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "following on from your answer um could it be said that a person who intentionally neglects the sun would that person be punished in the Hereafter before I reply to your question I would like to clarify certain points as far as the actions and deeds of any Muslim is concerned they're broadly divided into two categories one is halal and the other is Haram Halal is the permissible category Haram is the forbidden prohibited category furthermore the Halal category is further divided into four subcategories the first is the F which is obligatory which is compulsory second is the mustahab the things which are encouraged in Islam third is the muah the things which are optional in Islam the fourth is the maku the things which are discouraged in Islam or detestable so in all there are five categories number one is f which is obligatory and compulsary number two is the must things which encouraged the third is the muah things which are optional fourth is maku things which are discouraged or distest in Islam and fifth is Haram things which are forbidden and prohibited now if a person does an act of F and compulsory act he gets a reward that is he gets positive points if a person does not do a f thing he gets a punishment he gets negative points as far as the second category is concerned that is must if a person does a must act he gets a reward he gets a positive point but a person who does not do must act he gets no punishment he gets no negative points the third category that's mubah optional whether a person does the mubah optional act or not or does not do an optional Act he gets no positive no negative points he gets no reward he gets no punishment it's absolutely neutral it's optional the fourth category is the makr the discouraged or detestable if a person abstains from things which are maku he gets a positive point he gets a reward and if a person does the makru thing he gets no punishment he gets no negative Point as far as the last fifth category is concerned that is Haram that's prohibited if a person abstains from doing the Haram thing then he gets a positive point he gets a reward if he does the Haram act he gets a punishment he gets negative points so these are in brief as far as the five categories are concerned now coming to the question of Sunnah Sunnah are of two types one is the Lugi Sunnah that is the literal meaning of Sunnah that is the sayings the actions and the approval of the Prophet so as far as the Lugi that is the literal meaning of Sunnah is concerned it can fall in the first four categories it can either be a Sunnah which is aah which is must aah which can be mubah or aah which is Mak so the Lugi Sunnah the literal Sunnah can fall under any four categories for example Sunnah fallowing in the f categor is mam sahi wasallam pred the F Salah he pred the Z Salah he prayed all the five prescribed Salah that way the actions of the prophet and also saying of the Prophet but it falls in the F category the example of the must Sunnah is the prophet he prayed the two raat Sunnah before the F Salah it's not a first to pray before but it is must it is encouraged this is the second category the third category of muba will be mham Salli wasallam had long hair it was optional you know so anyone who has long hair it's optional it is permissible the example of the fourth category makr people will think that can the prophet do something which is makr and they will be shocked what is speaking prophet of the Prophet Mak I give you an example the Hadi saying that that prophet malli wasallam he said that do not drink while standing so drinking and standing is Mak fine so the right must is to sit and drink but there Hadith also saying that the prophet he stood and he drank water maybe there was a reason there was a requirement so standing and drinking is maku sitting and drinking is must standing and drinking is discouraged sitting and drinking is encouraged so there are times in case of necessity when the requirement is there the prophet did do sometimes things which are makru so this will fall under the category of Sunnah which is Mak in the Lugi sense not in thei sense I'll come to it later on otherwise people say what is Zak saying that that is sunah means doing Mak no it is not Lugi yes it can be because the prophet did it he stood drank water but normally most of the times almost all the times he sat and he drank so there are times of necessity but since a person does makru he will get no negative points no punishment and the prophet didn't get punishment but neither will he get any reward so this was in brief talking about the Lugi Sunnah that is the literal definition of Sunnah it can fall under any four categories must or Mak now coming to the second category of Sunnah that is theah which we normally when we talk about Sunnah it's taken for granted it is the FI Sunnah that is Sunnah in and you know when we talk about Sunnah so this basically is the second category of must when we say that you pray the two raat sunah before f it is Sunnah of the Prophet it is Sunnah of the Prophet to sit and drink water when they say this Sunnah it is talking about the Sunnah of it indicates the word must so normally in day-to-day life when we Muslims say theah to do this and sunah to do that most of the times almost all when they use the word it sunah of the Prophet to sit and drink it is sunah of the Prophet to pray two raah before the Sal it of the Prophet to read and we enter the mosque all these mainly come into the category of must so theah is must things which are encouraged and in all these five categories of f must Mak and in Haram there are sub categories like as we discussed last time sins major sins minor sins so in Haram things there are Haram which are major Haram which are minor same thing Mak which are less Mak some are more Mak mu fine the prophet kept long hair it's mu optional but if someone does that optional Thing For the Love of the Prophet it'll get Saab though it's optional no Punishment No reward but if you're doing for the love of the Prophet then for that you get again so there optional things which the prophet did that car more weight than optional things the prophet did not do furthermore in must there is means a more important the two before the Salah is it's a more important Sunnah than the other Sunnah same thing in the in the first thing there are some which are more important some which are less important for example the five pillers of Islam number one is is a offering Salah fasting the month of Ramadan doing HJ if you can do giving zakat all these are more important F and abstaining from major sin this itself all discuss 7 come major F then there'll be less F so in all these categories there are subcategories but coming to a basic question that will we be punished if in intentionally do not do the Sunnah of the Prophet now this Sunnah you're talking about I assume it is the FI Sunnah if it'sah I've already given the answer the first four categories fah means it falls in the category of must which already discussed earlier that if you do a must act that is aah you will get reward for it you'll get blessings for it if it's then more blessings as compared to that also you get blessings but less but if a person does not do it intentionally or unintentionally he will not be punished for that but that does not mean because we will not get punishment for not doing the Sunnah we should abstain from doing it because we human beings we make so many mistakes we do so many faults we involved in so many sins this Sunnah when we do we get additional points we get rewards this will help us in fulfilling the Lacuna which is there in other faults what the other faults we do it helps in covering up our faults some of our sins so therefore a Muslim should do as much as sunah as possible just because he will not get a punishment that doesn't mean that he should not do it in fact he should try and do as much asnah must acts so that it will help him to cover up the other faults which human beings do and it will help him to go to Jah"
