  "title": "Medical Treatments Permitted while Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "in terms of uh Medical Treatments um whilst one is fasting such as nasal drops Su lingual tablets to be used under the tongue um or medical investigations where things are inserted into uh your body are these things permitted during the fast there are a variety of treatments and investigations the list is wrong we can have full episode on this I will not permit us to discuss all this I'll just mention a few which comes to my mind as far as sublingual tablets are concerned they are normally taken for Angina person has a heart problem he takes it this sublingual tablet is kept beneath the tongue it is not supposed to be swalled and it is not a sort of food or nourishment it gets absorbed and the treatment is done so because of this ruling it does not break the fast you should not swallow the tablet it goes sub quinly it gets absorbed without going to the throat if you use nasal drops as long as the nasal drop does not go to the throat and to the stomach it's permitted if you put your drops also it's permitted as I mentioned earlier or if you syinge the year even that's permitted as far as investigations are concerned if you do a PO vaginal investigation whether you insert a finger or you insert an instrument it's permitted or for treatment if you insert a vagina pity or you insert a douch or any instruments it's permitted if you insert an instrument in the uterus or any device known as IUD intra utrine device or you insert a catheter for investigation oroscope all these are permitted even if you insert in the unary tract that the urra a catheter or inject a die for doing an investigation it does not break the fast similarly if you take any injection as I mentioned earlier subcutanous or intravenous or intramuscular as long as it is not a nourishment for the body it's no nutrient for the body it doesn't substitute the food it's permitted if it's a substitute it breaks the fast further more if you take a little bit blood from the body for testing that doesn't breake the fast also and if you apply certain creams maybe cream or lotion or medical ointment onto the skin and it get absorbed by the skin this two does not break the fast and it is perfectly permitted and if you take other treatments like for example if you do a laparoscopy in which there is a small insertion made on the abdominal and insert a scope whether for investigation or whether for treatment or for a surgery it permitted if you do a gastroscopy in SOS scope into the stomach as long as you do not put in some fluids or some nourishment it's permitted for investigation if you put an instrument in the spinal cord to examine the spinal cord or to see how the brain is functioning all these are permitted if you do Anya even that's permitted and you can go on and on as long as the basic rule is that it should not enter the body through the mouth or through the nose or it should not be a nourishment otherwise if it enters any other part of the body any instrument whether it be the urra whether it be the uterus whether it be the vagina all these things and the basic rule it does not break the fast because it is not giving food to the body and this is not the normal passage for food for the body all these are permitted"
