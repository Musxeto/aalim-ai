  "transcript": "the importance of the first 10 days of the leja this is a forgotten Sunnah of a beloved you may have sinned all year you may have missed doing good deeds in the month of Ramadan you've been missed the last 10 nights of Ramadan you may have missed doing good deeds this is the opportunity make the best of it the first 10 days of July even if you have not sinned the whole year maybe you did some minor sins maybe you did about that in the month of Ramadan even you might have got the last 10 nights of Ramadan even you might have prayed the full night of life yet you cannot afford as a Muslim the opportunity during the first 10 days of the legend Allah takes an oath in Surah chapter number 89 was number one to two Allah says by Dawn by the 10 nights and the mufaserin they say these 10 nights that Allah is taking oath of refers to the first 10 days of the religion and in many languages when you speak about the days that includes the nights when you speak about the night it includes the day for example if I say in English I spent 10 days in London but natural it includes I have spent 10 days and 10 nights in London depending upon the context we include the full day it may include part of the day it may include the night it may not include similarly when in Arabic the knights are referred to it may refer to the night only it may refer to the night and they put together or it may refer to the day only in this Surah al-fajr Surah number 89 verse number one to two when Allah says Asher by Dawn by the ten nights the Mufasa Serene say and it's also mentioned in IBN Point number eight page number 413 and if you refer to the summarized version the English translation printed it is volume number 10 page number 468. that these 10 nights refer to the first 10 days of the leja and they agree that this first 10 days of Julija are better than all the other days of the year it's even better than the last 10 days of Ramadan but it's mentioned volume number five page number 412 that though the first 10 days of the leja at the best days of the full year the last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights of the year the scholars differ some Scholars few do say that the first 10 days of the are better than the last 10 nights of Ramadan there are few Scholars who say the last 10 nights are better than the first Enders of the religion but the right opinion and the correct opinion Islam may Allah have mercy on him and he rightly said that the first 10 days of dulhija are the best days in the full year it is even better than the last 10 days of Ramadan but the last 10 nights of Ramadan they are the best nights in the full year because it has the latest it is the best night in the full year so the last 10 nights of Ramadan are the best nights because and amongst the days in the full year the first 10 days of dholija are the best days in the year because it has the second place with the Quran refers that they witness the benefits which have been provided and may celebrate the name of Allah through the days appointed here these days are referring to the first 10 days of the lija foreign then simultaneously perform all the Five Pillars all the five Horizon of Islam if he wants to yes he can Implement on the Waheed he can offer Salah Summit listed together in the first 10 days he can give zakat if he hasn't given give obligated charity or give extra charity he then fast and he can also perform Hajj these are the only days in the full year where a person can simultaneously perform all the five pillars of Islam it is mentioned bukhari world number two Hadith number 969 he said there are no good deeds done on any other days better than done during the first 10 days than during these days and the sahabas the companions they asked not even Jihad and the prophet replied not even Jihad unless a person put in danger his life and wealth in the way of Allah and does not return with any that means he goes for Jihad and is mattered in the way of Allah that means a beloved Prophet Muslim said the Good Deeds Done during the first 10 days of jalijah better than any deed done on any other days of the year including unless if the person is martyred and he loses his wealth and life during Jihadi that's the only one Good Deed which cannot be better otherwise the day is done on the first Ender of the lija are better than any deed than on any other day of the year it is so important and unfortunately this Sunnah of doing good deeds during the first tenders of dhulija is forgotten"
