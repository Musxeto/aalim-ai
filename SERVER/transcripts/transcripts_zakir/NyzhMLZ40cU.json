Becker please go ahead assalamu alaikum Angela Birkett oh and I welcome all the wheels of the TV as well as those of truth or watching on my facebook and I would like to greet all of you Eid Mubarak and a couple aluminium income and MELAS manners I'll accept all our good deeds our cm / km our dois and inshallah may Allah forgive all our sins and drizzle in challenge and reproduce dr. Bilal Salaam alaikum we need a couple words and I'm getting for the viewers please I think that is accurate [Laughter] wait wait until you see Yusuf Estes his English is different I mean here's a previous salam alikum walaikum Salam rahmatullah very character y'all that is the know even in conferences here or there we don't get together it's kind of hard to get all those stars together on the same screen but by the grace of Allah rumba daughter Tina Fionna there we are and hamdulillah shockula after a blizzard month and a happy time they spin in the shade of the month of Ramadan in the fasting and their citation of the Quran and the yada and the Torah and the supplication and hamdu lillah wa shukru lillah I have lot of questions to ask you before we give the the floor to the viewers as well and give them our phone numbers to call today were only posting the landline phone numbers because we cannot afford to take all the cause of course so be very selective but let me begin by presenting this question to you all and let's see who would like to begin subhanAllah under lockdown many of us were very skeptical and we thought Ramadan is gonna be different we're not gonna enjoy but as a matter of fact there were a lot of positives in this Ramadhan more than any other Ramadhan under lockdown despite the closure of the massage bed but we had great benefits let me begin by chef Yusuf to share with us first did you not that this Ramadan we all know that it is different but did you not see any positives in spending Ramadan at home with the family rather than going to the Masjid on daily basis alhamdulillah rabbul aalameen who Allah did young Muslim mean we thank Allah for everything that he gives us and we thank him for everything he doesn't give us like the virus hum didn't love for everything yes I do know that there were a lot of differences in the anticipation of what would come about in this month we had a little bit of a preview because we had a couple of months in there before we get to Ramadan that we were aware of this spread and the things that we were going to have to shut down be sequestered in our homes and I II was a little bit concerned but then I remembered the Haditha results of the Lonnie what song I'm telling us about that the shayateen would be chained down they're going to be locked down so whatever happens it's got to be a lot better than it would have been any other time of the year and sure enough one of the biggest things that came out of it was so many people coming to Islam that was very unsuspecting for anticipated we're not anticipated by us to see so many people actually believing comments that we did a program every single night in Ramadan and we deceived these comments the comments were amazing especially about the hand-washing they said oh what is this you guys been doing that and we talked about the ciwec and we talked about some of the other things from the Sunnah that would help people to avoid this thing and that was one of many things that we observed but I don't want to take up everybody's time and just that one particular one to start off with was amazing just to see so many people coming to Islam hamdulillah yeah indeed we started our electronic Dawa on November let's say technically speaking on December 2019 and then right before Ramadan we had about 2100 new Muslims from all over the world then by the end of Ramadan we had over 3000 masha'Allah so yes indeed Ramadan we have not an increase in the number of the new Muslims from you know from Latin America from all over Africa and from North America as well dr. Bilal you have anything to share with us were the guards to the positives of spending Ramadan at rather than going to the machine well for us bismillah was a lot to ascertain rasool allah all praise is due to allah miyan was peace and blessings be on the last messenger of allah for us the here there was something we're always talking about you know every Ramadan because people have this confusion about taraweeh and to had Jude [Music] you know it's confused we had p.m. also there's another name for it so what is it and when is it and so I'll have the D laughs for this I can say for this Ramadan for us here in Addis you know what we did by praying at home is we did p.m. every night th how much from the first day of Ramadan to the last day and that's a whole nother experience you know as opposed to praying right after salat Anisha which is the common practice any of your son's leading the fires I mean I was any of your sons leading the prayer melody and humbleness man of his caliber is just sitting and waiting for his turn and that only increases honor and dignity is such an honorable dare Masha Allah may Allah bless him and all of you my dear dua and Imams dr. Thakur I would appreciate if you can shed some light on the positives that you and your family have experienced during this from a bond under the lockdown I was initially very afraid that we will not be able to get all the benefits of Ramadan and martial I will there were many benefits especially because of the long down and we could not go to the mosque I will just mention two or three of the major benefits number and other policy never ever have I been coming on the social media life because I have my own satellite channel and I feel the reach is bigger so this from man because of the lockdown we went down from our usual practice of having a shooting in a proper studio with the proper equipment so we said we cannot just sit and not do that normally you know we give lectures in in the month of our man and the audience is about 15,000 20,000 you know or 25,000 and maybe about a 2 or 3 lecture and meeting different people but this room man mashallah on the pitch TV alone mashallah on average every oath in the day I will say mashallah on average about maybe 13 or 14 talks I did live on the fish TV on all the four satellite channels along along with the Facebook of mine the Facebook as well as the Instagram the YouTube and the Twitter and mashallah the audiences were in million Lyla and people will be happy and amount of thousand it was in millions in fact I mean you want exactly 10 years before it was 10 years Michele this is the benefit benefit of logged on that opened myself to the social media this is the one benefit number to normally wear and Malaysia the cam is very shot that they have yeah because we were having aa separate room and Allah and few people with who I am what I am was very long and the last 10 days we had additional in the morning cam so we prayed on an average for about five and a half hours is less than this five to five in a pod which was these to me the benefit besides my dear she'll and since I was a child with my teachers who never do a decaf sometimes we did twenty days and sometimes we did ten days then in the remaining one-third of Ramadan every morning after we stand up in prayer for the whole night they were very tough fascio masha'Allah but we have learned and we gained a lot of experience so all of us will be stepping on toes from looking from the windows some looking from the doors looking for sunrise at the time of Yeshua to see whether last night was Lena to Qatar or not this year alhamdulillah from the rooftop I was able to look at the sunrise and we figured out which night was lailatul Qatar before I say anything I want to hear from you was it really a concern for you guys did you detect that because we have a video that we will be showing the beautiful sunrise of the morning as the prophet sallallaahu land described it that the Sun would rise without any rays you can look at it like you're looking at the moon insha'Allah do you have any you know any comment on that when did you feel that it was a night because even if you don't see sunrise during the night itself because Allah says it is ceramic wool of peace so whenever you are praying you feel that peace if you if you if you think share hues of you figured out which night is it would you tell us please yes I know exactly I found that in the Quran yeah it's cold expected actually I did see what we anticipated might be the odd night the 27th and so on the next morning for some reason I was outside in the morning I was doing some things in my backyard but anyway I observed that the Sun was coming up exactly like the hadith is talking about with no race coming off of it no clouds in the sky and I said well maybe maybe it was a low alum which night was it lay little cutter as far as I'm concerned believe me normally I never really try and find out midnight I pray all the time I ride behave rather than funny and zombies ten nights was the best as compared to all the previous Akbar Allah at Pierce because you know with the kids in the family we were in one place all the few times that I mean the full nine but the bother was more because more disturbing there was no meeting normally I'm in the harem in Makkah so we have the two km which takes approximately three and a half baths but there's too many meeting people in between so this time I shall Allah it was fantastic about more than five hours of em and maybe a pro 45 as of 45 minutes of reading the Quran and then do I it was mashallah almost all the nights I try to keep it and even there for me in itself and if thought that counts of Monday but to go anywhere I am in Hadees you know there is this there is a skyline of buildings so it's not an average worry about it I just know like dr. Zakir I just put all my energies because my position is that even you know the possibility that the night you think was the 27th could be the 28th or it could be twenty-sixth if you started a day late or a day earlier nah I don't even bother to get it to to that you know I just a just do it every night and if we catch it we've got it if we didn't we didn't serve an Allah as what we say agile ooh Bush our movement I mean we're we're exactly as you said if you have worked hard and exerted some energy during the whole 10 nights then most certainly of witness lailatul cut and masha'Allah in the scale of your good deeds you have earned a worship of 83 years and a couple months but you know people will be also interested to know did they did it did I do it al hamdulillah so cool I was it that night so initially we thought it was the 27th until the 29th came and then we found sunrises look at it together insha'Allah and see why the Sun rose on the day differently I think we have now look look at this time lapse video sure here's of how do you like the Sun well I I guess but this is sunrise for approximately 20 to 30 minutes masha'allah la quwwata illa billah when it rises the first 15 minutes it's like a moon with no rays whatsoever okay well I didn't hear you dr. Bilal I see you're talking I want to hear you salam alikum okay we go ahead I'm sure he didn't see it because you're watching us from your screen we had a little about sunrise with the time elapsed for about 30 minutes masha'Allah it was a beautiful sunrise like the moon rising not the Sun exactly in the hadith my dear respected senior Xu and beloved brothers and there are Rasul Allah Allah Allah Allah cinema says if the day of judgment established and we know for certain it is now the day of judgement the prophet salallahu alaihe salam assist if you have a phacelia in your hand which is the cutting of the date palm tree in order to plant if you have it in your hand then if you if you can manage to plant it before that if judgment established do it even though we already know it's over so there is no point planting a date palm tree you know you're talking about 20 years before you start eating dates out of it so what is the purpose of planting a date palm tree while it is already over and it is the day of judgment I think in my humble opinion and I'm learning from you my dear respected you that allah subhanaw taala says walk only a menu of SAR allah i'm alaykum wa rasuluhu min we as believers are requested to work and exert the best of effort and then the is from allah subhanho wa taala allah will reward us according to the intention and the world and the effort that we have exerted so it comes this year while you are in very interesting conditions we cannot even visit family members and shake hands and exchange visits and you know in invite others for meals and so on we even pray to eat at home in this lockdown how did this eat look different and yet still joyful and pleasurable and we as Muslims all over are enjoying our aid despite the fact that were locked down dr. Billa please well for me I mind my family and children are scattered in different parts of the world in the Philippines in in Turkey in Qatar in UAE in Hadees in Somalia in the USA in Canada I guess I could just say in all the United Nations I mean I've always wished that I could bring them all together you know and of course it's too too costly I couldn't afford it as much as I'd like to see all of them - ok but alhamdulillah due to the fact that the internet was there zoom was there you know masha'Allah we were able to all gather on Zoom and we in fact after Ramadan I plan to do this on a monthly basis every month I will bring them all together and we'll you know share our experiences what's going on keep that family in touch I mean we're doing it through what's happened it's such a but we never thought to do it on soom we could have done it from before a lot but this lockdown situation made it a necessity so masha'Allah for the first time you know we all got together at one time of course so all the grandchildren are there and masha'Allah you know it was really a joyous occasion for Hampton dr. Decker Decker by I know that mashallah all your kids are in case a seeking the religious knowledge to become the future greatest drama ma'sha'allah so how do you and your mrs. may Allah bless you both spend the aid without all your kids being around actually this was the first time in our life that after the kids were born but not that me and my wife did not spend the ease with my kids you know there are parts of Ramzan reacted away but never eat it was the first time so as it is we won the first time you know so we prefer to eat over on the face time and the time difference is five hours via in Malaysia and Putrajaya and my children and Riyadh my son is in Germany mom and my two daughters and I'm with Laura so we you know though the time difference after you finish I was Allah time together and then when my children finish the Salah because it's earlier there although the difference is five us but the difference approximately three hours because the finest Allah is early there so we spoke on the first time and we spoke for quite some time for the first time we did not be one together physically those pretty we were together and we were together on the FaceTime reunite all of us with our family members and make you see their great achievement through these sacrifices or being away from you to seek the religious knowledge to continue your heritage insha Allah share yourself and hamdullah all your family are around correct you're all in California now yes as a matter of fact one and you know we are close to my daughters and my grandchildren but they're far enough away that they haven't been to see us since the lockdown started but we've talked him on the phone the only one I've seen is Ahmed who is there's some yeah and other than that a beautiful thing happened I have one son who doesn't have any faith at all no belief in anything so well hold on a second did something good came out of this because he lives in Texas but the good news was that because of his he has a moon deficiency seriously where he had open-heart surgery when he was less than two years old so he drove all the way up here when the doing the shutdown started and he's been with us ever since and he's been such a blessing and a help to us and I give him a hard time about you know but he's so wonderful to work with in there I'm really enjoying this having my son with me and praying for him constantly every night and asking a lot to give him the best of guidance and on behalf of dr. bill olive dr. Decker and all the viewers to join me to make du'a for your son may Allah open his heart to accept Islam and to become a true believer I mean Allah Matty what's other holy Islam so that insha Allah he will be saved and that will please your heart and his mother's heart as well I mean alumni he alone Mehdi I mean and Subhan Allah the chose us use of Estes I travel with him heavily all over the world almost and subhanAllah after we work hard during the day when we go to sleep he's in the room next to me and I see that he's still online a a knock on him and on his door and say won't you sleep he says not yet not before I give Shahada so every day Masha Allah is given multiple shadows but we see it is Allah who grants guidance soon ever He wills so many viewers may not believe that Yusuf Estes his own son is not Muslim yet it's up to Allah in the kinetic demon vector well a kingdom llaha yeah the monisha who are alamo will move to deed surat al qasas and i'm not going to say in the ayah number or else dr. Decker will Romanian me right away by the way I'd like to add something if you don't mind that this idea of working 24 hours a day I used to work about 18 to 20 hours a day but then when I traveled with dr. Zakir Naik I said oh this guy is really showing me up he's sleeping like 10 minutes 20 minutes at a time and while we were traveling I was like I can't believe this guy but yeah he's my mentor when it comes to this subject of staying awake not wasting any time and I learned to come up with something when people ask me what about sleeping I said hey there's plenty of time for that in the cover in the grave in English too if you remember dr. Decker just mentioned our first live appearance together was on hoodie TV ten years ago where we were discussing one masala a caller asked and then he made a remark I remember the remark contract distinction contre distinction so our brother Yusuf Estes dr. bill I'll jump day and live on air and said wait a minute is this an English word so Zacharias said yes indeed it's in the dictionary look it up they said I have masters in English whatever and I I know English very well I've never heard of that word before he said yes it's an English it was it was contra distinction contra distinction and then and then he looked at other said you write native american native english i've never heard of that word before such a huge mic in front the fuchsia yusuf is hiding you beautiful smile okay we have very traditions and I'm going to ask all of you about your a traditions and in one of the eight traditions we have after we pray Reed will visit each other and we exchange besides there it all the kids and the youngsters and the youth are anticipating what is known as Edie yeah which is monetary gift you give somebody will go to the bank a few weeks before Ramadan is over to book maybe a couple thousand small bills other Tweenies fifties or hundreds everybody based on their capacity because whenever you meet people even in the street and after the eight prior you start distributing the new bills so you know for us yeah for for for a person like me a few hundred will do it but dr. Bellin mail address a new mashallah is just received a twenty fourth child masha'Allah am I correct that's great mashallah the guys still practice that tradition of passing on the idea or adjustable like congratulations and happy eight because it would cost you a lot when we do the Idi Amin I usually do it where I am of course the wines I said you know I send the idea to them whoever they are but the kids usually I just give it to those that are their poor relatives because also sometimes my my family because my kids here and now this one is two years old the other one is five so India and it is not happening meaning to them but you know I give to the sisters of my wife and my wife's mother and so on so I gave them this is my practice what is your favorite - no many prepare on the eighth day dr. bill Angela our tradition is that we do lunch a group lunch and and and we have with it pancakes you know what happens is that of course different families have differential so the other traditional food will be there but the pancake is always pancake with syrup and bananas and every day so what is for aid we don't have any specific tradition because our tradition is is whatever we came up with you know I don't come from a Muslim culture so so we don't have that tradition now but my wives they all come from Muslim backgrounds and you know they will have their traditional foods with it and hosting of course in your case I tasted the food in your house and it is quite amazing mashallah and that's why every now and then when I call you and I ask you to save me some of the delicious food I ate even the dude but you're the tea masha'Allah Allah bless you the beautiful family I'll have the love may Allah bless you and your wife and your kids so what is so special what did you eat today for a home for normally the past about more than 15 years we have always celebrated in in Makkah with me and my immediate family and extended family previously my parents to be the brother sisters and their family so you know more than 20 people of us mashallah but in the last three years since I've left India it is different so what we do normally here that I get the close family members of a close friend so and I give maybe a eat lunch or eat dinner in a restaurant and last year I remember 60 people okay but this year because of the lockdown I could not do it so I thought inchaallah maybe after the logged on is no word for was in Malaysia celebrating the Eid normally for one to one and a half month how did i h called you know so they have a know they have a custom where they keep on having fatty beef patties one at a time so that the full month they don't cook in the home that they cook only once and then meantime the travel today at home same day a delicacy and man that shall we have a special dish that is there in India called ash shihr' coma with a lot of you know I mean so that's a speciality that is a dessert she'll come and the fine of fine that it's an either and normally we even exchange the shivkumar amongst our friends local among colleges so this is the normal tradition and a practice you know it's quite interesting even though I'm an but I brought a lot of indo-pak spices Kolchak spices and I think he was yesterday asked my wife to cook some you know with the Pakistani food yesterday masha'Allah very delicious share views of Habibi besides the pancake what do you normally have innate well we're not too much into the pancakes as much as I love all to Ramadan I love it whenever my wife fixes the Texas thing its biscuits and gravy with a lot of meat in it that's what I love but on the Eid day we kind of change it and then we go for the dates I like the what's it called the big ones do it that much doing my story that I love those but my wife she likes this the sugary secrete so Korea South Korea oh she loves those and she has diabetes but she eats him anyway we love those yeah that's it Matt's big thing for us because we haven't met in a while but we can tell chef Youssef you've lost a lot of weight how did you do it alhamdulillah what I've learned how to do is to squeeze down the picture on the screen that's seriously I weigh over 250 pounds and now I'm down in the 160s so not quite a hundred pounds of loss but it's not a loss I gained back the ability to prey on the ground I used that to sit in wheelchairs in the airport couldn't put my head on the ground if I could sit you know I had to sit for everything and it was hard to stand up even to give a lecture but now hey gorilla doctor let's turn into some serious poke that will benefit the viewers I'm sure that we all benefit even out of this joyful discussion and hunger illah because this is a day and a lot of Matisse's in surah younus verse number 58 who'll be fumbling leahy of your body if a bitterly Cavalia FRA who were higher on min management so the Almighty Allah commands us to show joy delight and to celebrate on their days mercutio is why and how to demonstrate the joyful happiness of the celebration of the a what is the this way to do it well I think that you know last Madonna has told us to to celebrate at the heat as a way of affirming that the eid the fasting the month of fasting wasn't a month of torture you know that this was a month of strengthening our faith strengthening our resolve to to live lives which are pleasing to a lost one of the Allah and ultimately this is what you know should be celebrated that a loss Matala has provided for us in such a way that it is something shared by the community as a whole it's stressing all of that you know because the interpreter you know given before the the prayer and then the celebration that day becomes a day of celebration it's all reinforcing the the connection between our sacrifices as in the case of the fasting you know and at the same time what Allah has given us in reward for that sacrifice so inshallah this is a encouragement for us and realization for us that with every effort and striving that we have made every difficulty etc there is a good reward to come at the end of it you know that inshallah he's that expression of thankfulness to be alive at seven celebration this is what Allah says in surah al concluding the course of fasting well he took me Lully read data well II took a Barolo Halima had a Kamala alikum - karoon I'm gonna turn to dr. Becker and I'm gonna ask him you know we work with the youth worldwide in North America in Europe in Africa and these kids they wait for festivals and celebrations anxiously because it's all about drinking going out partying and stuff like that and hamdulillah we drinkin were in committing any harm will not go into the movie theatres were not going to the beach and wearing clothes exposing our bodies and but we're still happy where does this happiness come from what is the origin of this happiness I mean when somebody would when a non-muslim young man or woman next you and the flight and she says I don't see any sources of joy or happiness in your religion it's all about worship fasting and the eat the festival itself is an act of worship as well they gotta pray on that morning and you gotta do this and you gotta do that and and so on so how would you explain to those people who don't realize how happy we are why are we happy and what is the source of this happiness on our festivals without drinking without dating without going to the movie theaters Islam unlike other religion a child a dual role it takes care of the spiritual aspect of the human being as well as the physical aspect so rightly you said that we have to pray like any other day but they each prayer is something different and a beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said that for the each players all should go even the menstruating women and the children even the menstruating women who don't have to pray yet deaf to go to Ithaca and they even the children and you realize that it is the biggest largest annual gathering of a Muslim but metal not do something bigger but normally we have our daily prayer may be praying congregation in the mosque then we have a Friday prayer which is a bigger gathering the each player is a much bigger gathering and that joy of thousands of people or tens of thousands of people praying together something different so it is a mixed worship and enjoyment and but natural a blood prophet said that we're the best of clothes you can buy new clothes and as you said that one of the tradition is giving IDI so our children are very happy and they look forward to it so it's a mixed two-in-one and that is the best the when diagram is the best rather than you know like in the other religion when you enjoy you don't believe in Allah subhanAllah and you and you rather go away from los Manos Allah in Islam when you enjoy Islamic Lee you come closer to last mama and for example the other is when we when we slaughter or we sacrifice the animal we share it with our neighbor with other family members so if you see in Islam most of the avada it is dill now we pray also when we pray we stand shoulder to shoulder irrespective as the person standing next to you whether the king or a pauper whether is black or white so the Brotherhood the universal bet on something different then joy and happiness what we get in the ease in meeting people masha'Allah in the large gatherings and the exchanging greetings and parabola minimun come that you know melis Manav Allah accept our worship so all these thing it is the dual and mashallah while enjoying you come more closer to Allah subhana Allah rather than going away from Allah so Allah like I'm coming back to you to comment and learn a little bit more about the greeting itself for date but you know let's open the phone lines and I'm only taking calls on the landlines because other lines there is a huge traffic jam and the calls cause interference so landlines two lines record 0 0 2 then 0 2 3 a trouble 5 1 3 1 I guess we have another number it records 0 0 2 then 0 1 double 0 5 4 6 9 3 2 3 these are the only two numbers which would be taking calls if you have any questions were greeting for our beautiful stars and she dr.

Thakur was talking about the happiness which comes from within not from outside the permanent happiness the genuine cause of happiness you know best in this respect that those who live their religions whatever religion is and accordingly when they accept Islam it comes with a package of list of do not dues so the sister cannot wear those bikinis any more cannot run to the beach whenever she wants cannot drink and I have you know cannot have a date with her boyfriend lot of do not dues right yet they're happy tell me what makes those people happy this is not a typical festival that the normally celebrate where the night is in the nightclub there is a long queue and here and there but you know we change gifts to go to the a priori thank allah subhanaw taala la la comtesse karoon and we try to maintain goodness after Ramadan how do you describe this happiness and how does it evolve in somebody's chest to overcome the older traditions which used to make them happy or they thought that it would make them happy keep in mind one of our very famous predecessors say that in the kings and their sons were to know how much happy we are they would have fought against us in order to draw this happiness because they can never be as happy as we are even though were neither Kings nor sons of the Kings the microphone is yours I cannot hear you show yourself yeah well I muted my mic so I could hear your answer to my own question so do you want me to still answer it anyway it was that a rhetorical question or what and now and it seriously okay you have some first of all there is when you come into Islam there is some things you must not eat pork you must not drink alcohol you must not deal in gambling you must not deal in usury or interest this is very much clear but you didn't mention to those things what you did mentioned is something that's still hell out women can still wear their bikinis no problem as a matter of fact you know I actually well not to get too personal about it but a lady should wear the bikini she can in front of her husband right or no none you know you know what I mean be serious for a little bit please you don't want to tell people that they can't do something you limit certain things but you don't cancel out everything for instance so when the lady goes out in public she's covering her beauty is she's being modest she's not trying to attract strangers to observe her body when she's at home hello you know so we want to give the balance out there especially for the new Muslims to let them understand this is not a religion of like a monk or extremists and something if these are just limits to here and but then it wide open over here for instance I can worship any day of the week any time of the week it doesn't matter I don't have to single out one day in fact we pray five times a day to Allah Subhan Allah tell a minimum so we have the right to openly express our love and devotion to our Lord this is a big thing to me and I really would like to encourage all of the people watching right now who are not Muslim to consider the limits that we do have that provide for you the privacy security and safety of the things that you Mosul an excellent just a few callers have been waiting let's take a couple calls insha'Allah demon will hand it over to dr. Billin assalamu alaikum mustafa from ethiopia Salam alaikum mustafa Salam alaikum okay no problem he's been waiting for a while and other coolers so dr. bill AB again you take the serious part what is the source of the genuine source of happiness without all those fantasies that people think that it may bring them happiness whether superficial or temporary happiness we're talking about the happiness which stems from the heart can it can you share with the viewers how can person really find it a lot Matala through His Messenger you know gave us a way of finding that state that not so much happiness but state of contentment because the real lasting happiness is more one based on contentment than one based on the receipt of some material things of this life you know whether you've got a lot of money you won the lottery or whatever you are really happy but this is only temporary and that's why those people who you know who are movie stars and you know music idols and all is that all of this you find that yeah they got all that money but they committed suicide drug overdoses all these other things so it means that they didn't achieve that happiness through these material means you know they're it's only temporary whereas the kind of happiness that comes from a state of contentment you are content with what Allah has given you that is the one that the kings and the sons of Kings would fight us for because you can't get it from the material world and it's only with faith that we find it and this is why when they've done research into you know people who tend to become depressed and all this kind of thing they said that from their research this is Western research statistics and data shows that the people who have a strong belief in God they live the most happy nights they're happier than then the people who don't have if your belief in God is very weak etc then you know your happiness is fleeting it comes for a minute it's gone you know it's never really there but you know as Allah said aloud in the cradle I thought my inner hulu it is with the remembrance of allah and everything that comes along with it because when we remember Allah remember what Allah has instructed us to do with our lives how we should live this life it's such a it is with that remembrance that we find rest and peace in our hearts there's a higher Anya now beautifully presented I'm not Ola from India wants to greet you my dear respected shoe sister I'm not allah assalamu alaikum Salam aleikum is Mumbai respectable alone in Manama mental oh I'm so happy to be talking to all of you I love all my cynics for the sake of Allah I just want to say a very important name Ramadan has been one of the best rung down of my life I never felt so content so close to Allah so this Ramadan thank all of you for guiding us and showing us the light hundred and may allah accept from us and I just want to say I am so blessed so blessed it is being alone in such hard time Allah has blessed me so much this is what I want to share and thank you so much for guiding us all of you and eat Mubarak Eid Mubarak to you and to your family sister I'm not Allah and thank you so much thank you so much like a lamb please I love you all for the sake of a 19-yard wah I'm here trying to throw 100 from Rumsey from ethiopia Salam alikoum Ramsay avocado welcome to our aid party on holder TV go ahead Ramzan cuz I'm on tumblr hell yeah sure same to you - go ahead dear dr. zakir naik is my pleasure to see you today I have been a very good fun of you very long time ago and I've been watching everything and I've been happy with you and I've been I mean I've learned a lot of things from you like a low fire on rongzi and this is a quick reminder all the viewers whenever you call in you need to mute your TV or the device from which you're watching us so that there will not be interference with the sound Thank You Romsey jazakallah Huayra mohammed from switzerland as-salamu alaikum and welcome to our aid party on how the TV Mohammad go ahead Mohammed from Sutherland yes yes go ahead yeah I speak I speak me the darker my chord oh but I can I can take little back little big English but I speak although well I've been speaking for dr. Decker nay it's okay you wanna speak or do go ahead what Torah Torah or do go ahead no you wanna tell in Kahala by yellows or connect by a kiss I am your voice is not very clear little bit I get here not completely because of the wife's disturbance exact hello Hiram Muhammad slanting message has been delivered thank you so much in the Koran Allah Almighty says when whoo-hoo a hacker wear a burqa so the source of pleasure joy happiness logic even smiling or laughing it is him well can he the one who makes people cry whenever he wants to in surah taha as well as in surat al-baqara Allah Almighty said to Adam and Eve when they were sent down to earth for enmity and Nicole Minnie hood and feminity buddhaya in surah taha Monteria in surah al-baqarah Fela will no Alyoshka so Allah promised that what brings joy happiness and pleasure is strictly following his guidance which secures safety and happiness or contentment in this life as well as in the hereafter as well then on the other hand to confirm what you just said dr. Bilal woman Arabic live in Allah whom I shat on Lanka and for those who turn away from my guidance for my reminder the life would be miserable and that's why they take their lives despite the fact of being celebrity or having lot of money of becoming famous but they don't have that contentment so when Allah subhana WA Ta'ala loves somebody and he makes him loved by others and then he in his tells this joy the happiness and the contentment in his heart then he is the happiest even if he doesn't have the materialistic means which people assume that those are the action means for happiness yesterday my wife and I were talking about how this Ramadan with the best Ramadan and hamdulillah and one of the reasons is giving and how the prophets Allah Allah Allah cinema said in the hadith that the best of the deeds before Allah and the best of people and the most loved by Allah irrespective deeds so room to fill huwa ala kulli be Muslims so when you make a believer happy like somebody who's in need and he a system financially or they need some physical assistance or by any mean and you make them happy that makes a lot of happiest with you and accordingly he makes you happy so making somebody was in need happy by fulfilling his need by assisting them that is interpreted automatically into making you personally happy wanted to share with you the good news that was thakur share use of and dr. bilal philips that masha'Allah there was an organization looking after orphans and trying to feed 500 families during this Ramadan so we arranged masha'Allah in a very short period of time through just announcement over a hundred thousand sterling English Pounds and masha'Allah now when we managed to sponsor approximately 200 orphans by the grace of allah masha allah la quwwata illa billah even in lockdown while millions of people in America approximately 35 million Americans lost their jobs the queues on the food bank are in - even in California Shaykh Yusuf Subhan Allah but you find and handle let the believers and in Ramadan are coming forward to assist people whom they have no clue about they do not even know them and we do not know them either and accordingly there reflects into happiness in the hearts of the givers or the donors to be continued after this course assalamu alaikum another salam alaykom from Egypt wah-wah-wah-wah care to eat Mubarak to all of you thank you - insane - your Eid Mubarak our share I wanna say to you you know you are you are the reason to grab me and I'll also I want to say to our ship to survive Iraq and doctors like it - and also I want to say we were like to our share to use search and I went to our share we say to him I really really live the way you speak the way he loved everything get our use of what he is you yeah I wanna say to you I want to say to you you know let's say to you I'm living for the sake of Allah and all of you 10 F you thank you so much Thank You Ahmed from Mahmoud assalamualaikum Eid Mubarak - all you say thank you so much same to you Mahmoud Mubarak the harem I have a question dr.

Decker and a cushion from Armour from the way I would presented to insha'Allah after discourse Muhammad from Denmark wants to you my dear respected she of Muhammad assalamu alaikum Salaam welcome to our eat party Muhammad go ahead thank you very much aid Mubarak to all of you it is a blessing it is a blessing - here lies one of the most most respected this collapse I have I know it is really amazing to see you all guys alhamdulillah because last night you have gone through hardship we know that you are the one who who taught us guys the most Hardy City will when when a person is goes to to do to the hardship fitna the most reward will be you are the one who taught up guys and humbling that I have seen you doctor blood will out please use of SS SS doctor like and like doctor all of you may Allah bless you it is a blessing to see you like today alhamdulillah Eid Mubarak - same to you Mohamed from Denmark thank you so much dr. yaker from the UK was inquiring about the support story in surah al-araf the study of the people of the village e of the town on the Sabbath or Saturday he says he couldn't find it in the in depth on the same details either in the Bible or in the Torah so I told him that the questions you know pertaining any matter other than the Eden Ramadan can be postponed in other sessions inshallah unless if you're happy with answering the question the Venetian here just in short that everything what the Quran mentions about about the Jews and the Christians is not necessary in the Bible some are mentioned some not mentioned similarly whatever mentioned the Bible is not mentioned in the Quran as a general rule of the Sharia whatever the Bible says and if the Quran reconfirms we have no objection in accepting it but the Bible all the Jewish of the Christian scriptures failed and and the Quran objects to its me say it is not the Word of God if the Quran is silent on it we say may be possible may not be possible so everything what the Quran has mentioned is not there in the Bible and it is a vice versa Inchon the second doctor that can now allow me to reveals I've been concealing one of my main objectives of holding this gathering besides bringing happiness joy and delight to the viewers masha'Allah and celebrating aid and on Hoda TV screen something really serious which now it is time to share with the viewers the reason I invited those suspected to you to know that alhamdulillah were all one on the same path or calling people to the same Lord on the same man Hajj and hamdulillah luckily we live in Allah and his messengers and there's of the articles of faith and all of them are true seekers of knowledge and hamdulillah Sugarland acquired some degrees of knowledge have been working hard in the field of Dawa and have encountered a great deal of hardship but hamdulillah the hardship increased them nothing but strength masha allah la quwwata illa billah the DA who is seen on the screen by the grace of Allah Allah have utilized them for the guidance of tens of thousands of people if I'm not mistaken I'm talking about individually if I'm not mistaken one llahi hundreds of thousands of people you know if if we were talking about everyone because sometimes a lot of people they become rightly guided through listening to one of your audio or video recording which was recorded 20 years ago and you have no clue about what allah subhanaw taala is making them by the grace of allah as means of guidance it doesn't mean that any of us or any of those respected du'a is infallible or doesn't make any mistakes of course we're human beings and we do so in hamdulillah what is most beautiful about all of them is whenever you pick up the phone and he says a Cobra or Bilal about Amina or Yusef I remember once I picked up the phone and I said she Hughes of he calls me son and said look there is a little mistake here and no need to correct it what am I supposed to do I said hold your phone and you need to do this immediately he did it and this is a sign of being seeking the truth not seeking the personal image or the personal ego so I just wanted to share with you brothers and sisters that those people in front of you have done a great deal of service to the Ummah may Allah accept from all of them and may Allah pardon them and forgive them any shortcoming I mean I mean I mean dr. Bilal you're the academic man here I'm sure dr. wrecker is an academic as well me and use of Estes we follow your trail guys and hamdallah but I want to ask you a question one of the the things that dr. Thakur raised a few minutes ago when he said that what brings happiness is exchanging the greeting of aid you know in Hebrew don't say happy Christmas I wish and kisses on the Schiff's no we say a lockable carry if I'm correct sorry dr. Decker I'm a correct even though greeting is an act of worship talk to us a little bit about the concept of Kabul and a huge concern of the Sahaba and the predecessors as Salif may Allah be pleased with Allah for the respect of the concept of Kabul after every good deed particularly after Ramadan since I was a child I hear that this been six months making dry a lockable carry o allah accept from us our fasting and our a barrier during ramadan dr. Zeller dr. Beeler please well the concept acceptance identifies where our focus lies because whenever we do any righteous deed or any good deed we don't know whether it is acceptable to Allah or not you know the prophets also let me spoke about fasting the month of Ramadhan wiping out all of sins you know our daily prayers between our daily prayers wiping out the sins in between so many acts of worship will clear away sins and bring all temed rewards janet's etc but there is the key principle of our own sincerity our own intentions because the external actions that we do though Allah through His Messenger some lawyer seldom has promised you know that you do this you will get gana you do that you'll get this great reward their promises are there but the same time promises Allah did say in the man I'm Albania so deeds will be judged ultimately according to their intentions and we all know that you know we easily do rituals we're in the real intent behind them gets lost you do it happily you do it all the time continually you know maybe at some points you are focused and yeah you could say you did focus on it but so many other times you were you know just you're doing it so the issue of Kabul of acceptance by Allah depends on those intentions and that's why we risk we always think about me Allah we wish for others as we wish for ourselves that Allah accept you know what we do and that's why we also have all of these super auditory acts you know the Sunnah whether it is in Salah we have shown us a lot whether it is in in zakah we have sadaqa you know whether it is it hatch we have Umbra there are all these other voluntary acts that we do to make up for the deficiencies in the obligatory acts and since we have that uncertainty we're not sure our intentions will get us through getting our deeds accepted we have that additional those additional acts of voluntary acts you know which will make up for it so Allah is most merciful he is Raheem and you know he is a rock man Raheem and so we know that Allah wants to give us the full reward but it will happen not by itself by just wishing we have to make an effort so without that effort then we're not going to people ask well okay how do we know when we when our actions have been accepted then the issue comes how has it affected you if you have and you didn't find any difference in terms of how you are living how you are treating other people and all these other things then really you can be sure a bool is missing jazak allahu khairan jazakallah hyerin dr. Bellin that's a very good point kabul will be based on whether the action was a turning point in your life or not if you are still the same then definitely a Kabul is missing may Allah guide us what is best dr. Thakur Habibi insulting nor an iron number to anyone the Almighty Allah teaches us that whatever good that we do it is not because we are genius it is not because we are indispensable or unprecedented it's simply a gift from Allah he bestowed upon us including being rightly guided the maintenance of guidance and doing good deeds so it says well olefrog la la la kumara matter who Massacre a milkman a hardened evide well a canal ah I use that key man he sure had it not been for Allah as bounty and mercy upon you none of you would have become pure it is Allah who purifies whom ever he was if he can shed some light on that so that we understand that if if a hundred layer we perfected our fasting during Ramadan and I heard from you masha'Allah you stood up in prayer for the whole night many people have done so and we we will encourage to give any charity then we should turn around to tell Allah Thank You Allah for choosing us and guiding us to do that please go ahead after that and this is now rhetoric question you surfaces okay this is not for you this is for doctor that this Quran with a lesson for a new chapter number 24 mashallah and and I feel that it is perfectly correct and there is no one I mean I find my life is concerned it is has I'm in France Arabic it's only because of the Villa La Scala and I am one of the best examples to the human beings that I was a stammerer if you ask me what was my name during my childhood I would say my name is na da da da da I could have jumped on becoming the best doctor in the world I couldn't have 35 people and today everything is harder Memphis therapy it's only and only because of the great philosopher not Allah I know there are millions of people in the world immoral than me they're more intelligent than me yet people listen to my talk only because of Allah subhanAllah and even if you tangle a bleedin time till in 10 we will not be even adding a drop in the ocean Allah Allah and this realized bow when we do a bada and we know that you know there are question asked to us and we don't know the answer and Allah Allah puts it into our mind into our heart Allah and and and we keep on seeing that masha'Allah more the difficulties that come more life solving a problem more our faith increases hamdulillah and this happiness as we were discussing earlier that the happiness that people unfortunately most of the human beings think happiness is physical do a physical thing maybe with your world maybe with your health no happiness is a mental process it's a mental state it has nothing to do with the physical state it is a mintue status and what happen is to get like as you said that when you become a Muslim earth to give up your alcoholism gambling for all these things are the false happiness when we have alcohol when you have drug it takes you in a different state of mind which is temporal the true happiness is permanent and that happiness can only be achieved by Salaam what do we do in this world I mean people normally feel have been possessing well but the happiness you give in distributing wealth is a million that is much more then pull the signal then happiness is on a different level altogether and for every Muslim diet goal and ultimate happiness Hashanah they tell us so whatever actions we do it gets us happiness here but the main happiness is everlasting happiness it is and it is only Allah who can get you into into the state of Jenna which all our knowledge no human being would be general without the mercy of allah so allah and what prophet said this when the sabah what about you the prophets that even i so we realize that the movie Tangled la semana at ala the more languages we start realizing hallelujah how insignificant we are we are nothing so I humbly learned in the beauty of Allah and in Rome man when we contemplate and we really start thinking that Allah has been so kind to us has been so merciful to us and our faith in a line peace and our happiness increases and when we realized that the Allah tests people and Allah says that the bigger tests he gives you if you pass will be the higher rewards that better than all the obvious all the messengers Allah's monopoly they were testing the maximum much more than any other human beings and their status their reward would be the highest that's been even for a Muslim more difficulties come more our faith in Allah increases moving it happy so most of the people are thinking we know and the person who came on the phone said you know not the life is having difficult I'm believe me it is it is getting more happiness for us I'm more happy now then what I was four years back I'm more happy Malaysia I was in India I Manila and I'm pretty well as far as that allowed to keep on keep on keep on getting me closer to him and to forgive our mistakes and our and our sin and all of us each other but it's not gonna be over we'll be having more and more meetings of this kind insha'Allah so she'll stay just a couple more cause before whatever dub because they've been waiting for so long on the line and then insha'Allah we will say Salam to the viewers assalamu alaikum amino from ethiopia salam aleikum
