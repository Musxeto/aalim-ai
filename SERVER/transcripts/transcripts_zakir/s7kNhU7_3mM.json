  "transcript": "and we find that certain verses of the Quran \nare called out of context and one of the most   famous verses of the Quran in which the critics \nthey try and say that oh Quran says wherever you   find a non-muslim you kill him and one of the \nfamous critics of India as you know Arun Suri   he wrote a book called The World of atwa and \nhe writes in his book and he quotes the Quran   in Surah chapter number nine verse number five \nhe says the Quran says wherever you find a cafe   into bracket Sindhu into bracket Sindhu wherever \nyou find the kafir into bracket Hindu you kill him   you wait for him in every study gym of War so \nimagine if a common Hindu I know you need to read   this Quran says that whether you find the Hindu \nkill him then immediately there will be a reaction   if you start going against Islam so the \nproblem is that Selected Few people for the own   ulterior motives because of their writing and he \nwrote the book The World of atwa and he quotes   the same verse which has been called power \nin the list Surah chapter number nine verse   number five giving reference after verse number \nfive he jumps to verse number seven directly   any intelligent person will know why \nbecause verse number six has the key   they reply to his allegation in context \nif you read for a thought by chapter   number nine the first few verses speaks \nabout a peace treaty between the Muslims   and the musics of Makkah this peace treaty was \nunilaterally broken by the mushriks of Makkah   so by the time almighty God reaches verse \nnumber five he says that in the battlefield   that wherever you find your enemy kafir means \nan unbeliever enemy wherever you find the enemy you kill him in the battlefield \nif anyone quotes out of context   it will sound absurd imagine a few decades \nearlier there was a war between USA and Vietnam   and if the Army general of USA or the president of \nUSA tell the American soldiers in the battlefield   that my soldiers don't get scared wherever you \nfind the Vietnam you kill him it is to boost   up the model but today if someone quotes that \nthe president of America said that wherever you   find a weird name is kill him you will make \nhim sound like a butcher it's not a context   and but natural any army General to boost \nup the morale he will give moral support to   his soldiers so similarly when almighty \nGod says in the Quran to the Believers   that when the enemies come to kill you don't \nget scared to kill them so what's happening   and the next verse verse number \nsix is that if the unbelievers   if they seek Asylum it does not say let them go \nit says if they seek Asylum if they seek peace   escort them to a place of security so that they \nmay hear the word of Allah the Quran does not   say if the enemy wants peace let them go the Quran \nsays escort them to a place of security today the   most generous Army General the maximum military \nsoldier that if the enemy wants peace let them go   which army General will say that escort them to \na place of security but this is what Quran says if you read in context you come to \nknow the real message of the Quran"
