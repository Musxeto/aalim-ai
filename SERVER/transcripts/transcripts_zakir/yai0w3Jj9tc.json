  "title": "Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) Prophesied in the Bible in the Book of Deuteronomy - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "since Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was the last and final messenger he was not sent only for the Muslims or for the Arabs he was sent for the whole of humanity and the prophecy of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is mentioned in the scriptures of all the major world religions it's even mentioned in the Bible if you read the Old Testament it's mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 almighty God says I shall raise them for prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee and I shall put my words into his mouth and he shall speak all that I command him this prophecy which is mentioned in the Old Testament in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 almighty God speaks to Moses peace be upon him and says I shall raise them for profit from among their Brethren like unto thee and I shall put my words into his mouth and he shall speak all that I command him many of the Christians they say that this prophecy refers to Jesus Christ peace be upon him and when we ask them that how does this prophecy refer to Jesus Christ peace be upon him and they tell us the dear the prophecy says I shall raise them for profit from among thy Brethren like unto thee the prophet to come should be like Moses peace be upon him and the similarities and Moses peace be upon them is that Prophet Jesus and Prophet Moses peace be upon them both of them they were Jews and both Prophet Jesus and Prophet Moses peace be upon them both of them were prophets of God if these two are the only similarities for the Fulfillment of the prophecy then all the prophets mentioned in the Bible after Moses peace be upon Him fulfill the prophecy all the prophets mentioned after Prophet Moses peace be upon him were Jews and all the prophets of God for example Prophet Solomon Ezekiel Isaiah Daniel Joel John the Baptist all of them there were Jews and all of them were prophets of God who are the only similarities if we analyze this prophecy does not befit anyone better than the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him if we analyze Prophet Moses and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon them both of them were born naturally they had a mother and they had a father but Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was born miraculously without any male intervention he had a mother but he had no father and it is mentioned in the Quran about his birth in Surah al-imran chapter number three verse number 47 it's also mentioned in the Bible in the gospel of Matthew chapter number one verse number 18 and the Gospel of Luke chapter number one verse number 35 that he was born miraculously without any male intervention so if we analyze Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Prophet Moses peace be upon him and Prophet Jesus peace be upon Him is unlike Prophet Moses peace be upon him furthermore we know that Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Moses peace be upon them both of them they were married and they had children but according to the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was not married and he had no children so Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Moses peace be upon him and Jesus peace be upon Him is unlike Moses peaked upon him further when we read the Quran and the Bible will come to know that Moses peace be upon him he had a natural death same like Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him he too had a natural death but Jesus Christ peace be upon him he did not have a natural death according to the Quran in Surah chapter number four was the 158 he was raised up alive and according to the Bible also it is the same but many Christians say that he was crucified even if we agree what they say though I've given the talk proving from the Bible that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was not crucified he's not alive already was crucified he did not die a natural death so if we analyze we come to know that Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Moses peace be upon him and Prophet Jesus peace be upon Him is unlike Moses peace be upon him further we come to know from the Quran and the Bible that Prophet Moses and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon them both of them were accepted by the people as a whole but Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was not accepted by the people as a whole it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number one verse number 11 he came to his own and his own people forsakim so he was not accepted by his people as a whole furthermore Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them they were worldly kings that means they could give the punishment of life and death whoever they wanted that that power Jesus Christ peace be upon him it's mentioned the Gospel of John chapter number 18 verse number 36 he says my kingdom is not of this world and furthermore Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them both of them they bought a new law but Jesus Christ peace be upon him he did not bring a new law he came to confirm the previous law as what was mentioned clearly in the Quran chapter number 61. verse number six that Jesus Christ peace be upon him the son of Mary he said to the children of Israel Israel origin of Israel I have been sent as a messenger to you confirming the law what has come before me and giving blood Tidings of a messenger to come whose name shall be Ahmad which is another name of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him it's also mentioned in the Quran in Surah of chapter number seven verse number 157. it says they follow the messenger the unlettered prophet which is mentioned in the scriptures the law and the gospel so when we read the Quran it says that it will be prophesied in the scriptures in the law and the gospel about the coming of sallam so Prophet mama has been prophesied in the Old Testament in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18. and further it's mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 19 that anyone who does not hearken to his words I will require of him some translations say I will take revenge that means anyone who does not follow this Messenger to come almighty God will take revenge from these people"
