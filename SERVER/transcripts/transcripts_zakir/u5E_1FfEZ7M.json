  "transcript": "most of us human beings what is our purpose of life number one purpose of our life is how to earn a living majority of the people you ask them and you inquire with them number one the main concern is to earn a living they are more bothered about earning a living than how to lead a life and depending upon how much they earn their lifestyle revolves around it what will they eat what will they wear where will they live which school will they study which graduation course they'll take up everything revolves around the earnings and these people think that if i can earn good money in this world they have achieved the purpose of their life you know i gave the example of being focused you know most of us what we do instead of focusing on the eye of the bird and shooting what do we do we shoot and then we draw the bullseye around it we shoot anywhere we take up any course of graduation then when we ask why have you taken this course i haven't thought of it then they do speciality then they do super speciality and then they try and justify why they have chosen that course you know people first think how much will they earn and based on what will they earn they decide how will they lead their life this is just example of shooting in the air and then drawing the bullseye first we have to identify what is our center on which act does our life revolve around different people have different centers of their life some people they are self-centered everything for them is themselves at least bothered about anyone else in the world they are only bothered about themselves how they lead their life they are least bothered about others they are self-centered some people they are family centered their whole life revolves around that their family is happy they are ready to break and make any rule irrespective whether it's right or wrong to make their family members happy the main aim in life is to make their family members happy some may be parent-centered some may be spouse centered wife centered husband centered some may be children centered some people to make their parents happy they will go to any extent the whole rules and regulations of life are based on what their parents like and don't like allah says in the quran verse number 14 that they have enjoined on the human beings to be good to their parents interval upon travel that the mother bore them and in pain did she give them birth immediate next verse surah luqman chapter 31 verse number 15 says but if your parents strive do jihad strive and struggle to make you worship somebody else besides allah of which you have no knowledge don't obey them yet live with them with love and compassion that means our creator says you have to love your parents you have to respect them obey them but if they tell you to go against the creator against allah and his final messenger you don't have to obey them yet live with them with love and compassion there are limits some of us we are spouse centered we want to satisfy our wives or we want to satisfy our husbands and suppose the man's wife she wants a very expensive diamond necklace the person he can't afford it what does he do he begs borrows and steals but buys that expensive diamond necklace for his wife his goal is to satisfy his wife some of us we are children centered we want to satisfy our children and there are cases where sometimes the son wants to go abroad for studies the course in which he is getting admission is useless it will not help him in the akira won't help him here also but yet because the son wants to go abroad this person mortgages his property and sends his son to america and then says as though the objective of his life is to send his son to america to study what are the objectives what is the center of your life some of us we are society centered we want to know what do the other people outside our family think about us so full life revolves around the society some people they are neighbor centered they having competition with the neighbor that reminds me of an anecdote once an angel he comes and tells a man i am pleased with you whatever you ask i will fulfill your desire but there's one condition whatever you ask i will give it to you but i will give your neighbor double so the man says i want a rolex watch so the angel gives him a rolex watch but gives the neighbor two rolex watches the man says i want a mercedes car the angel gives the mom a serious car but gives the neighbor to mercedes cass the man says i want a big beautiful bungalow the angel gives him a big beautiful bungalow but next to his bungalow there are two big beautiful bungalows given to his neighbor so the man says angel please fulfill my last one desire what is it please break my one eye so that i cannot see with banana imagine he is more bothered about his neighbor than himself he is not bothered whether his life is simple or complicated whether he lives in poverty or luxury he's more bothered that he should lead a better life than his neighbor so much so that he tells the angel break by one eye so that my neighbors both eyes are broken this is how we are neighbor centered he's not bothered whether he's happy or he can see or not see as long as the neighbor is completely blind i don't mind losing one eye neighbor centered some people are friend-centered some people are enemy center they are more bothered what are the enemies doing what is my enemy thinking against me so they plan strategies if my enemy does this i will do that full time their full life goals in thinking what their enemies doing and you find this in various you have businessmen thinking about the enemy you have politicians thinking about the enemy you have students thinking about the enemies what are they planning so i will counter plan they spend most of the time in planning to counter the enemy i would like to give a piece of beautiful advice to them which i follow in my life if someone throws stones at you raise yourself so high so that the stones don't reach you if someone throws stones at you raise yourself so high the stone should not reach you so where is the question of competition where is the question of the enemy planning against you and there's another advice if someone throws bricks at you use those bricks to build your house when i was in school i have to learn martial arts karate judo and if a big man comes and pushes you what do you do you take a side step use this force to throw him over use this force if someone throws bicks at you use that brick to build your house some people are fame-centered they want to get famous the main aim is to get famous they can break any of their principles they can break any of their rules and regulations some people they are materialistic they are material centered they are more bothered what do they own what do they possess what do they wear and this is common very common amongst people or rich and when they meet their friends they start discussing what brand of watch are you wearing is it tiger is it omega oh it is rolex what is the strap is it metal strap or leather strap what is the basil or what kind of a dial do you have is it gold plated or the diamond studded oh designer watch party phillip and most of these people who are rich they don't have one watch they have multiple watches then they start planning okay this watch i vote today next time i'll not wear the same watch when i meet my friend so they spend their time in planning which wash to wear for which function these same people then start discussing about cars what car do you have bmw mercedes porsche rolls-royce maybach bentley designer this is the pastime and very often as though this is the identity if they don't wear that watch who will recognize them if they don't travel in the car if they don't travel in mercedes or a bmw we'll recognize them this is identity this is common amongst people of big cities on a higher level you go they start discussing what yacht do you have what kind of ship do you own on a higher level which jet do you own i have a private jet how many engines people may be wondering how come i know all these nitty-gritty of the watches of the brands you know the profession that i am in alhamdulillah fortunately unfortunately the profession that i am in i am mixed around with all types of people right from poppers to the kings allah has blessed me fortunately unfortunately i mix around with people of purpose to the kings and every opportunity i get whenever i meet a person who's materialistic i try and convey the message and i tell them you know your watch may be costing thousands of dollars or tens of thousands of dollars or hundreds of thousands of dollars my watch that i'm wearing it cost only 1400 rupees less than 30 dollars i have it for several years yet it gives the same time accuracy as your watch simple watch 1400 rupees allah has blessed me all these brands that i mentioned most of these brands have got gifts i've got gifts of these brands all these omega rolex many i got and i always follow the guidance of sallam i give it to other guys and i give it to my staff members so that i'm away from the shaitaan there have been occasions there have been locations where my hosts they send their private jet plane the private jet plane to get me into the country there were few occasions imagine the cost of the fuel of the private jet plane just to get one man the salary of the pilot the salary of the air hostess the salary of hiring the airport so i told this man that would have been preferable that you have given me an economic class alhamdulillah allah is blessed allah has blessed my family that mashallah we can own all these cars we can travel first class alhamdulillah so i told him instead of spending such a big amount you would preferably given me an economic class a ticket i would have come and you could have given the difference in charity in the way of allah my host also mashallah being very clever he told me that who can i send my jet private plane to pick up who is a better person than a day of allah so i told him inshallah life when was there inshallah i'll get the reward his niath was to give a servant of allah the best of treatment allah will reward him the point to be noted is i am not telling you that all these material things are haram they are not always haram you have to know your objectives of life they can become haram they may not become haram let me give an example suppose you belong to category 1 in which a person cannot afford these things this expensive watch is expensive cars expensive bungalows yet he begs borrows and steals or he takes a loan and he wears his expensive watches he thousand expensive cars it is called as israel it is haram we are second category of people who allah has given them the means as allah says in the quran in surah anam chapter number 6 verse number 71 we have bestowed bounties more freely on some human beings than the others what's allah says in surah alam chapter 6 verse number 165 that allah has raised some people in higher ranks and giving gifts to others so that he may test you so if allah has given you the means and if you have all these things expensive cars expensive watches expensive bungalows and if your life is revolving around it that you cannot do without it it is your center it is your purpose of life yet it is haram we have the third category of people who allah has given the means they own these things but they aren't dependent on them they own it you have examples of prophet salallahu salaam was rich and he owned but he wasn't dependent on it so if you own these things and yet you follow the guidance of allah you aren't dependent on these material things then it is muba it's optional it is not haram but the best category is the fourth category that allah has given you the means and yet you don't use it you don't acquire it like a beloved prophet muhammad sallam a beloved prophet muhammad sallallahu sallam the power he had the fame he had the command he had he could have become the king of the world that time he could have won all the riches but whenever he got a gift most often almost all the time he gave the gifts to the sahabas not that it was haram doing it if someone gives a good gift you can keep it it's not haram but the prophet he gave it to others the fourth category allah has given you the means but yet you spend those means in the way of allah we have to identify our center what is our center the most important center for the human being is he should be allah centered his purpose his goal should be allah and the last and final message and believe me if you are allah centered that does not mean that you neglect yourself you neglect your family that neglect of society if you're allah centered allah says that take care of yourself sleep at night allah says that take care of your family allah says about your parents in surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 27 24 that allah has ordained that you worship none but him that you be kind to your parents and if one of them or both of them reach old age don't say a word of contempt don't say off to them but address them with honor and load to them you having of humility and pray to the lord they cherish them as they cherish me childhood that means if you are centered you have to love your parents you have to respect them you have to obey them only when they go against allah and israel that's the time you don't obey but live with them with love and compassion so luqman chapter number 31 verse number 14 and 15. if you are allah centered that does not mean they don't take care of your wife it is the hadith of a beloved prophet hadith number seven three nine six a beloved partner said the best of the believers are those who are best to the family especially your wife allah center doesn't mean neglecting a family neglecting your society allah says in surah mount chapter 107 verse 127 that you provide neighborly needs help your neighbors a beloved prophet muhammad said in hadith in say bihari number one book of faith number thirteen that a person is not a believer if he does not wish for his brother the same thing what he likes for himself that means take care of the people so by being allah centered it doesn't mean that you're neglecting that you have to lead a life of a pauper your focus should be allah if allah has given you wealth see to it that use your wealth for the cause of allah if allah has given you fame use that fame for the way of allah if allah has given you qualities if allah has bestowed gifts on you use it for the cause of allah you"
