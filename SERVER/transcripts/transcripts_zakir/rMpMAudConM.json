  "title": "Is it Permissible to Watch Ertugrul a Turkish TV Serial Promoting Islam? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "upon you and your family i mean you are one of my favorite scholars i have learned a lot from your lectures may allah give you jaza hair let me remind you i am just a student of islam and comparative religion i am adai i am not a scholar and the question continues there is a turkish dharma earth which has broken all records on the youtube muslims in the subcontinent are praising it so much that anyone who tells them not to watch it is considered anti-islamic this serial is supported by arizona and imran khan also praised it though when they literally had to pass a fatwa against it this serial has germaram hugging and touching each other music and love story plus the story is also not authentic what is your nasiha advice to the youth who are wasting their time in ramadan in this haram cereal a similar question asked by my name is from kashmir is it permissible in islam to watch arthur guru syria a similar question is posed by habiba misbah uttar pradesh india my question is that how is it to see turkish drama or guru another question similar question posed by faisal khursheed pakistan what does islam say about watching dramas and movies my question is in reference to the turkish drama or guru gazi which depicts which depicts the glory of muslims during crusades against during crusades against the crusaders i am aware that we received i think hundreds of questions from the hundreds of thousands of questions at least hundred questions may be only on earth i will give the answer but please don't limit this answer is not limited only talking about earth series first let me tell you that i being in the field of media almost all the movies the dramas almost all 99.9 percent that are they will not fulfill the criteria of halal some are less haram some are mohara islam and not broken any of the criteria so let me tell you for sure that almost all the movies some are moharam some alice around some have broken the kabira somewhere broke in the sagitta as far as urdu guru is concerned i have not done a deep survey on orthogonal so i cannot answer to everything of untrue but yes i have read reports i have read articles saying also girl is one of the best serial in the world not only on youtube throughout the world it has broken record even of hollywood that's how i came to know about this serial called orthogonal it is made in turkey and what i read was 157 episode each episode was for about 2 hours 15 minutes and some weight is boiled into three so 157 episodes of the cereal was then it has been translated into various languages of the world urdu english many dubbing are there into umpteen number of languages that is their netflix etc yes what i came to know from the articles that i read and what little bit you know it is less it is it cannot be fully permissible because there are lady actors which are not in hijab so it cannot be hundred percent halal there is music in it which again cannot be around as the brothers said there is huxleys etcetera but surely it is not like normal movies like bollywood and hollywood movies there is no smooching there is no love making scenes etc yes shaking hands hugging etc not like the bollywood movies or the hollywood movies so it is it is not it doesn't have those bigger haram but yes there are ladies not in hijab there is music in it there are certain things wrote about islam which is against akida there are certain things which is against the tahiti so surely it is not totally islamic at all so no one can give you fatwa that is watching is permissible but i would like to go step further that what was to realize that because of the evil that is spread throughout the world anyone who is not watching serial i would recommend this is haram for you don't watch it at all please if you are not if if you are not watching movies because that's haram if you are not watching serial my recommendation is read the quran it will get you closer to allah read the hadith will get you closer to allah read the seerah it will get you closer to allah but those people who are addicted to movies there are many muslims millions of muslims in the world who i know they're addicted to movies even if they may not be addicted to the very vulgar movies they addicted to the normal hollywood movies and bollywood movies which is asara they may not be watching pornography but they're watching the normal bollywood movies in which the ladies are dressed with with with with with skirts and with with you know revealing the body more than covering it there are music there are songs away from islam so if such a person who's hooked on to the normal bollywood movie and the normal hollywood movie or hooked onto the normal serials that you see in the star tv or the ztv or all the other serial and all of them almost all haram this is less haram than the bollywood movie than the hollywood movies surely there are no love making scenes there may be a little bit hugging that's what i'm told so based on that if a person is hooked on and he can best option for people hooked on stop seeing movies that's the best but if you cannot then seeing such cereal like arthur girl is better than seeing the hollywood and bollywood serial what i had seen many years back was message and the best movie according to me that has been created in the world any movie it is message again the message movie which arabic the message movie it was the actor was anthony quinn if you are the father is it 100 even the message movie which i saw i cannot say 100 halal because there was music there was sometimes ladies being shown which were not properly dressed but the way it was created the way it was made is superb it will surely get a person close to islam but yet i cannot say 100 halal but if you want to watch a movie if you hooked on to a movie then please watch message the umar series it was a series of 30 episode made few years earlier it was made by the mbc and funded by the qatar qatar foundation even that i've seen that you cannot say 100 percent islamic there was music there was some scenes of ladies but as far as message is concerned and um mercedes are concerned the the the knowledge in it the the hadees is quoted the quran is quoted is wonderful it will surely get a person closer to islam there is no obscenity in it there is not major haram in it yes music is it and and alhamdulillah as far as mercedes is concerned majority of the hadith aside there may be a few here and there which may be problematic so the best amongst all i would say is you watch the message movie if you hooked on to movies if you're not looking for movies don't watch message if you hooked on to serial the best serial to watch is the series of omar series ursula will not come on the same level as as as message it will not come on the same level as um series but let me tell you that suppose there is a lady who is wearing many skirts and if she says okay i want to wear shavar kami's but my hair is open is it permissible keeping your hair open is haram but better than wearing mini skirt so tell that lady who's wearing many skirts and deep neck okay stop that where sarah commute which covers the body completely with full sleeve covering your full body except that is seen is your hair that is multiple times better than me i say oh no no you want to leave mini skirt wear full hijab otherwise don't so this is this will be a foolish answer if you are wearing mini skirt do either hijab or continue wearing mini skirt i will tell you okay stop mini skirt where shalwar kami's cover your full body of course covering your full body and only showing your hair is a lesser sin as compared to wearing mini skirts and wearing low neck so similarly those who are hooked on to cereals and movies and then if they watch arthur and or so everything is authentic maybe 20 is authentic but it tries to get a person closer to islam and tries to revive your passion please let me tell you again i have not done a full survey on the orthogonals release i'm not the app person but what reports i read based on that yes it is haram singing or toggles but if you're hooked on and if you're watching bollywood movies and if you're watching hollywood movies surely watching this and not watching that is better then not watching this and watching hollywood movies i am very clear instead of watching a hollywood or a bollywood movie i would prefer you stopping it number one if you can't stop because you hooked on to serial then watching earth is better than watching bollywood and hollywood this in short but yet it is haram but surely it will be a lesser haram as compared to the hollywood and bollywood movies and inshallah this may get you closer to islam and that time and maybe later on you may stop watching all these haram and then follow and then eating the quran is the best reading the hadith is the best and it is my desire for example i i cannot make a movie even like messaging if i want to because it again it's against my principle if i want i cannot even make a serial like omar siri leave us because it's against my principle there is a desire of mine that inshallah inshallah one day i would like to make a movie better than the message movie which is the best available but following all the principles of islam you know we should not have any musical instrument but you can have islamic sound effects which are halal you know which following all these principles it will be difficult like how we doing the peach tv on the peach tv masha'allah we have no music at all we have the sound effects of human being we have the alap and since duff is permissible by some of the scholars some say no we do use stuff so based on this inshallah library to allah that me fulfill my desire that one day i would like to make a movie totally islamic following all the titles of islam whether it be on the life of rasulullah or maybe on the quran or maybe on some other islamic topic and a very high quality it's my desire so that at least we can say there is one movie of high caliber there may be movie of low caliber which may be following islamic principles totally i don't know of them maybe but of high caliber of high quality like the movie of message i don't know of any i pray to allah that may he give me the opportunity to do that inshallah before i die inshallah hope that answers the question"
