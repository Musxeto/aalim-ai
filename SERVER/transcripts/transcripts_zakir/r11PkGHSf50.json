  "transcript": "i would like to end my talk by giving the last example of professor radhakashan professor tarada goshan is head of the department of anatomy university of shanghai in thailand and he spent a great deal of time doing research of pain receptors we doctors previously we thought that only the brain was responsible for the feeling of pain recently we have come to know that besides the brain there are certain receptors in the skin which are called as pain receptors which are responsible for the feeling of pain without the pain receptors the human being cannot feel pain that's the reason whenever a patient of burn injury comes to a doctor he takes a pin and pricks it in the area of burn if the patient feels pain the doctor is happy it's a superficial burn the pain receptors they are intact if the patient does not feel pain then the doctor is sad the pain receptors have been destroyed it's a deep burn the quran mentions in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 56 as to those who reject our signs we shall cast them into the hellfire and as often as the skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skins so that they shall feel the pain what does the quran mean by saying that as to those who reject our signs we shall cast them into the hellfire and as often as their skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skin so that they shall feel the pain indicating that there is something in the skin which is responsible for the feeling of the pain and today the scientists and medical doctors have discovered that there are pain receptors in the skin which are responsible for the feeling of pain when this translation of the verse was given to prophet he said it is impossible how could a book written 1400 years ago mentioned about pain receptors he could not believe in it later on after verifying the translation and speaking with other scientists he was so impressed with the quran that in the eighth medical conference held in riyadh in the conference itself he said mohammed rasool allah there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon me the messenger of allah"
