  "transcript": "the eighth most common question asked by a non-muslim is that why does islam permit a muslim to have non-veg food you know killing animal is a ruthless act so why does islam permit a muslim to have non-waste in food i would like to mention the outset that a muslim can be a very good muslim even by being a pure vegetarian there's no verse in the quran that says it's compulsory for the muslim to have non-veg food but since the quran and our creator allah subhanahu ta'ala have given permission for the human beings to have non-veg why should we not have the quran says in surah maidah chapter number five verse number one oh you believe fulfill your obligations and eat of the four-footed animals with the exceptional name eat of the meat of the four food animals with the exceptions name quran says in surah and hell chapter number 16 verse number five we have created for you cattle and from it you derive warmth and many benefits and of the meat you can eat quran says in surah amin chapter number 23 verse number 21 that verily in the cattle is an instructive sign for you we give you to drink from what is within their bodies and you derive many benefits from them and of their meat you can eat so when quran has given permission to have the meat of the lawful animals then why should we muslim not have it"
