  "title": "I want to be a Full Time Daee. How can I earn my Living and in which University should I Study?",
  "transcript": "next question Muhammad Ali Talal from Islamabad Pakistan recently I have completed my 12 years education and I've decided to become a professional died mashallah in short I have decided to be like Sheikh amedy that in you please guide me about such a proper path so that I can also earn enough to carry my Dawa mission throughout my life my parents are blessed enough to send me abroad for study should I go to medina in a city or somewhere in Makkah or just add in Pakistan should I go to some mothers are awesome University should I first become a scholar of Islam and then die or can directly jump into the hour a similar question is asked by Nasim from Bangladesh I want to educate my son in Islamic education please tell me the names of some Islamic educational institutions inside and outside Bangladesh from which my child can acquire knowledge of Quran and hadith I want my child to acquire the highest knowledge of Islam in the light of Quran and Sunnah as far as these questions asked is concerned in the first question the first part of the question was that how can that out to become a professional day so how can I earn my living so that I can continue doing my profession of Dawa and this question was asked to me during the last session I just repeat in brief the best is that if your parents are wealthy and they can support you and they can take care of your day-to-day nature expenses and you continue doing Dawa and you and you make your life for las manos Allah that is the best if your parents are well-off and they do it is the best number two the second best can be that if Allah has given you that acumen and and that knack of doing business and being successful in business you can spend a small portion of your time maybe 5% of your time in doing some business as a small part time which can get you sufficient money so that you can realize I'm concerned mashallah in the initial stages my parents supported me fully completely financially they said you need not do any profession and a hamdulillah my parents and my brother and later on I started doing my own business and I have to spend about a few as a week not doing a fish time during you know normally people have one or two days off in a week you know one day off a few hours in a week maybe one or two days in a month and that time I have to do business and in that business Allah blessed me so much that I started earning more than my parents more than my brother and hamdulillah I still plays a small portion of it for my family and the major portion has to give in charity so first with your family if they can support it number one second is you can do a business of our life huge acumen and the best example is of of the Saba observe Minh Minh off may Allah be pleased with him people have to say that whatever we touched it became gold when when they migrated the swabiz to Medina and when Ansar were willing to help them he said no show me the place to the market he went to the market and came back with enough wealth because I had given him that gift number three as I mentioned earlier is that the rich Muslims can make a fund for supporting the died the dwarfs so that they need not worry about the living and they support them so the rich people get the swab of the Dawa with the die they are doing without the swab of the die reducing number four you can join an organization join Islamic organization which is of your school of thought which is according to Quran and Sunnah you join them and if they can pay you a salary even it may be less than the others you are doing both together they are doing now in the organization and in getting a salary and the last resort the fifth is you can join a higher company it may not be an Islamic the organization it may be a Muslim company not later Adamo it can be a non Muslim company as long as it is halal see to it that that company has two days off in a week the timing the less it is asked for the government rules so that you have about 50% of your time more than that for doing Dawa these are the various options that take care of your day-to-day living in Chandler as far as the second question is concerned that which university should region should you go abroad medina Makkah or Pakistan or the lady who had asked in Bangladesh which is the university that I would recommend according according to my knowledge one of the best universities that I feel that can give the knowledge of Quran and say hadith it is geometry mom it is imam muhammad saw density imam muhammad bin Saud University which is in Riyadh in Saudi Arabia but unfortunately this university is mainly for Southeast only a very small percentage maybe two three or four percent initially to one person now I think it four percent of the foreigners are allowed for very small portion allowed so to get admission you know like in India I think the quote has one a year so thousands of people apply only one they select from the thousands applying similarly from each country they have a very minut number of people but alhamdulillah when I approached the Deen director at that time I said there why don't you allow all our students who have passed from international school to join the University and a humble in a fourteen that pass seven wanted to take the mainstream become doctors engineers 700-acre that were field and all seven of them are hamdulillah what admission into the Yemen Imam University in Riyadh the other good University it is the Islamic University of medina that's in Saudi Arabia this University one of its purpose was to give admission even to foreigners so 50 percent of the students are Southey 50 percent of foreigners so they have a quota maybe of 40 or 50 students from from India each year bigger number from Pakistan they have a quota from Bangladesh here is much easier as compared to getting into Germany mom but yet it is difficult there are hundreds and thousands applying and yet the photon is limited so according to me the other good University is the Islamic University of Medina the other good is also doable kora from Makkah for a foreigner I would I would prefer that for a foreigner he can go to some guru city of Medina and but only going to the university is not sufficient besides standing in the university you should also attain the Druce of the scholars there are many scholars giving jurors giving lectures taking session in in Medina in the prophet's mosque outside even in in Makkah and even in via the Khobar Alma there are many great scholars in Riyadh and even in Riyadh UK so the one of the thing is besides going to university I would also recommend that you attend the Guru's of the great scholars this will help you more than studying University so doing family ously it is it is the best so I recommend that you can go to any any of these University regarding the third part of the question that should I first become a scholar of Islam and then die or directly jump into Dawa to become a scholar of Islam is a very great I don't consider myself to be a scholar of Astana I'm just a die scholar you have to have a great deal of knowledge so person who does graduation from the Islamic University I don't consider that he is calling some maybe but not all neither is a person rather than master neither personal than his PhD I consider these people a student of knowledge a scholar someone who's a booster head someone who is an alum they thought there the difference between getting an alum degree from a mother aza or a university and being a true alum or a true scholar in the world of a difference so the thing is there that I believe today in the world there are very few scholars of Islam I was called a is the most ahead a person was a fuck' not getting a degree of Figment actually  and a beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said that badly go undeveloped aya propagate even if you know one was so even if you know one was so bored islam as long as you know it correctly you have to propagate it so you don't have to wait till you become a scholar you whatever we know you can start doing Dawa immediately but the roll of a die a good day is that in the fringe to the scholar he the books of the scholars the the the teachings from the Quran say hadith the Sabhas the you have the whole Pharisee Dean you have the Amos and then you have the mooster hey they are the Chagall Islam and you have the present they they read and what Fatah was the scholars have given the dye makes it acceptable to the masses and I need not be a scholar he can be a scholar but add I need not be a scholar and most of the guys in the world today aren't scholar even I don't consider myself to be a scholar I am just a student of knowledge but for a general Muslim it is his duty that he should convey the message even if he's not a student of knowledge whatever little bit he knows he knows there's one God you know there's one Allah ok can read that he knows that vamos lá lá something the last and final messenger he has to convey that so whatever you know even one ayah offered me the Prophet you have to convey it to the others"
