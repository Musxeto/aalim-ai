  "title": "What is the Purpose of Our Life? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign the honorable scholars speakers the respected guests my respective elders my dear brothers and sisters and the millions of viewers who are watching this program live on peace tv i welcome all of you with the islamic greetings assalamu alaikum may peace mercy and blessings of allah of almighty god be on all of you the topic of this last lecture of the last session of the last day of the ten day international islamic conference peace the solution for humanity is what is the purpose of our life how many of us have really ever thought in their life what is the purpose of our life how many of us have ever thought what is the purpose of our existence what are we doing here why are we here let us start analyzing right from here itself i request all the people in the audience all of you if you have ever thought in your life what is the purpose of your life please raise your hand i would like to know among the audience how many of you have ever thought in your life what is the purpose of your life fine maybe i can see 10 50 maybe 100 hands an audience of more than hundred thousand that less than point one percent some may have felt shy to raise the hand so surely i can say less than one percent of the human beings have ever thought in their life what is the purpose of our life is it required that should we know what is the purpose of our life to help you let me give you an example once a man when he was traveling and when he came at a crossroad he asked the passer by where does this road lead to the passerby asked him where do you want to go the man replied anywhere the passerby answered then take any road it will make no difference imagine that traveller he had no goal whatever actions he did whatever deeds he did it made no difference because he wanted to go anywhere and many of us are leading our life in the same way let me give you one more example imagine there is a builder who starts constructing his building and he lays the foundation and he digs a big hole for the foundation and when you ask him how many stories is your building going to be he says i don't know how many square feet is the build-up area he says i haven't thought of it the builder has got no goal at all once there was a man who told his neighbor your dog always chases vehicles and cars i wonder will your dog ever catch up with any car the neighbor replied i don't wonder whether he'll catch up or not i wonder if my dog catches up with the car what will he do the man who asked him will the dog ever catch up with the car he's short-sighted the neighbor who was the owner of the dog he was fast-sighted even if he caught up with the car what will he do what is the purpose of his goal and unfortunately many of us we are leading our lives same fashion just like the dogs you know people do graduation and you ask them why are you doing graduation and they don't know the reason just because they want to be a graduate what will you do after you finish your graduation i haven't thought of it yet most of us are leading our lives like that traveller or like the dog who's chasing cars absolutely without a purpose many of us we copy goals of others without scrutinizing it when we ask a student why are you doing commerce so he will reply because my friend is doing commerce many people they emulate and they copy the actors the models without realizing what they're doing once a person comes from the village to bombay to become a millionaire and when the question was asked him why have you come to bombay so he gives a reply that i have seen amitabh bachchan in the hindi movie he is a popper he comes to bombay and he becomes a multi-millionaire overnight that is the reason we find many people coming from outside bombay and they're settling in bombay to become a multi-millionaire overnight and that's the reason you find that the sums in bombay are increasing many times we see actors and models they are brand ambassadors and they endorse certain products there was a person who purchased a new car hyundai i-10 and when the question was asked why have you chosen this particular car hyundai i10 so he says my favorite actor shahrukh khan he owns hand i doubt whether shah rukh khan ever sat in hand i10 except in the advertisement he may be owning a mercedes or a bmw or somewhat similar i doubt whether he owns an i-10 you know shahrukh khan endorsed the watch tag her he's a brand ambassador of the watchtower and we find many of his fans buying tag here i wonder what has tagore got to do with the acting of shahrukh khan has that watch has that wristwatch ever helped him in acting i doubt whether he wore tiger before he became a famous actor also so these are the various ways the media promotes products and unfortunately we blindly follow goals of other people without realizing what we are doing imagine this industries who buys a textile factory and when asked why have you bought the textile factory he tells us that i have come to know that there is good profit in textile business then you ask the next question do you have a feasibility report he says no have you had someone to take care of your business have you hired a ceo chief executive officer he says no what is the percentage of profit you will make he said i don't know where will you buy the raw materials for he says i haven't thought of it where will you sell your textile he says i don't know do you think that businessman will make profit in the textile industry imagine there's a person who has a goal he wants to become the best scientist of the world what does he do he does a survey of all the scientists from the first human being adam peace be upon him till today and after doing a survey he comes to know the best scientist of human history was isaac newton and his survey was correct after that what does he do to become like isaac newton he starts growing long hair curly hair like isaac newton he wears shoes like isaac newton he wears clothes like isaac newton do you think he will become a successful scientist such people have a goal but the planning is wrong they have a planning they did a survey of the scientists but the planning is wrong"
