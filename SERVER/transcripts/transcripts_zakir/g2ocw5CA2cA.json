  "title": "In Islam, Jesus Christ is a Human Messenger Held in Great Honour - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the concept of God in Christianity before I discuss the concept of God in Christianity I would like to make a few points clear Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messenger of God we believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern Christians today do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers with God's permission the Christians and the Muslims we are going together but one may ask then where is The Parting of way The Parting of ways is that most of the Christians believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was Almighty God and he claimed Divinity in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God always says worship me"
