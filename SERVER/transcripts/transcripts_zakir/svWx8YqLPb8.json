  "transcript": "the first question if from a non-muslim he think peace be upon you my name is Abraham from New Delhi the question is when people reward back to Islam like Cassius Clay Sony Billy Williams and Mike Tyson and many more so Muslims say that God gave them guidance hidayah so that's why they reverted I wanted to know why he God didn't give guidance to everyone why he gave guidance to some people and not to all and this is a very important question by abra Devorah him Allah says in the glorious quran in surah younus chap number 10 what's the man I 9 that if he wanted he could have made all the human beings in this world as believers so for Allah to make hundred percent of the human beings now there are more than seven point seven five billion human beings for Allah to make all the human beings as believers as Muslim is very easy confession but the question is that we human beings are one of the best creations of Allah so Muhammad Allah and Allah says in the Quran answer a multi-tap number 67 verse number two a little north of Al hatha it is he who has created that and life to test which of you is good indeed so this life is a test for the hereafter so when you are coming in coming for a test for an examination the supervisor cannot help you and even if you do something wrong can pass him I mean supervisor can can consider that you don't that you don't break the rules the teacher can give you grace marks but cannot pass you if you have failed and did not write anything or broke all the rules so in the same fashion regarding the question if Allah wanted you could have made all the human being the Muslim but then what is the difference all the other creations of Allah Muhammad Allah except the jinn and human beings they obey Him so what difference is in this creation of human being regarding why did he select few people there are some criteria for Allah to select who he guides Allah says in the Quran in surah in tabooed chap number 29 was from 69 that if you strive in the pathway of allah subhana wa ta'ala he will open up your pathways that means anyone where the Muslim or non-muslim if he strive the fish struggles in the path of Almighty God Allah Muhammad Allah he will open up the pathways all these people whether it be Cassius Clay whether it be Mike Tyson whether whether it be cast even if you read the history when they were not Muslim they strike like you if you hear the story the background of cached even was a pop singer now he's called eve of islam when his life was in danger he said that if if you saved my life oh my god i will dedicate my life towards you and then someone gave him the copy of the Quran he read the Quran and he came close to Islam so if you strive irrespective whether you're a Christian or a Hindu or a non-muslim if you sincerely strive to come close to allah subhana wa ta'ala you will come close to Almighty God Allah subhana Allah so the only criteria quired for you striving and struggling that i want to find the true Almighty God and follow his Commandments insha Allah Allah will get you closer whether you will lead the Quran come close to Allah whether you'll hear the lecture of a DIYer come close to Allah you may attend the event you may hear the Adhan the main criteria you strive to come closer to Almighty God and insha Allah Allah will give you the hope the answer the question"
