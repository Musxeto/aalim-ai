  "title": "\"The Mughals tampered the Hindu scriptures. Myth or Reality?\" - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I've been introduced to you by my sir Nasir sir Guru who is a teacher by profession and the first time I heard you was at uh Azad maidan and the topic was similarities between Hinduism and Islam my name is depend said and I'm working with a construction company I have come across an argument by my fellow friends when we have discussed about these topics and the question is that when the Moguls were there they have tempered with the Hindu scriptures and that's the reason we find uh you know some references and things like that in the scriptures is it a myth or reality please throw some light on it thank you very good question that when the Moguls came to India they tampered with the Hindu scriptures is it a myth or is it a reality as five my study goals it is a myth there are some things what the Hindu said did come into the scripture for example the word Hindu the word Hindu doesn't exist in any of the Hindu scriptures before the Arabs came to India Hindu is actually a geographical definition the word Hindu was first used by the Arabs when they came to India this Hindi Hindi even now today when I go to Saudi they call me Hindi India I am a Hindi Hindi means it's a geographical definition for people living in the land of the Indus Valley it's not a religious definition that's the reason jawaharlal nehru says the word Hindu does not appear in the Hindu scriptures until the Arabs came to India but regarding a question the Mughal tampered with the Hindu scriptures Point number one as far as my study goes the Mogul did not tamper with Hindu scriptures fine now even if I agree with you that the Moon is tempered now once that Temple do you leave that scripture now if you agree that the scripture is tempered so leave it now what are you going to follow a tempered scripture follow scripture which is not tempered Quran so even if I agree with your argument that mughals of tempered description or leave their scripture suppose you have two glasses of water one glass is pure in the other glass someone puts one drop of gutter water is in front of you but once it mixes you can't make out the dirt will you have that glass of water why you can't see it but because you saw dirty black color drop it falls in the glass of water it mixes you can't make out will you have it will you have that glass of water once I've seen it I won't have it correct very good because you're logical so even if I agree with you that more girls have tempered the skip to leave that scripture have the pure scripture go on and if you say they have not tampered the Hindu scriptures says you have to follow the Quran Hindu scripture says that you have to follow Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him if they have not tempered if they have temperedly we'd follow this if they have not tempered the scripture says that you have to believe in one God which I give quotation besides giving quotation of God that scripture also says that you have to follow the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I can give you quotations from the Hindu scriptures talking about the coming of sallam if you read the Hindu scriptures book number 20 hymn number 127 verse number 1 to 14 talk about Muslim if you read book number 20 hymn number 21 verse number six book number 20 hymn number 21 verse number seven book number one hymn number 53 verse number the one who praises [Applause] number two I can keep on quoting only references mentioned in the scriptures so your scripture say that there's one God you worship him alone and you have to follow the last and final messenger even when the scriptures speak about the kalki avtar about Mama as the last and final messenger it says his mother's name will be sumathi that's Amina the name of Allah it says his father's name will be Vishnu Yas servant of God Abdullah which is the name of Allah it says he will be born in sambala a place of peace that is Makkah he'll be born in the place in the family of the chief of Makkah and we know in the family of quresh he'll have four companions talking of the Sabbath I can go on and on and on talking about this he will come he'll be the last messenger that is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I am asking your brother do you believe in one God yeah do you believe that there's no ideal worship yeah you don't believe in idol worship after I heard your speech so you know I'm very clear in all those aspects and I've heard you a lot of times so I just had a question which was close to me and and I wanted an answer for that so wanted to hear that so do you believe that Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger yeah I do believe in Allah [Applause] from the bottom of my heart that you doing such a good work and you're clearing all these misconceptions that we all people do have marshmallow devotee brother and in Islam if you submit your will a person is called as a Muslim exactly sir sorry to interrupt you but that's the reason when people ask me who what's your religion and uh you know I speak Gujarati and when they tell me what's your religion I just uh when I heard you that um you know the definition of a Muslim is the person who bows his will to Allah and that's what I told him that you know I am a Muslim so he was like shocked so the reason why I was shocked is that I I speak Gujarati I know where you know I'm a Muslim or something or you know come from a Muslim background family so I was like I'm born in whichever family it is but then I know what is right and I have just studied that and that's what I talk about and I preach about and I just try to do my bit in the small pieces and bits that I can do so thank you I really appreciate and I thank you and may almighty God to Jannah and if you require any query any question the most welcome to contact us it's a pleasure thank you very much [Applause]"
