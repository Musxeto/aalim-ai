  "title": "While fasting can I swallow my spit? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign I spit a lot in Ramadan and I find it difficult I have bad thoughts that if I don't spit my fast is not valid when we do Voodoo and our lips are wet can they stay with because I wipe it excessively with tissue and can we do shower every day this brother Ahmed from London has basically asked three questions that yeah the habit of spitting a lot and if he doesn't spit he thinks his fast will break it will be null and void now either Voodoo and there's some water remaining in the lip seed wipes it with this tissue excessively and can he take shower every day some people have this OC and obsessive compulsive Neurosis I'm a doctor you know sometimes you do excessive things in your obsession coming to the first question that use put excessively and you think that if you don't spit Your fast will break there are some Muslims who think that if they follow their saliva they fast will break this is a big misconception swallowing your saliva does not break your fast and it is impossible for you to remain full day without following us alive according to Medical Science every day an average human being secretes half to one and a half liter of saliva every day without stimulation in your mouth on average 0.3 to 0.4 ml is secreted every minute when you're sleeping 0.1 ml is secreted per minute that means if you sleep for eight hours 0.1 multiplied by 60 becomes 6 ml multiplied by 8 hours 48 ml so approximately one small cup of saliva or a quarter glass of saliva is secreted if you sleep for eight hours normally that means you're ingesting in your sleep one small cup of saliva or a quarter glass of saliva normally if you are eating or chewing something the rate of secretion of saliva increases that goes up to four to five ml a minute but if you're not stimulated as I mentioned the average is 0.3 to 0.4 ml per minute take average of 0.35 ml per minute that means if you fast average for 10 hours every hour you will secrete 0.35 ml into 60 into 10 it comes to 210 mL of saliva in 10 hours that means on average if you're fasting you are ingesting more than one full glass of saliva in one day of fasting it's normal whatever normal saliva that is secreted and you ingest that is permissible voluntary you cannot keep on thinking and getting excessive saliva and accumulating in your mouth and then you ingest then that is wrong but normally when you're talking when you're sleeping when you're awake the saliva comes it goes into your stomach it is permitted it is the stupidity that you have to keep on spitting every few minutes and I know that when I was in school I had one or two of my friends who are Muslims who used to always keep on spitting and when they're sitting in the class then they will put in handkerchief fools this is lack of knowledge of Deen so let me tell you that you can very well ingest your saliva don't purposely think and and secrete purposely saliva in your mouth and the ninja that is wrong but normally what is there ingest it it is perfectly fine it is sometimes a vastavasa of the Satan of the shaytan telling you okay go and spit trying to create problems and if you keep on spitting the full day there will be a health problem you may get dehydrated so it is nonsense forget about it be it normally whatsoever comes out it goes in automatically you don't have to ingest it it goes in automatically it's not done voluntary come into your second question that when you do voodoo there is water on the lips so you wipe it good you excessively wipe so that you rub your skin and then there are rashes this is again OC and obsessive compulsive Neurosis like you wash your face and then again you want to wash you want to wash 10 times or you want to clean something you close the door you check it 10 times when the door is closed or not and there are some people I'm aware some Muslims and they're not sure several times in one hour so this is obsessive compulsive Neurosis or The Whisper of the city when you're doing Vudu you can rinse your mouth you gargle out you spit out the water that's it you don't keep hotspuring 10 times if you fear there's some water remaining okay you can spit it out you wash your face there is water on the lips you take a towel or take a napkin or take a tissue wipe your face close you don't have to keep on wiping 10 times so if you do though you wash your face okay wipe your face wipe your lips that's sufficient it will not break your fast it is normal the third question that can you have a shot every day yes we can have a shower every day and you should have it is preferable it should not to be clean if you want to have a shot twice a day no problem while fasting if you want a Thrice a day no problem there is no harm at all there is no restriction how many times you can have a bath a day no problem at all it doesn't break your fast as long as you don't ingest water if you purposely take water and you ingest that's a problem while having a bath normally don't ingest water so surely let me tell you that don't keep on spitting when you're doing Vudu okay that water your gargle out that is sufficient spit out that water that is sufficient don't have to keep on spitting every few minutes or every hour it's not required at all once you wipe your face it is sufficient you can have a bath as many times as you want in a day it is permissible it will not break your fast hope that answers the question"
