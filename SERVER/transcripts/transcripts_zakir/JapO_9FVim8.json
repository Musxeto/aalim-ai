  "transcript": "catering in VIP launch my question is from my family that everyone in all the books it's written that gods are same and God is one when I say you salaam alaikum you can see me that Shanti salaam alaikum means that maybe peace on you and Om Shanti means that maybe peace on you then why can't you say that that Om Shanti is a problem what is the problem sir the OM the Hindus think that that is God om chantino probably if I translate no problem peace is no problems no problem the problem is Om what we have to realize that we say may peace be on you we're requesting Allah for that om is another concept which people have a different concept about om so if you say may God peace be on you no problem but the moment you say om people may start having a negative picture or is it about Hinduism is it about a god something maybe having Idol so because you divert not to divert it's better to be clear so only saying Shanti is no problem in Arabic we say assalamu alaikum may peace be on you in English the moment you add that somebody else will give you besides Creator then there's a problem so I hope peace is on you brother yes sir thank you I hope that you live in peace so yes sir thank you brother bye [Applause]"
