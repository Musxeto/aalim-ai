  "transcript": "we have many Muslims especially living in India who are various types of surnames and names and there are various surnames which match with the surnames of the non-muslims and especially the Muslims of the Ken region the Coes and even I'm a coy so that no CNE feels offended and if you analyze the surname of certain Muslims depending on the region that com from their surname resembles that of the non-muslims of the Hindus so you have a takur a Muslim takur and a Hindu takur you have the Patel the Muslim Patel and the Hindu Patel you have the Nike Nike my her name is Nike you have the Muslim Nike and the Hindu Nike you have pwar a Muslim pwar and a Hindu pwar you have Muslims coming from the Gujarat side who have surnames like Shah you have a Muslim sha you have a Hindu Shah surname like Desai you have a Muslim Desai and a Hindu Desai we cannot identify from the surname whether the person is a Muslim or a non-muslim if you read the tradition of beloved Prophet The Prophet never ever changed the family name he never advised the people to change the family name you know why the family name shows the roots and identification of the roots is very important in Islam therefore the prophet never ever recommended any Muslim to change his family name whatever his name was because if you know ah n k coming from Cen region you come to know the roots ah takur if is a Muslim coming from the Ken region ah Shah coming from the Gujarat side you come to know the lineage the area where you come from but many times along with the surname which may get mixed up with a non-muslim you even have names which can get mixed up with the non-muslims you have Muslim Muslim woman who have the name kishwar you have a Muslim kishwar and a non-muslim kishar you have names such as Sheila there are some Muslim women who have the name Sheila even the Hindu has Sheila you have Danish Muslim Danish and a par Danish there are certain names which are common and some of the Muslims when they have a non-muslim type of surname like takur Patel or n they take advantage of situation and they try and manipulate if they're meeting uh Muslim certain names of Muslims are identical you can easily identify the Muslim like Abdullah Sultan Muhammad Zakir no two doubts that Abdullah Zakir Muhammad sultan are Muslims no two doubts so if you have a label which clearly identifies and the name is specific there's no two doubts that you're a Muslim but certain Muslims they Advantage if they have a surname which matches with a non-muslim if they meet a Muslim they say the full name like Muhammad Nik full name that the name of my brother and if they meet a non-muslim they say m Nik it can be man Nik it can be Manoj Nik my brother doesn't do that but I'm telling the example so that no one feels hurt no one says that I'm particularly pinpointing because it's very common they write M Nik only M Nik or M A Nik MD Nik whatever it is you can identify whether the Muslim or non-muslim when they meet Muslims they say the full name so using such things intentionally trying to manipulate that if a Muslim comes maybe I get good customers I if I'm a Muslim if a non-muslim comes I try and deceive him it is nothing but deception which Islam is completely against if your name happens to resemble a non-muslim if your surname no problem keep it but don't use the strategy of trying to win over people by deceiving them Islam doesn't permit that be proud of your name alhamdulillah and identify yourself to be as Muslims you know when you go to school you have particular uniform that if you're going to send me to school the school which I went you have great trousers and white shirt you can immediately identify he is a St Peter IDE a student of St Peter school if he's going to St Mary school if has white trousers and white shirt identify that he is a student of St Mary school and they particular different color ties Etc it's easy to identify they wear a uniform known as the school uniform it identifies the person"
