  "transcript": "now let's discuss the prophecy of muslim in the new testament as far as the christians are concerned whatever is mentioned in the old testament they have to believe because that is part of the scripture that's part of the bible and allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 7 verse 157 they followed the unlettered prophet which is mentioned in the law and gospel it's further mentioned surah chapter number 61 verse number 6. the jesus christ peace be upon him says to bani israel to the chin of israel i've been sent as a messenger to you confirming what came before me and giving glad tidings of a messenger to come whose name shall be ahmad and when we read the new testament there are several prophecies of prophet muhammad sallam mention the new testament it's mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 16 it says jesus christ peace be upon him says i shall pray to my father to send you a comforter who shall abide with you forever it's mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 15 verse number 26 and when the comforter will come who my father will send he will glorify me it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 7. nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter shall not come for if i depart shall i send him many of the christians say that this comforter refers to the holy spirit now carefully note the prophecy of gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 7 says nevertheless i tell you the truth jesus christ peace be upon him saying nevertheless i tell you the truth it is experience for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter shall not come for if i depart shall i send him the criteria for the comforter to come is that jesus christ peace be upon him should depart only if he departs will the comforter come we know that the holy spirit was there when jesus christ peace be upon him was being baptized the holy spirit was also there before jesus christ peace be upon him was born he was in the womb of elizabeth several places it's mentioned in the bible so surely this comforter cannot refer to the holy spirit and furthermore the word comforter if you go to the greek and aramaic the present scripture it says it is paraclete and the translator comforter parakeet actually means advocate and if you go and do research the right word is periclitos which means one who praises or one who is worth praising irrespective which is the name of muhammad and muhammad irrespective whether it is the one who praises or the praiseworthy or it is paraclete whether advocate or comforter alhamdulillah all these meanings benefit no one better than the last and final messenger prophet muhammad further it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 jesus christ peace be upon him says i have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself all that he hear shall speak he shall glorify me he shall show you things to come this prophecy says i have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now jesus christ peace be upon him tells the people i have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all truth he shall not speak of himself or that the earth shall he speak you know muhammad whatever was revealed to him he spoke verbatim he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me and you know muhammad sallallahu salaam has glorified jesus christ peace be upon him in the quran and in several hadith we consider jesus christ peace be upon him to be one of the mightiest messengers of allah we believe that jesus christ peace be upon him was the messiah translated christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male intervention which many modern-day christians did not believe we believe that he gave life to the dead with god's permission we believe he healed those born blind lepers with god's permission so prophet muhammed did glorify jesus christ peace be upon him so this prophecy refers to no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammad this was in brief regarding the mention of muhammad sallam in the christian scriptures time doesn't permit me to go and give more quotations but this is just a nutshell the tip of an iceberg regarding the mention of muslim in the various world religious scriptures i would like to end my talk with the condition of the glorious quran where allah says in chapter 108 allah says which means we have granted him the fountain of abundance and pray to thy lord and sacrifice the name of the lord and anyone who hated thee hated sallam he will be cut off from all future hope alhamdulillah"
