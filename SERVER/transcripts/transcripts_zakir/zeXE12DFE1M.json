  "title": "Dr Zakir Naik can Reach out to those Muslims in UK who the Government Cannot - DG Counter Terrorism",
  "transcript": "dr nike i'm yasmin i'm a student at the university and my question is sort of related to the last question um you talked about you wanted to come to the uk because you wanted to reach out to muslims who you felt that the government were not able to reach out to and i wondered why in your opinion you felt that the government were failing in this way to reach out to muslims in britain thank you just as a question that i wanted to come to uk to reach out to those muslims who the government could not reach out sister to the side confusion i said charles far the director general of the office of security and counterterrorism felt that i could reach out to those muslims who the government could not reach out to he felt that not me and i think again because the information which the home department has that peace tv is the most popular islamic satellite channel in uk watched by the muslims as well as the non-muslims and the most popular speaker according to home department according to me according to the home department is dr zakir naik so i repeated what he thought that i could reach better maybe he thinks that my speeches have influenced and he may have read my speeches in context that's the reason he was not in favor of the home secretary that she passed the explosion order hope to answer the question do you think that he has a point do you think that um in some sense the government are failing to reach out to muslims in prison though if you ask my opinion that do i agree with the thoughts of charles far that the government is failing or yes i do agree with him i do agree because as i said in my earlier answer that the government should not think that muslims are part of the problem the government should think that muslims are part of the solution because a muslim there are many muslims who are british citizens and it is a duty of every muslim to follow all the laws of the country staying in as long as the law does not force him to do something which is private in the religion or prevents him from doing something which is comprising religion as far as india is concerned i do not know of any rule or any law in the constitution which forces a muslim in india to do something which is prohibited neither does it prevent me from doing something which is compulsory so i am a practicing muslim and i'm proud to be an indian so i'm proud to be an indian muslim similarly there are many britishers who i feel may be feeling the same they may be muslims and they may be following the laws of the country so the british muslims so i feel that the government should take in confidence and what they should do that they should see to it that this maligning by the media should stop and the best example best example is myself i mean there are many there are 100 million views of fish tv and there are millions of people who tell that i am the ambassador for peace they say i'm a peaceful person there are many heads of states of several foreign countries many they have called me at the state guest so do you mean to say all these heads of states of several countries the president the prime minister the king the sheikh they meet me and they have dinner do you mean to say that meeting a person who is promoting terrorism a person who spreads hate so what i'm saying that this is all again manipulated by the media so the government should not fall prey to the media and take any decision hisly what they should do they should give a chance for the person to clarify and then i'm sure that most of the misconceptions will be removed and i'm sure that a uk would be a more peaceful country to live in hope to answer the question"
