  "transcript": "the next question my name is faheem muntasir from bangladesh city silat my question is if a person is good throughout his or her life but does not believe in god will he or she go to hell allah subhana tala says in the glorious quran in surah al-imran chapter 3 verse 19 in nadine in the islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah it is islam so the criteria for entering jannah is you have to believe in one god alone and you do not have to associate any partners with him and believe in the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him now as you said in a question that if the person is good and if he does not believe in god so will he go to hell i would like to give you a simple example there is a person who says that he is the best employee of a company he is the most obedient but when you ask this employee who is your boss so he says i don't know my boss i don't know his name do you think this person is the best employee do you think he's obedient to his boss but natural no he does not even know his boss how can he be called the best employee how can he be the most obedient allah subhana tala he has given you shelter he has given you food he has given you water he has given you air if you do not get water for a few days you will die if you do not get air for a couple of hours you will die allah is asking us to worship him alone without associating partners with him and to follow his commandments so a person cannot be called good if he does not recognize his create allah first thing that you need to do or to attain goodness is recognizing your creator allah who has given you all the blessings in this world he has given you the eyes allah did he ever charge you for the eyesight did he ever charge you for the air that you breed all of it is free of cost he is the only one who is worthy and deserving of worship he is the one who deserves to be worshiped and many people they say that if you give charity it is good if you do other good deeds it is good all these things they are good giving charity helping others helping your neighbors but all these things they are secondary the first thing is recognizing your creator allah subhana wa tala and even these good deeds if you do them for show off it is of no use if you help the poor the needy just to show off just to show it to the people that you are wealthy it is of no use and the criteria for success is mentioned in the glorious quran in surah al-asir chapter 103 verse number one to three by time insane verily man is in a state of loss except for those who believe and do righteous deeds exhort people towards truth that is doing dawah what was the sub exhort people towards patience and perseverance there are minimum four criteria for a person to enter jannah the first is iman that is belief the second is that is righteous deeds the third is exalting people towards two that is doing dawah and the fourth is exhorting people towards patience and perseverance these are minimum four criteria for a person to enter jannah if any one of them is missing under normal circumstances a person he will not enter jannah if allah wants to forgive you it is his prerogative but in normal circumstances a person he will not enter jannah and i would like to give you a simple example if you appear for an examination for example the 10th grade there are certain subjects that you need to pass in even if you get 99 marks in all the subjects but in one of these five subjects if you fail you will not pass the 10th grade similarly for you to enter jannah you have to believe in one god alone and you have to believe in the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him"
