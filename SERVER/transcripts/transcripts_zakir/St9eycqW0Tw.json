  "transcript": "we wish to begin with the uh story of your uh medical uh background we know you started out as a medical doctor and then moved to dawa so how was the transition between studying medicine and studying Islamic Studies as well while I was doing my Medical College in the second year in 1987 I met shik Ahmed and when I met shik Ahmed dad he is the person who inspired me to become a DI and after meeting him I started doing dawa and because of him I changed from a doctor of a body to doctor of a soul initially when I finished my medical studies in the year 1990 while in the Medical College I started doing dawa when I finished my medical studies I thought I would initially do only da for two hours in a week and remaining Al medical studies but then when I started I decided to do two hours a day then I told my parents I'll do 50% da 50% Medical Practice then I said I'll do 12 medical practice and remaining that then alhamdulillah uh there the brother ask a good question this one uh like touches with the lers right now if I say the brother Dr how did it happen it is mainly whenever anyone asks a question not always but if the question is good we should encourage the questioner so normally when nonm Muslim ask a question so that's how I break the ice by say the brother asked a very good question and that's how and that has become like common people have know made video now Dr is going to give a reply and the person will get convinced and he accept Islam all that has become you know alhamdulillah from Allah do you count uh how much W and uh DT in your hands Allah keep the Allah the best to give the account even if you do one alhamdulillah even if one person accept Islam because of you then it is a great deal Mah it is Allah tala who converts people who changes Hearts Allah says your job this message converting hearts in the hands of Allah so it's Allah keep what is one advice you give young Muslims the advice I like to give to Muslims that say to it that they read the Quran daily for at least 20 minutes and read it in the language they understand the best if they don't know Arabic as a language they should read the translation of the Quran in the language they understand best and they should Implement on it because Quran is the most positive book in the world it's the future world called tradition and if we Muslims read the Quran and understand it and implement it inshallah we'll benefit of this world as well as the in terms of the the people that want to do da they want to start in this da scene they want to become come die and they don't have enough knowledge and they TR to seek knowledge but to who do that then what must they do see our beloved Prophet said in propagate even if you do one was so a on every Muslim that they should do da whatever they know they should convey and if you want to do more da but natur you should knowledge and the best is of course initially you have to read and the Quran along with the translation and then see programs and lectures of duas for example if you want to do da with a Christian to sh is good so once you hear it talk and you started memorizing it and you repeat it that is so the more you keep on memorizing the more you keep on repeating the more da you do Allah gives you more knowledge you don't have to wait till you become like to start doing da if you decide then whatever you listen what you memorize but the golden rule is that do not say what you don't know whatever you know you say once you start doing the Allah gives you more and more knowledge and there is a dawa training program we have a new platform called Al which is the largest platform for Islamic video content in the world it also has a large number of courses one of the courses International da training program let's become effective di so it's a long course so if you log on to a and see this course there's a study guide then there are question answers there is testing so if you do this course online course inshallah that will be very beneficial for you to no uh him says uh they don't have much issues with having uh a friendship with a female like mes and females uh can you give them a message about that in Islam there is nothing thing like love before wedding in Islam there is a hijab that we have to follow the rules of hijab that a of male and female they cannot intermingle they cannot sit in the closed room together and the prophet said that two male and female n together the third person is a devil so like how you have in the Western World they have girlfriend boyfriend they keep on talking chatting they go out for dinner they go for a movie they spend the night together this is all Haram in Islam you can have friends with the same sex male with male and female with female with the opposite sex but required you can talk but you cannot be that free you cannot you cannot intermingle with opposite sex you cannot sit alone with opposite sex all these against the ruling of the Sharia so this is there in the western culture without in Islam so in Islam we should follow the Islamic ruling and the Islamic Sharia and it's against uh having intermingling with the opposite sex uh now youngsters one to marry earlier do you think that's a good yes that's good and I beloved Prophet sayi oh young people whoever had the means to get married should get married so it's good for the youngsters to get married if you have the means you should get married as soon as possible moment to become an adult so in Islam if you become adult there is no age thing but the prescribed age is as soon as possible what what people who youngers don't have the means to get married don't have the means to get married the prophet said to can fast so that will help you to lower your GI and always you can lower your requirements and it's not necessary have to be a millionaire to married so you can lower your requirements and get married mil"
