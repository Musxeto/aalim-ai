  "transcript": "Zakir is spreading terrorism Charles far is yet the head of the anti-terrorism department he disagrees with the government you can't man this person is doing good but they want to show they want to be tough the new government conservative party wants to show that we are tough against the Muslim so the first Muslim they banned after coming to power just before I was going to come I had a valid Visa they cancel my Visa why because few of my statements one statement I'll give you example I told him my lecture that the thousands of Americans killed in 911 I condemn it more than 50 people killed in the London Tube bombing I condemn it more than 180 people killed in Bombay in the serial train Bomb Blast I condemn it but I tell the Muslim don't put a full stop I also condemn the thousands of innocent people killed in Afghanistan killed in Iraq killed in Palestine so they want to B me now I'm very careful I say thousands of innocent people killed in Afghanistan when I said thousands of people kill in America I didn't use the word innocent when I said more than 50 people killed in London I didn't use the word innocent when I said more than 180 people killed in Bombay I didn't use the word innocent but when I used for the Muslim that particular I condemned the thousands of innocent people killed in Afghanistan in Iraq in Palestine and they want to B me"
