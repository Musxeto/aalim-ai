  "title": "Do Wet Dreams Nullify the Fast? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "regarding a person who has a wet dream during the day whilst he's fasting is this an act which would nullify the fast is it permitted for a person to have a wet dream during the day while she's fasting if a person has a wet dream during the day while having a fast maybe offers Salah and he sleeps and he has a w dream it is involuntary a person has a wet dream even if ejaculates it's involuntary he's not to be blamed for that in this case because it's unintentional surely it will not break the fast and he can complete the Fast and the thing that is advised to him is that he should have a g a bath as soon as possible so that he can offer the Salah that's excellent I think that's self-explanatory thank you for that another question very much related to the last one I feel um is a person allowed to be in a state of sexual impurity whilst they're fasting I follow the question question that can a person be in a state of sexual impurity that depends if as long as it does not do any Haram act during the fast for example it's mentioned in the Hadith of wasallam in s Muslim volume number two Hadith number 2453 it's mentioned that um Salma pleased with her for the wife of the Prophet she says that the prophet got up from his sleep in a state of sexual defilement state of sexual impurity while he was fasting and he had a bath and he continued his fast further there's a similar message given in s bukari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1925 and the Hadith is narrated Again by um Salma pleased with her and NAA pleased with her too both are the wives of the prophet and they said that the prophet used to get up in the morning in a state of sexual defilement because he had intercourse with the wife not because of a sexual dream and he used to have a bath and he never used to compensate the fast later on this proves that being in the state of jun sexual defilement or sexual impurity does not nullify the fast even if a person has a we dream in between his fast is valid the only point to be noted is that the person should have a bath as soon as possible if he gets up in the morning after Dawn breaks and if he's in a state of sexual impurity should have a bath immediately so that he can offer the Salah of faj or if he sleeps after F Salah and has a wet dream and then become sexually impure so he should have a b at least before the Z Salah so that he can offer the Z Salah after having a Gul okay that I think that sheds some lights on that issue and the same thing if a person is menstruating if a lady if she's menstruating and she finishes the Minal cycle just before fajer and she delays a bath even after Dawn is broken and she has a bath just before the F Salah that's also valid"
