  "transcript": "the next question is from muhammad farooq from chittagong bangladesh some of my muslim brothers complain about you that you prove quran is true by science as a result it is understood that quran has less status than science and science seems to distinguish between the truth and falsehood what is the opinion the comment made by the brother that when i try and prove quran with the help of science i am trying to prove that science is more superior to quran and that is totally false if any of you hear my video cassettes on quran modern science they'll come to know that i am comparing avayastic the astic of the muslims that is the quran with the yashtik of the non-muslim which is science and i said that quran is the last and final revelation of allah which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him and in every age the quran has proved itself to be the word of god previously was the age of miracles and quran is the miracle of miracles then came the age of literature and poetry alhamdulillah muslim and non-muslim arabic scholars alike they claim the quran to be the best arabic literature available on the face of the earth but today is not the age of literature and poetry today is the age of science and technology and if you compare quran with modern science you will come to know that quran is far superior when i'm comparing quran with modern science i'm telling what science has come to know recently 30 years back 40 years back 50 years back 100 years back quran as mentioned 1400 years ago for example quran mentions the creation of the universe in surah ambi chapter number 21 verse 30. do not the unbeliever see that the heavens and the earth will join together and we close the massandha this is similar to the big bang and the big bang says that our universe was one primary nebula there was the secondary separation of big bang which gave rise to galaxies the sun the stars including a planet earth and that's how the universe came into existence this was first described in 1973 by a couple of scientists for which they were nobel prize that is hardly 47 years back 50 years back imagine quran mentioned 1400 years ago the creation of the universe the big bang what we came to know 50 years back the quran mentioned 14 years ago so when i'm comparing the yastic of the atheist of the unbeliever of the non-muslim that is science with avaryastic the quran i say quran is not a book of science s c i c but it's a book of science it's a book of ayats and there are more than six thousand ayats more than six thousand signed in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about science and when we compare we come to know that our aspect the glorious quran is far superior so when i'm comparing science with the glorious quran nowhere do i say that science is superior all what is mentioned in the quran 14 years back science has come to know recently so what i am trying to prove that our glory is quran the last and final revelation of allah subhanahu wa which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the ultimate book it is far superior than modern science so if you hear my lecture correctly and with attention you will come to know i am uplifting the status of the quran far superior to the state of the science in no way am i saying that science is more superior than the quran i am using they are stick science with avaya the quran and quran alhamdulillah excels and proves it is superior to science hope that answers the question"
