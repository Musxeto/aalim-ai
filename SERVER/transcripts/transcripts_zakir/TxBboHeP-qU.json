  "transcript": "the next question is from friday kerela india can a muslim become an ias officer or an ips officer in a democratic country like india first question was from muslima a muslim sister this question is from a muslim male a similar question asked by shahil ahmad from kolkata india i recently completed my b tech in computer science and got job offers from many multinational companies but i haven't joined yet because i want to become an ias officer to serve my country but there are a few things that are discouraging me from becoming one number one the current political situation which increases hatred against muslims number two after meeting a few bureaucrats they say civil servants are bound to get corrupted because they can't overrule the orders of the corrupt political masters number three constitutionally politicians can harass you because they have power to transfer and remove any civil servant from important posts and give less important posts since i'm a practicing muslim what is advice both these questions are related the first question posed by the muslim brother that can you become an is officer or an ips office in a democratic country like india and the answer depending upon whether can you follow the deen after becoming an ass officer or a ps officer if you can it is permissible if you cannot it's not permissible it will depend upon each individual and the question posed by the second brother that he wants to become an is officer but there are few queries and all these three queries are very important and need to be added separately the first thing he said is that seeing the hatred towards the muslims being increased in india will he be able to do the job of an ass officer and the answer is it will be difficult it's not impossible it's possible but difficult now when your colleagues start attacking you attacking islam attacking the prophet attacking you as a muslim do you have the khmer to reply do you have the courage to reply to them is important if you're a timid person and you cannot reply and you're shy so my advice is that don't take such job if you think you can answer them you're good in replying you're bold you can take it then go ahead with it whether you become an ips officer whether you become an is officer and the second point pose was that because when you take this post there is bound to be that you may be tempted to do wrong things you may be tempted for bribery you will be tempted to do things which illegal according to the country which haram activities of islam and i agree with the person totally that when you're in high position like an ips officer and it's common that if not all the majority of the ips officers not all but the majority for sure they are corrupted and if an honest officer goes there he either becomes corrupt or he has to leave the job so in this situation you are the muslim bribing is haram how can you take bribe how can you become corrupt it's a challenge for you because the setup is such of these government whether it's officer or with an ips officer that if you don't agree with them they make life difficult for you and the third part is that the political bosses if you don't follow them they will transfer you yes they can transfer you so my advice to you is that if you are strong if you know that you have the correct not to involve in bribery you will not do corruption you will do justice you will follow the quran in sunnah and if the political bosses tell you something one thing you are sure that if you are honest they cannot remove you they can transfer you yes they put you to a place which is isolated but when they transfer you if there is no evidence of yours which is against the law what they will do they cannot demote you they can transfer you and when they transfer very often they may have to give you a higher position i know some officers muslim officers which were very honest because they were honest they kept on being transferred and because they were transferred they kept on getting raised very fast so at a young age they reached the top position very fast alhamdulillah so it's a blessing in disguise so if you are such a person who is a muslim who's strong who can face the criticism of the non-muslim who can face the attack of the non-muslims against islam and we're going to be honest who will accept the challenge and say that i will not involve in bribery i will not do corruption i will give justice even if it goes against myself i will protect the muslims then go ahead with the job whether it's an ips officer whether it's an is officer it's going to be a challenge it's going to be difficult i know many muslims have taken this job and have deviated away from islam there are a few that i know who have stuck to the straight path if you know that you are bold if you can take the challenge if you have that metal in you then go ahead alhamdulillah otherwise it is safer for you not to take up such a job"
