  "transcript": "there are some other criteria required for a supplication to be accepted and that's the reason why most of them are rejected one is that we should not say that oh Allah forgive me if you please oh Allah bless me if you please or oh Allah grant me sustainance if you please because I beloved Prophet M wasallam he said it's mentioned in s bukari b number n in the book ofed Hadith number 7477 where the Prophet said that do not supplicate do not Pray by saying that oh Allah forgive me if you wish oh Allah grant me mercy if you wish oh Allah give me from your bounties if you wish because Allah subhana wa ta'ala he does what he wills and you cannot command him so saying such things is totally wrong which many people do which is a big mistake that the reason the supplication un answered furthermore people many a time they give names to Allah subhana wa ta'ala which Allah never mentioned in the Quran neither the prophet used any of the had they call Allah subhana tala which attributes and names which are not given by Allah and his that is totally wrong while supplicating"
