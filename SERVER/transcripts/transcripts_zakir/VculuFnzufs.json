  "title": "Is a Person Allowed to Fast for a Person who is Alive? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Zakia is the heir obliged to make up the fast of the one who dies before he makes up his obligatory fasts and secondly is a person allowed to fast for a person who's alive but is unable to fast due to some legitimate reason maybe like sickness or such like all the scholars agree that if a person is alive for example and if he does not offer Salah no one else can offer on his behalf similarly if a person misses any fast for any valid reason he may be sick or for example he's continuously sick or he's very old so no one else can keep the fast on his behalf as the Quran says in Surah bakar chapter number two verse number 184 that if a person finds it difficult to keep the fast then he should feed a poor person he should feed an indent person so he if a person is alive and if you cannot keep for a valid reason like continued sickness or old age old man old woman then one person should be fed for every fast he or she misses this is the ruling as far as the first question is concerned that if a person dies before before you could make up for the fast that you're supposed to keep so what's the ruling should the hair should they fast on his behalf and dies as far as this ruling is concerned there are two groups of Scholars and the two opinions for it as far as ruling is concerned for this case there are two opinions one group of Scholars they say that the or the guardian they should keep the fast of a person who has died and who ought to have fasted based on the may Allah be please with her it's mentioned inkari verm number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1952 a pleas with her she says that a person who has died who ought to have fasted then his Guardians should fast on his behalf so based on this Hadith the first group of father they say that the guardan of the air they should make up for the fast when a person dies who ought to have fasted but there's another group of Scholars who say that that's not required but a person should be fed on his behalf based on the Hadith again of Allah pleas with her which is there in mam volume 4 page number 422 where amra with her she asked that a Allah be please with her that her mother had missed some of the fast during the month of Ramadan so she asked that can she fast on behalf of her mother so said that no she should not fast on behalf of mother but she should give charity equivalent to one s that feeds a person for every F that she has missed so since both these two Hadith contradict the second group of Scholars what they say the second opinion is that here specifically mentioned that the fast that were missed were the fast of Ramadan where the first Hadith of s bukari volume number three Hadith number 1952 it's a general Hadith saying that a person who died who ought to have fasted so that's a general Hadith but this Hadith is a specific Hadith which says that these were the fast that were missed due to Raman and here the ruling is that the fast should not be made up but one indent person one poor person should be fed so since both the Hadith cannot contradict and both the Hadi are say so the scholars they say that if a person misses the fast of Ramadan then the fasting need not be made up but the right ruling is that one person should be fed who's poor the other General Hadith they say it indicates for a person who has vowed to fast so if person WS to Allah subhana tala that he or she will Fast if certain wish is fulfilled at that time it's obligatory that the air of the person who has died should make up the fast and further similar thing is mentioned by Abbas M be pleased with him it's mentioned in Sun Abu da volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2395 Abbas pleas with him he says that if a person dies who has missed his fast in Ramadan then you should feed one poor person for every fast that he has missed and you need not make up for the fast there's no atonement for fast but if a person has vowed too fast if he has vowed that he will Fast if some wish is fulfilled then in that case there is atonement of The Fast and that fast should be fulfilled by or by the guardian So based on these two Hadi because they can not contradict that the reason the opinion is divided that if it's the fast of Ramadan which is missed then the right ruling is that one person should be fed for every fast Mist further there's one more Hadith inkari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1953 where it says abas with him he says that a person came to the prophet and asked him that his mother had to make up for one month of fasting so should he fast on a behalf so the prophet said yes he gave the answer in the affirmative and it's good to make up the fast but since again this is a general Hadith it's not specifically mentioning whether it's the fast of Ramadan which is missed or whether the fast of VO and since we cannot agree that the say can contradict so the best is the opinion second opinion that if a person misses any fast in the month of Ramadan then one poor person should be fed on his behalf but if a person vows and does not fulfill the fast in this case the fast should be made up by the air"
