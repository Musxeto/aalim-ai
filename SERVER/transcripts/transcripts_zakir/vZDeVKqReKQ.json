  "transcript": "there are some people who tell me the brother Zak suppose if you're driving a car and if you have a temporary license temporary license this a kacha license in India and if you have an accident know the police will give you a small fine if you have a permanent license and if you have an accident the police will give you a bigger fine therefore if you don't read the Quran and if you don't understand the Quran and if you make any sin God will punish you less if you understand the Quran and then if you commit a sin then God will give you double punishment you know very good logic so why I don't understand the Quran I told this brother for sake of argument I agree with you but the point to be noted is that if a person who has a permanent license in one year the chances he'll have an accident is maybe one but a person who has a temporary license who has not learned driving well the Chan is he'll have an accident in one day maybe 50 so at the end of the year the person who has permanent license pays a fine of 1,000 rupes or $1,000 and a person who has a temporary license he pays the fine of $50,000 so if he has an accident once a year at the end of the year he pays a fine of $2,000 and a person who has a temporary license maybe he'll have 50 accidents in a year at the end of the year he pays a fine of $50,000 or 50,000 Rupees"
