  "title": "Rahul Asks Dr Zakir Naik why Allah is Egoistic and puts a person in Hell if he Worships someone...",
  "transcript": "uh just one question I have you told me we heard about uh that The Vedas say that don't make any images of the God yeah whoever worships anything which has been created throws himself in darkness right the difference between bhagwan and Allah is that Allah says that if you worship anyone apart from me I will punish you forever and ever and and I will not spare you of this sin but nowhere in hinduism's books would you see that bhagan is saying if you worship anything apart from me you will be put in narak which is uh the Hindi word for uh hell forever and ever now what why I'm saying that to you is the concept of God in Islam Christianity and Judaism is the same in which which he feels bad if anyone worships anything else apart from him but the concept of the other side of the religions which is Hinduism Buddhism or those sides the concept of God there I think is more the god of those religions is more large-hearted because he doesn't say to you that I'm going to put you in hell if you don't worship me although although I understand that it is wrong to worship idols it is wrong to worship created things but I do feel that because that I I somehow feel that you know basically God there is nothing like him right so why in the Quran or the Bible or the Jews scripture we are attributing a human uh feeling to God that let us say my father gives me everything he gives me all the money and I give that money to the poor people right now one day if I forget my father yeah so my father will feel bad but this is a human nature God is more large-hearted than that even if I don't worship him he should have no problems you know he should not put me to hell because that's egoistic egoism is a part of human nature not of God is what I feel according to my uh understanding brother Rahul is old friend of mine mashallah whenever I come to Dubai no question answer session goes without him asking a question he's following me since many years when I came in 2005 and I came last year and yesterday night we had a good session for a couple of hours and though he didn't mention his name he's Rahul mallah and we pray that may Allah guide him inshallah may Allah give and he asked very good questions always difficult questions very good questions I like it it's a challenge for me he asked me new question I like challenges and always I say he asked a good question this is one of my last questions sir one of my last question last question before you accept Islam one of my last questions before you accept Islam clarify this it just struck me actually I he told me he will not accept Islam in public so I don't no problem no no it's okay clarify me on this I'll clarify with you and I won't ask you to accept Islam in public we have done that yesterday so Islam is a glorious religion and I am it's given me a lot of peace and I can say many good things about it but please clarify and you told I'll clarify you told me you have spent more time studying Islam than what you spend time in getting your degree of engineering it is right that's right and I enjoy it more therefore I enjoy your questions also the brother asked a very good question very attacking very tricky difficult question that he understands that all the religions Christianity Islam Hinduism say there's no God except one God Don't Make images don't make it but Islam goes a step further he will forgive any other sin except the sin of sh Surah 4: 48 Surah 4: 76 but in Hinduism nowhere does it say that if you do shik Allah will not forgive you before I ask you a question about larhe heartedness no way does the Quran say that if you commit murder Allah will not forgive you brother no way does the Quran say that if you commit murder Allah will not forgive you does it mean that I will go and commit murder brother repeat again sorry nowhere does the Quran say that if you commit murder though the second largest sin in Islam in the major sins number two is committing murder of an innocent human being yes after shik is murder though the Quran says in Surah ma 5: 32 that if anyone kills any innocent human being unless it be for murder or for creating corruption in the land it is as though you have killed the all of humanity but nowh does the Quran say that if you commit murder Allah will not forgive you Allah will never forgive you does it mean that I will go and commit murder no yeah enough same way when the vas don't mention that if you don't do shik Allah will not forgive you you should not do shik I understand I understand very good you understanding person I come to the lar hearted one afterwards I haven't answered your full question I only answered the first part of your first question I'll come to your lar heartedness afterwards yeah I mean I'll come to it that's fine but I like you know cutting on the questions so that you understand better yes or if you understand the other people also should understand you're an intelligent person I know that sure Mah engineer done from UK that's why you told me yesterday now coming to a part of large heartedness that in Islam if you don't do this I'll punish you that is a human nature that if the father gives money to the son son gives in charity tomorrow the son doesn't ask about the father so father feels bad it's human nature agree with you God is far superior right I agree with you so why does God feel bad very good question very intelligent question inshallah you'll get convinced I won't ask you to accept Islam you in public that we have done that yesterday yes the Quran says Allah subhana wa ta'ala does not require you you require him now coming to the question now I'm making your question more easy M why we have to say allahar Allah is the greatest Allah ask you to say Allah abbar Allah is the greatest tomorrow if you don't say Allah is the greatest do you think Allah will become less no no yeah whether you say or not Allah is already the greatest irrespective whether you say or not it will make no difference not even out our difference is only the greatest he will remain irrespective whether you say or not why does he ask you to say that is the question the question is Allah subhana wa ta'ala knows the human psychology for example your mother has a heart attack and now you have heard of a very famous heart specialist in the world if you know he's famous he will give you some advice for your mother another person who's unknown he comes and gives you advice Whose advice will you follow repeat again sorry if if your mother has a heart attack yeah there's a person who you know is the most famous heart specialist in the world I would follow the advice of the specialist why because you know he's number one he's most famous so the reason Allah asks you to praise him is not for his benefit it's for your benefit because the moment you praise Allah you will follow his advice by following his advice Allah will not benefit you will benefit yes by the doctor giving advice to you he will not benefit yes you may give him fees so that way he'll benefit you aren't giving any Feast to Allah so Allah doesn't benefit anything but the moment you praise him it is human when you say Allah is the most wise Allah is the greatest Allah is the most merciful most wise ah he gives advice I'll follow most greatest I'll follow him most merciful I'll follow him so you say all these Praises not to benefit him to benefit yourself agreed yes so when you worship Him mhm it does not benefit him it benefits you yes when you follow the advice of the doctor it will benefit if you give him fees yes you don't give any fees to Allah yes it benefits you yes so same way Allah is large-hearted by punishing you do you think he will benefit know by punishing he becomes I'm coming to it brother Rahul yeah let me complete my answer sure sure yeah by punishing you he will not benefit but he's giving you a fear why if you have alcohol he will punish you if you have drugs he'll punish you whether you have drugs or what different does it make to him no if he says okay don't have drugs but if you have drugs I will not punish you then will you have drugs or not you have if I give an examination right two no I won't have if I if I'm convinced it's wrong for me I won't have I don't need that fear of the hell the fear of the Hellfire to be put in my mind to avert me God convinces people in different ways some people with reason and logic you're a logical person you're convinced with logic some people want fear some people want punishment some people want reward there are three four types of ways which Allah speaks you get convinced with reason logic you're like me yeah you're like me yes yes some people they are not convinced reason logic leave logic ah I'll get reward I'll do it I'll get punishment I'll stay away so it is the fear is it reality or yes I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll tell you reality is that the Hellfire is there and the punishment is there let let me complete the answer yeah yeah will you allow me to complete the answer or you yes please let me compl I'll give you a chance G give you a chance to say that you are convinced yes but before I complete man answer you're interjecting sure sure yeah please after I complete I'll give you a chance and ask you sure yeah now there's a teacher taking an examination 2 plus 2 is how much four convinced now there are some people the teacher says okay now in the examination those who write correctly will get plus point will pass those who don't write correctly will fail now when the teacher is telling hundreds of things it's difficult for everyone to remember but if they what you remember you right if you write correct I'll pass you if you write wrong I'll fail you so now the student starts memorizing he starts like you pass to engineering you afraid of failing yes if you wouldn't have studied you would have failed so teacher said no problem even if you write wrong I will give you part degree will you study no ah though your logical you understand boys's law you understand trigonometry you understand chemistry but to remember you have to stay awake you have to SLO teacher said no problem you understood you write in the examination right or wrong 2 plus 2 is three I will pass you will you study well it depends I won't but probably someone who is more sensitive ask to learn some knowledge correct if the teacher says now your aim is to get the degree yeah once you understand if you fail if you fail you won't get the degree so here almighty God speaks logically some people logically doesn't make a difference whether Hellfire is there or Heaven is there other people you do it you get a reward like when you speak to your child sometimes you speak logically sometimes you say you know I'll give you a chocolate yes sometimes yeah I will give you one slap so this is what God knows the psychology of the human being he's our creator sometime logic sometime reasoning sometime reward sometime punishment but once he says he has to follow he can't lie once he says he has to follow so he's trying to convince you suppose your son yeah yeah I know you're not married yeah I know you're not married inshallah one day when you get married and if your son yes and your son inshah I'll marry a Muslim inshallah yes inshah so your son when you have a son yeah 5 years old he wants to jump from 10th floor you said my son don't jump you D I want to jump you know you will die no problem I want to jump one slap you will get him right or wrong yes you'll tell him I slap you yes yet if he wants to jump you'll slap him a father is cruel to be kind is your intention to hurt him no your intention is to hurt him little so that he prevents from the bigger hurt yes so here if he says no no I'm only acting maybe for little time you'll think I'll punish you and you don't punish him but if he wants to jump you'll not wait till he jumps you'll give him untight lab the same way God here he tells you this is good this is bad this is reward this is punishment and once he says something he's honest in Islam God is the most kind he wants the human being to improve the other gods okay no problem even if you right wrong I'll pass you what kind of a teacher is this suppose Tomorrow there's a student studying with you he writes wrong answers you strong you stay awake in the night this person plays hookie enjoys writes everything wrong and the teacher says both get first class first will you be happy with the teacher no why you are a very unkind person very cruel unkind not a good human being I'm wrong because you believe in justice so besides God being kind and merciful he's also just imagine someone rapes your sister rapes your mother God said no problem I'll forgive on the day of judgment won't you tell God why do you not no that's okay I'm I'm talking about God being egoistic on his own self he's not egoistic at all but he's saying if if you do shik then I will put you in Hellfire forever and ever I'm not saying that he should not punish wrong Deeds but he is putting on his own self that if you associate partners with me along with worshiping me if you worship someone else even then I will not forgive you that's the right thing because that's egoism if the doctor says yes if suppose the heart specialist tells your mother see this is a good thing have only this medicine nothing else someone else says okay have this medicine also so that heart specialist tells you if you mix it with something else a mother will die so will you listen to somebody else or not will you listen or not art specialist saying don't have anything else except this orbit rate keep it below your tongue yes another doctor come you I'm a very good doctor you don't know him also will you listen to heart specialist correct yes heart specialist specialized but God is a bigger heart specialist so heart specialist you want to follow you don't want to follow your creator who's created your heart what kind of wait wait wait wait wait wait let me complete yes let me complete yes yes yes so you being logical yeah when you want to follow the heart specialist when the heart specialist tell you don't listen to anyone else because they told you the total that heart specialist can be wrong because he's a human being almighty God when he says do not worship anyone else besides me he knows that if you think somebody else is also the greatest h and if you follow and follow something wrong it will harm you God does not want to see to it that his Creations are harmed he's going out of the way to give you an ultimate warning other sins maybe I will forgive that is one type of murder is one type of sin very wrong second largest but one if you worship somebody else you can do anything you can start murdering you can start having drug you can start raping too dangerous h this is the guidance it is complete because he's the Creator he knows no one else is the creator now someone else tries to behave like a Creator when God knows no one else can create you it is very dangerous that's the reason he says that following advice worshiping anyone obeying anyone as the Creator not obeying normally normally don't obey a father no problem obey your mother no problem going against the Commandments of almighty God worshiping some I'm trying to find out is that the right God who is saying that if you Associated partners with me I will never forgive this sin you are taking it's a catch 22 I am questioning whether a God who thinks like that is that the correct God correct God you are saying you saying he is the correct God hence he knows why why why I have checked up with signs this Quran passes the test when I put signs to your Hindu Scriptures it fails when I put signs to Bible it fails so even if I agree with you with my earlier question maybe this is ambiguous fine 80% is proved to be 100% correct 20% is ambiguous inshallah logically even this will be right if I have to put that way but the other way if a doctor who Sol stronger argument would be correct 100% of it is proved that it is correct if 20% ambiguous is there I tell you one thing brother your mind hasn't reached that level my mind hasn't reached that level right the science hasn't reached that level maybe 100 years afterward thousand after it will be proved 100% correct we are limited the problem is in you and me not in the Quran similarly but a person who's very powerful a person who's a heart specialist he knows his stuff very well he'll be sure do this nothing else a person who's not sure okay I have this medicine also have that medicine also so person who's sure of himself like the Creator almighty God he will give this commandment now he's sure you are not sure about him that he's the Creator yes once you're sure you'll follow I'm sure that this is the word of almighty God you aren't yes so once your research gets complete yes you know very well that the other scriptures don't pass the test yes I challenge you to get any Scripture that you know of which is close to the Quran no this is the strongest scripture that I that's for sure so when you know yeah I can't ask you to accept because you know we spoke yesterday right okay but when you know it is the thing then the ego is in you Not An Almighty God the ego is in you I don't have ego and I pray to God I told you all the ones I have this is the strongest I pray to almighty God you know because I love you Rahul yes I love you too I love you that the reason I pray to almighty God to give you don't have to Proclaim you asked me yesterday do I have to Proclaim I said no you don't have to Proclaim so I think that you are a person who submit will to God and may God guide you and may you get a good submitting Muslim life partner thank you thank you [Music]"
