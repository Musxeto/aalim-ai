  "transcript": "my name is Benjamin k a student of e girl ey media FM Academy my first question is you said um when Jesus Christ died um rising up he told the people that he is going to send his father is going to send a comforter to them but to what I believe or what I learned from church is that he was going to send the Hest Spirit down onto them so I just want to know from you that what do you people believe it is the brothers asked the question that when Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says that I will send you a comforter when he goes he's talking about the Holy Spirit that's what the church says what is my view brother I gave the reply to this in my talk it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says that I will pray to my father to send you a comforter who will abide with you forever Gospel of John chapter number 15: 26 says but when the comforter comes who I will send from my father he will testify me Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is experient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter shall not come the criteria for the comforter to come is that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him should go only after he goes will you send the comforter if you say the comfort was the Holy Spirit we already know from the Bible that the Holy Spirit was there before Jesus Christ peace be upon Him came onto this Earth before he was born the Holy Spirit was there in the womb of Elizabeth the Holy Spirit was also there when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was being baptized so this prophecy cannot refer to the Holy Spirit it refers to No One But the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad PE be upon"
