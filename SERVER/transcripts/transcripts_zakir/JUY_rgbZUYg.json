  "title": "Recommended English Translations of the Quran - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "which of the English translations or meanings of the Arabic uh Quran would you recommend to the viewers as being the best there are many English translations of the Quran as I mentioned Quran has been translated in most of the major languages of the world as far as English is concerned in our foundation Islamic Research Foundation we have more than 50 different translations of the Quran only in English language the best overall amongst all the English translations there are a few one of them is the S International this is the copy the S International it is translated just a few years ago it was translated by three american ladies these three excepted Islam and alhamdulillah they've referred to various previous translations and this is authentic translation but one thing i' would like to mention that no translation of the Quran is exactly as the original word of Allah subhana tala because the translation is a human handiwork so no translation would be free from errors no translation it can come closer to the meaning of the Quran but because the translation is a work of a human being it can come nowhere exactly the same as the Arabic Quran but amongst the one that we have in English language so International is one of the good ones the translation is authentic alhamdulillah but naturally as I mentioned that there's bound to be a few errors the other one which is overall good and which I recommend is the translation by Abdullah Yu Ali abdulah Yu Ali spent more than 40 years only in translating the Quran and overall I say that if you want to give to a non-muslim the translation overall is good it has commentary it has got footnotes and the English is a big you know the old English which most of the people don't like but actually it's closer to Arabic because Arabic is a language in which you have two genders male and female and numbers you have three singular dual and plural so in English language if I have to say you whether it's a male or a female I use you whether it's single person or two persons or more than two are use the same you for six different people whe single dual or plural with the male or female I use the same U but in Arabic for a male single person is a different U an for a female single person is anti similarly dual for male female is separate plural more than two male female is separate that six different use in this archaic English instead of you they have e the da which is closer to the Arabic but it's difficult for those used to this English difficult but there are people who have simplified this and they've taken out this and and made it into youu Etc but overall this translation is very good but again has some errors which are cross errors you should be aware of it these errors are cross but barring these error which are there as I mentioned that this is one of the old translations and it is one of the most popular translation there have been tens or maybe hundreds of millions of copies of ABD Sali which has been distributed throughout the world because it's a popular translation there are books written against this Quran also maximum but alhamdulillah it is a good handiwork we have to be careful of the errors the other good translation is Noble Quran by halali and mus Khan this translation I especially recommend for the Muslims I don't recommend for the non-muslims because it has too many brackets and it's good for the Muslims because in the footnotes very often they give references from s bukari say Muslim so it's helpful for the Muslim to understand the Quran better but for non-muslim because of the brackets and too many explanation it may not be very much feasible for da work according to me the other translation which is good is by Abdul Majid Dadi it's in four volumes its main speciality is it's good for comparative religion and it gives quotation from the Bible and the other scriptures besides the Islamic scriptures another English translation which is good is by Muhammad Assad it is a very logical translation he very often quotes zamak Shar Kash but if you be careful sometime he goes overboard he tries to prove everything logically even the Miracles Etc so have to be careful otherwise it argument is very sound we have to be careful as I said no translation is free from error then the other translation that you have is by m you the britisher but it's only translation there's no commentary there's no footnotes you have the translation of TB iring which is an American translation if an American English that's a good translation TB iring if you want to poetic translation then AR is there he's a non-muslim but it's a poetic translation these are many of the translations which will translate directly from Arabic to English and the famous one there are many other several there are some translations which have been translated from Arabic to another language uru and then to English for example by Malana ABI and that's called Quran that's a good translation it's in six volumes the new one is in more volumes and especially the new translation from Udu to English by Zafar Shakari is far better in English and it's a different view you know it's gives a different view a different angle of the Quran I just like to mention one more the other one which translated from Arabic to Udu to English is by m shamada it's in three volume so these are some of the important translations I think it's approximately 10 that I've mentioned there are more than 50 that are available and in the market maybe more just a sample for the viewers if they want they can refer with this translation"
