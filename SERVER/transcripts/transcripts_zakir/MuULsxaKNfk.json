  "transcript": "Dr Zak you mentioned a verse just now can we just ask you the significance of that verse eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears distinct from the black thread when this verse was revealed for the first time Surah bakar chapter number 2 verse number 187 it said that eat and drink till the white thread you can differentiate from the black thread moment this verse was revealed the sahabas understood the meaning as the ver the whe and it's mentioned in say Al bukari volume number six Hadith number 4509 that one saah the moment he heard this verse he took two hair strings one black and one white and he kept it beneath his pillow and when he got up for he tried to differentiate between the white string from the black string and he could not really understand so he went to the prophet and asked him what does it mean and and another Hadith it's mentioned in s bukari number six Hadith number 4510 where it says that one sahaba he took two threads one black thread and one white thread and he tied it in his toes in the legs and he kept on eating until he can differentiate between these two threads but when they went to the prophet and asked what does it mean that until you can differentiate the white thread from the black thread then the prophet made them understand what it actually means is until you can differentiate the white thread of dawn that means the light of dawn from the black thread of night and then the wor was revealed incomplete and the word of Dawn was revealed later on first the verse was until you can differentiate the white thread from the black thread then Allah reveals in between white thread of dawn the complete verse then is revealed so then it was made clear and I beloved proph Salli wasallam he explained the meaning of two fajer and he said that the first fjer is known as the false fajer where you see a vertical white streak of Light which is somewhat similar to the tail of a fox but that is known as the false fajer and the second fajer which is the true fajer is when the redness of light it spreads horizontally in the sky which you can see it in the mountains and which reaches the houses and the streets so that is the true fjer that is the break of dawn when a person should stop eating at that time and this is clarified further in the Hadith of the Prophet M wasallam it's mentioned in a of alaki Hadith number 8003 where the Prophet said the first fjer does not prohibit you from eating the food and it does not make the fjer prayer lawful and the second fajer that the true fajer it makes the eating of food prohibited and it makes the FJ Salah lawful so we made the differentiation between the two types of faj and further it's mentioned in the Hadith of sun Abu da number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2348 where the Prophet said let the people continue eating and drinking and should not stop when they see the white vertical light and they should keep on eating until they see the horizontal redness of F that the true faj and it's further mentioned in s Muslim Vol number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 247 and 248 pleased with her she said that let not the call of Bal with him and the whiteness of the first FA deceive the people and let them not stop eating that mean they can continue eating and there's another Hadith which says that let not the call of Bal deceive you continue eting until you hear the call ofum so this actually is the complete meaning of the quranic verse that you can eat until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black thread of night"
