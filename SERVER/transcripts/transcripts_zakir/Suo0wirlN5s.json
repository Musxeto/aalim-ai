  "title": "Great Goals and Consistency in Achieving them - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Allah says if you ask for a Allah gives you a and both. So our main goal should be aka even if it is 100% aka no problem dunya will come as a byproduct you know byproduct and I'll give you example in the end of my talk. You do only for a Allah will give you dunya without fail. But if you do only for dunya your a is gone. And this dunya as compared to a is very small. Average human being lives for about 70 75 years. Some may die early 50 years 40 years. Some may die 90 100 not more than that 110 compared to a eternal. So here Allah is telling that lucrative is profitable in Akra. You are a better businessman. People only want a small. Even if your problem for this 70 years, 80 years, no problem. Akara is eternal. A better businessman will target the Akara. A A is apt apt. It should be apt and it should be correct. If the goal that you're doing is apt as per Quran sunnah, it's perfect. M is measurable. You should be able to measure it. Not just big. For example, someone says, \"I want to build the tallest building in the world.\" Okay, it's a specific goal. Tallest building in the world. Is it measurable? Yes. Which is the tallest building today in the world? It is Bourj Khalifa. 823 m. So you have measurable. If you anything you make more than 823 m, it will become the tallest building in the world. Measurable. I intention. What should your intention be to achieve the goal? Your intention should be only and only to please Allah. Your intention should not be that you know people will praise me so that I become famous. If this is your intention in the your goal is not useful. Your intention should only be to please Allah and follow the commandments of Allah. If your intention is to please Allah, Allah will take care of you. And the last is C. That's consistent. Be consistent. For example, you plan that I want to read the complete Quran. Okay, I'll do it in the month of Ramadan. So you plan I will read one every day one juice one par. So in 30 days of Ramadan you finish 30 Jews 30 part of the full Quran you're consistent. If the goal is time bound then you be consistent till the goal is finished. Some goal are not time bound. For example you say I want to read the Quran daily. Okay fine I will daily read halfjus that is 10 pages every day be consistent forever our beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said when aisha may Allah be pleased with her it's mentioned hadith of say Muslim point number one hadith number 1711 may Allah be pleased with ask the prophet that what is the best of the things the prophet is The best is the best that is beloved to Allah is a thing that a person does consistently even if it is small. Allah loves those things that are done consistently even if they are small rather than doing one time big thing. Allah likes those things which are consistently and regular even if it is small. Consistent. So this is the acronym Islamic better than the management gurus who talk about smart."
