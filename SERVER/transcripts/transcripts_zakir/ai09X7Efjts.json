lecture by um she faric n he said that um the Quran right is the solution to the problem of humanity okay so I just want to know what the problem of humanity is yeah what the problem of humanity that the Quran is the solution to the problem that's my [Applause] question do you want for to answer or me to answer anyone I don't know can answer sisters asked the question that what is the solution for Humanity that Islam talks about my son faric he gave a full talk Islam as the solution for alcoholism Islam as the solution for drug addiction Islam as the solution for pornography he mentioned all that I think you didn't hear his talk sir I do not hear it ah you didn't hear it okay so you don't intend me to repeat his full talk again so he gave examples how s sorry what's actually the problem of humanity that Quran is Solutions yes Humanity has many problems for example Humanity has more number of women than men if every man marries one woman there'll be yet many women who will be unmarried so Quran says in Surah nter 4 verse number three marry woman if a choice in twos threes or fours if you can't do justice man you only one okay sorry sir sorry let me let me complete the answer so the full answer is in detail I'm saying in short today there's problem of terrorism so Quran give the solution Surah ma 5 verse number 32 if anyone kills any other innocent human being except be for murder or or for corruption of land it's as though he has killed the whole of humanity if any human being Muslim or non-muslim kills any other human being Muslim or non-muslim it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone saves any other human being whether Muslim or non-muslim innocent human being he saved the whole of Humanity there is no scripture in the world not even the Bible which has any verse close to this verse of the Quran isn't this the solution for terrorism yes or no okay sir today the problem alcoholism every year more than 4 million people die because of alcohol in the Bible the first miracle Jesus Christ peace be upon him did was converted water into wine okay sorry we don't agree with that we don't believe that Jesus CH did this miracle but the Bible says that in the Quran Allah says in Sur MAA chapter number 5 verse number 19 you believe most certainly toxic and gambling dedication of stone divination of arrows Rich to mean these are Satan hand work AB for me that you may Prosper so Quran has the solution if alcohol I'm a medical doctor I can give a talk of one hour what the problem with alcoholism sosis of liver pancreas esophagus cancer I can go on and on what is the solution prohibit it so Islam has solution to all the problems one by one if I it will take me 10 hours so my son pointed out few problems of humanity and gave the solution and told Islam is the solution to the problems of humanity so if you want to hear the talk again you can go on the YouTube and type faric Nik is Islam the solution for Humanity and you'll get the lecture you can see it again and inshallah you'll be convinced okay sir please can I say something sure okay sir if um there's a problem for Humanity now we are all humans right and then humans gener are supposed to have just a particular problem that can be applied to everybody sorry can you can you speak a bit slowly sister okay sorry slowly and loudly okay I said if we are all humans right yes now humans generally are supposed to have a particular problems that are Center to everybody it's not because that okay today she's poor she don't have money me I'm rich being rich or being poor is not a problem right because she's rich or maybe I'm poor that's not a problem but what I'm saying is that a problem is supposed to be applied to everybody if it's a problem for Humanity so now I don't know there's something I want to like point out because I'm a believer I'm a Christian now for you to have a problem that is applied to everybody it supposed to be something that everybody is should partake of it and it's Universal so now like sin is the problem of everybody on Earth because you not tell me that I've not done something wrong or she has not done something wrong but sin is universal poverty is something that everybody people are rich people are poor so it's not Universal but sin is something that is universal to everybody and it applied to everybody and that what we saw that that was what we saw that was that was what we saw that um that was what we saw that Christ came to this earth God came to fulfill on Earth I question I heard your question sister sister is saying she is not talking about problems which are only to some people like she's Rich she's poor it is a problem isn't she not a human being it is a problem it may not be a universal problem come to a universal problem afterwards so Islam has solution to Universal problem even to individual problem that's the beauty of the Quran being poor is not a problem if that's not a problem then give me all your money to me if being poor is Sir if if if being poor is not a problem I challenge you today to put all your wealth in my name will you do it no being poor is a problem so don't tell this sister please don't say being poor is not a problem because you're rich just because you're rich you saying being poor is not a problem I disagree with you wait sister wait let me complete the answer so being poor is a problem what is the solution I do agree everyone is not poor what is the solution zakat every rich person while saving of more than nisab level who has more than 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5% charity if aage person including you give 2.5% of their wealth in charity poverty will be eradicated from this world there will not be a single human being will die of hunger now coming to your question I do agree with you poverty is problem for most of them but not for everyone alcoholism may be problem for some not for everyone I agree with you you are telling sin is a universal problem I disagree with you every child is born masum he's sinless every it is your wrong conception show me one verse in the Bible does the Bible says you're born with sin you are saying you are a Christian everyone is Bor you don't know the Bible the Bible says in the Book of Ezekiel chapter number 18 verse number 20 the soul that sin shall die the soul that sin shall die you are talking about the original sin correct that Adam and Eve Adam made the Apple Eve temped Adam date the apple and everyone is born sinless this is your wrong reading of your Bible what the Bible says in the Book of Ezekiel sister I'm quoting from my memory God given computer you can open your Bible if you want you're a Christian correct yes are Christian in practice I'm more Christian than a Christian than you in practice in practice if Christian means following the teachings of Jesus Christ I'm more Christian than you I'm coming to your reply it's mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel chapter number 18 verse number 20 the soul that siners shall die the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither the father shall bear the iniquity of the son that means the son shall not bear the son of the father neither the father shall bear the sin of the son but if the person turns back he shall not die so that means Accord to the Bible sin is not inherited in Islam every child is born as a masum even even if he's born to a Christian parents born to a Hindu parent born to a Jewish parent or a Muslim parent that child is sinless so I disagree with you that sin is a universal problem after he grows because the Beloved Prophet said If a person is a child and if it is something in ignorance the pen is lifted he's not responsible he's not if a small child does something who's 3 years old if it does a mistake he's not to blame so in Islam everyone is not sinless that is your false teaching of the church the Bible also says the soul that Sinners shall die yes but the sun does not bear the iniquity of the father so even your example that sin is universal is a wrong example it goes against the teaching of your Bible but Islam has a solution even for sin Islam if you want to stay away from sin follow the Quran follow the Quran Quran has the solution to stay away from Sin Sin means anything you do in which you get a punishment follow the Quran the Quran shows you what is good for a human being what is bad for a human being hope the answer the question"
