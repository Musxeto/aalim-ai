  "transcript": "question seven if a person breaks his fast after sunset on the ground and immediately takes off in a plane and then sees the sun does he have to stop eating um is his fast valid or should he repeat it and this situation can happen to a traveler that he's in a place and the time for iftar is that the sun is set and he has iftar and immediately the plane takes off maybe two minutes after the sun sets at six o'clock and six o two two minutes after six o'clock the plane takes off and the moment the plane takes off it goes at a higher altitude and at that time you can see the sun so what happened does he have to stop eating the person who has completed his fast where he was staying the first is valid he doesn't stop eating the fast of that day is finished he has completed the fast he can have the star even when he goes to a high altitude and he sees the sun he need not stop eating his fast is completed but on the other hand if a person takes off two minutes before at 5 58 or 2 minutes to 6 2 minutes balance to break it fast and if he takes off and then sees the sun and he sees the sun for another five ten minutes he should not break his fast he can't say okay while at the ground two minutes was left so now at the six o'clock the time is up i will break my fast because then you can see the sun so at that time he should continue fasting only after the sun sets maybe after 5 minutes or 10 minutes or 15 minutes that's the time that it should break as fast and similarly while traveling in a plane if suppose the pilot is there and the sun can be seen the pilot should not take the plane down so that you can break the fast early but if there's a technical problem and they have to change the altitude and come down and if the sun sets for the person in the plane then they can break the fast"
