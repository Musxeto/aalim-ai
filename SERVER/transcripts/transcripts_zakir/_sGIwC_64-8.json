  "transcript": "my name is kalash I an atheist my question is why do Muslims believe that Jesus is born without any biological father when there is a Quran says that Allah says that he's the originator of Heaven and Earth how come he can have a son without any consult ask the question that Muslims believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born without any biological father father but the Quran says how shall almighty God have a son son when he doesn't have a wife as far as the miracle of isaam Quran says inah Imran 3 verse number 47 when maram says mother Mary that how shall I have a son when no man has touched me the reply come back Angel Gabriel when Allah decrees a matter he just said to it be and it is similarly inah Imran 3 verse number 159 Allah says the similitude of Jesus in front of Allah is like Adam that he was created from dust and said be and it was so what we realize that almighty God normally by Nature human beings are born by mother and father but to show the power of Allah that he can create even without a father the example is isaam another miracle Allah did created a human being without mother of father that Adam peace be upon him but the verse of the Quran saying that almighty God doesn't have a son neither does he have a concert neither does he have wife and further Quran also says that if Allah begot a son say I would be the first person to bow down to him that doesn't mean Allah has a son it's saying that there's no question of Allah begetting because begetting is the animal act it is functions of lower animals of sex that's the reason Allah will not beget Allah does not require a wife also wife is required by us human beings meeting is the function of no elal of sex so these verses of the Quran that if Allah has a son I would be the first to bound is negating that Allah can never have a son neither does Allah require a wife so these are concepts of the Quran trying to say don't Bel little Allah by saying almighty God has a wife or has a son it is not the Dignity of Allah who so gracious to have a son or to have ald [Applause]"
