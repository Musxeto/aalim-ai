  "transcript": "as far as the S of the male is concerned for a Muslim man it's from the navl to the knee there difference opinion whether the KN is included or not but the right opinion is different opinion I mean Shafi and that if the knee included or not but preferable is that to include the knee also so if you are shirtless without a top as long as from your navl downwards below the knee is covered it is permitted but you said a public gym so if you know that it's a public gym and if it's a gym where male and female are together and then if you think it will create a FNA by law it's permitted but it may can come in the maku category if you think is going to create a FNA that if it's a gym where both the Sexes are there and if you're somebody watching you and if you're want toate a fitna so it can come generally it's permitted but because you said public gym means in the open place and whether it's if it's only male then no problem at all if it's female and depending the other situation Etc but generally yes being topless in a public area for a male is permitted because his s is from the nvl to the knee"
