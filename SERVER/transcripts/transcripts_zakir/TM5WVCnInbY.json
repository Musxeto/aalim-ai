  "transcript": "let's go straight into the questions regarding the preparation what did the rasool Allah do in order to welcome Ramadan what was his preparation for Ramadan number three book of fasting Hadith number 1969 the wife of the Prophet Aisha may Allah she says that the prophet he never fasted any month completely except the month of ardhan and in no month did he fast as many days as he fasted in the month of Shaban so from this Hadith we come to know that Prophet Muhammad sallam in order to welcome the month of Ramadan he is to start he used to prepare himself and fast more in the previous month that is the month of Shaban that was his way how is to prepare for the month of Ramadan and further if you read in termedi chapter number 50 Hadith number 3451 which says may Allah be pleased with him he said on the 30th of his father that is father that is his grandfather he said whenever the prophet saw the new moon used to always pray to Allah and say oh Allah bless us in this month and is to mention the name of that month and then say that please keep a steadfast in faith in this month this was the way the prophet always is to pray to Allah whenever he saw a new moon it wasn't specifically only for the new man of the month of Ramadan but it was for all new moon when I wish to see and his special way of welcoming the month of Ramadan was that he used to mention about the coming of this blessed month to the people and it's mentioned in Muslim Ahmed ROM number two page number 2130 Hadith number 7148 he should tell the people that all people this blessed month is approaching you has ordained for you that you fast in this month and the Gates of Heaven will be open in this month and the Gates of Hell will be closed and the Devils will be chained and in this month there is a night which is better than a thousand months and if anyone is deprived of Allah's blessing in this month he is truly a deprived person so here we come to know that this is how Prophet Muslim used to welcome this month and he used to tell the good news of the Blessed month to come to all the people the next question to you is what should we do when Ramadan approaches the first thing we should do is we should thank Allah for making us witness this blessed month of Ramadan once again and we have to thank him for his Mercy and we have to ask forgiveness in this month so that all our previous sins will be forgiven and we have to thank him for all the name of he has given us all the blessings all the love this is the best month and Allah says in the Quran in Surah tap number two verse number 185 it says which means that Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guidance for mankind and signs for guidance and judgment between right and wrong and Allah for this is in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 183 Allah says oh you believe Museum in public or you believe fasting was prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-restraint the word used so that you learn God Consciousness so that you learn party so that you learn righteousness so this is the month in which a person can become more righteous this is the time when athakwa can be the highest and this is a month it is an annual training it is a sort of an overhauling of the body how we have that every Machinery requires some sort of servicing maybe every three months maybe every year and if you allow me to call the human beings as the best Machinery in the world doesn't it require a servicing or overhauling so Ramadan is an annual overhauling of the human body it is a spiritual and moral training for the human being and it is a purification of the body mind and soul this is the month where we can increase our takawa we can increase our patients and we can derive the benefits and the guidance from the Quran Allah"
