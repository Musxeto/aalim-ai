  "title": "Do you Endorse Saddam Hussain, Mujahideen and Palestinian Suicide Bombers? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "as a muslim personally i want to ask you this question in the current socio-political theological climate of stark black and white prevalent in the world today i find it extremely difficult to endorse any faction or even my own notions of right and wrong ruling out the biology of the prejudice it is an accepted norm today that it is a followers of the faith who reflect the faith itself assuming such an argument how can i make a stand how can i preserve the solidarity of my faith when there is a basic conflict of opinion between me and my islamic peers as an individual would you personally endorse the standard of a saddam hussein the passion of a mujahideen fighter or the death of a palestinian suicide bomber the sisters asked the question that seeing the conflicting views and ideas she doesn't know where she fits in who should she agree with who should she not agree with what should he say she's asking the question that do i agree with what's happening the palestinian mujahideens what's happening about saddam hussein etc sister as i told you many a time these issues are political what i say that everything has a hidden agenda and because i keep on traveling a lot and again right or wrong allah i can't say this is the thing but mainly the cause are a few selected people and the politicians again the politicians for political reasons they make someone the scapegoat and that's the reason they want to see to it that the ulterior motives have been solved me as a muslim if you ask me that what should i say if someone asked me i can only speak the truth if someone has caused them harm if someone has murdered them etc etc in this way if they retaliate it's allowed otherwise they cannot you ask me what's happening about a particular individual case osama bin laden or saddam hussein i say i don't know the background i cannot give a fatwa i can't give a verdict on them because i haven't interviewed them for me to give my opinion after interview with them so what i say allah allah allah knows best allah will not ask me on the day of judgment it's osama bin laden or not i will tell that if he has done wrong if he has broken the guidelines of quran and sunnah he's wrong if he hasn't broken his good that is not my basis to pass the examination what i have to read i have to read the quran i have to read the scripture this question can be dealt with those who are experts who keep on traveling to afghanistan taking interview etc and we find such coming in the paper etc if you as a muslim me as a muslim allah will not almighty god will not ask us the question or dear judgment that do you agree saddam hussein is the terrorist or not we have to say allah we don't know neither do we support them neither we condemn them if the solid proof of a particular person of a particular muslim who has done an act which is proven to be against the quran then we have to condemn him but if there's no proof which is substantial proof we have to remain neutral that's what quran says and your faith has been to shake sister your faith should be based on the truth which is mentioned in the scripture the best way to see to it that the faith is reinforced is to read the quran you will not find any defect in the quran you will not find any contrast in the quran if a person doesn't understand arabic as a language you have to read the translation of this book this is the translation of the lives of ali and the translations available outside in the fire that sister if you read how to lead a life based on the quran inshallah faith will become strong and believe me you will not feel shy at all to practice any of the fundamentals of islam if you know the reason and logic why these fundamentals have been prescribed if you know that believe me i keep on traveling in different parts of the world i mean i speak i go with this cap i have a beard i go to different western countries never ever faced a problem sometime query inquiry is there but never the problem i mean why should i get scared to speak the truth so if you have knowledge of the scripture and you know the reason and logic you will feel proud even you too will call yourself like me you will also call yourself a muslim fundamentalist"
