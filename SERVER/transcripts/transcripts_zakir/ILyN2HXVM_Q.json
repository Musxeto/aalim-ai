  "title": "Divine Wisdom behind Allowing the Israelis’ Atrocities, and the Role of the Muslim Ummah – Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "questions posed by Fatima Patel a university student from Birmingham UK why is Allah allowing the unjust Israeli forces to kill thousands of innocent Palestinians for the last seven weeks why does Allah not give Victory to the Palestinians what should the Muslims do this question calls for a very long answer the question POS was that that why is Allah allowing the unjust Israeli forces to kill thousands of Palestinians for the last 7 weeks and why does Allah not give the Palestinians Victory and what should Muslims do and we know that since the 7th of October 2023 this war has started between the Palestinians and Israel and in the last 7 weeks from 7th of October till today more than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed and this started after my sessions were discontinued while I was on a tour to Qatar and to Nigeria and I've given talks on this issue in several places including in my online talks in different parts in UK Etc also the last Jumba in Nigeria in the National mosque in Abuja was about 3 weeks ago and the topic was genocide in Palestine that are the 40 minutes kba talk I gave before the jum Salah but since this is the first time I'll be speaking on this issue so inshallah I will try to give the answer the question posed was that why is Allah allowing the unjust Israeli forces to kill thousands of Palestinians and we we know that the Palestinians they are protecting the third holiest site of Islam that is M they are doing on behalf of the Muslim umah and they are protecting the third Hol site that is M AA and they're if not we Muslim would have to go and protect the third Hol site of Islam and why is Allah allowing there are various reasons I'll just mentioned the important reasons number one Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 216 that you may hate a thing which may be good for you and you may love a thing which is bad for you Allah knows and you know not so many times a thing which you may feel is not good which you may hate if actually it may be good for you and a thing which you may love may not be good for for you Allah knows and you don't know I'd like to give you an incidence to explain this verse of the Quran once there was a man who was catching a flight from Doha to USA and he wanted to reach USA the next day it was a very important business deal in which he would get a minimum profit of a million dollar while going towards the airport there was a traffic jam and due to the traffic jam he's unable to reach to their airport in time to catch his flight and he misses the flight and he says this is the worst thing that happened in my life I missed the flight and now I'll miss the meeting and I will lose a profit of more than a million dollar that I was going to make on his way back when he's returning back home he he he hears on the radio that the flight that he was about to catch from Doha to New York the flight while taking off it crashes and all the passengers in that flight they die so the person says Ah this is the best thing that happened to me that I missed the flight imagine just an hour before he was seeing that he missed the flight and that was the worst thing that happened to him in his life and He was cursing one hour later when he realizes the flight he was about to catch which was about to board it crashes and all the passengers die he says to Allah subhana ta'ala that this is the best thing that happened to him in his life so that's what Allah says in the Quran in Surah bakar CH 2 verse number 216 that you may hate a thing which may be good for you and you may love a thing which may be bad for you you do not know Allah knows so in this situation we know that on the face of it more than 15,000 innocent Palestinians have been killed and there was a th fire for approximately a week and again the bombarding has started since yesterday and yesterday alone more than 100 100 innocent Palestinians were killed and out of those killed more than 15,000 two3 of them are women and children more than 40% are children and more than 27% are women on the face of it of course we feel what's happening is wrong and it's totally wrong but when we look at the brighter side or the other side of it we realize that this war between the Palestinians and the Israeli forces is continuing since decades since more than 75 years this war is taking place and we know that the Israelis have occupied the land of the Muslims of the Palestinians the Arabs and we know that the Muslims more than 75 80 years back they welcome them Hitler ins 6 million Jews many of the Jews came to Palestine and the Muslim welcomed them but later on the same Israelis the Jews who were given Shelter by the Muslims by the Palestinian Arabs they kick them out of the house and when they want the land back they are saying that they're terrorist we know this is going on since many years unfortunately unfortunately the world many countries in the world they're supporting this unjust Act of the Israelis that they are settlers they occupiers they have occupied the land and now they are calling the people to whom the land belongs as terrorist if you look at the brighter side of this issue when this war started on 7th of October one week later when there was a poll done 65% of the people around the world they supported Palestine in the favor of Palestine and 35% they supported Israel but one month after the war when we realize that the footage of the social media which went viral and showed the Injustice done by the IDF the Israeli Defense Forces that they killed innocent people they targeted they broke most of the international laws of war they selectively targeted civilians they selectively targeted innocent children women they targeted hospitals they targeted schools they targeted mosqu and they broke almost all International laws of war and this was known to the world because today the world is a global village on the social media on the Facebook on YouTube on Instagram on Tik Tok we have live images never before has it happened before when the wars took place in 1948 in 1973 and all these wars we used to get some videos or some audios maybe few days later few weeks later few months later not knowing whether it's true or not now we can have a life telecast because of the social media because of the International satellite channel so when the poll was taken a month after this wall started alhamdulillah 95% of the world was in favor of Palestine and only 5% in favor of Israel and now nearly 7 weeks after this surely the percentage in favor of Israel may have risen maybe it's 97 or 98% and hardly 2 or 3% are yet supporting Israel what we find in the social media though the heads of these Western countries whether it be USA whether it be UK whether it be European countries they yet supporting Israel it is an injust act you can see the double standards that us had as compared to Ukraine when Russia attacked Ukraine it gave all its support to Ukraine to defend against Israel and here they're doing exactly the opposite and if you compare between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Palestine there's a difference of chalk and cheese the Israelis are much more wrong as compared to what happened between Russia and Ukraine because this land belonged to the Palestinians and they were occupiers yet today America supports Israel and this year alone they have funded $3.8 billion only in military equipment to Israel to attack innocent Palestinians and kill 15,000 Palestinians you see the double standards and the world has come to know about this and now we feel that though the heads of states the heads of countries of these Western countries are yet supporting Israel but the masses leave aside the Muslim Muslims even the non-muslim masses in America in UK there are strong protests in thousands in tens of thousands and hundreds of thousand supporting the Palestinian cause and we can see this so if you see the brighter side we know we really pray for the Palestinians you know may Allah give them may Allah give them set fastness may Allah give them sa may Allah Grant those two the Mars but if you look at the brighter side that 15,000 have been killed yes it is depressing it is worth condeming but we realize that what the world did not know for the last more than 75 years in this last two months in last s weeks the world has come to know what Israelis are and they have come to know the truth that the reason you have in the parliament of various Western countries the masses the common man in the Western countries it's supporting Palestine so this if you see with a with that 15,000 people have died yes it's a point to be condemned it's if we we feel hurt about it but you see the brighter side of the coin that now the world has come to know about it so that's the reason when certain Islamic scholars have discussed and they realize that what has happened is better in the long run that now at least the world has come to know so that's why Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chap 2 verse number 216 you may hate a thing which may be good for you and you may love a thing which is not good for you Allah knows and you do not know Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 155 and 156 Allah says that surely we will test you with something of fear and hunger with loss of lives and fruits of your toil give Glad Tidings to those who patiently persevere those who have S and verse number 156 says and those people who when they inflicted with Calamity they says in that surely from him we come and surely to him will we return so here Allah subhana taala is saying that surely we will test every human being with something of fear and hunger with loss of life and your goods and the fruits which you have gained and blessed of those people who do sa who patiently persevere so here Allah subhana wa ta'ala says that surely you're going to test every human being do you think you will enter Heaven without being tested and we know that more difficult the test is more higher is the reward and we know that amongst all the human being that have have come from Adam Alam till today the ambas The Messengers the prophets of God have been tested the most severely that's the reason Allah subhana wa ta'ala have given them a higher status the test that the ambas The Messengers the prophets of almighty God have undergone is more difficult than the nonprofits and then we know that the test the sahabas at the time of the Prophet for 00 years ago and the sa they underwent that is the second most difficult test so surely you should know that the test undergone by the Ambia is much more difficult and higher the test if you pass that test higher the reward so one thing you have to realize that if there is a Calamity the Calamity can be two it can be for two reasons one it can be as a punishment for the evil evil you have done or second it can be a test for you so if the person is on the straight path following Allah and hiso following the Quran and and if a Calamity comes it is surely a test for him Allah wants to test him on a higher level and more difficult the Calamity and if the believer passes it the higher reward he'll get inshallah if the person is not on the straight path and if a Calamity comes then surely the Calamity is a punishment for him so this test that the Palestinians are enduring is really a very difficult test and Allah is testing them surely he'll test everyone with something of fear of hunger with loss of life with loss of fruits that you have gained with the toiling that you have done and give Glad Tidings to those who patiently persevere and Allah subh says in the Glorious Quran in Surah Bak chapter number 2 verse number 26 that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala does not lay a burden more than what a person can bear Allah subhana wa ta'ala gives a promise in the Quran that no human being does Allah subhanahu wa taala lay a burden more than he can bear and as you go ahead in the verse that's the last verse of Surah B it says that we pray to Allah subhana tala lay not on us a burden greater than we can be so here Allah subhana tala is saying when Allah has given a promise that he will not lay a burden greater on any human being more than what he can bear then why are we praying to Allah that lay not on us a burden greater than we can be many times the human being themselves puts in a position where they let the burden come on them so they are to blame they dig their own grave so yeah Allah subhah wa ta'ala promises that he will not put on anyone a burden greater than he can bear and Allah subh says in the Glorious Quran in Surah M chapter number 67 verse number two it's Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in Deeds so this life is the test for the Hereafter we are living this life as a test for the Hereafter and Allah is testing that which of us is good in Deeds so whatever that happen in this world it's a test for the Hereafter regarding coming to your question your question that why does Allah allow the unjust Israeli forces to kill thousands of Palestinians this life is a test Allah is testing Allah wants to test different human beings of different parts of the world and when Allah is testing Allah can easily stop this massacre for Allah to stop the genocide is very easy Allah just had to say be an it is but then how will he understand he'll understand but how will we understand that have we passed the test or not Allah subhana tal is in make Allah is testing us and Allah is letting us know how we will F the test so on the day of judgment no human being can object to the justice of Allah Allah subh tala knows which human being will pass on Earth but we don't know so this all these incidents is are tests and when Allah is testing first we know that the atrocities that has been inflicted on the Palestinians according to me almost all a majority more than 95% will surely pass this test with flying colors the Palestinians there may be few a very small minority a very small percentage who may be hand in glove with the Israeli or maybe breaking all of the Quran Sunnah but majority almost all surely more than 95% of the Palestinians they are going to pass this test with flying colors and we can see that we have got evidence that mothers whose children have been mared they say that if Allah gives us more 10 children we would love them to be mared in the way of Allah subhana tala we have children giving testimony we have women giving testimony the mothers the fathers and we can see the way they are reacting and because of this the non-muslims when they seeing that what is making these Palestinians even after they been tortured after theyve been massacred after their family members have been killed yet they saying alhamdulillah yet they're praising Allah subhana wa ta'ala it is making thousands of tens of thousands of Muslims to read the Quran that how come these Palestinians even after this genocide they're thanking the great Allah subhana wa tala and because tens of thousands of non-muslim reading the Quran and when they read the Quran their hearts are opened up their mind is opened up and they said what is this book and alhamdulillah in the span of last s week there are thousands or tens of thousands of non-muslims who have accepted Islam allahar so you can know that this what has happened in the last 7 weeks because of the atrocities because of the genocide done by the Israeli forces on the Palestinians and we can see the double standards of the media the media is defending the mainstream media whether it be CNN whether it be BBC they have been giving false narratives that the Palestinian forces they are killing innocent babies they are torturing innocent civilians all these are fabricated news and once when they exposed many many people are losing faith in the mainstream media whether it be BBC whether it be CNN and they're going to Alternative better truthful media like Al jaaz like Al Arabia and we can see the difference so all this is a plan of Allah subhana tala he letting the world know and we can see thousands of people embracing Islam and you can see the testimony that they are Christians they're Jews many Jews are coming out in open and seeing that we condemn the Israeli they zist they are not Jews they are not following the book of of almighty God they are against the teachings of Judaism there are demonstrations of thousands of Jews in America in UK and all over the world they are condemning Israel and the testimonies are filled in the social media many of the social media accounts are being blocked they are being tampered with they are being silenced but they get silenced a few hundred a few thousand but not Millions so here you can find that because of this war the unjust War the atrocities done by Israelis and Palestinian for the last seven weeks because of that the world has come to know so it was surely a very good bargain that yes 15,000 people have been killed but all the 15,000 people more than 15,000 who have been killed or maybe many more which are unidentified maybe in rebeles all of them inshallah will go to J F all of these innocent people will go to J F so they have passed this test what we have SE to it that Allah subhana wa ta'ala is testing the human being he's not only testing the Palestinians at the same time he's giving rope for the people are doing atrocities to continue he's letting as the Quran says he's letting the unbelievers go astray giving them rope to hang themselves Allah can solve this problem very easily but he's letting them do the Injustice so that he can hold them accountable so that he can give them hell in the yearafter and Allah is checking the other non-muslim what are they doing are they agreeing with this atrocity are they supporting this genocide what's happening in UA what's happening in un so here we come to know that Allah is testing everyone not only the Palestinians and the Israelis but even the Muslims and non-muslims all over the world and we know that the Palestinian and inshallah are going to pass with flying colors and the Israeli if not all almost all who are doing Injustice especially the Zionist the Zionist who are planning all this they will surely be entered in the Hellfire in the Hereafter now Allah is opening eyes of the non-muslims what are they doing are they supporting this unjust regime at the same time Allah is even testing the Muslims what are we Muslims doing what are we doing are we just sitting and doing nothing a beloved Prophet M wasallam said that if anyone of the Muslim the whole Muslim umah is like one body and if one part of the body is in pain the whole body is in pain so if one part of the body suffers anyone in the Muslim umah suffers the whole umah should stand for it what are we doing the Palestinians inshallah almost all majority of them will pass with fly colors what are we Muslims doing is it this not a test for us also and I've given a talk before on the 13o action planned by the Muslim umah for the Palestinian cause and the last talk I gave before the jum Salah in Nigeria in Abuja in the National mosque it was 15 Point action plan for the Muslim umah as far as the Palestinian issue is concerned time will not per to speak in detail I'll just briefly mention about this because the questioner the first part of the question was why does Allah allow the Israeli forces the unjust Israeli forces to kill thousands of Palestinians because Allah is testing them why doesn't Allah give Victory to the Palestinians and Allah can give them very easily I said and we know in history that in the Battle of bad where the Muslims were hardly 33 and the enemies were more than a thousand three times more yet they were victorious the enemies were more powerful they were more well equipped they better horses they had better equipment for fighting yet because of support of Allah in the Battle of bad the Muslims they defeated the non-muslims even though they were three times in number we know if mention the the Quran and from history Prophet David peace be upon him very weak very small in terms of numbers but when he fought with gol who was more powerful more stronger much bigger more in number yet the victory was with those who are in the truth so Allah is testing Allah is waiting and seeing what are the other non-muslims doing what are the Muslims doing and coming to the question that what should the Muslims do two I'll just say in brief the 15o action plan for the Muslim umah as far as the Palestinian causes concerned number one you have to realize that the Palestinians they are protecting the third holiest site of Islam M AA they are doing for the if they would not have protected have sacrificed their life sacrifice the weal that they have in protecting the third holiest site it would have been duty of every Muslim all over the world to go and physically protect that site so they are doing for the so we owe it to them and in the 15o action plan the first seven can be done by any Muslim whether he's rich or poor whether black or white whether Arab or non-arab whether living close to Palestine or far away from Palestine irrespective every Muslim can do the seven points the first seven points the Balan eight points from the 15th Point action plan can be done by those people who Allah has given Nama or have blessed with certain facility but the first seven every individual Muslim can do whether the rich or poor whether black or white whether Arab or non-arab whichever part of the world he living in number one the least a Muslim can do is do Dua for our brothers and sisters in Palestine the least we can do is do Dua to Allah subhana wa ta'ala we pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may he give steadfastness to the Palestinians may he give them sa may he Elevate the suffering may he ease things for them may he Grant J F to the people who have been mared may he make it easy for the family members of those who have been mared the least we can do is to Dua and we find that mashallah the Muslim umah in many parts of the world they are following the sunah of the Prophet that in times of Calamity we have to read du and we can do that in all Salah in the last after when we get up the prophet the Sunnah that in times of Calamity he prayed to Allah subhana after getting up from ru in the last of all theah we do Dua and alhamdulillah alhamdulillah we find that different parts of the world people are praying especially in Malaysia mashallah in most of the MOs five times a day we find that people iding and they are praying for the Palestinian brothers and sisters and we are praying in Jam that may Allah give them sa may Allah Elevate them and may he take away their suffering may he Grant J fos to the people who have been mattered and may he give them Victory and individually we should do as much as as possible especially in the last one-third of the night and the prophet said in the last oneir of the night there is one hour where Allah subhana waa descends to the lower heaven and asks is there any of my servants who want something and I will answer his prayer so the best time in the full day to Dua is the last one third of the night especially in tud in the night prayer in theud when we pray to Allah it's the best and those who pray tud this is the best time time in the last one third of night especially in the sujud pray for the Palestinian brothers and sisters and those who don't pray tud regularly are not used to praying tud this may be an excuse for you that at least get up in the last one third of night maybe one hour before the FJ or half an hour before the F aan and pray tud you may never know by this it may become a part of a lifestyle which is one of the most important Sunnah after the far number two it the duty of every Muslim that he should make the people aware the people around him whether they be Muslims whether they be non-muslims the atrocity that the Zionist the Israeli Jews are doing on the Arab Muslim Palestinian brothers and sisters you can inform one to one to your friends maybe to Gathering maybe on the social media whether you have a Facebook account whether on the WhatsApp whether on the YouTube YouTube whether on the Instagram whether on Tik Tok whether on X see to it that you make the people aware of the atrocities the Israelis are doing the Zionist are doing on the Palestinian brothers and sisters on the innocent children on the innocent human being on the innocent woman and we can find that in the last one week when there was a truth for approximately 7 days it was 4 days extended to 5 days then 6 days then 7 days and we find when the hostages were being released you can see the difference when the Palestinian resistant forces when they were releasing the hostages you could find that the hostage is really respected those hostages who were with the Palestinians for about four weeks 5 weeks 6 weeks 7 weeks you could find that how close they were to them you know and they were smiling and they were happy and you can see the stories that how when they were released they praised the people who kept them captive and you can hear the stories what they said that these people they protected us and imagine imagine if you were one of them if you were one of the captives one of the hostages and imagine when you have been taken away by the Palestinians and you realize that your own country Israel they are dropping bombs they doing carpet bombing they have nearly destroyed more than half of Gaza they have displaced hundreds of thousands of human beings of the Palestinians in Gaza they have killed more than 15,000 Palestinians and thousands more they may be under Troubles of the buildings they may not be yet traced and when you find that your own country is bombing and your captives are taking you under the tunnel and keeping you safe what will be the plight imagine they are dropping bombs your own country is dropping bombs on you and the people who have captured you they're protecting you from your own country what a sight allahar and they saw to it that they gave them food and they gave them food better than what they ate and they knew that though there were thousands of Palestinian were dying there were tens of thousands were hungry yet they saw to it that the few hundred hostages that they had they saw to it that they gave them good food they took care of them they had medical doctors attending them 24 by7 they thought they took care of the needs of the wom and they thought to it that they felt safe the treatment that they got for the last few weeks five weeks 6 weeks 7 weeks was phenomenal it changed their life contrast with a v when the Israeli forces when they are releasing the hostage which they kept for 5 years 10 years 15 years without any charges when they were released they were talking about the atrocities that the Israelis did on them the condition of the prisons were atrocious they were not giv food to eat they were not even giving one proper meal a day they could not see the outside world and they were not allowed to read books not allowed to here the news you could see the contrast between the two hostages or the two types of prisoners and when the resistant force of Palestine when they were raing the hostage you could see the smile on the face of the hostages they were shaking hands they were saying goodbye they were uh meeting each other as though they're going to miss them as though they're saying that thank you for taking care of us on the other side here the atrocities they did the Injustice they did and the news that the pales inan who were captured by the Israeli forces and were kept without any reason for years together they were threatened that we will rape you the woman were threatened that they'll be raped they were threatened that the children will be killed that they'll be burned alive they were threatened that their parents will be killed they were tortured see the contrast gives an example of a true Muslim that even though when they kept hostages they sought to it that they protected them they protected them more than their own family members they protecting them more than what they did to their own citizens so this is a sample of Islam and surely the world has seen this because of which thousands of non-muslims accepted Islam so much so that the Israeli have put a band on the hostages that were released by the Palestinian resistant forces they told that the released hostage should not give any interview to any of the news channel they were afraid so you you can see that this is Allah's plan why if Allah wants Allah can stop it but Allah is exposing the double standards of the Western World exposing the atrocities done imagine if Allah wanted on day one Allah could have easily seen to it that the Palestinians win the war but the world wouldn't have known yet the world would have had a soft corner for the Jews for the Zionist for Israel now it is confirmed that more than 95% of the world Muslims and non-muslims alike they know the atrocity is done by the Israelis by the Zionist so this is Allah's plan number two should make it known to the best of ability every Muslim to make it common they find it they should spread it check up that the news is correct and spread it on their social media account on the Facebook on the WhatsApp on the YouTube on the Instagram on the Tik Tok on the Twitter on the X as far as possible number three I request every Muslim the 10 most important people that he has on his list he should see to it that he personally messages them or calls them or speaks to them and talks about this issue and how we should support the Palestinians and stop the genocide atrocities done by the Israelis and the Palestinians the 10 best people from some people may know heads of States some people may be aware of the Prime Ministers of the of the presidents of the ministers or you may be a common man your top may be a Secretary General of your building committee he may be maybe a principal of a school whichever 10 most important people that you feel you know see to it that you personally one to one convey this message and talk about the atrocities done by the Israelis on the Palestinians Point number four see to it that to discuss this in Gatherings whether you go to school see to put on the school notice board on the colleges on the universities see to that your street place that you make it more common as much as awareness as possible to expose the double standard of the Western World to expose that the double standards of USA what they are doing in the war between Russia and Ukraine and what they're doing between the war with Israel and Palestinian the standard should be exposed Point number five see to it that you take part in a protest against the ATR is done by the Zionist the Israeli forces against the Palestinian see to it that you gather in large numbers in your area in your city in your country and protest should be peaceful it should not be violent you should not destroy properties should not touch up Vehicles it should be a peaceful protest so that the larger the numbers are the more aware will the people know and alhamdulillah alhamdulillah never in the history of the world ever had they been such large support for the Palestinian in the last 100 years never ever has there been so much support by the non-muslims for the Palestinian cause and you can find non-muslims waving flags and they are supporting saying that Palestine should be freed and stop the atrocity stop the genocide you should take part in protest point number six that we should ban the products of Israel and ban the products of those country that are supporting Israel so that we put an economic pressure on them and we find this is happening in many of the Muslim countries including Malaysia that they're banning the products of Starbucks of McDonald's of KFC and you find that the business is dwindling so much so that now they want to give free Burger they want to give free chicken and so on and so forth trying to attract the people we should see to it that this should be sustained we boycott the products of Israel and boycott the products of those countries that are supporting the unjust cause of Israel Point number seven that every Muslim should donate whatever possible in his capacity for the Palestinian Cause And while giving donation the amount is not important the percentage is important and I always say that if a person who earned $1,000 a month and he donates $100 for the Palestinian cause he's donating 10% of his monthly income on the other hand if a billionaire who earns a billion dollar a month from that he donates a million dollar for the Palestinian cause $1 million of a billion dollar is 0 one% whereas $100 of $1,000 is 10% so the person who earns $1,000 and donates $100 for the Palestinian cause will get 100 times more Saab than a person who earns a billion dollar a month and donates a million dollar because $100 is 10% of his income and $1 million of a person who earns a billion dollar a month is .1% of his income so the person who donates $100 after earning $1,000 will get 100 times more Saab than a person who donates a million dollar after he earns a billion dollar so while giving charity you cannot say I'm poor whatever you are whatever you have how much are you willing to sacrifice what percentage of income whether it be a dollar or $10 or $1,000 or a million dollar Allah will look at the percentage not on the amount and therefore I say to all the people with the rich or whether the middle class or the poor people that make it a habit to give a percentage of what to earn in the way of Allah subhana wa tala and see how your income how your earnings how your savings keep on inre ining these first seven points every Muslim in the world can do whether rich or poor black or white whether Arab or non-arab whichever part of the world is think he has no excuse of not praying for the Palestine brothers and sisters not praying for the victory for them not spreading it one to one on the group on the social media not telling to the 10 important people that he knows personally seeing to that he convey in the place he works in the college he or she studied in the University make it more common see to it that he Jo the protest in large numbers against the unjust regime of the Zionist the Israelis that he boycotts the product of the Israelis and those countries supporting Israel and last is contribute whatever he can in the way of Allah subhana tala many people talk oh this rich country don't do anything what are they doing Allah will not question you why the rich Head of the State of when another country donating or not Allah will question you what have you done I've given you th ous a month couldn't you sacrifice from it so for the first seven points no muslim rich or poor black or white Arab or nonar has excuse of not taking part in the First Seven Points the balance eight points from the 15 Point action plan can only B those people who Allah has given the facility have the Nama that he can do Point number eight those Muslims who own satellite channels or who have friends who own satellite channels or know people who own satellite channels or the international media whether it be the international newspapers whether it be International magazines whether it be radio broadcast station whether it be satellite channels what they should do that see to it he they should coax them or give them information so that they can show on the media everyone may not be owning channels or maybe having influence but those who have see to it that you influence them and make sure that they spread the truth on the media Point number nine there should be a battery of international lawyers International lawyers who can file a case in the international court of law on war crimes against Israel whether you get results or not you at least do it if you're near Allah give you so there should be an organization of international lawyers who are well qualified and well known and see to it that you file a case in the international law and we know that many years ago Dr M Muhammad the former prime minister of Malaysia he had made a kumur war crimes had made a colur international Court where he put to trial Tony Blair and George Bush who were responsible for the massacre done in Iraq where hundreds of thousands of lives were killed and sanction because of which many children were killed and he called International judges International lawyers and after the case Tony Blair and George Bush did not come to defend themselves Etc but after the case was done there was a resolution that if the former president of USA George Bush or the former prime minister of UK Tony blade set foot in Malaysia they be arrested mallah so see what results so we should have a battery of lawyers seeing to it that whether we get results or not we should see to it that we file a case against Israel for the war crimes and for the atrocities that did this is point number nine point number 10 that we should make a wak exclusively for the people of Palestine exclusively for M AA make a work maybe with investment whatever capacity you have see to it that you join along with your friends and make a W for the cause of Palestine whether it may support to have international lawyers or whether it may give support as a as aid for the education aid for the medical Aid or various options are there this should be Point number 10 point number 11 those countries which have an Israeli Embassy see to that officially the government where the embassies are there they should give an official letter to the ambassadors of Israel in the country saying that we are against this genocide that's happening in Palestine and the genocide should stop immediately Point number 12 that they should be trade boycott between Israel and the country where you live and you'll be shocked not only Muslim countries many non-muslim countries they said that they send the ambassadors back and point number 12 is that if they straight back there will be an economic impact on Israel stop buying weapons from them stock buying any Israeli Goods we can always find a substitute Point number 13 that we should severe The Diplomatic relationship severing The Diplomatic relationship that we will no longer have the Embassy of Israel in a country and we will not have our Embassy in Israel C The Diplomatic relationship if you severe it's a very hard warning unfortunately these people are very well equipped with the best of equipment best of arms and ammunition and they're killing innocent human beings so number 13 is that severe diplomatic relationships number 14 is that how the Western countries have a natto North Atlantic Treaty Organization that means there are about 31 countries which which are members America and most of the European countries they have 31 countries which are member and they say that if any country attracts any one of these 31 countries it is as though you have attracted all 31 countes together it's called as NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization so the Muslims which should have metto Muslim country Treaty Organization you know there are 57 countries in the world more than 25% in which Muslims are in majority so all these 57 Muslim countries get together and if they have this metto Muslim country Tre organization and have the same rules as NATO why should people object when you can have the Western countries together and and pass a resolution that if anyone attacks anyone of these country it is as though you have attacked all the 5 Muslim countries and lastly the 15th point point is that we should reestablish theaa we know that KFA was abolished about 100 years back in 1923 when was there and the treaty was signed for 100 years now 100 years over so we should reestablish the so the Muslims are united under one manner Allah says in the Quran in Imran 3:3 hold strong to the Rope of Allah and be not divided the Rope of Allah if the Glorious Quran and the say and under this Banner the Muslims can I'm not seeing that all the countes joined together at least let there be an umbrella Let There Be umbrella each one can have can be leader of the country but let there be a joint common umbrella to the Muslims are united and if they're united inshallah we will not be disturbed happening now and we know the Hadi of the Prophet wasallam that Muslims will be looked down upon and one of the person asked the prophet that is it so because the Muslim will be be lesser number the prophet said no muslim would be large number but we'll be like FR FR which has no particular purpose only only numbers so he said why because the Muslims would love this Dunya and would be afraid of death the Muslim will be love the duny and be afraid of death this is the reason we'll be in this situation so inshallah inshallah when the Muslims will stop loving the dun and stop fearing death in inshah you will find that Muslim will be victorious so for Allah subhah wa ta'ala to solve this problem as I mentioned earlier is very easy so the first question is that why is Allah allowing Israelis to kill thousands of P I told you it's a test for thereafter what should the Muslims do I've G the 15o program and the last question that why doesn't Allah give Victory to the Palestinians for Allah to give Victory is very easy Allah is testing us Allah is seeing whether we Muslims pass the test or not and I give the 15 Point action plan for Allah to solve the problem very easy Allah says in the Quran in no less than three different places in Surah number 9 verse number 33 in Surah 48:28 and chter number 61 verse number 9 Allah sent his messenger with guidance and theion of Truth so that it will PR over all the other religions over all the other isms whether it be christianism Judaism Hinduism socialism atheism Islam is des to suped all master them all and Allah ends out of three places and two places how the mus don't like it and one place Allah says that and enough is Allah as a witness so for Allah to solve this problem is very easy but Allah is testing us with fear and hunger with loss of life Allah is testing us see who's going to pass this test Allah is given opportunity what are we doing for the cause of Palestine what are we doing Allah has given us such luxurious life and when we see the thing that's happening that imagine there the people are dying the children are being murdered and we are living away so much in comfort in the luxury of a house in air condition with all the facility what are we doing for the Coss Allah is testing us and for Allah subhana wa ta'ala Allah does not require you and me the raish that we are Allah has promised in this Quran that this Dean will prevail over all the other religions and the Hadith is very clearcut that before the day of judgment before the world ends Muslims will rule the world for seven years it would be the best ERA we will rule the world for seven years and later on there'll be a sweet wind which will put to death all the Believers and then the Kama will start so Allah subhah wa ta'ala for him to give Victory to the Palestinian is easy so we Muslims should realize that we should have faith in Allah and we find unfortunately the situation of the Muslim country is very very bad most of the Muslim countries there are few which are speaking very few country maybe Qatar uh maybe Malaysia few countries are only speaking actually against the atrocities of Israel in support of Palestine Allah subhana wa ta'ala is testing what are we doing it's a test so for Allah to solve the problem very easy do we have faith in Allah that with Allah's help surely we'll be victorious so inshallah inshallah Victory will surely be there today or tomorrow maybe after a week after a month after a year surely we are going to be Victorious and for seven years the Muslims will rule the world with peace and prosperity hope the ansers the question"
