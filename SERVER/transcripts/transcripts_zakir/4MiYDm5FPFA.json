across the world you are from india you are from bangladesh you are from ethiopia and again from india nur nabil from india i am a medical aspirant from childhood i wanted to be a doctor but after seeing your lectures and debates my dream has been changed i heard that after watching sheikh ahmad dida's lecture you chose to become a preacher and alhamdulillah he has inspired you you inspire me now my dream has changed i want to be like you and want to spread this lovely message to all the humanity but i know this work is not easy so what advice you want to give me and many muslim youth who have a dream like me similar question asked by sayad abdullah hyderabad india what should i do to be a student i have only picked up five similar questions believe me such questions are in hundreds if i read only we'll take ask so i've just clubbed all the questions so that i'll try and answer all together the similar question the basic question asked by these five people are is that they want to be my student number one they want to be a die number two they want to study comparative religion as far as being a student of mine personally on a personal level i don't have any student yes i have taken our training programs in the past and there are these students of mine but on a personal level because of my busy schedule because of my activity involved in dawa etc like there are many of the scholars and guys they have got holocaust etc i don't have one to one regular meeting i mainly have on the social media on the satellite channel where 100 million are watching as far as training personally is concerned i have done only four dhawa training program on a big level one day half a day many but for a few days put together i've done two training programs for the students in india one was the first field of dao attending program which i did in the mid 90s and the late 90s and i did a second phase of the hour training program both these training programs had about 20 students then in 1999 i did the first international java training program where we selected 20 students from different parts of the world from different parts of the world and we had thousands of applications those we felt deserve more we selected 20 and after 1999 after 16 and a half years we had in november 1999 again in january february 2016 after about 16 and a half year i had the second international our training program and the purpose of the second international dive training program was and it was for a longer duration it was updated it was for about 45 days the actual working day was 33 it was five days a week two days holidays in between with a lot of homework so total cost was for about 45 days and it was updated and one of the reason was that when we did the second international dawa training program in bombay we call people after receiving thousands of application we call people you know we had from malaysia itself maximum we had six people two from singapore one from japan one from holland one from the uk and from different parts of the world from india we are from china and this training program i recorded in a very high format we recorded it with 14 cameras of four can 8k cameras so that once we record it once we edit it it would be for the next 50 60 years so the main purpose of this was besides training this these 20 people which was the smaller aim the bigger aim was having it recorded updating my notes so that we can make it public unfortunately this this tower training program took place in january and february and ended in the end of february and the other thing sessions continued even later after that within a couple of months i had to leave india and then you know there was allegation against me in july 2016 and the organization was banned in november 2016 because of that if you could not have the program edited could not have it uploaded but alhamdulillah as i mentioned earlier that in the beginning of ramadan we had the complete new website of mine by the address zakir naik dot com and it is yet under process of more material is being added on it but there's a complete new section to it which is called as international java training program idtp and this international dial training program was supposed to be launched in the mid ramadan but because i started having the sessions live sessions i could not give time to it but inshallah in the next four to eight weeks inshallah whether towards the end of this month june or before the end of july inshallah inshallah the international dhawa training program will be launched on our website it's a different it's a different website all together but it will be part of my main website and in this international dowa training program all the notes of the dhawa training program on islam on comparative religion will be uploaded it's thousands of pages these notes the dhawa training program is more of a technique based rather than knowledge based most of the training programs give knowledge but don't give technique this training program is more of technique based even though it's not knowledge-based it it it yet has about a thousand pages and in if you do online inshallah it may not have the same effect as doing the training program directly with me but yet inshallah if you do it online it will have approximately 15 of impact of doing the course with me directly the videos are not edited allah knows best when will be edited but as soon as time permits or when we have the facility it may take two years three years four years i don't know we will have even the videos uploaded with the videos uploaded and the notes according to me it will be approximately 30 percent effective as effective as doing the course directly but the reason i had the notes prepared and uploaded and the videos also inshallah will be done because for a trainer to have this material and then have a training session of having 20 muslim students following the notes following the video and just being a supervisor then inshallah it will have 50 impact if all the same notes are given and if the videos are shown and there is a supervisor to supervise you know amongst the students who did mashallah in the first phase in the second phase mashallah i'm happy to tell you that in in the in the first phase mashallah there were at least few people who who were qualified to become trainers and and maybe about 50 percent are doing dhawa and yet continuing mashallah in the second phase my shadow the number of people doing active dawah is much more than the first phase and mashallah more people i think are qualified to be trainers than in the first phase the second phase was more effective it had more information and inshallah once the video is prepared if you have a supervisor amongst any any of one of my students and if the notes are given and if the video is played and it supervises the homework the way it is inshallah it will have 50 percent impact because if a person just attending my program conducts on his own according to me the impact was 10 percent if we had the notes the impact was 15 percent that's it because he may not be able to explain the same way as me he may not be able to add the points he may not be able to demonstrate the techniques so then i thought that having the notes having the video and having a trainer would be the best so inshallah very soon in the next maybe four to eight weeks our international doubt training program will be uploaded on my website so to become a student would be very difficult would be and when i did the training about four years back i told that this may be the last training program i'm doing unless allah will get to be because of the busy schedule because in the training that time though the training is for 45 days i spent about you know 60 days now 60 days stopping all my activities and at that time i slept sometimes one hour sometime 45 minutes my average sleeping i told you is three and a half hours now in bombay it was three hours but in the training session it was about one and a half hour you know at times i spent 10 12 13 14 hours on the stage starting morning 8 o'clock ending night early morning two o'clock next day you know because of doing personal training etc it has a lot of impact it has a lot of effort that goes in in this two-month work of at least three months is done so stop all the activities that's the reason i don't think so i'll be having any training program like that in future in my life but inshallah when the website is ready when the video is ready and when the website inshallah even having 15 percent of the impact is a great deal i was inspired by sheikh ahmadin and sheikh ahmadi that marshall has taken many training programs and he conducted even two month training program one month training program one day program and then in the 90s when he met me he told me son who trained you did i train you and i had talked to you that i was inspired by sheikh madida but personally one to one training yes i spent time with him several hours you know but training in a session i said no uncle because he knows who trained you allah tried you he said anyone who has the passion and the zeal to become a die allah will become thy and i agree with him totally he said wasting time in training program is a waste of time i don't agree with them completely but i do know that most of the training program done by most of the people are not that effective but alhamdulillah that's the reason we learned the good thing from the training program and even the negative factor and when i made my training program i saw many of the other training programs then i changed it and alhamdulillah all our training programs were effective but it is time consuming it is difficult so the best thing what shaydeed that rightly said it is allah subhanahu talah who makes you die and in this training program our main focus is the three points in the training program and i'm telling you so that you pick it up number one is if allah helps you none can overcome you allah says in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 verse 160 that if allah helps you none can overcome you if allah forsakes you who is there then who can help you so let the believers put their trust in allah so number one is having faith in allah allah should help you number two allah says in surah chapter number 29 verse number 69 that if you strive to jihad in the way of allah subhana wa allah will open up his pathways for you so you have to strive you have to struggle if you struggle allah has to open up your up your pathways if you struggle and allah does not open up your pathway don't blame allah blame yourself your struggling wasn't enough so here in this training program we hammer in the student that have faith in allah only allah is the one who can make you an effective guy no one else number two we show them how to strive we show them how can you work hard and get results in a short span i have students who have done the dm mbbs md dm highest and and he said that even in my dm exam i did not strive so much as i've done in the java training program we show them about discipline and we show the results the homework we give them maybe a month in advance they cannot do but in the dhawa training program they can finish in two days or one day alhamdulillah number three is technique allah says in the quran in surah chapter 16 verse 43 and surah chapter 21 verse number if you don't know as the person who's knowledgeable so in this training program we touch on the third part of the technique but we are pay stress number one is allah's help number two is driving third is technique and we show techniques of public speaking and as today's science tells us that the impact of a lecture that you give a person giving a public lecture the matter he speaks in the lecture carries only seven percentage of weightage 93 percent is presentation skills how do you modulate your eye to eye contact in the gestures how do you structure your lecture the opening the conclusion all these things carrying 93 percent so in this training program we we give you the fishing line we don't give you the fish fish is given little bit we give you the fishing line how to do research in preparing a lecture how to be effective how to quote when you quote it has a bigger impact than just saying you know allah says in the quran giving the reference carrying the bigger bit giving the reference of the scriptures then we tell you that all the verses of the quran are important but if you memorize these 25 verses there are which these verses are more required for dawah then we give them another 25 of the quran then another 25 then another 25 by by the time you complete the course he knows a couple of hundred verses by heart along with the translation then we tell the people it is preferable to know the answers of the more common questions asked than to know more number of answers of questions which are uncommonly asked so we give them a set of questions the 20 most common questions are by non-muslims then we give another set of questions 20 most common questions asked by non-muslims which have some knowledge of islam then we give them set of questions ten common questions asked by christian missionaries ten common questions asked by hindus about islam and so on and so forth we give them ready-made answers of more than 100 questions these are how our answers should be given and we tell them when you're giving an answer it should touch four categories it should touch from the quran and hadith islamic perspective it should touch comparative religion quotation from from the non-muslim maybe from the bible from the vedas number three giving answers with scientific knowledge and number four with reason and logic we have to touch all four you may never know what will convince the non-muslim so in this way we we tell them the technique we give the structured answer of the most common question which will work alhamdulillah with more than 90 percent 95 percent non-muslim then we tell them that surely there will be some people who will count the question so how to handle question contra question is another technique so in this dhawa training program we teach about the basics of islam also it is not knowledge based but we tell them then we teach them the basics of hinduism then the basics of judaism and of christianity the major world religions then about atheism and in this way we give them the key points and i'm telling this because this question is asked many times to me and amongst maybe a a couple of hundred thousand questions have been asked to me a few hundred are only on this and how to do the how to become i want to be a student so personally to become i would love to make everyone personally because when i teach i myself improve my my knowledge and my skills but believe me so much committed as it is i'm sleeping three and a half of the day it is difficult so my request to you is that join this hour training program it is online absolutely free wait for the wait for the notes to come you can do it and believe me no one taught me shay these are inspired me no one taught me public speaking it was just my passion of dawah that i did it and alhamdulillah at least you have something now so see to it that you visit now also if you go on the website there are yet common questions available the answers are there you can start from today don't wait till the idp starts yet there is enough information on my website presently which is on comparative religion so if you want to comparative religion then we give them the important verses of the bible memorize you don't have to memorize the full bible bible is three times as voluminous as the quran we give them memorize these 20 verses of the bible you then later on another 20 verses another 20 maybe with a set of 60 70 verses of the bible you can even debate with the pope you don't have to memorize the full bible then we give us of the vedas to talk to hindus then we give verses how to how to convince atheists then we tell how to do that on the social media how to dive on the stage with the different technique how to do dhawa off stage with a different technique how to draw one to one of the different technique how to the one the print media the different technique how to do that one the social media the different technique every social media this pros and cons facebook has a different advantage as compared to the instagram as compared to the youtube as compared to the twitter each has advantage disadvantage i've done a full session one day only on social media but now in four in in four years time all the statistics have changed social media has advanced a lot so you have to keep a die has to be up to date so the best is you go to my website immediately today initial in the next four to six weeks seven weeks the idtp will be launched that would take if you read it if you dedicate full day of yours it will take about 40 days to go to it and do it if you do a few hours a day it will take you a few months or maybe a year and inshallah we have these live sessions in the live session you can ask questions not necessarily that a question would be entertained because we have every day tens of thousands every day literally about 25 to 30 000 questions coming i'm answering only 30 my data bank of questions to be answered has increased as i told you earlier that out of three four thousand question by the team they forward to me maybe 100 150 from that i select about 40 50. i keep it i'm only able to answer 2025 so every every day in my data bank the questions to be answered is every session it's including another 25 and yet the majority of the question have not been read by my team the most expensive part of this session is the ques is selecting question answer session that is an ordeal which 25 questions should be selected to be answered out of the 25 000 is a team is working on it i'm spending every session approximately eight hours on which question will be selected and we are presenting it so this was in brief how can you you don't have to be a personal student of mine you can go on the website how you can learn about comparative religion from the website and the various technique i just gave you a gist of the synopsis you go on the website inshallah it will take you a few hundreds of hours to go through it and to read it once the video is available it would be more beneficial even without the video inshallah you can learn a lot"
