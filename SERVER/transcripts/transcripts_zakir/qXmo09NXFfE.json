  "title": "Can a Muslim Lady give a Public Talk if She Wears a Hijaab? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamualaikum again this is haifa and i'm a business student my question is is it permissible for a muslim lady to make public talks for dawa if she wears hijab if no what are the other options thank you sister asked a question that is permissible for a muslim woman to give dhawa in public talks with wearing hijab as far as giving public talks in front of ladies only no problem my wife mashallah she's giving lectures in hundreds and thousands of ladies in many parts of the world in saudi arabia she has given talks in dubai and usa and canada in many countries so if a lady gives a talk in public in where there is only ladies no problem as far as the lady giving public talk in mixed gathering there's difference of opinion difference of opinion though there are some scholars who say that final lady can't come on the stage like on this stage in the mix gathering but those scholars who are more closer to quran and sunnah they say a lady cannot give talk in mixed gathering and i agree with the second group of scholars why because the quran says in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and guard his modesty whenever a man looks at a woman any brazen thought comes in his mind he should lower his case so if a woman is giving a talk in public and if the men are watching they should lower the case if someone tells me i look at a woman and nothing happens to him then he requires a psychiatrist if a man is giving a lecture there are women looking at me the next verse the verse i quoted was foreign said to the believing man he should lower his gear and guard his modesty next verse sunday nude chapter 24 verse number 31 says say to the believing woman that she should lower again and guard a modest the same thing but today scientific research tells me that when a man looks at a woman his pupil dilates more as compared to a woman when she looks at a man a man is sexually more aroused when he looks at a woman than a woman when he looks at a man that's the reason today in schools which i single sex the results are better it is better for a man teaching mixed gathering it's preferable for a man teaching a woman a man teacher teaching a woman audience then a woman teacher teaching an audience scientific research in spite of that if any woman looking at a die including me if some unashamed thought comes in she should lower your guess but a woman is less excited as compared to a man that's the reason i agree with the second group of scholars who say for women to give lectures in mixed gatherings it's not permissible that's the reason on our peach tv when we show a lady we don't show more than three seconds i mean there's no mention the hadith and quran why three second why not two why not five it is our ishtihad even though the modestly dressed maximum we show is for three seconds so that it does not let the gents get excited so sister i agree with the second group of scholars how should they do dhawa it is not compulsory for a man or woman to come on the stage with dava sister you can do dhawa on the internet you can do email you can do da by writing books no problem while doing java preferable man does to a man woman to a woman male to male female to female in some countries i go a man a muslim die talking to a non-muslim girl in close doors doing dawah in a closed room the third person is the devil even i cannot do dhawa to a woman one to one no we have our dhawa center in irf islamic research foundation we have a gen swing doing one to one dhawa to gents ladies one to one ladies if there is some great problem where a lady cannot be convinced and if i have to speak to a lady it is with my maharam either my wife is there with me or my sister is with me or that lady's husband is your brother is there with lowering the case this is islam so we should follow the rules and regulations do dawah but within the purview of the islamic sharia the woman you have got great scope in bombay the women do one to one more than the gents in our bombay branch there are more ladies accepting islam than the gents so masha'allah in iref mashallah there are so many sessions they have marriage preparations they have ramadan month they have the quran family so many sessions they have one day workshop three-day workshop one week workshop they have lectures and hundreds and thousands of ladies attend masha'allah but it should be females with females and gents hope that answers the question"
