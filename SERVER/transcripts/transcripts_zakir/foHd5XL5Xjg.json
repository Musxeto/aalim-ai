  "title": "Making Tea the proper method with the Expert â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "just a few minutes ago we had a very interesting conversation with the expert none other than Dr Decker himself so he said you guys don't know how to drink tea well if you don't know how to make tea then you don't know how to drink tea so basically insha Allah is going to teach me the proper way of making the heavy tea mild tea and what there are three types of tea right mild normal and strong and strong Bismillah that this video is being made on the request and you know this thing I've told to maybe more than 200 people and none of them knew about this methodology of how to make proper strong tea so because of that he said let's make a video which I was reluctant but I cannot refusing thank you so much and now we're in the kitchen in here here is the kitchen we put some water right and now would you like to put the tea in a glass or in a mug okay and here is a tea bag the English breakfast right yes excuse me normally people when they want strong teeth they put two tea back three tea bags and yet it doesn't turn out to be strong and it's not actually about how many tea bags this is the Metrology and the technique of how to make tea using tea bags so it is the methodology of of making strong tea with one tea bag and the correct technique one single keyboard here and immediately add tea add sugar and wheat and then say it's not getting strong the right method and the scientific method is that when you put the tea bag when you say scientific method it's really scientific or yeah so how did you learn that what natural uh the thing when I visited one of the uh tea a tea Farms or the tea a th state so that time no it was in Kerala Canada told me that how you tasty I'm not going to that detail what is the method of tasting tea okay and the specialized taster then he said to make the property is that we should put it in hot boiling plain water without adding any the moment you add milk to it or sugar to it then the tea is not absorbed from the tea bag so the best methodology is to put a tea bag and put hot plain boiling water if you want light tea you keep it for one minute if you want normal tea you keep it for two minutes if you want strong to keep it for three minutes the right technique even if we treat tea bags and you add hot boiling water and milk and sugar immediately even then after you add milk and keep it for 10 minutes or so it will not get strong it will not give you that concentration well water has been boiled okay so I'm going to step back in a glass yeah it can we can make it in a glass there is a smaller glass is better here I like the English super Christine but unfortunately yeah there's only one English oh can we take a smaller glass okay to quality yeah yeah that will do oh sorry are you okay here is a spoon you could not see how it's getting from the board he said we'll count two minutes right the first time in three minutes only you can turn the 15 seconds can you imagine I'm having doctor that can himself mcinty Masha Allah Masha Allah sometimes I say lucky your wife Masha Allah do you also cook at home no my life but he never cooked anyone require a lot I mean if I'm traveling outside that I make my own breakfast for myself so that is one minute passed normally when people in three minutes they don't realize how long is three minutes or when I say that okay you know when you're having a bath if you proceed with the proper shampoo medicated shampoo is is is is taking effect on your on your scalp three minutes if they do it without the stopwatch or without looking at the watch for them one bit becomes limited as a matter of fact most of us do that we just apply the shampoo yes or the body wash and we wash it off immediately same thing when they have to put for 20 seconds oh yeah for five seconds two and a half minutes so normally when I close this to this time no you're not used to it again when I tell the people to make tea for me I said you watch you time it from your watch which has a second hand or a mobile uh had people that the seconds are there wow it should be for two minutes and do you know whether the struggle or not once you add the milk you come from the color with the strong one okay sure about those who actually entered the tea bag and boil it in the kettle that's you you go eat that also you're making good body if you put if you boil the tea and then put the milk later it will be more strong you put the water and the sugar and the meat together and boil it it takes longer the time to make it stronger and The Taste is different how long how long because I know the the pakistanis when they make the tea it's really heavy they add everything to it yes but if you add a bit later milk it's better if you add in cold water milk and sugar and then boil it will not be that strong I remember one senatica in the states um I used to drink this dude body and I was off for three days I was unable to sleep it was very very strong and you can add the milk or the milk powder I have any sugar do you want to have it so I'm looking okay I normally have less than half a package you have three packets I'm not sure I'm a newcomer here three oh no no no I don't I only think when but this is an experiment that's okay saying I use honey I wish we have honey here you come from the color from the collecting company taste it okay let me let me test it but I'm sure it's really hot now one there's advantage of it is when you keep for three minutes it is hot but not boiling hot which I like yeah one big advantage of wait a minute you like it boiling should burn your lips that's like my mother then you have to put in the microwave to make it hot again you're really particular ly it's okay for me but when I was very hot then I can have my egg and marmalate and have a sip of tea then again I've said before it stays for a longer time if it's sufficient if you want to drink it together that it is strong and we can taste it is and then depending on if you want more milk to make it less less strong your flat movement a bit let me see if you had one more so this is this is uh the tea with milk one tea bag stayed in the water in the hot in the boiling water for three minutes boiling that's right that's right that's right yeah the water had already boiled and we inserted the tea bag Dr Becker did it for three minutes after three minutes we added two packets of sugar and one package why you don't remove the tea bag now and how to remove it is another technique that if you want to see to it that you squeeze all the remaining T you do like that this is the technique another technique you see I see without the dotting end and then you can put this aside let me let me try Bismillah Allah this is beautiful this is beautiful I'm drinking tea that is made by DR Zakir mashallah guys would you like some would you like some masha'allah thank you so much I've learned I've learned a very important lesson today how to make a property to make it concentrated brothers and sisters inshallah see you another time or spending some quality time you can say The Best Time Ever with my dear brother Dr zaka see you later"
