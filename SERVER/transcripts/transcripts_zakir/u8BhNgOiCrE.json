  "transcript": "and before we offer Salah there's a call for prayer and different religions have different way of calling people for example the Jews they use the trumpet it mentioned the Book of Numbers Chapter number 10 verse number 1 2 and 3 the Lord spake to Moses peace be upon him and told him to build Two Trumpets of silver and use it to call the assembly the Christians they use a church bell some tribes they use a drum but we Muslims we use the human voice and this is called Adan and the person who gives the Adan is called as a m and the human voice it is far more melodious and soothing compared to the drums the church bells and the trumpets and it has a greater impact on the human mind there are many non-muslims who have accepted Islam just by hearing the Adan it had such a great impact on their Minds that they accepted Islam but unfortunately in Bombay the aans they are not as melodious they cause inconvenience rather than Tranquility so would request the muin in Bombay that they should listen to the Adan of mam in Makkah that is an example of how an Adan should be like and besides the Adan being melodious and soothing it carries a message but many of the non-muslims did not understand the message of the Adan many non-muslims say that you know Emperor abbar he built so many monuments for the Muslims and during the time of the mugal no wonder the Muslims they mention his name in their Adan five times a day some may think it's just a joke but many of the non-muslims they think like this and many of the non-muslims in the western movies there is a person who's dressed up in the Arab gown who's a terrorist who's a villain and before he draws out a sword he shouts allahar as if Allah abbar is a war cry so many non-muslims did not understand the message of the Adan we need to explain to the non-muslims we need to give the translation of the Adan to the non-muslims Allah abbar Allah abbar Allah abbar Allah abbar Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest we are not praising Emperor abbar or it is not a war cry but we are saying that Allah is the greatest I bear witness that there's no one worthy of worship except Allah subhana wa tala I bear witness that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the servant and messenger of Allah subhana tala come to prayer come to success allahar Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest there is no one worthy of worship except Allah subhana tala so we should explain the translation of the Adan to the non-muslims to those who are unaware of it in fact the Adan can be considered as a sign of unity any Muslim from any part of the world from any nationality from any country when he hears the aan he knows that it is time to pray in fact the Adan read in Arabic can be considered as an international anthem of the Muslims"
