  "title": "The Answer to the Third Question Raised by the Jews - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there are three distinct questions asked to John the Baptist but the Christians only see two questions why they only think two questions asked Art Thou the Christ art thou the Messiah and he says no art thou the El and he says no Then the third question art thou that prophet and the answer is no that means all three are different Prophets The Messiah is different Elias is different and that Prophet is different so Jesus Christ peace be upon him as a messiah which we agree we do not doubt the more than 100 prophecies mentioned about Jesus Christ peace be upon him in the Old Testament because all the Muslim believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is a messenger of God Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of almighty God we believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christian today do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and leers with God's permission we do not argue regarding more than 100 prophecies mentioned in the Old Testament about the Messiah about Jesus Christ peace be upon him because we believe he was the Messiah we believe he was one of the mightiest messengers of God but we tell the Christians why do you deny the Prophecies of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him mentioned in the Old Testament and the New Testament Gospel of John chapter number one verse number 21-25 three distinct questions are asked to John the Baptist art thou the Messiah art thou the Christ he says no art thou the Elias he says no art thou that prophet he says no that means there were three different people not three in one so if you say Jesus is the Messiah peace be upon Him Jesus cannot be that Prophet that Prophet has to be someone else and that is no one but the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad sallah wasallam it's mentioned in Gospel of John chapter number one verse number 25 then the priest and the Levites the Jews they say why does thou baptized if thou not the Christ Thou Art not Elias Thou Art not that Prophet three distinct question questions you ask any Christian who is this that Prophet mentioned in Gospel of John chapter number one verse number 2125 they have no reply they can't say it means Jesus Christ peace be upon him because it's already mentioned that he is the Messiah it refers to No One But the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad s wasallam it further mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says I will pray to my father to send you and the comforter who will abide with you forever Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 that I will pray to my father to send you another comforter who will abide with you forever that means Jesus Christ peace be upon him will not abide with the Christian forever this new comforter this new Prophet who will come will abide with you forever he further says in the Gospel of John chapter number 15 verse number 26 but when the comfort shall come who I shall send from my father the spirit of Truth preceding before thee he shall testify me this comforter to come who my father will send Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says he will testify me he will talk about me he will testify that I was a messenger of God it's further mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter shall not come for if I depart shall I send him all these three verses I quoted Gospel of John 14:6 Gospel of John 15: 26 and Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 talks about the comforter when you ask the Christians who is this comforter they say this comforter is the holy spirit I asked the Christians how does it refer to the holy spirit it's clearly mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter shall not come for if I depart shall I send him the criteria for the comforter to come is that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him should depart only after he departs will the comforter come we know that the Holy Spirit was already there before Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born the Holy Spirit was there in the womb of Elizabeth the Holy Spirit was there when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was being baptized so surely this prophecy cannot refer to the Holy Spirit"
