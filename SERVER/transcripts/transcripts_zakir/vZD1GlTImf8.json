  "transcript": "next question if from Mohammed Khan from New York USA is the player valid when we pray in congregation in German in a mosque keeping six feet distance between the two person's brain a similar question is asked by died her husband Alam if salah valid with worship was standing two meters apart the general circumstances all the focus all the scholars agree that standing six feet apart two meters apart in a Jamaat is the Jamaat is invalid it's not acceptable at all a prophet clearly said peace be upon him that when you stand for Salah stand shoulder to shoulder the Saba said that when we stood for Salah its Hadi in Bihari it is an avowed that when we stood for Salah our shoulders tied the shoulder of the companions our feet like the feet of the companion its mission a Buddha or the beloved formula Salim said that they close in the gaps and do not and do not give space for the Satan so it is a unanimous agreement that when we stand for salon congregation we should stand shoulder shoulder and we should stand close to each other but this is the special situation because of the contagious pandemic that is coronavirus covered 19 in such a situation when there is a fear that the person praying can get infected is it permitted or not so this question was never it has never arrived earlier so we cannot give the views of the classical scholar or the medieval scholars this is the first time in the history of Islam the such a situation is taking place yes there what diseases which I would say equally or more dangerous which have been in the past but never has this question arrived regarding the prayer being valid there are very few scholars today who say that prayer is invalid which is the totally wrong wrong opinion majority of the scholars they agree that if we even if we prayed two metres apart the prayer is valid the difference of opinion is whether it will be counted as the Jamaat or not whether it will be counted as the congregation or so the difference in opinion of the scholars today is that if you stand two meters apart six feet apart in a congregation will then be counted as the congregation not because of the situation that we are in today because of the common 19 surely almost all the has all the scholars today say that the fella will be valid the difference in opinion is will the Jamaat be counted or not today majority of the scholars say that because of the pandemic the contagious disease that is covered 19 it is highly infectious the scholar says majority say it is permitted but yet there is a small group of scholars say it is not permitted it is not it the the Jamaat will not be counted the fella will be accepted but counted as individual prayer so one if Fatah the other is tawa so in the first way the majority of scholars today say that the Jamaat will be counted but yet there is a small group of scholars say that no it will not be counted it is against ruling of Islam it will not be counted as a a month here what you have to understand that one is fatwa and one is taqwa we have to take precaution but no one fails it is further to pray two metres apart while praying in a Jamaa today yes if you at home four people are there five people are there very well you can follow the Sunnah of the Prophet stand close to each other this is the Taha the Prophet said tie your camel and trust in God so depending upon a taqwa I personally would prefer standing close standing shoulder shoulder standing feet to feet it is a way that the Prophet prayed and the swabiz prayed and I believe that we take the precautions which I mentioned in my earlier answer take the precautions and after taking all the precautions I would prefer standing close shoulder shoulder and feet to feet hope them sequester"
