  "title": "Is it Permissible to Delay Breaking of Fast for Few Minutes after Sunset? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "dr zakiyah in difference to what you've said there are some people who delay the breaking of the fast and the maguru prayer on the premise that they don't believe the sun is completely set and on the basis that they believe it's always better to be on the safe side is this a correct logic there are a large number of muslims who they want to be safe and the delay the breaking of the fast even though the sun i said they said let's wait for about three or four minutes you know then we'll break because they want to be careful because the hadith of a beloved prophet muslim it's mentioned in sadit number 991 where the prophet he speaks about his dream that he has a dream and he's taken up and there he hears the sound of people howling and he asks that who are these people these are the people in hellfire then he's taken to another corner and he sees that people are hung from the hamstring and the corner of the mouths are torn and there is blood dripping so he asks that were these people so the replies these are the people who broke their fast early so based on this hadith that if a person breaks the fast early he'll be hung from the hamstring and his mouth will be torn and there'll be a ping of blood people go out of their way to take a precaution and they delay by four or five minutes now this is against the sunnah breaking early is wrong but delaying it also wrong because as i mentioned earlier it's clearly mentioned in the quran in surah chapter 2 verse 187 that keep the fast until night falls and as i mentioned earlier in the earlier answer it's mentioned in say bihari volume number 3 in the book of fasting hadith number 1954 a beloved prophet muslim said that when night falls from this side and the day vanishes from this side and when the sun sets you break your fast and there are various other hadees which i quoted earlier including say bihari verb number three in the book of fasting hadith number 1957 a beloved prophet said that my people will be on the straight path till the time they hasten to break the fast it's mentioned in volume number eight hadith number three five one zero that the beloved professional said that my people will be on the sunnah till the time they don't wait to see the stars to break the fast and it's also mentioned in volume number eight hadith number three five zero nine that the beloved professional said that my religion will be seen till the time my people hastened breaking the fast and do not delay like the kitab the jews and the christians so here there are various hadith talking about you should hate breaking the fast but natural it should be after the sun has set we cannot break the fast before the sun sets but the moment it's confirmed that the sun has set with your own eyes or nowadays there are clocks that are watching you can easily time yourself so there's no need of waiting for a five minutes and taking a precaution if you do that that's what the prophet said that my ummah will not be on the sunnah so to be on the sun now on the right track the moment the sun sets you should break the fast immediately"
