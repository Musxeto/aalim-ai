  "title": "How can I earn my living while doing Da’wah as a full time Profession? – Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "santosh Karim Nagar India as-salam-o-alaikum armed robber katsu I love you Zaheer neck I reverted to Islam after watching your videos alhamdulillah my question is how can I earn by doing Dawa because it is the best profession I started my talk by coding most of the Quran from sorry for sale except number 41 verse number worst immortality well Allah says woman has a new column in montoya lillahi Waman is holly holm koala anonymous Amin who is better in speech than one who invites people in the way of their Lord works righteousness and say that I'm a Muslim according to Quran according to Allah the profession of Dawa is the best profession and that is a reason and left from a doctor of a body to become a doctor of facility the basic question is that how can I earn my living by making Dawa at the profession number one that as I mentioned that the best profession but you should not do da WA because you want to earn money yes you do Dawa and because you want to leave a life a simple life you have to have some money so you can use you can earn by doing the hour but the meaning for the hour should be to attain Jana because it's the best profession am a nymph of Domino a lot of money and I know that your intention is not there but I'm just verifying to other people that you should not do that because we get a lot of money but when you do that how can you earn money number one if that if your parents are very well-off and if they can support you so that you can do Dhamma without thinking about how to make both the ends meet or how to take care of a family that is the best and Allah has blessed me that my parents and my brother they took care of my financial aspect and they told me I don't have to worry at all we will take care of your family and not only that my parents went to the extent of taking care even of my dau activities for the first few years of my dog activities it was 95 percent financed by my parents so I didn't have to waste time also acting funds when the activities grew my shallow supporter family increased but outside support from other people also increase more and mashallah we became the largest private the organization so number one would be that if your parents are well-off and if they can support their nothing like it number two that if a life give me the knack of doing business and if you can do business spend a small portion of your time and business and that's what I did that initially it was mainly families support within a few years I started doing a small business I took a small loan of 15 lakh rupees from my mother and within a few months I gave it back and that money expanded mashallah and I started leaving my parents I share of Melanie's an amoeba and later on I got involved in various other businesses I have to spend on average a few hours a week or maybe one or two days in a month during the holidays and were involved in business or real estate business of mobile and various businesses you know and I hamdulillah Allah blessed me so much that mashallah I started earning more money than my parents and then my brother I have the little and I used to always give major portion of my earnings in charity I made Allah my partner in my business initially it was twenty five percent when I started then became fifty one percent and it kept on increasing the major portion of my earnings it for this Allah when Allah your partner and you make him the partner so our hamdulillah very the question of weighing in loss Allah blessed so much and that we started from my owning they started helping other times what I want that the Muslim Ummah among the rich people they should have a separate fund for supporting the dice and that's what we had we had a large fund previously and I mean now we have a fund supporting dwars in different parts of the world and Marsha Levine supported WOD from different countries of the world depending upon the requirement we have to take care of the family if he wanted X amount we have to give one point two extra 1.25 X to him so that he doesn't have to take care at all of his financial respects take care of it so that he can do concentrate on Dawa so if there is a fund made by the Muslim NGOs or the Muslim bridge businessman with selectively and this is very good why because you are getting a visa Wow and I realized when I went to travel and when I met the Arabs the first is to ask me many Arab leader asked me that dr. zakir how i'm taking care of for living not knowing the background that mashallah my family are very well-off and I never took salary he said who's taking care of a family can we take care of your take care of expenses and a hamdulillah so far till this day I will have been very kind I did not have to take help from any of these rich businessman many people offered me $25,000 a month some people offered me more all put together would be hundreds of thousands of dollar get per month but alhamdulillah Allah has blessed me when he's making me earn much bigger a more than what they're offering me why should I take anyone's help so the best is from a family second best is if if you can do a business and make a business of a life giving you that knack if not don't get involved with business if you don't let that business acumen lead you not waste your time you will come into bigger problems if you are not well over the business you know that reminds me of the sabha of observer man been off may allah be pleased with him he was people have to tell their what do we used to touch was to be gold he was an expert in business when they needed heated up to medina when many of the Muslim Ansar wanted to help them he said no show me where is the market and used to go to the market then come back with a lot of health so they Allah had given him that ability so what you have to realize the next would be have your own business number three is NGO or they can be Muslim who can have a separate work for a fun for the day as a last resort who can do some harm you can join a damn organization that's the reason me in a debauch nation we had an IRF and the associate sister concern we had more than 500 full-time paid employees volunteers in ten thousands it was the largest private Muslim dau organization in the world which the present BJP government could not digest and that there is in the late allegation Manila and we saw to it that we paid about 20 to 25 percent of much more more than the market value if his market value as X amount we have to pay 1.25 X or 1.5 X sometimes even double X we have to train the people those who are not well qualified we should train them for training wish to give them money and take a contract that after we train you we have to work with us five number of years in mashallah this way if you can join a Muslim Dawa organisation that will be the best who can take care of a financial aspect if not the last resort would be you do a halal job a large job which may not be an Islamic organization it can it can be working in any company a normal company which is not have allowed with harem activity and that job should be said that it should not be Albany you only the fewer that you spend in the office maybe eight hours or nine has that's it so that and you get no job in which the company I've got to weekly holidays so if you do such a job and more than fifty percent of your time you can yet do now you can do that one the two days on the weekends you can do lover when you come back from office at home this is option and and you should not you should pray to Allah so Allah I died he normally should see to it that he make his requirement very less if you make a requirement less no one can force you to tell something which you don't want if you are requirement do you want minimum ten thousand dollars a month or five thousand dollars a month to survive it's not it's not required a hamdulillah Allah had given me whereas to earn millions of dollars a year but I saw to it that my family requirement was bad minimally in Bombay the immediate requirement family has to give my wife only forty thousand rupees a month to take care sufficient here in Malaysia I'm spending two thousand ringgit a month on me and my wife only that think will do less than five hundred dollars no alive given mashallah or not so that make your requirements less so that you do not get involved in trying to waste time making money if Allah gives you give majority charity Allah will give you more and so thy life should be simple with the emmonak I was learning I could own a Rolls Royce a hamdulillah but I preferred having a small Toyota no but that is sufficient it is enough my apartment used to go in our activities because when I travel I play from my own money I stay outside in the hotel that was any expense for the hi Spencer but for the personal expense see to it that you make it bare minimal so a life is simple many people when they come when they came to me home did one when they were shot now living is such a small apartment I says that means such a big apartment it is 800 square feet big apartment in Bombay 800 square feet is a big apartment the carpet area built-up area is 1200 here also people come to Malaysia some people are shocked you're living in such a small apartment living in such a big apartment you know so masha'Allah it is somewhere close to the whole vanilla so if you make your requirement less and your earning earning a separate reminisce then no one can blackmail you so even if you do a simple job it will be sufficient and you can do Dawa better if Allah gives you more wealth see to it to give in charity so that this burqa and this is a key point and this the first person who inspired me about this it was when I went to Pakistan I mean I met dr. Solomon we said shake em agree that the second person inspired me was dr. Solomon and he told me son I tried to do both together being a doctor and I died I could not you can be expert only in one and I gave up my medical profession and he was one of the second instrumental person for me to leave my profession and you also told me son make your living asked low so that no one can pressurize you no one can blackmail you and Allah Allah Allah blessed me with a lot of Neama and yet now but feet will you make your requirement the least so that you can do the hour to hit extend"
