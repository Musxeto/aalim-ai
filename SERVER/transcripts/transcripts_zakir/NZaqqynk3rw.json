  "title": "Muslims Follow Allahâ€™s Commandments and Pray, Fast etc. Then why are Non Muslims like Bill Gates...",
  "transcript": "the first question muhammad fazel from bangalore he says i am a software engineer sir we muslims pray fast and try to do all the things that please allah then why are people like bill gates jeff begos mukesh ambani why are they rich why not muslims also why only a small section of arab muslims are rich prophet muhammad peace be upon him said it's mentioned sahih bukhari number four hadees number 3158 that by allah i do not fear poverty but i fear the wealth of this world our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him he feared that his ummah they will have wealth they will become rich and this money this wealth will take them away from allah so wealth being rich having money it is not the criteria for success based on your question it seems as if you are trying to say that success is based on how rich a person is how wealthy a person is how much money a person has but true richness it is the richness of iman it is the richness of taqwa allah subhanahu ta'ala says in the glorious quran chapter 49 verse number 13 of a male and female and divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honor among you in the sight of allah he is the most righteous of you the person who has taqwa the criterion for judgment in the sight of allah subhanahu talah it is not caste it is not color it is not wealth it is not money but it is righteousness it is god consciousness it is taqwa it is piety and a beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him he said that it is more easy for a poor man to go into jannah than a rich man because the rich person he has to give accounts of all his spendings he has to give accounts whether he has given zakah he will be questioned about all these things whereas the poor person he will get hundred out of hundred and zakah because he does not need to pay zakah similarly the true richness it is the richness of iman it is the richness of taqwa and a blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him what did he leave behind did he leave behind wealth did he leave behind money he left behind sahaba who were taught bearers of the world and i disagree with you wherein you said that why not many muslims they are rich in fact if you analyze among the top 100 richest people majority of them they are arab muslims you have something known as the listed companies you have the forbes list etc these are the listed companies so these businessmen like bill gates jeff because etc they are according to the listed companies they are the richest people in the world because they are public limited companies they are registered but if you analyze the arab muslims many of their companies they are not public limited companies and as i said earlier that among the top 100 richest people in the world majority of them they would be arab muslims but what is the state of the muslim ummah today the muslims they have wealth but yet look at the state of the muslim ummah we are divided we are fighting over petty and small issues so wealth is never the criteria for success even though we muslims we have wealth we are rich but yet the state of the muslim ummah it is divided and um he asks the sahabas that what would you want this room to be filled with so that you can give it in the cause of allah so the sahaba they say that we want this room to be filled with gold so that we can give it in the cause of allah ask for something better the sahaba they say that we want this room to be filled with rubies pearls diamonds so that we can give it in the cause of allah you tell us what is better so um he says that i want this room to be filled with the likes of abu baidab may allah be pleased with him so that he can go and spread the message of islam i want this room to be filled with the likes of mahatma may allah be pleased with him so that they can go and spread the message of islam umar radhiallah one he did not want the room to be filled with gold gems pearls diamonds but he wanted the room to be filled with like abu baidavi may allah be pleased with them so that they can go out and spread the message of islam the prophet muhammad peace be upon him the sahaba they did not leave behind gold did not leave behind wealth but they left behind the legacy they left behind their character they left behind their message so that people can follow their path and there is a list of the 10 richest people in the world at the third position is bill gates at the second position is jeff because do you know who is the richest person in the world who is on the number one position the richest person in the world is the one who offers two rakah of sunnah before the fajr obligatory prayer because offering two rakah of sunnah before the fajr obligatory prayer is better than the world and all that is in it a beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him he said that the one who offers to raqqa of the sunnah before the fajr obligatory prayer it is better than the world and all that is in it imagine chess offering 2 rakah of sunnah of the fajr prayer imagine the reward the greatness the importance of offering the farah prayer the prophet peace be upon him he just stated the importance of two rakah of sunnah fajr prayer it is better than the world and all that is in it so we muslims we believers we need to strive for the hereafter and the only thing that will be acceptable in the sight of allah on the day of judgement it is not your money it is not your wealth but it is your good deeds it is your righteous deeds so even if a person he is rich in this world but he may not be rich in the hereafter if a person runs behind money and wealth in this world in the hereafter he will not get a share therefore for us believers the prime focus the true richness is the richness of iman success is based upon a person's good deeds upon a person's righteous deeds so we need to understand that even though some people they may be rich they may be wealthy but that is never the criteria to judge the success of a human being"
