  "title": "Why is there Poverty, Unemployment, Malnourishment, Sickness, etc. in the World? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "next question is from rf ansari from uttar pradesh india one of my non-muslim friends has asked me all religions are superstitious and false the truth lies in science which is constantly developing religion says that god is all-powerful merciful and all good if that is so then why do millions of children in the world suffer from hunger cold etc as the great russian writer dostoevsky asked in a famous novel brothers karamazov why does god who is said to be merciful not have mercy on them and give them food clothes shelter etc why is there so much poverty unemployment malnourishment sickness etc in the world if god is powerful and merciful why does he not abolish these and give everyone a decent life the question posed by the brother is that one of the non-muslim friends is saying that all religions are superstitious and they're false science is ultimate and is always developing i agree with the brother that most of the religions they are superstitious and they are false but not all islam alhamdulillah is based on truth as far as science is concerned if you compare science with the religious scriptures of the various religions i do agree with you that most of the religious scriptures they will fail the test but if you compare modern science with quran you will find out that there is not a single verse in the glorious quran which is against any established science there are more than 6 000 verses in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about science and there are many scientific facts mentioned in the quran 1400 years ago which was discovered recently 30 years back 50 years back 100 years back 300 years back now who can tell us how come the glorious quran 1400 years ago mentioned about these facts in biology in zoology in oceanology in embryology in medicine in hydrology which we came to know recently 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back about water cycle that every living creature has made from water how was the creation of the universe the big bang and hundreds of things which science came to know recently 50 years back hundred years back 200 years back 300 years back the quran mentioned 1400 years ago how can you justify this out of more than 6000 verses of the glorious quran more than a thousand speak about science and not a single verse of the glorious quran is going against established science so if you compare quran with modern science alhamdulillah quran is far superior and science as you rightly said is developing and many things what the quran has mentioned which science hasn't confirmed yet but neither can it say it is wrong inshallah in the near future scientific confirmed that so quran is far superior to science but i do agree if you compare with scriptures of other religions all the other scriptures besides the quran they will fail the test so quran is a book based on hack on truth quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c-e but it's a book of signs s-i-g-n-s it's a book of ayats more than 6 000 ayats are there signs are there auto which more than a thousand speak about science coming to the last part of the question that why are millions of children in the world dying of hunger why is there suffering in the world why people are homeless why people are in pain and suffering the reply to this question is allah says in the quran in surah mulk to test which of you is good in deeds this life in the world is a test for the hereafter allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has sent the human being on the face of the earth has sent us as a test for thereafter and allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 155 surely we will test you with something of fear and hunger with some loss of lives and goods and what you have earned through the toiling in the world and give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere that means allah is saying every human being will be tested with fear and hunger with the loss of goods and lives and your toils what you have worked hard and accumulated but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere as i mentioned this life is a test for thereafter and allah tells different human beings in different ways allah cannot have the same paper the examination paper keeps on differing every year so allah tests different people with different ways some with wealth some with health some with poverty some with diseases so allah is testing these people with hunger with fear with suffering do they yet have faith in allah there are some people who children are born handicapped the children are assumed they are innocent but it's a test for the parents who allah tell different people in different ways and depending upon how will you react will you cause allah will you get angry that last allah or will you say okay amina i accept it so this is a test unless testing different people in different ways no way does it say that a person who will suffer in this world will go to hell nowhere does it say that people who are poor will fail in the test in fact it is easier for a poor man to go to jannah than a rich man allah is testing if we have summer if we have patience if we had a faith in allah will be successful in the hereafter so since this is the test the atheists will not be able to understand because they don't believe in the great allah but for a believer for a moment he realizes that this world the life that we lead in this world is a test for the hereafter and we are here to pass this test so with this way ensure life your faith in allah if you follow the commandments of allah and obey what is mentioned in the glorious quran inshallah you will be successful in this world"
