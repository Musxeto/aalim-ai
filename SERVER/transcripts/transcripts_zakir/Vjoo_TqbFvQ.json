  "transcript": "the first question if hello myself Aditya I'm a Hindu I want to convert to Islam what is the procedure behind it first of all I want to be stable and get a job so that I do not face any problem if my family refuses to accept me and I hamdulillah I thank Allah subhana WA Ta'ala to give you a daya and it seemed that because you want a stable job so that you don't face any problem after accepting Islam it means that you have done proper research and you have been convinced that Islam is the best religion to be followed and you want to accept Islam I want to congratulate for that but let me remind you that don't wait too long once you're convinced don't wait and look for a job where you get a lot of money so that it can be stable ok search for a job but if you do not get don't waste too much time because they do not know how long will you live I do not know how long will I live we don't know where they will live for 10 years more or we live from one number of years or five years or few months or we don't know whether we live tomorrow also so earlier the better since we have been convinced please see to it that do not delay as soon as possible accept it and let me again confirm with you I hope no one is forcing you to accept Islam and I hope that no one especially I think you to accept Islam because forcing anyone to accept Islam or pressurizing is not allowed in Islam and I hope no one is paying you money to accept Islam as far as to accept Islam the procedure is very simple you only have to believe that there is one God Allah subhanAllah and he has got no partners he has got no associates and there is no other God besides him and there's no idol worship and the second point is believe that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final messenger of allah subhanaw taala formatting good if you believe in these two things these two are the basic requirement for anyone to enter into the full of slack there are many other things following though come on you even though las manos Allah and following the messenger hadith but the most important at these two and even if you believe in this anyhow they are Muslim you don't have to say it in public but preferable if you can decide this in Arabic and I will say and if you want to again repeat it after me now or later on go to the YouTube he may be doing repeated I'm saying in Arabic the same before I said in English I like ain't translated for anyone to accept Islam you have to believe what I said the two things and in Arabic the same thing is and you can repeat after me if ashhadu an la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh which means i bear witness that there is no God besides Allah and I bear witness that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him if the messenger and the servant of Almighty God and if you believe in this any except with a heart and you say it you become a Muslim it's very simple my request to you whether they don't delay as soon as possible if you have convinced please accept Islam"
