  "title": "How to Convince an Atheist Regarding Faith? And How do you Update Yourself with Scientific Knowledge",
  "transcript": "any sister have any questions my question is regarding a person who we cannot call him another atheists or discuss the entire discussion it will take time but the basic thing is we gave him certain uh scientific facts uh certain logical facts and in spite of that the person was not uh convinced like and everything got stuck when it comes to Faith so can't we really explain this concept of Faith or is it not possible for us to convince a non-muslim regarding Faith because there are many things for which even science does not have answers so how do we go about and also I would like to know that how to keep yourself updated with the scientific uh Innovations or maybe the invention new discoveries that are coming up if there was two questions that we have spoken to an atheists or a person on Earth but doesn't believe in Islam you tried to convince him a scientific facts archaeological facts they agreed but when it comes to Faith we can't answer how do we convince faith and how to update ourselves with scientific fact regarding faith is concerned with scientific facts we can talk about faith but how you go about the technique technique so therefore we have to ask the person who knows so depending what your discussion is like faith I have faith that this is the word of Allah it's with how to improve it then I talk about science so if you see my videos I can even prove it scientifically so system there are many things which you can prove scientifically if you have the knowledge of Quran and science there are some things sister which you cannot prove scientifically for example if they say that how can you prove their life after that so then you have to use logic and for that you can refer to my video concept of Peace in Islam or my question answer session where I've proved how to logically prove about the concept of Hereafter one of the simple ways is that suppose the Quran speaks about 100 things for example out of which 80 percent of whatever the Quran has spoken today we have come to know that it is established scientific fact the other 20 about science for the Quran speaks it is ambiguous neither right neither wrong so my logic says when 80 person is 100 correct and the remaining 20 percent neither right neither ambiguous even this twenty percent will be right it's not a blind belief it's a logical belief of the 20 percent which is ambiguous science hasn't proved it right neither wrong for example existence of Jinn about angels about Hereafter science has improved neither science prove that it is wrong so my logic says that in shall 11 this will be right so this is one way of proving and the other way of proving is going logical aspect which if you see my video casted sister so depends what faith you're talking about are you talking about faith in Quran faith in Allah how to prove what Allah if you see my video cassette is the Quran God's word so faith and different things Faith In The Messengers faith in the Angels faith in the Hereafter so sister depending on each stage may be the style how you convince the first so if you see my video because alhamdulillah most of the major points of Faith have been covered in a very different custard sister and regarding the second question that how can you update yourself with scientific knowledge Etc sister have read the scientific journals and the books so if you read this and every books there are several scientific books coming out every month weekly daily there are books coming out on science read that or if time doesn't permit to read all then you can read those books which are being written by Muslims on compatibility you know there are many books which come out if not daily at least once a month or months of fortnight there are books coming out at least on some aspects of Quran and science there are journals for example Saudi Arabia there's a journal the name is which talks only about Islam and science Quran says nothing is I think it comes out once in six months if I'm not mistaken so there are mass Maas so there are journals coming out if you read these genres you update it with knowledge and even come to what has spoken so this is a shortcut only any Muslims if you have more time you can read the other journal and think for yourself what was the Quran matter and you can come out with new things yourself inshallah hope that's the question"
