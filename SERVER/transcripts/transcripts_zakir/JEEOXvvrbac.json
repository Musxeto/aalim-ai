  "title": "Is the Concept of 'Trinity' Scientifically Proven? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my question is dr zakir naik the christians explain the concept of trinity scientifically by giving the example of water which can be in three states solid liquid and gas in the form of ice water and vapor similarly one god is a triune god father son and holy ghost is this explanation scientifically correct just to comment before you the answer we should not tempt god should not test god but here we aren't testing god we are testing the human being we should not test god but here we are testing you and god promises that any believer who has deadly poison he will not die he'll be able to speak in foreign tongues we aren't testing god we know god is correct he will see to it that every believer can speak we are testing you whether you're a believer or not coming to the question of the sister that there are christians who say that scientifically we can prove the concept affinity like how water can be in three states solid liquid and gas like ice water and vapor so similarly god is in three forms father son and holy ghost how to reply and is this scientifically correct scientifically i do agree water can mean three forms solid liquid and gas vice water and vapor but scientifically we also know that the component of water remains the same h2o two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen the components remain the same the constituent remains the same the forms keep on changing there is no problem let's check with the concept of trinity concept of trinity father sun holy ghost form they say form changes okay for sake of argument you agree does the component change god an holy ghost is made of spirit human beings are made of flesh and bones they aren't the same human being required to eat god doesn't require to eat to survive they aren't the same and this is justified by jesus christ peace be upon him himself in the gospel of luke chapter number 24 verse number 36-39 he says that behold my hands and feet handle me and see for a spirit has no flesh and bones he says behold my hands and feet handle me and see for a spirit has no flesh and bone and he gave his hand and the saw and they were overjoyed and he said that do you have any meat to eat and they gave him broil fish and a piece of honeycomb and he ate to prove what that he was god to prove that he was not god he ate any flesh and bones a spirit has got no flesh and bone this proves that it is scientifically not possible that father son and holy ghost father jesus christ peace the holy ghost is almighty god and the concept of trinity the word trinity doesn't exist anywhere in the bible the word trinity is not there in the bible but it is then the quran quran says in surah chapter 4 verse 171 it says are doing kuf they are blaspheming those who say that allah is three in one is a triune god jesus christ peace be upon him never said he was god the concept of tree doesn't exist in the bible the only verse which is closest to the concept of trinity is the first episode of john chapter number five verse number seven which says for there are three that bear a call in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are one but if you read the revised standard version revised by tidal scholars christian scholars of the highest eminence backed by 50 different corporate denominations they say this verse of the bible first epistle of john chapter 5 verse number 7 is an interpolation is a concoction is a fabrication it was thrown out of the bible jesus christ peace be upon him never claimed divinity there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him says i am god already says worship me in fact if you read the bible it is mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 28 he said my father is greater than i gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 i cast out devils with the spirit of god gospel of luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 i with the finger of god cast out devil gospel of john chapter number five verse number 30 i can of my own self do nothing i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says not my will but god's will he's a muslim muslim means a person who submits evil to almighty god jesus christ peace be upon him said not my will but god will he was a muslim and he was alhamdulillah one of the mightiest messenger of god we believe we believe that he was born miraculously without any male intervention we believe he gave life for the dead with god's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers with god's permission we respect jesus christ peace be upon him as one of the mightiest messenger of god but he is not god and he is not a part of the trinity trinity doesn't exist quran says say he is allah you"
