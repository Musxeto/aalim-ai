  "transcript": "regarding another important aspect how Allah subhana wa tala accepts Toba repentance what are the prerequisites for sincere Toba and could you possibly Enlighten us with some prophetic traditions of some of the prophets making Toba to Allah subhana wa tala Allah says in the Quran chapter number 66 verse number8 that you believe turn to Allah wa tala with sincere repentance and there are basically five prerequisites for Allah subhana wa taala to accept Toba number one the person should accept that he's doing is wrong number two he should immediately stop it number three should seek forgiveness from Allah subhana tala number four he should not commit that act again and number five if he has taken something from any other human being and if he can return it he return it back back for example if he has robbed some moneyy should turn the money back if he has taken some wealth you should give the wealth back if he can undo the harm he should do it and according toim he says that repentance is accepted when the person does not do that evil act again and it further helps him to do good deeds and prevents him from going back to that act according to IM Nai he says there are three prerequisites for any Toba to be accepted number one he should stop the ACT what he's doing number two he should ask for forgiveness number three he should not do it again and he says there a fourth requirement if he had done some harm to any other human being then you should undo it if you can and there are various examples in the Hadith which give that how people have asked for forgiveness it's mentioned the Hadith of say Ki volume number four in the Book of Stories of the prophets Hadith number 3470 that there was a person who had committed 99 murders so he wants to seek repentance so he asked the people that how can you do it so they sent him to a monk so monk says that you have killed 99 people there's no chance of forgiveness so that person that murderer he he kills the M too and now he has committed 100 murders so he goes to another person and says that I want to seek repentance so he says that if you want to seek repentance go to that land where people are worshiping Allah subhana wa ta'ala and inshallah you should leave the land in which you have committed the crime and go to that land where people are seeking repentance and inshallah Allah will grant you forgiveness so he immediately goes towards that land but on his way death takes place and he dies and he turns his chest towards that village where people are repenting then both the Angels the angels of good and the angels of bad both come and they want take him the angel from the heaven say that we will take him because he want to repent but the angel from the bad Deeds the hell they say no he has not committed a single Good Deed we will take him so Allah subhana wa taala intervenes and he asked the village where people are repenting that it should come closer to the person who has committed murder and He commands to the place where he committed the crime that it should go further away so when they measure the distance they find out that the person who committed the murder he was one span closer to the village where people are repenting so then Allah subhana T grants him Jenna so this is an example that a person commits 100 murder and he wants to repent only the KN of repenting and traveling towards that place and a different version of the same Hadith says that while dying he pushes himself towards the he looks towards the place where he can get forgiveness so this shows that only the Nia and the intention to ask for forgiveness Allah forgives there is another example in say Muslim number three in the book of H Hadith number 4207 there was a lady from the type of Jena she comes to the prophet and she had committed adultery and she was pregnant so she comes to the prophet and says that I have done so and so sin please give me punishment so the prophet calls her master and it says take care of this woman till she delivers the child and after that get her to me so the master takes care of her and after she gives birth to her child he gets the woman the then the prophet says because of the adultery she has to be given the penalty and the lady she has to wrap around herself with her cloth and the people Stone her to death and after she dies the prophet he prays for her so Omar pleas with him says that oh Prophet you praying for a woman who has committed adultery then the prophet replies that the V she has repented even if you distribute this repentance to 70 people of minina it would be sufficient for them to go to Jenna who can repent better than the woman who willing to give her life for the sake of Allah subhana tala a similar example is given in say Muslim volume number three in the book of H Hadi number 4205 that Ma Malik PE with him he come to the prophet and he says that please Purify Me The Prophet says vote to you go and ask for forgiveness for Allah subhana tala and you repent the person he goes back again he comes and he says that oh messenger please pardon me he says vote to you ask for forgiveness of Allah subhana tala and you repent again the person goes again he comes for the third time oh messenger of Allah please Purify Me He says go away from you ask for repentance ask for forgiveness of Allah subhana tala again the fourth time he comes and he says to the prophet please pardon me the prophet says from what so ma pleas with him he says that from adultery so he says are you mad have you gone crazy so the person says no I'm not mad then the prophet asked that are you drunk did you have K did you have wine so the other people get up and the smell his M they said no prophet he said no he said did you really come adultery he says yes I've committed adultery and I want the punishment for the sin I've committed so Prophet asked the people to Stone him and he was Stone to death after Stone to death there's a controversy between the sahabas and there two groups of people one group of people say that he has been undone that means it's a Pity that he will not get undone the other group say Allah subhana ta'ala has accepted Allah accepted his repentance and he shall go to jenah this happens for two or 3 days then the Beloved Prophet M wasam comes and then he tells to the sahabas that pray for Malik because he has repented for a sin and if you distribute his repentance even in a large number of people in a group of people it would be sufficient here shows that the people they committed a major sin but they repented they were even willing to have themselves killed because both these people knew very well the punishment for adulty was death it was throwing to death so here it show that the high level of tawa they had the sincere repentance that they from Allah subh tala and Allah forgiv them"
