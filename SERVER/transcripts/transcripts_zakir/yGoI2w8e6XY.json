  "title": "Why are the Insane Exempted from Fasting? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "one of the categories you've mentioned an insane person is Exempted why is this the insane person is Exempted because the same Hadith that I quoted earlier our beloved Prophet mam said it's mentioned in the Hadith of Hadith number 1423 that the pen is lifted from three categories of people a child till he reaches puberty a person who's sleeping till he wakes up and a person who's insane till he becomes the sound mind so this the prophet has Exempted and they are free from fasting the reason is because one of the criteria for the fasting to be accepted is NI is intention and intention can only be made by a person who sane who sound in mind only if he sound can he willingly intend to fast if he's insane he cannot so that's the reason if an insane person whether he fast or not it doesn't make a difference at all it is he's Exempted and once he becomes sin he does not have to compensate also for the fast because he's not responsible for that he's not held responsible so that's the beauty of Islam they only held responsible those people who should be held responsible"
