  "title": "Is there Contagious Disease like Corona Virus in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "i am muhammad wahidu zama and i am from dhaka bangladesh my question is there is no contagious disease in islam is it true no it's not true to say there is no contagious disease in islam is not true at all and i quoted several hadith giving us what precaution we should take when the plague and plague is a contagious disease the prophet spoke about leprosy the first contagious disease that i can think of in the history of islam is mentioned in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 59 talking about the bani israel that at the time of musa salaam the bani israel they were transgressing they were not following the commandments of allah so allah says in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 59 that these transgressors the bani israel allah will send a plague on them so the first mention in islamic text the earlier that i know of any plague mentioned that i can think of is at the time of ban israel at the time of muslim when they were transgressing not following allah sent a plague on them as a punishment if you read historical record by tabari tabari says that in 18 hijri 18 ah after history in palestine in a place known as amwas a plague came and 25 000 people died because of the plague and from the people who died there were many sahabas some were from the ashram bashirin for example he was one of the 10 people who promised paradise and he was amongst one of the people who died in the play and 25 000 people that imagine at that time when the population was small if you read the historical records of ibn tagira brady he writes that up to 100 131 hijri ah 15 plagues came and he quoted the time and the so plague is there since ages and centuries even in islam it's there so it's wrong to say that there is no contagious disease in islam the next question is i am abdul rahman from riyadh saudi arabia a prophet peace be upon him said there is no other contagious disease is this not contradicting with the medical science yes there is a hadith of a beloved prophet it doesn't say bihari one number seven hadith number five thousand seven hundred seven where the beloved prophet said there is no other advantage contagious disease what you have to understand that you have to read and it says that there are no bad documents that settle in it and continues the hadith but if you read the shara and the commentary of the hadith it says that here what the prophet meant was when there is no adva there is no contagious disease which can be conveyed without the permission of allah it means that no one can acquire any contagious disease unless it is permitted by las manothala it is not just a blanket statement that there is no contagious diseases otherwise as you mentioned correctly it would be against medical science there are and if you read the complete hadith that says there's no otherwise there's no contagious diseases meaning there is no contagious disease it is not conveyed unless with the permission of allah and there's no bad domains etc and it says that if you see a leper run away from it as though you've seen a lion this indicates that leprosy is a contagious disease and the prophet is advising you when you see a person having contagious disease you don't know indicating there is contagious disease so if you read the complete hadith you understand that the context is that you cannot get any contagious disease or any disease unless with the permission of allah and the other hadith quoted that we have to take precautions during contagious diseases so that means of course there is contagious disease but have faith in allah that nothing will befall you unless except with the permission of allah so according to the hadith there are contagious diseases according to the quran there are contagious diseases quran says that allah sent plagues on the bani israel and surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 59 so there are contagious diseases allah and allah say that the prophet said what precautions you should take but it's giving an indication that have faith in allah it will not harm you except with the permission of allah hope that answers the question"
