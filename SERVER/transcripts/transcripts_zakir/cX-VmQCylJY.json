  "title": "Is a Person Who has Final Exams in Ramadhaan Exempted from Fasting? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh next question as a gentleman who says he's an engineer final year would-be graduate student his final year examination lies in the month of ramadan we were talking about last ramadan i believe his mother and his parents have advised him not observe the fast during the month of ramadan because it may affect his examination results is he exempted from fasting on this basis a person who does not want to fast only because of the examination it is not a valid reason even though it may be a final exam and maybe the parents may coax that don't fast because if you fast then maybe your concentration will go down and the results will become less even if the parents force at this point of time the child the son or the daughter should not listen to the parents because if the parents tell you something which is against the teaching of allah and every soul that's the only time where they can disobey the parents allah says in the quran in surah and kabut chapter 29 verse number eight as well as that if your parents force you or strive to jihad to make you worship somebody else besides allah do not obey them but yet live with them with love and companionship so here quran gives you permission because that is not a legitimate reason that because the examination is there they don't want too fast so that they can get good marks getting marks in the akhirah doing a pharah's is more important that is the reason this is not a valid reason and the person should yet fast inshallah allah will help him and he will do better in the examination with the help of allah is more important than any other help and allah says in the quran in imran chapter number 3 verse 160 if allah helps you none can overcome you if allah forsakes you who is dead then who can help you so let the believers put their trust in allah so my advice is that even if examination let them fast inshallah the concentration better and they'll get better marks in charlotte"
