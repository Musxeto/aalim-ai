  "transcript": "a lot of people are concerned about this I know I am myself how do we know what of indications and how do we know whether repentance is accepted what are the indications the indication as far as for repent is to be acceptable as Mahalo number one is that you do not commit the same sin again and your good deeds keep on increasing and a bad deed keeps on decreasing this is number one thing that alive accepted their repentance number two that you have the fear of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala number three is that you regret to Allah subhana Allah and you keep on asking his forgiveness number four is that you're humbled and you always address him in humility so these are the four signs we show that your repent days have been acceptable las manos Allah the signs of non acceptance of the table our repentance is deficiency in the person's repentance and he remembers the pleasures of the sins and he gets preoccupied and continuing the sin that's number one number two he's for sure that it will be accepted as though he has got immunity and he's immune to it I'm sure he'll be forgiven that's number two number three is that his eyes don't cry and his heart is hardened number four there's no increase in the good activities that he's doing no increase in the good deeds and I beloved partner Phyllis Lim said it's mentioned in say Muslim one before in the book of repentance hadith number six six to one that if the people do not commit any sins Allah subhana WA Ta'ala will wipe them out and replace with the people who commit sin and who asked for forgiveness so that I like and forgive them no you if you understand this hadith it will look really odd that does allow just reducing if you don't do sin Allah will remove you what it means that there are some people who may do sin and who may ask for forgiveness and repent and make him prove that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and the good deed will increase and these people were Jenna on the other hand some people who do good deed and the have concede they're so proud of themselves and that will take them to Hellfire so Allah says that if there's a group of people who don't do sin unlevel replace them with the people who do sin so that they'll ask forgiveness and Allah will forgive them that means you should have humility so these are the signs for not acceptance of your Toba may allah subhanho wa taala continue to accept repentance on october dr. zakir"
