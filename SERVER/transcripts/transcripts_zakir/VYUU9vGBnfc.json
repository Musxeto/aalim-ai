  "transcript": "the first question asked on the what's up if by Periyar alum Shah from Tamil Nadu India and brother Pierre is asking the question how can Muslims coexist peacefully with Hindus while Allah hates cafes and commands Muslims in the Quran to do jihad against their faith Quran is indeed a terror manual against Hinduism Muslims want to abolish Hinduism and convert Hindustan into Islamist and they want to fulfill the command of Allah I fully support Modi ji and Amit Shah JEE for a Muslim free Hindu Rashtra kick Muslims out to Pakistan or Cobra Stan J him our Hindu brother Britta Perry R has asked a very important question and he's asking the question that how can Muslims and Hindus coexist peacefully while Allah subhana WA Ta'ala he said that hates cafes and commands Muslims in the Quran to do jihad against the faith there are about five fixed questions in this one wrong question the first is that how can Muslims and Hindus coexist when Allah hates the coffered what is the meaning of the Arabic word kafir the arabic word kafir comes from the root word cosa which means to reject which means to hide so kafir means those who reject I would like to ask a simple question to be the Puryear that if you have a company and there are hundreds of employees that you have and if your employee a reject is the commandment that they have given him all the work you have given him what will you do will you praise him will you love him or will it is like him and mind you they are only employees here Allah subhana WA Ta'ala is the creator he is Almighty God he has created all the him means more than seven-and-a-half billion human beings today in the world that are there all that came in the past he's the creator and then after he's the creator he asked you to follow a few of his commandments and you do not follow what do you expect him to love you but natural so he will not like you so Allah subhana WA Ta'ala you rightly said that he hates the kafir kafir means those who reject the commandment of Almighty God so anyone who obey the commandment of Almighty God he loves them those who reject his commandment who disobey Him he will not like them this is but natural so what is wrong in it and the second part of your first question is that Quran says that we should do jihad with this kaffir you are right if you read the Quran the Quran says in surah Furqan chapter number 25 verse number 52 that do jihad with the Quran against the unbelievers with the cafe here Allah is advising us that jihad is the Arabic word which means to strive which means to struggle unfortunately the media has promoted that jihad means something to kill or jihad only means that you go for a war this is not the right concept the real meaning of the Arabic word jihad comes from the Arabic word jihad ax which means to strive which means to struggle so jihad basically means to strive and struggle here Allah is telling that to strive and struggle against the unbelievers those who reject the Quran you strive and struggle with the Quran that means Allah is telling us to convey the message of the Quran of allah subhanaw taala of almighty god to the unbelievers so what is wrong in that this is good that Allah is telling to strive and struggle to convey the message the commandment the Creator then the question asks Quran is indeed a terror manual against Hinduism let me give you an example that every country has the police force and they have laws in the country what you should do what you should not do and if you go against the law there are punishments which I mentioned every country other law that if you rob they'll be thrown into the punishment if you murder someone for answers the punishment and if you cheat so enter the punishment if you do fraud similarly Quran is the future world Constitution it is a law book of our Creator how a human meat should lead is life if you allow me to call a human being a machine it is the most complicated machine on the face of the earth the glorious quran is the instruction manual for the human being the do's and don'ts and if this instruction manual to prevent people committing crimes has given a punishment for robbing or for murdering innocent human being or for cheating then why do you call it error manual if you call that error manual that means all the countries the court of law which has a constitution and where it says in the log book the punishment for the crimes then every country will have a terror manual so it is a misunderstanding it is the guidance given by allah subhana wa ta'ala to the human beings about the do's and don'ts and if you do not do certain things which are commandments of almighty god like how you have rules in the country if you break a signal there are punishments for it so similarly this is a book to prevent the wrongdoing by the human beings it is a misconception that it is a terror manual actually it's a manual for peace if someone calls the law of the country as a terror manual that means the person hasn't understood the law of the country it is actually a peaceful manual so that peace prevails in that country if this law wasn't there in the country the country would have been in chaos so because of this law peace is maintained similarly this is the law book of a create allah subhanaw taala to let peace prevail throughout the world in the next part our brother period says that muslims want to abolish hinduism and convert Hindustan into Islamist and they want to fulfill the command of Allah regarding a question that Muslims want to convert Hindustan into Islam Stan first let me tell you that the word Hindu is a misnomer where'd it come from who gave this word Hindu according to historical books we come to know that the word Hindu is not present in any of the scriptures of Hinduism according to Joanna Nehru in his book discover India he says the first and this word was used was in the eighth century it is never found in any of the Hindu scriptures it was first used in the eighth century even the Persians when the Muslim Arabs came to India and even the story in shape that this word was given by the Muslims so the word Hindu is given by the Muslims for the people living in the land of the Indus Valley the real name of the religion those who follow the Vedas should be with them test so this Hinduism is a misnomer and really if you come to know that allah subhana wa taala almighty god has only send down one religion for the whole of humankind it is later on that human means kept on manipulating it and the moment the message got changed allah sent a new messenger with a new message to get the people to the straight path so all the messengers of Almighty God Allah subhana Allah they thought nothing but submitting your will to Almighty God and the religion of submitting your will in Arabic we say Islam Islam comes from the root word Salam which means peace it's also derived from the Arabic word film which means submitting ovale to God so Islam means peace acquired by submitting or wilt almighty god and anyone who acquires peace by submitting evil to a mighty God is called as a Muslim so here Muslims want all the human beings in the world not only in India the Muslims want all the human means in the world that they should follow the commandment of Almighty God they should worship only Almighty God and no one else because we love our brother human beings and we want them to follow the commandment of the Creator Almighty God which all the major religions if you read the scriptures all the religions the Scriptures basic messages that you worship only one God do not make images of God and worship Him alone and for his command the brother further says that I fully support Modiji and Amit Shah G for a Muslim free Hindu Rashtra regarding as far as our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and our home minister ameesha is concerned according to me both these people they do not follow the Hindu scriptures they don't follow the Vedas they are breaking the rules of the own scripture what they're promoting is not Hinduism of agent ism they are promoting Hindu to are the own brand and if you read the Vedas there are many things that our prime minister who minister not following from the intro scriptures they're killing people the torturing people all this is against the scriptures if you analyze and read the teachings of the Vedas I can proudly say that I follow more of the teachings of the Vedas then Amit Shah and moody's you put together because I have read the in the scriptures I doubt whether Narendra Modi has read the Vedas I doubt whether Amit Shah has read the Rinda and even if they read the Veda I doubt whether they were understood and I don't think so the practice there are so many things that they violate there is so much of an arc you going so much of oppression going on in India so much of innocent people have been killed on the advice so much of cheating is there so much of corruption is there all these against the teaching of Vedas so if you want to judge a person only on the peak Nevada then a hamdulillah i dr. zakir naik who's a Muslim can proudly say that I follow more of the teachings of Vedas than Narendra Modi or Amit Shah so what they're doing is they are taking the people away from the true teachings of Hinduism and regarding your last statement that you said that kick Muslims out to Pakistan or Cobra let us understand what is the meaning of the word Pakistan Pakistan part means sacred holy s--t and means land holy land I am NOT referring to the Pakistan country or neighbouring country I'm not talking about that but if you literally say that the Muslims should be kicked to Pakistan to a holy land that means you don't consider India to be holy you don't consider India to be sacred you don't consider India to be a good country I consider India to be a good country it is few politicians who are changing that Monsieur and causing chaos in the country but as a country India was a very good country for many years it is yet a good country there are some politicians who for the anterior motives they are spoiling the name of the country and they are causing chaos and violence in the country so if you say that Muslims should be kicked out to a holy land again Pakistan path is sacred or pure something which is pure - pure land you are not considering that to be pure I'm not talking about our neighboring country Pakistan and take the Muslims to Cobra Stan it is every human being has to die Allah says in the Quran he gave life and he will cause you to die every human being no one can save you nobody ji na Mishra ji can save any human being when Allah has signed you the day you will die you will die no one can save you if Allah wants to keep you alive no one can kill you so every human being is born in this world and yesterday so every human Mina the Muslim or non-muslim therefore die so my aim is to make the whole world a sacred place whole world a Park Place whole world so all the human means in the world should follow the commandments of Almighty God and if you truly regarding a first part of the question that how can Muslims and Hindus coexist the best way they can coexist that both of them should read the scriptures with understanding and at least agree to follow what is common if the Hindus read the Vedas with understanding if they understand Sanskrit and if they did and if the Muslims read the Quran with understanding and let us agree to follow what is coming what will different we'll discuss tomorrow at least let us agree to follow what is common the Hindus believe that whether the Word of God the Muslims believe that the Quran is the word of God let us come to come in terms let us agree to follow what is common both the sacred scriptures and when we do a comparative study I have given a lecture on the topic similarities between Islam and Hinduism and I have given Marius similarities number one is both the legend say that we should worship only one God both the legends say that you should not make any idols any images of Almighty God both the regions say that the last and final messenger to come is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him both the religion say that when we pray we should do sujood we should be prostration both the legend say that which will be of charity both the legend say that we should fast there are many similarities so why don't we agree to follow what is common why are we creating fictitious animosity so those people who believe in getting the human beings together on the common platform and the real good human beings those who for the ulterior motives one for the personal benefit they create the number City so that they can get a benefit in this world but in the year after surely they'll be among the losers so a request Manu and Muslim brothers of India that read the scriptures and let us at least agree to follow what is coming what is different we can discuss tomorrow and inshallah if the Hindu they're Muslims in India United there will be a superpower India was superpower a few centuries ago India of the superpower it was number one country in the world if we go back and unite go back to our scripture and unite and follow it inshallah again will be a superpower hope Danson's question"
