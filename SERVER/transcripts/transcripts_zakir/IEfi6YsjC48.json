  "transcript": "okay good evening i have one question before that my name is mr ram ramesh kumar i am from mayapul my profession is pastor so brother in this occasion you are told the final is quran okay but i have one question in a bottle of yamama may people died this who by hearted the quran there was a few that quran can be lost during the abu bakr time and second uh saith al-bukhari volume six hadees number five ten says but when three cauliflowers third khalifa came he was fighting with harimi people and the time this found all the way reading a different quran so usman written and another thing is allah says in quran 15 9 says we we have released and we got it but here the quran was born and at the time what was the corrupted why it was the corrupted where it was the corrupted who is what the corrupted when it was the corrupted please answer me ask the question he says when the quran says in surah chapter 15 verse number 9 which i quote in my talk that we have revealed the quran and we shall got from corruption so in the quran says the quran is uncorrupted allah says it's unadulterated how come say bukhari says that the quran was lost at the time and third qualifier this man came and he found different readings and then how is it possible brother what you said of sai bukhari is correct what hazard usman may allah be pleased with him found is variant reading for example in english language there are different dialects same english language a south indian speak different what is your name an englishman what is your name so hyderabadi a different accent i can't imitate it hindi style is different my wife was telling me why don't you speak hyderabadi style urdu yesterday in bombay we don't say in bombay with yesterday so here you realize that every area has a different dialect so same way at the time of this month in arabic 1 there were different dialects what the prophet gave permission was seven dialects so in pronunciation they made mistakes so when they made mistakes he said okay let's finalize it and we have to follow the correct pronunciation so one of the reasons he did was he corrected the dialect if someone says what is your name my english man said what type of english is this what is your name what's your name american accent is different british accent is different neutral accent is different some accepted some are not this was one of the reasons he corrected the dialect number two when when prophet quran was revealed he had special scribes and he told the specialist sabas whatever was revealed to him he repeated it and the sabbath wrote down he rejected in that zayat bin tabith may allah be with him he was the main person and other scribes now many of the sabbaths when prophet muhammad said the quran they went home and wrote it through memory so now someone hears my speech and goes home and makes points it may be right may be wrong it will not be verbatim but if i tell someone and check up okay i'm giving notes write this read it again it's a mistake correct it so the copy that was kept with muhammad sallam was verified by him when he was alive it was given to his wife allah be pleased who was the daughter of allah please with him so it was kept in that custody now when people wrote on their own from their memory there are bound to be mistakes so the quran is not wrong even though there were notes of some people had said now people should not get mislead that is the real quran so he said okay now i'll make copies of this and spread it throughout different parts of the world so that they will know this is the authentic the quran wasn't changed people when they had their own roads written down people did not know whether that was hundred percent verbatim correct or not so other this man the third khalifa male 1 he saw to it that he made a committee of the sabbath and copied it from the original copy and spread it in different parts of the world and one of them is even present in tashkent in koptaki museum today and if you analyze it it is verbatim same and today the fast even if you burn all the copies today there are millions of ufas who know the quran by heart even if you burn all the copies hypothetically yet if these people get together they can again make the true verbatim quran hope they answer the question [Applause]"
