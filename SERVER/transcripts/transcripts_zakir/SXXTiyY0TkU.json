  "title": "Every Religion Claims that they are Only Right & all others are Wrong. How do we know which is the",
  "transcript": "let's take the first question assalamu alaikum my name is jihadul islam and i am a student of bba from bahama barya bangladesh one of my hindu friends asked me a question that muslims say that people following other religions are not on the right path every religion claims that only they are right and all the others are wrong how can a person justify if he is on the right path or the wrong path how do we know which is the only true religion of our creator brother i disagree with you that every religion says that only their religion is right and the other religions are wrong quran is the only religious scripture on the face of the earth which says that islam is the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah subhana tala allah subhana wa says in the glorious quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 19 in the islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah it is islam so the glorious quran clearly says that the only religion the only way of life acceptable in the sight of allah it is islam no other religious scripture on the face of the earth says that and allah subhana tala says in the glory imran chapter number three verse number 85 islam and fellaini foreign and whosoever chooses a path other than that of islam it will not be accepted of him and in the hereafter he will be from among losers so the glory is quran besides saying that islam is the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah subhana tala it also says that the other religions they are wrong no religious scripture on the face of the earth says that its religion is the only one acceptable in the sight of almighty god and the other religions they are wrong so islam and the glorious quran it is crystal clear in saying that islam is the only way of life acceptable in the sight of allah and the glory is quran it is the only religious scripture on the face of the earth that is free from contradictions and errors allah says in the glorious quran chapter 15 it is we who have revealed the glorious quran and it is we who will guard it from corruption so the glorious quran it is guarded from corruption and allah subhanahu wa says in the glorious quran so nisa chapter number four do they not consider the quran with care had it been from anyone besides allah they would have founded it numerous contradictions so the glorious quran clearly says that there are no contradictions in it the other scriptures whether it be the bible whether it be the hindu scriptures there are contradictions but the glorious quran alhamdulillah it is free from contradictions it is free from errors it is free from scientific errors what makes islam different from the other religions islam besides teaching good it shows you a way how to achieve that state of goodness for example all religions basically say that we should not wrong islam says that christianity says that hinduism says that so what's the difference between islam and the other religions islam besides saying that you should not rob it shows your practical way how to achieve that state of goodness in islam we have a system of zakah every rich person who has a saving of more than nisab level he should give two point five percent of a saving every lunar year in charity if every rich man give charity poverty will eradicate from this world there will not be a single human being who'll die of hunger and after that if any man robs chopping of the hands certain people might say chopping off their hands in this 21st century islam is a barbaric religion islam is a ruthless religion you know people they say america it is one of the most advanced countries in the world you know america it has the highest rate of crime and theft i am asking the question that if you implement the islamic sharia that there should be a system of zakah every rich person who has a saving of more than the nisab level he should give 2.5 percent of saving every lunar year in charity and after that if any man robs chopping of the hands i am asking the question will the rate of robbery in america will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease but natural it will decrease you implement the sharia and you get results i would like to give you another example all major world religions basically say that you should not molest a woman you should not rape a woman islam says that hinduism says that even christianity says that so what's the difference between islam and the other religions islam besides saying that you should not molest a woman you should not rape a woman it shows your practical way how to achieve that state of goodness in islam we have a system of hijab the man he should lower his gaze and the woman she should maintain her complete hijab and after that if any man rapes any woman capital punishment death penalty certain people might say death penalty in this 21st century islam is a barbaric religion islam is a ruthless religion and america happening to be one of the most advanced countries in the world as many people say it has the highest rate of rape according to the fbi report in the year 1996 alone 2713 case of rapes took place every 32 seconds one woman has been raped in usa i am asking the question that if you implement the islamic sharia that every woman she should maintain her complete hijab the man he should lower his gaze and after that if any man rapes any woman capital punishment death penalty i am asking the question will the rate of rape in america will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease but naturally it will decrease you implement the sharia and you get results islam besides teaching good it shows your practical way how to achieve that state of goodness islam it is a practical solution so besides teaching good it shows you a practical way how to achieve that state of goodness and what makes islam different from the other religions there are several scientific facts that are mentioned the glorious quran these facts they were mentioned 1400 years ago which science has discovered it recently and i would like to give you one or two examples when did we come to know regarding the big bang it was in 1973 the glorious quran talks about the big bang fourteen hundred years ago in surah chapter number 21 verse number 30. see that the heavens and the earth they were together and we clothed them asunder the glorious quran talks about the big bang 1400 years ago which science has discovered it recently the glory's quran also says that every living thing is made from water in the same verse surah chapter 21 verse number 30. and we created every living thing from water do we not then believe imagine in the deserts of arabia the glorious quran says that every living thing is made from water and today we know every living creature consists of 50 to ninety percent of water so there are various scientific facts that are mentioned the glorious quran the glorious quran talks about the water cycle the glorious front talks about biology the various scientific facts that i mentioned the glorious quran these were mentioned 1400 years ago which science has discovered it recently so the glorious quran it is different from the other in the scriptures there are no scientific errors there are no contradictions in the glorious quran islam it is a practical solution to the problems of humanity so that makes islam different from the other religions"
