  "title": "Why is Fish Not Slaughtered before Eaten? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Muhammad gulam Mustafa opthalmologist from India sir what is the reason both scientifically and spiritually to make Halal chicken Halal goat but not fish please reply what Dr Muhammad gulam may be asking that when we Slaughter the chicken or the goat we do Zab so why is there not requirement to do Zab to a fish and that's a very good question as far as Islam is concerned Quran clearly mentions in Sur MAA chapter number five verse Number 96 that lawful for you is the pursuit of the water game and Allah says in MA lawful for you a food of the sea fresh and tender so Allah has given permission it's allowed and there are various Hadi that also says that amongst the dead animal the only two that are permitted it is the fish and the Locust so the Hadith and only blood that is permitted is that of the spleen and the liver so islamically it is permitted to have fish without doing Zab but we know islamically whether goat chicken or cow Etc when we have to eat them we have to slaughter to J to Zab in zabia what we do there are various conditions the main is that see to it that the knife is sharp see to it that it's not in front of other goat and you do it swiftly and once we Slaughter the wind pipe and the veins and the jagular veins and the artery when you do it you leave it you leave the animal the animal will rther and the blood will flow out of the animal so when you do Zab the blood which is a good media of germs and bacteria majority flows out of the body so that's the reason zabya is compulsory when we are having nonv food like like uh meat mutton beef Etc anything we have to do zabya this is the scientific so that the blood flows out of the body when the blood flows out of the animal's body there are less germs and bacterias because blood is a very good medium of germs and bacteria so it keeps the mutton or the chicken fresh for a longer time if you have slaughtered by the Islamic method of zabia a goat or a sheep or a cow or a chicken it will stay for a longer time because blood is a very good media of germs and bacteria so in the normal cases that if you don't do zabya the blood remains in the body of the animal and even the disease remains and high chances of you getting the disease so Islamic slaughtering zabya is a must for nonage now the question posed is why not zabia for fish because fish is sea life and goat and sheep they are animals they don't live in water the difference in the system is that in the fish there are gills and when the fish dies it gasps when it gasps the gills it sucks all the blood into the gills so in a fish when a fish dies when a fish is bought outside water it struggles and you find it rering and then it dies so when it's out of water because the fish cannot breathe so what happens when it starts breathing and it cannot it's it can only normally breathe in water it doesn't have the function to breathe in normal air like of human animals have so what happens most of the blood is sucked by the gills so when a fish has died because of loss of air loss of oxygen when it dies the blood is sucked by the gills that's the reason the scientifically the blood doesn't remain in the body of the fish number one the blood of the fish differs from the blood of the goat the sheep or the animal it's not as much of bacteria and toxins as the blood of the goat the cow the sheep and secondly the blood is sucked so first of all this blood is not as dangerous as the blood of the animals number two the blood is sucked because the blood is sucked the germs and bacteria are not there so eating the fish is safe this is is the scientific reason hope that answer the question"
