  "title": "Why does Allah Chain the Devils only in Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question by shamshad Alam Kar from Bihar India why Allah traps or chains the devil only in the month of Ramadan why doesn't he trap them in other months as well that's a very tricky question that why does Allah trap and chain the Devils only in the month of Ramadan why doesn't do in the other month why doesn't do the full year if you watched my earlier sessions on Ramadan I told you that if you allow me to call a human being a machine human being is the most complicated machine and Ramadan is like a servicing like overhauling of the complete body and every machine requires servicing some require once a year some require once in six months so Ramadan is one month in a year which I would say give an analogy it is like a servicing of the body so when you're doing servicing it is good for the machine but if you say I will keep on doing servicing the full year then that's not logical so if you say that we will keep on having Raman the full year if the devils are chained then but Allah subhana tala will also have to tell the you should fast the full year and fasting full year is Haram in Islam our beloved Prophet said you cannot fast every day the maximum that if you want to do our Prophet permitted keep the fast of da he fasted alternate days so fasting every day of the year is prohibited so if Allah changed the devil full year you'll also have to fast because in Ramadan one of the requirement that you have to fast the the full month of Ramadan so if Allah Chang the Devil the full year you have to F the full year that is point number one point number two Let me give you an analogy that you know when there is there's a shop the shop normally sells good and once a year maybe or once in month they have a sale during the sale you get the goods cheap and and you go there and you purchase same way Ramadan is one month in a year where you get many benefits so these benefits that you get cannot be for the full year you know the shopkeeper allows only for for one month so these benefit that you have is kept for one month but the best example anery I can give you is of an examination because this life as Allah says in the Quran Surah chapter number 67 verse number two Allah has created death and life to test which of you is good and deeds so this life is a test for the Hereafter now if you see the test that we have in our life when we go to colleges when we go to universities you have for the full year you you attend the University you attend the college and you have final exam only once in a year and that final exam is more important it may carry 80% marks depending upon which course you're doing and full year you may have to attend college every day for for for which marks may be given for attendance they may be weekly test some of the professions have daily test you get marks but those marks are less important as compared to the marks in the final examination depending upon the course you're doing maybe final examination may carry 80% marks of the total maybe 75% marks the balance 20 or 25% maybe for day-to-day activities so similarly this life is a test for us Allah subhana wa ta'ala has given you rules and regulation which you should follow throughout the year but during Ramadan it is like the final examination and during final examination you study more you study more than the normal time so we Muslims do more I in Raman than the normal time but you cannot say that like the examination be throughout the year it'll be a problem because in when during final examination you do not follow your daily routine you may do less of the other activity less of Social Work less of and concent more more on the things of the examination similarly in Ramadan is not the same activity as we do in the other days you do more I you fast you pray more you read the Quran more which is difficult for the full full year so in Ramadan because Allah subhana tala chams the devil it is possible for you to do more I it is possible for you to do more Salah it's possible for you to fast for the full month if you say Allah will change for the full year then full year we keep on doing more I and and and more it's good but then it's difficult during the last 10 nights many of us stay awake full night so imagine you have to stay awake full night for the full year is difficult so everything is balanced and comes in a combination you cannot say Allah changeed the devil will and then you don't stay awake the full night in the last 10 nights that be one third of the month of Ramadan you're staying awake full night so that the It's a combination together the best example of an examination this is like a final examination it is more important therefore you give more time and you give more effort so Ramadan is like that in one year one examination you give more time Allah changed the devil so that you can do more I and come closer to Allah subhana wa tala and the marks of this is counted more so even if you make the small mistake mistakes and the small small faults Allah forgives that Allah says that from one Ramadan to the other Ramadan Allah washes all your sins except as long as you stay away from the major sins hope this answer the question"
