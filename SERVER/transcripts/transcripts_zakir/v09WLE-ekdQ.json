  "title": "In Islam how many Women can a Man Marry and why? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "[Music] is as far as the woman is concerned according to surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 12 to 24 a married woman cannot marry again so women should have only one husband maximum as far as the other is concerned quran says in surveillance chapter number four verse number three marry woman for choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one you can marry two three or four but if you can't do justice marry only one this statement marry only one if you can't do justice it's only given in the quran there's no other scripture on the face of the earth which says marry only one besides the quran if you read the ramayana if you read the mahabharat you can marry as many wives as you want if you read rahman the father of ram how many wives he had he had more than one wife krishna he freed mahabharat how many wives he had two four ten thousand ten thousand sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives so when krishna again has sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives so why can't we muslims have up to four if you read the bible in the old testament as the new testament you can marry as many wives as you wish solomon had 700 wives abraham at several according to the bible it is the church we put our parliament christians should marry only one it is rabbi benjamin who passed a cyanide that jews should marry only one in india it is the indian panel code in 1954 which passed a law in hindu marriage act which said that hindu should marry only one it is the indian penal code not the hindu scripture which says that hindu should have only one wife let's analyze what are the reasons that islam gives permission for a man to have more than one wife marrying more than one wife is not compulsory in islam it's optional but if you marry more than one wife you should do justice between your eyes the logical reasons we can think that islam has information are that male and female are born in equal proportion but if you ask any medical doctor any pediatrician he will tell you that the girl the female child is a stronger sex medically as compared to the male child she can fight the german diseases much better than a male child so more female children are alive as compared to male children as life goes on there is death due to war due to accident due to secret smoking due to alcohol in all these cases more male are dying as compared to female so today in the world there are more females in the world as compared to males in few third of all countries like india etc where the female population is less than the male population because of female infanticide and female feticide every year in india more than one million fetus have been about it after they identified that they're females if this evil practice stops even in india the male population will become less than the female population in new york alone there is one million female more than male in usa alone there are 7.8 million females more than male in uk alone there are four million female more than me in germany alone there are five million female more than male in russia alone there are nine million females more than male and god alone knows how many millions of females are more than will throughout the world if i agree with you that one man should only marry one woman and suppose the market is saturated and if your sister happens to live in america my sister happens to live in america and if she happens to be one of the 7.8 million females who has not found a life partner the only option for her is that she either marries a man who already has a wife or she becomes public property public property such a harsh word this is the most sophisticated word i can use i cannot think of a better word than this and any modest woman would say that if the option is given she would prefer marrying a man who already has a wife or become public property hope that answers the question [Applause] you"
