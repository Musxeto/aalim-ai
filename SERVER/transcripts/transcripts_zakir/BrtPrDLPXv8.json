  "title": "Does Swallowing Saliva Nullify the Fast? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question relates to a person that is swallowing his or her own saliva during the fast is this a permitted act as far as following the Sala is concerned it is a normal act it's a natural act and today science tells us that there are several liters of saliva being secreted by the salivary gland every day and it is normal it's natural that the saliva a human being gulps it down he swalls it and this can't be avoided and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse 185 when it tells you that you should fast for the full month of Ramadan and those who are on a journey they can make up the period later on then it says Allah subhana wa ta'ala wants to make it easy for you and does not want to put you in a difficulty Allah says inah chter number 22 verse number 78 Allah subhana does not want to give you hardship in your de in your religion so but natural sin soling saliva is a normal act and I know that some people keep on frequently spitting out and I have some of my friends who do that thinking it's Haram to swall and they keep on spitting and imagine if you have to do it the full day you cannot even offer your Salah properly because when you offer Salah it takes a few minute and in few minutes also Sal gets gathered so will you be concentrating on spreading the Sal out or on Allah subhana tala if reading the Quran you have to keep on spitting outside always and I know some people always keep uh maybe a container always spitting out not knowing the ruling so if a person follows the saliva normal saliva which comes in the mount it cannot be avoided at all same way a person when he breeds the dust which which a person goes to a city which is polluted and there's dust particles and you breathe that and some of it goes in your lungs or it goes so it's all this is permissible because this is a normal dat act and these do not violate your fast at all"
