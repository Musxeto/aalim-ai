  "transcript": "um I just wanted to ask a question related to the Christian who asked a question before and you mentioned that the soldiers stabbed Jesus and he was still alive before he was buried my question is did Jesus actually go to the Cross or was he saved from ever having any of the pain sister what's the name sister my name is Rachel sister has a question that when Jesus Christ peace be upon him when he was stabbed by the soldiers she's asking did Jesus actually go to the cross and was in pain or was he safe from going to the Cross now both these incidences details differ as per the Quran and the Bible I am a student of comparative religion I know both the versions as per the Quran the Quran gives the reply in Surah Nisa chapter number four verse number 157 it says that the Jews said in boast that we kill Jesus the son of Mary foreign anyone who defers is full of doubt son with only conjectures to follow for a surety they killed him not so according to the Quran Surah Nisa chapter 4 was 157 Jesus Christ peace be upon him was not crucified he was not killed it was made to appear so how it happened we at least bothered about the details the next verse says in Surah Nisa chapter 4 158 Allah raised him up a life unto himself in the Bible now for the Muslims Quran says he was not killed he was not crucified we are satisfied it was made to appear so how it happened there are many hypotheses maybe somebody was replaced in his place or maybe we at least bothered Quran says he was not killed he was not crucified we are satisfied we are not bothered to know the details if you read the Bible if you read the story if you read the gospels we come to know that Jesus Christ peace be upon him the Jews the alleged that he did blasphemy if you read the Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 31 32 when he says and my father are one so they think that he claimed Divinity so they say that ye being a man you claim Divinity so JFK peace be upon Him says in the Gospel of John chapter 10 verse 32 that he didn't mentioned in your scripture that he are Gods the person who speaks the word of God are called as gods and the law is not broken so here they mistook that he claimed divinity they pick up stones to Stone him so then he says many of Good Works have I done for which of the good works do you Stone me So based on this there's a trial in Pontius pilot and then he's put on the cross and on at that time the Sabbath starts on Saturday for the Jews it was in their philosophy that a person cannot be crucified on a Saturday which starts on Friday night so because he was crucified on Friday he put on the cross on Friday afternoon he was taken down from the cross early because a person cannot be crucified on Saturday so because they take him out early if I agree with the narration of the Bible I assume that even if he was put on the cross he did not die that's the reason the soldiers they pierce and there you see blood coming out and then in a hurry they put him in the Sepulcher now when they put him in the supper he's in the sepulkar on Saturday full day Sunday morning the stone is rolled out when Mary Magdalene comes she sees that the stone is rolled out so who moves the stone is the question so based on the narration of the Bible even if I agree hypothetically what the Bible says is correct nowhere does it say in this narration that he died so what we come to know from this narration if he has to fulfill the sign of Jonah that as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth Jesus Christ peace be upon him has to be alive he feels dead that means Jesus Christ peace be upon Him lied in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 he says and he gives a prophecy that as Jonah was so shall the son of man be if Jonah was alive he has to be alive so what I assume in my reading as a student after doing research I don't believe Jesus Christ peace be upon Him light so to fulfill his prophecy I have to believe he was alive he was put on the cross but he did not die if you read the dictionary crucifixion c-r-u-c-i-f-i-x-i-o-n means to fix a person on the cross and he dies on the cross there is no word in the dictionary which says if you put a person on the cross and he does not die what is it called so new word we have to coin is crucifixion c r u c i f i c t i o n it's the fiction it's the story it's put on the cross but does not die so therefore I believe that if I agree with the Bible it is correct and Jesus did not tell Allah peace be upon him it was a crucifixion f-i-city it was not fiction f i x i o n hope that answers the question sister"
