  "transcript": "and the other important Sunnah which people neglect or avoid mainly fearing that it will spoil their fast or nullify their fast is putting water in the nostrils sniffing the water normally especially during Wu so many of the Muslims even when they do woodoo they just get the water close to the nose and touch the tip of the nose to the water that's it they don't put the water into the nostrils and they clean their nose they don't sniff it which is a requirement for woo thinking that if they sniff it break the fast water entering through the nose into your throat will nullify the fast but the chances are very negligible what our beloved Prophet mallam said it's mentioned a had of Abu da volume number two number 2360 our beloved Prophet said that when you do woodoo sniff the water excessively except in fasting so normally when we do woodoo we sniff the water excessively except in fasting because fasting if we sniff excessively there are chances though very negligible for it to enter the throat and nullifying your fast but normally when we put water in the nostrils there are no Chan of it going to the throat so only care that we have to take while fasting is don't sniff excessively but we have to put the water in the nostrils and clean the nostrils which is important Sunnah which many of the Muslims neglect and they avoid it especially during Wu and here since the prophet clearly mentioned except fasting in during the he said I would have made it compulsory had it not been difficult for my um there because he doesn't say fasting it means that s can be used while fasting and sniffing should not be done excessively but normally water should be put in the nostrils while doing woodu so these two important sunas which people out of ignorance they avoid during fasting"
