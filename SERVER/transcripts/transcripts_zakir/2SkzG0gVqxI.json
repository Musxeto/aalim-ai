  "title": "Dr Zakir Naik's Views on \"The Message\" and other Islamic Movies - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is noman i work in the field of internet travel and marketing my question revolves around the strongest form of media today is movies movies originating from hollywood bollywood lollywood and probably now dollywood in dubai fortunately for their benefit it gets the message across in many forms passion of the christ was one form that related a story about jesus christ it was the script was in hebrew i wanted to first ask how much of that was um in line with what christianity preaches and how much we can relate to quran as well obviously there's some deviations as well but again the masses took that understanding and absorbed it and that's what their understanding is my second part to the question is how can we use the media in form of movies to effectively communicate the message of islam like it was done in the form of the first movie called the message from which i understood a lot of people converted to islam after watching that movie jazakallah brother has the question that movies do play an important role in creating opinions and conveying the message hollywood bollywood now you have dollywood new world that's come to dubai media city and you give the example of passion of christ what are my views of such movies brother i haven't seen that movie passion of christ do i wanted to see it i haven't seen that movie normally i don't see movies but this being a particular movie i wanted to see it but i read reports that after this movie were made by mel gibson the way he portrays and he kept it in the original language there were a lot of criticism and the way he created it and which was slightly against the jewish lobby because of that there was a human cry but it also became popular in the negative sense when you speak something negative it became a box office so they did break the records he was walking on the edge of the sword he invested so much money if it went the flop he would lose millions of dollars it went ahead and it had many things which were right many things would agree with the islamic point of view many would not agree with some point of view as far as the second question is concerned on message and i've seen that movie message made by mustafa arkad and anthony quinn was acting as hamza when i repeat with him the way the movies are made were excellent i really appreciate one of the best movies [Music] on islamic line i would say is the message alhamdulillah without showing the hero without showing prophet muhammad allah without showing his picture without showing his voice alhamdulillah the whole picture was revolving around the hero prophet muhammed without showing his picture without his voice once they show his camel and his staff that's it but the way the angle of the camera was that to show that the prophet did not like and he turned his face away the angle of the camera changes so the direction was superb it was a masterpiece and we do require such more movies but the budgets of this movie is happening it turns into millions of dollars millions of dollars so the budget is there but it did make a lot of money mustafa then he made another film called as umar mukhtar talking about not 100 islam talking about a muslim which also did create a box office and all we do require such movies but we see to it that whatever you create it should be on lines on islam quran and sharia there was something which i don't agree everything of message is right as a whole it was good there were things which were wrong also in the message but as a whole it was good as a whole it was good what we have to do that we have to create online of the islamic sharia without picking any laws of the quran this and portrayed in a way same way not only movies we have to make docu dramas we have to make serious we have to make documentaries [Music] because in the media it is a white elephant white elephant you know if you know about kohn manning or korpathi it was a copy of [Applause] [Music] who wants to be a millionaire on an average they spend one million dollar more than four crore rupees only on one episode one episode only 45 to 50 minutes in bombay where labor is cheap ramita bachchan is expensive so the thing is that the budget is there surely those people of philanthropists would like to sponsor such they should sponsor such films and make such films so that we can convey the message but i yet believe the new movie that has been made the kingdom of heaven it was made by a very famous director and he portrayed incidents how the crusaders attacked and they killed thousands of people and then saladin the hero he comes and he showed us the hero there's a big human cry in the western media that how could he make such a film he's a christian he only portrayed what was fact in history but it did not go down the throat of the westerners there will be human cry but because the person was a very famous director alhamdulillah did not do much damage but if a non-muslim makes such film the kingdom of heaven that flame also i did not see but i read the reports that it did a marvelous job it conveyed the true picture to a great extent so such films should be encouraged hope to answer the question [Applause]"
