  "transcript": "uh yeah Dr Nik first let me just say I'm really honored to be standing in front of you I've watched your programs on peace TV a lot and I really think you're great can we have your name yeah my name is Mahesh urar and I am a PhD student in the department of philosophy of Mumbai University uh my question is a little technical uh I would like to know what the concept of soul is in Islam as you know in a lot of Indian philosophy soul and mind are taken as different whereas in Western philosophy soul and mind is considered as the same so my first question is what is the concept of soul in uh Islam and the second question is what is the relationship of the soul to the body so that after death uh you know does the soul leave the body and uh you know uh things like that so there it's a two-part question what is the concept of the soul and how is it related to the body and what happens to it after death thank you but the Mah asked the question that what is the concept of soul in Islam and what is the relationship of the soul and the human body and what will happen to the soul after death that's basic question that's correct as far as the soul is concerned the soul is the essence of the human body the main importance as compared to the other creation of Allah subhana wa ta'ala creation of almighty God the major difference in the human being it is the soul and it is the essence which will remain even after a person dies which I'll discuss later on as far as science is concerned science does not speak about Soul science hasn't reached that level where it can decifer what is the exact essence of the soul but there have been researches done that when any living creature dies for example animal when he dies as compared to a human being when an animal dies immediately after he dies there's no difference in the weight but when we analyze the weight of a human being the moment he dies and he seizes life immediately there's loss of weight that means there is something that the human being is losing the moment he dies but science hasn't reached that level so far to decifer what exactly soul soul is the essence of the human being and the Quran says in Imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 Allah says Every Soul shall have a taste of death in this world this life is a test for the Hereafter Allah says in the Quran in chapter number 67 verse number two that Allah has created death and life to test which of you is good in Deeds so this life is a test for the Hereafter and every soul shall have a taste of death once a person dies his soul is not there but on the day of judgment when he'll be resurrected then depending upon the good deeds and the bad Deeds he has done almighty God on the day of judgment he's Malik he is the master of the day of judgment depending upon how you have fed the test in this world depending on that then your result will be whether you go to paradise or hell so the soul lives Soul doesn't die it only has a taste of death when a person body Li so the relationship with the body and soul put together you have the human being here but in the year after there'll be absolutely a new body given and the soul will survive and then depending upon how he has fed the test he will go to heaven or hell hope that ansers the question is the soul the same as the mind but ask the question that is the soul same as the mind no again mind is abstract if I ask you where is your mind so people say okay fine you know mind is it in the brain so this is an abstract word like how you say mind your own business so mind when we say people start thinking of the brain but that doesn't mean that the mind is in the brain but it is different so mind is like an abstract word I do not know where the mind is placed but when we talk about the Mind normally start thinking about the brain but that's an extract word hope that answer the question thank you"
