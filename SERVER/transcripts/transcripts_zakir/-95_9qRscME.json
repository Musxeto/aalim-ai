  "title": "Allah tells Muhammad (pbuh) to Ask the Jews and Christians. Does it Mean that their Scriptures ...",
  "transcript": "uh I'm not an expert on the Quran you are but I've read the English translation so I just want to ask you about something I read there in one place where uh uh the prophet Muhammad Alam he is told if you are in doubt about the things I am showing you then go and ask the ones who have been reading the books before you which I presume are the Jews and the Christians so so I was thinking from these verses in the Quran that uh if the tat and theil and the Zab are are the word of Allah and that Muhammad Alam is is supposed to ask the Jews and the Christians if he's in doubt about what's being revealed to him then how can how is it that the Bible is possible to be corrupted very good question brother and brother as a very good question you told in your question Allah told prophet Muhammad if you don't know go and see in the books of the Jews again misunderstanding now I realize that really you have just read the Quan not an expert based on the third question what Allah is telling Allah is telling Prophet Muhammad you as peace be upon him you are the Jews and Christian if you don't believe look at your scripture it is not telling to Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him Allah is telling Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him you tell the Jews and the Christians if you don't believe in this look in your scripture why because this is the last Testament and last Testament contains part of the old and the New Testament because this is the final word of God it contains part of the Torah and the injil so Prophet Muhammad has been asked by almighty God to tell the Jews and Christian if you don't agree in this that's what I'm telling you if you don't agree not to eat the Poke look in your Bible book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number 8 in the book of levitic chapter number 11 in the book of Isaiah chapter number 65 verse number 2 to5 I mean I'm quoting it's not mentioned enough to quote like that it mentioned that you have to tell them look I'm helping you because if you go and find you may take one hour may take two hour if I give reference 2 minutes if you know how to open the Bible and go through it if I tell you book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number 8 if you don't know Deuteronomy is the fifth book you look in the index under D it will tell you page number open that after you open that chapter number 14 easy every page is numbered every chapter is numbered verse number eight easy if I tell you where it's not me have to go into concordance if you know concordance look under the PE look under the poke you may find you may not find depending how big the concordance is so same way Prophet Muhammad I'm learning from that I'm getting guidance from Allah subhana wa ta'ala and the way Prophet Muhammad convinced the Jews and Christian I'm trying to convince you same I'm trying to be a student of the Prophet trying to follow his guidance fine so the same way Prophet told for example same way Jesus Christ peace be upon him did same thing that all those who have not done any evil is the first one who will cast the stone on this woman is it not mentioned similarly it said is it not mentioned in your law in the scripture said same thing mhamad sallallah wasallam that you open your book and see what is the law so many things that Prophet Muhammad told with the Jews and Christians disagreed at that time he said this is what is mentioned in your scripture that means was a messenger of God not that he read the Torah not that he read the injil he didn't know Hebrew he didn't know and there was no Arabic version of the Bible that time Arabic version came later on fine so Prophet Muhammad's going have read that you literate fine so because he was told by almighty God being a messenger of God he get a direct Revelation he was told by almighty God he tells them look and when they look at it they get convinced so the way Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam Prophet Muhammad convinced the Jews and Christians of that time I'm trying in a smaller way my level best to try and convince you that brother if you think this is wrong forget the Quran you don't believe in the Quran keep it aside I'm saying if you believe the Bible is the word of God should you follow the Bible or not see you agree Bible is the word of God yes or no yes the Bible says don't have poke do you have poke it's a complicated question is a question of yes or no or you say Bible doesn't please let me respond then sure aren't there some things in the life of uh Muhammad which uh he says they were at one time uh Halal for you and I have made them Haram or they were at one time Haram and I have made them Halal doesn't it sometimes happen like that so we we believe that for the people of Israel for the Jewish people when when Allah gave the law to mam we believed that for them the pork was Haram and this is why it is in theat brother in any organization when any command is given to you you have to find out who's giving the command any command given by high Authority can be overruled suppose a teacher gives a command in a school and the principal overrules that she has a right but a teacher has no right to overrule the command of her principles so in every religion the person giving the high Authority can overrule not a low Authority if you read the Quran Quran mentions that what has been prohibited for the Jews in the Quran the fat of the ox it was been Haram for them but for you who says that highest Authority almighty God now in the Bible I know what you're referring to St Peter he sees a dream he see it correct St Peter that's right he sees a dream and he sees that the Poke is good and eating of poke is there it's a dream one thing whether it be any Apostle whether it be St Paul also the self-appointed Apostle of Jesus Christ peace be upon him they are not Superior to Jesus Christ peace be upon him if Jesus Christ peace be upon him said in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17 to 20 that think not that I have come to destroy the law of the prophets I have come not to destroy but to fulfill until the Heaven and the Earth pass away not one J or shall pass away from the law until all be fulfilled and whosoever shall break one of the least command Commandments least to whosoever shall break one of the least Commandments and teach men to do so shall not enter the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall keep the Commandments and teach the same shall enter the Kingdom of Heaven unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees in no way shall you enter the kingdom of heaven so Jesus Christ peace be upon him said I have come not to destroy the law of the prophets I have come to fulfill not one J shall pass away until the complete law is fulfilled if any of you break one law even a minutest shall not enter the kingdom of heaven and this is present in the Red Letter Bible if you know what is the Red Letter Bible are you Red Letter Bible mashah you alhamd very good may God bless you Red Letter Bible is a Bible those people who don't know it is a red letter means those words which Jesus Christ peace B himself has said because everything of the Bible is not the word of Jesus CH peace be upon him in Quran everything is the word of Allah of God 100% not one dot or TI is not the word of almighty God now in the Bible those which are the word of God if you put in a newspaper it will be less than one page just two long Columns of her small percentage it's present in the new testament old testament is nil in the New Testament also mainly in the gospels and here are there little bit in Acts very few so if you analyze it is a very small percentage of the complete Bible and this portion is that word of Jesus Christ please be upon him no black letter can overule a red letter because red letter is the word of Jesus Christ black letters maybe somebody else maybe Apostle maybe historian maybe XY Z maybe narration no black letter can overrule a red letter why red letter J peace be upon him unless you consider Paul Peter Thomas higher than J no so in Islam also we have almighty God we have a prophet malli wasallam we have our sahab as companions how you have Apostles we have companions you have the followers of Jesus Christ we have companions ofh but no companion if you show me the companion has speaking against Prophet Muhammad throw away that word Prophet Muhammad number one in the human beings after Allah Prophet Muhammad number one then come the sahaba so there is a gradation no word of the sahaba can overrule the word of the Prophet never in every religion there is hierarchy the word of God cannot be overed by by the word of the messenger the word the companions of The Messengers can never overrule the word of the Prophet so what you're quoting me is lower grade right or wrong we'll discuss later on what you're saying is right or wrong is different but even if I agree it is right what you saying it is a black letter right so no black letter can over red letter if you know if you are a scholar of Bible you'll know if you're not a scholar of Bible and if somebody has told you so that was finishing a third part of the question now the main question of your earlier question fine no I'll give you all the time I'll just finish the I will finish my answer and then I get back no problem even if the others don't get a chance we'll give it you are a guest brother you are a guest and we love to speak with you but let me finish your earlier question after the third question you posed that is it not possible that why are comparing Quran the Bible is right and Quran is wrong you didn't use the word Quran wrong you are very humble and appreciate that I know you didn't say that but you said that the Bible is right and comparing with the Quran comparing with the Quran mean you're comparing a wrong thing with the right thing you have to follow right thing I agree with you but is the Bible right is the question I've given a separate talk is the Quran God's word and any person who's unbiased who even doesn't know much about the Quran but when I've given the talk along with the question session for approximately four hours any unbiased person will see that talk I've proved it logically with reason logic and science that Quran is the word of God I've given the talk is the God's word and use the same logic here there are so many contradictions in the Bible I don't want to quote them according to an article more than 50,000 I don't go into that which you have read I don't know all Muslims book I don't agree to be correct yes with the Quran agree with it I stand by it if you name the book may agree with may not agree may agree with part of it may not agree with part of it so first highest Authority number one Quran even if in my book this is more Superior than my book also number one Quran then com the saying of the Prophet the coming back to a question so when we use Simple logic when we use science we find there are so many stif in the I'll just give you a few samples time doesn't permit us to go into the great detail for example the Bible says in the gospel of Matthew chapter number four verse number 8 that the world is flat it's mentioned in the Book of Genesis chapter number one verse number 16 to 19 it speaks about the creation of the universe that there no light God said there light first day second day third day then it comes and it says on the fourth day on the fourth day God Almighty he created the sun and the stars and the light was created on the first day it's illogical the source of light came later on and the light came earlier if I say that I made a bulb and I switch on the bulb and then there was light then I said the light came on the first day in the first hour and the bulb was switched on on the fourth hour people think I don't know signs for furthermore it is mentioned the creation of the Earth on the third day and the vegetation and the sun was created on the fourth day now Earth is a part of sun in science F to say that the part was created first and the sun came later on is unscientific furthermore if you read in the Book of Genesis chapter number one verse number 16 and 19 it says that God Almighty created two great lights the bigger light the sun to Rule the Day and the smaller light the moon to rule the night and the word out there used in the original text indicates that it has light of its own the Quran says suran chapter number 25 verse number 61 that the light of the sun is its own light and the light of the moon is reflected light so if a scientist reads the Quran and the Bible he will agree with the Quran but not the Bible the light of the moon is not his own light previously a few hundred years back we thought the light of the moon was its own light today we know that the light of the moon is not its own light it's a reflected light so like that we can go on and on and on and on and on there are hundreds of scientific error in the limited time I had in the debate and now I have less time I pointed out 38 scientific errors to Dr William Campbell who was the best the Christianity could produce in science and Bible right he's a medical doctor got a PhD I'm telling you he's very famous or rather was famous and everyone many of the Americans if they want to trap a Muslim they use this book see Quran has got scientific errors Bible has got no scientific errors and the person who's not well in the field may get impressed or may not be able to answer so I had to go all the way from here to Chicago to America to USA and I had a dialogue there alhamdulillah God help us there it was very successful and you can have that cassette inshallah and I'll give you a copy of this debate as well as similarity Witham Christianity so therefore I say that regard in Bible can't it be possible Bible is to it can be possible but not is so you analyze when we analyze that the Bible contains many mathematical errors if you add up there are mistakes mathematical errors means the same vers is repeated twice and the figures are different contradictions 2,000 bars 3,000 BS several so many not one many can be Recon I know that if the 10,000 pointed out on the internet maybe 50% 80% can be reconciliated but many hundreds cannot be I've gone through them hundreds with all your logic with all your S I traveled the breadth and length mashallah and I've gone to various countries spoken with Scholars I'm not a scholar I'm a student and no one could reconciliate these contradictions these scientific errors these historical mistakes so when we use whatever knowledge Our God has given us and put it to test we fail to agree that Bible is the word of God but when you put to Quran we agree for that you'll have to see my C inshallah now we come to our next question brother you're most welcome just a couple clarifications I I'm not trying to debate you uh I I'm sure I am because you're very knowledgeable but I'm not trying to debate you I'm just trying to learn as well as we are all trying to learn about Allah so if I can learn something from you or you can learn something from me wonderful uh I just want to point out I personally do not eat pork because out of respect uh but I think also there is a reason in the red letter of the Bible why Christians feel it is okay to do so not simply because of the black letter but uh isaam has also said that there is nothing that comes into a person through their mouth that can defile them but it is the sinful tendencies that come out of our own heart the evil that is in our heart that defiles a person and it's because of that saying of uham that uh the Christian teaching is that he has declared Foods clean that it's not a food that you consume that that defiles a person so uh whether you agree with that or not that is at least something in the red letter that explains why Christians do feel that in the time of Moses Allah had prohibited Bor but then this was something thatz Isa had made Halal for his followers I'll reply to that I do agree with you brother you're not come here to debate me neither do I want to debate you we are learning if you tell me something which what I've said is wrong or with my understand I'm willing to change see a person when he hears the truth you accept it if he hear the truth if by mistake I said 2 plus 2 5 say Brother 2 plus 2 is not five is four and you prove it to me thank you brother I say may Allah reward you we have to accept it but if I say 2+ 2 is equal to 4 and someone says no it is five then I say that say 2+ 2 is four it's not five it's a mistake and I'll correct him so whoever is right we have to agree now coming to a question a very good argument that in the red letter Jus CH said that whatever comes in your mouth that doesn't defile you it is what's in your heart I agree with you for sake of argument then it's a contradiction between what I quoted to You gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17 to 20 think not that I have come to destroy the law of the prophets so that is a mistake that mean Jesus Christ PE be told a lie Noah may Allah forbid we don't agree with that he cannot tell a lie even if you break one law or jot or a title the law is you shall not have poke so whenever there are two statements given we have to try and follow both together that means the other things which you eat no problem but don't have poke why because Gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 17 to 20 says you cannot break a single law or similarly in the Quran there are various things in the Quran where it says that these foods are Haram but that doesn't mean only those four foods are Haram there's one more food made Haram somewhere like one place which are quoted dead meat blood and flesh of swine somewh it's mentioned alcohol is Haram that does not you cannot read one verse of the Quran and say that is full Islam fine so any way where it's mentioned Haram is Haram and then it says everything else is halal here when we come to know that one verse of the Bible in red letter says that I have come to keep the Commandments not break a single of them if any of you break one jot one title you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven so all the other verses cannot contradict this otherwise Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is telling a lie in one place nah which you don't agree so we cannot not be little Jesus Christ peace be upon him to upgrade Paul or Peter no we cannot that is a law so when we realize we say just because Paul or Peter said something or Thomas said something you want to go against Jesus Christ PE said no what we say what Paul and Peter and Thomas said is wrong we can try and get a Reconciliation if we can if if if this wasn't there Gospel of Matthew 5 verse number 17 to 20 if it wasn't there don't break law tit maybe maybe not for sure I can give you other arguments against that time is limited I put my a in the front maybe if this ver wasn't yes brother very good I agree with you but because this verse is there Gospel of Matthew chapter 5: 17- 20 if you break one law one jot or tit you shall not enter the kingdom of heaven then you cannot under any circumstances where the Paul says that Thomas says that or Peter says that or anyone says that you understand this is how you understand logically so what you are doing just to upgrade Paul you means I'm talking about some of the Christians when I say you means Christian to upgrade one of the Apostles you belting that Jesus Christ God forbid told a lie which I cannot agree so this is how you study how you do comparative study So based on the comparative study what we say that if Christian is a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ please be upon him then we must Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves if you don't have Pok I congratulate you maybe after you go out of the auditorium if you're having alcohol you stop having alcohol if you're worshiping Jesus Christ peace be upon him maybe after you leave this a to him you will stop worshiping Jesus Christ peace be upon him as God so we pray to almighty God to give you and me guidance I'm very happy that before you came in the a you are not having poke maybe after hearing my talk you may stop having alcohol if you're having if you worshiping Jesus Christ peace be upon him after you leave this a you will not worship him because I've given you proof or you may go to your study room or go to a library and check up the references and then find out yes what that person that boy you know I saw a lean looking boy wearing a cap and the spe that a small weird lean person quoting quoting quoting fine what he said is right from today I will stop worshiping Jesus Christ but yet I'll respect him yet I love him yet I'll rever him I will read my Bible and find out that one more Prophet is going to come his name is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I'll read that book and you and I will come closer to the truth so we pray to almighty God to give you and me guidance hope that answer the question most welcome yes you're most welcome to give both those vcds hope you have vcd player brother the two vcds dealing with the talks similarities between Islam and Christianity so have easy references everyone can't remember yes most welcome sure sure you're most welcome"
