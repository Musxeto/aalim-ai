  "transcript": "we will take the last question my name is miss ba and i'm from pakistan and i'm doing bachelors in mlt my question is that allah is not the father of us then how come in the bible isa alaihi salam said that i will pray to my father and he will send you a comforter this is confusing me what you are referring to is a verse from the bible from gospel of john chapter number 14 verses 16 and i will pray to the father and he will send you a comforter whenever in the bible jesus christ peace be upon him uses the word father it refers to almighty god he is referring to almighty god so in the bible this word father when it is used by jesus christ peace be upon him it is referring to no one but almighty god in the bible almighty god he has got sons by the tongues ephraim was the son of god adam was the son of god all those who are read by the spirit of god they are sons of god so son of god it refers to a righteous person it refers to a person who follows the commandments of almighty god and many people they say that jesus christ peace be upon him he is not a normal son but he is a begotten son and they quote the verse of the bible in the gospel of john chapter 3 verse 16 for god soul of the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever shall believe within him shall not die but have everlasting life now this word begotten according to 32 callers of the highest eminence backed by 50 different cooperating denominations they say that this word begotten it is a concoction it is a fabrication and they've thrown it out of the bible that's the reason in the glorious quran there are no less than 99 names and attributes of allah that are mentioned the glorious quran and the authentic hadees but allah subhanahu ta'ala took utmost precaution not to use the word father that is up in arabic because he knew that people they would misunderstand this word and they would misuse it but in the bible this word is used and whenever jesus christ peace be upon him he uses it is referring to no one but the father in heaven and it is referring to almighty god so this was the time that we had today inshallah the remaining part of the session will be continued by my father i would like to end this session alhamdulillah"
