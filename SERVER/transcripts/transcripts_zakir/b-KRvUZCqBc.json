  "transcript": "is there any information that you need to impart to the viewers of Peace TV before we start this long series of interviews and question and answer sessions regarding Ramadan a date with Dr zakira alhamdulillah [Music] before we start this long series of episodes I would like to make my position very clear that I consider myself to be a student of knowledge I consider myself to be a Talib I don't consider that I'm a scholar to give fatwas Enough by some ruling is concerned and as far as this topic on Ramadan there are various issues and there are various difference of opinions as far as different Scholars are concerned as far as different schools of thought are concerned since there are only four verses in the Quran dealing directly with Ramadan chapter 2 verse number 83 verse number 184 was the 185 and verse number 187 there are indirectly another few verses but directly only four verses so most of the rulings are based on the Hadith and some Scholars I have used zaif Hadith some of you say Hadith so as far as what I'll be answering it will basically be the views of different Scholars only I'll be selecting those Scholars who I feel have quoted on the base of Quran and say Hadith so it may not agree with some of the viewers View which they used to our opinion should always be based on Quran and say Hadith when required I may give the difference of opinion different Scholars I'll name the scholars if required most of the times I may not name but I'd like to make it very clear at the outset that all the answers as far as Ramadan issues are concerned none of them are my own answers they are basically some or the other Scholars who have said it an Altima level best to name the scholars whenever required so that no one feels that I'm trying to give my own opinion but I always believe that the answer should be based on Quran and say Hadith so that Altima level best inshallah as far as possible whenever a code Hadith I will try and give the references whether some say buhari or say Muslim the volume number Hadith number so that people can you know check it up and as far as possible that is the Quran and that's my normal method of giving replies so that people let me know they get the answer they get from authentic so go down and say hey and whatever right or good that comes out from your mouth will be from Allah and whatever wrong and mistakes that come from my mouth will be from my side and from the side of the shaitan so I seek Refuge with Allah from sataniacus and I pray to Allah that made this series be beneficial for all of us including the viewers I mean"
