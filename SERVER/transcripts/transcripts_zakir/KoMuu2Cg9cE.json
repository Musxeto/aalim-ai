  "title": "The Islamic Scholars Dr Zakir Naik Refers to for Fiqh Issues - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "habiba malik from india can you list the name of reliable scholars who you turn to for fake issues so that we also turn to them for our fake issues this is a very big question the answer can go on for us together i will try and answer in short because which colors do i turn to for my fake issues you know scholars are divided into classical scholars the medieval scholars the contemporary the pre-modern the modern you know as far as the beloved prophet sallam said we look our shariah is based on the quran and say hadith on allah and the guidance of the prophet and a prophet said the best generation is my generation then the next generation then the next generation so after the prophet the best are the sahabas then are the turbines then other tapita bind so when you look for any in dalil number one is quran then the life of the prophet after that is the sabbath then so but naturally the best scholars for fick is fulfilled the sabbath then would be tarban then so when you look at what what was their opinion when they and there were different is an opinion among the sabbas and then we see the sabbah then we see which some sabbahs were specialized more in the quran some in other aspects some some in mirad then you have the classical scholars that are there you have the four imams the imam abu hanifah imam malik imam shafi imam humble ahmed humble may allah have mercy on all of them there were many imams 50 hundreds of imam were there at that time but these four there they were the students mashallah were were were able to spread the teachings more these four were the top imams there were other top imam also but maybe the student didn't prom promote the teaching so much so these were the top four imam that we have and all of them mashallah i love them i respect them i refer to them then then we have the muhammad singh imam there will be this was there but then we have an imam imam bukhari and i look up to them and then i check then we have the mufasari ibrahim then we have tabari then we have kurubi and the list is long therefore i said the answer is very can't give a short answer so these then we have the classical then yo saba then the classical scholars we have their level is different then we have webbing who who wrote the shura of the bukhari many then we have the i mean you can keep on naming but the the the one that i can recollect now then we then we have the medieval scholars you know a few centuries later then we have oh earlier we then we have imam anawi then we have after a few hundred years uh we have hypnotemia a great scholar then imam new jersey several then coming down the line we have the recent scholars you call them contemporary scholars they all call them the modern scholars i have divided this into two levels in two parts one which was a few decades earlier and i'm not living any longer and one which i live in in between there are many other scholars that did not name but what i could recollect in those scholars in the recent few decades but are not living i would the really that i appreciate and i'll look forward is the sheikh nothing sheikh nasir and unfortunately these three great scholars of our time you know when i mean the when we started doing dhawa earlier they they expired within a few years a span of few years in the late 90s or the early 2000s and after that at that time that i believe one of the best scholars living that time was abdullah nigerian check up the lebanese i met him several times and whenever i had any problem that to go to him and look forward to his reply at that time he was one of the best living scholars and allah also my lifted him mashallah and may allah grant jannah to all these followers who have mentioned may allah's mercy be on all of them rahim allah now that we have among the scholars really frankly now we have very few handful of scholars who we can really call them scholars scholars are many but we really can you know the the level of uh level of fake and the level of intelligence and the way to reply and to analyze according to me one of the best scholars to their living or two best scholars one would be sheikh mohammed hassan he's from mauritania but in the past few years he living in turkey in istanbul and i've been meeting him for several years alhamdulillah the last time i met him was at the kl summit and before that when i was in turkey he is one of the best living islamic scholars in the world as well as sheikh abdullahi's authority and the other one that i can think of and again is sheikh muhammad salim and all these scholars every year mashallah meet them many times for the last several years i've been meeting them except you know now some of them are in custody so since the last couple of years that they have been custody i could not meet some of them so these that i can think of today are the top scholars i know i refer to but you have to realize that there are different specialities for example there's a speciality of islamic finance in islamic finance previously i know i used to discuss with dr umar chaparra he's indian then became a saudi and dr siddiqui he's from india again and they were very well learned islam finance and the one that i gained the maximum knowledge as well islamic finance is concerned is is dr hamilton he's an egyptian he's yet alive but very old man allah gave him health and later on he spent many years in pakistan and he was the founder of the islamic university in islamabad in pakistan and he was the one who made the university of the director for many years i think he spent 19 years there if i'm not mistaken then he shifted to dubai and he is masha'allah according to me the father of islamic banking he was the chairman of more than 20 islamic banks has converted many conventional bank to islamic bank and the maximum knowledge that i gained when i sat with him for us together we also invited him to bombay for the islamic peace conference i think in 2007 or 2009 i don't remember so in terms of islamic finance knowledge one of the large one of the best scholars today living is dr ahmed usa nasan and the other one is is also a great scholar these two scholars are one of the highest in the field of islamic finance he's from pakistan and i met him a couple of times when he came to malaysia masha'allah he has great knowledge and what we find that in finance the hanafi's fukaha then a few scholars have done more advanced research on islamic finance as compared to others so each one has its speciality so in finance but natural i would believe more in uh uh uh buffmani or dr ahmed sallasan then sheikh the because that is the specialty each field like in loga according to me one of the best person according to me is dr abdullah dr fabi originally an indian then shifted to saudi arabia and he was the head of the lokar department in the starting when loka department for non-arabs started in the islamic industry medina and when i tried to find which is the best teacher i can learn with i someone told me it is fob the ring i said how will this person give me time so i went there and i was shocked he said you know i was there the lecture you gave a few weeks back in madina i was there on the city in the first row so masha'allah he agreed to give me five hours every day and we were supposed to spend six months so that's the time i talked about mahama my my my saudi student permit in the year 1997 and unfortunately i could spend hardly about three three and a half weeks with him there was an important issue in india to go back so for three weeks mashaallah i sat with him five hours a day immediately after the zohar salah up to the end of mangrip just before maghrib spent about four five every day and there were learnt he was one of my first few teachers mashaallah and the knowledge he has he has he knows about 70 to 20 languages the fluency here mashallah and then the other person has studied who's also great in the hadith is dr raman asked me dr ziaraman asked me again in the indian you'll be shocked to know he was a hindu then he migrated to saudi arabia he did his master the bachelor masters phd became the head he became the dean of the hadith department in islamic university of madina and i used to sit with him twice a week and my basis of hadith i learned from him mashallah he's a great scholar and he has compiled after he retired in the past he spent about 19 18 years in compiling all the say hadith in one volume and that was my desire when i used to speak in lecture after the quran and say hadith muslim but that's not all so what he did he spent about 15 to 20 years and compiled all the sayyad in one volume and called it jamaica and that's in that's printed in twelve volumes there's a mukta version of it which is in five volume and we are translating into english and you know when i say quran it's now all even if not hundred percent you can easily claim that more than 95 percent of the sahajita also then muslim also then abu dhabi so all these you can find in that he is so there are other scholars in the field of science is there like doctor muslim he specializes in science then you absolutely that's nani in science so they are very in terms of fake issues as i told you that there are many scholars there are other scholars also there are there many like uh he's also a great scholar but the one that i really appreciate amongst all of them is sheikh muhammadan and and sheikh he has his own own website islam which is the most popular islamic website in the world and most popular site if you have any questions the best answer you can get is go to islam q a it's in 14 languages hope this answers in short it's a very short answer you can elaborate for us together on this"
