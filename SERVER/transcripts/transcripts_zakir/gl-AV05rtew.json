  "title": "Is it Permissible for Muslim Children to play PUBG and other Video Games? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Manong hamachi from Kashmir India there is a very popular video game known as pop ji bu BG that is spreading all over the world and it has nowadays become an addiction to all people that everyone plays it continuously every day everyone plays it continuously every day mashallah recently the new updated version of this video game came out in which a person has to glorify idols in the game to gain repentant power if it Haram or she liked to play this kind of game or is it okay if any Muslim played this kind of game in which we have to glorify idols a similar question is posed by Abdullah from New Jersey USA is it permissible to play video games or first answer the second question and then answer the first question as far as video game that concerned there is a revolution in the past few years and past few decades I remember when I was a teenager maybe about 35 years back there were video game palace we had to pay some money and we could for a few bricks maybe I have a car so boards thought of video games which were they 3035 years back not that I was a fan of video games but I did play a few times in my life so those are games which is for entertainment and I feel there is no problem at all but in the passage of time today we find that there is a revolution and there's a lot of changes that have come and when you read articles about the video games unfortunately most of these video games they are the reason is that many of this video game they are mixed with elements which are prohibited in Islam I'll give a few example for example there are video games which envision there all of killing and the more number of people who kill the more marks to get and you become a veiner some of the killing the unnecessary it's murder and murder in Islam killing an innocent human being in the second mediation in Islam there are some video games which glorify witchcraft which is the third mediation in Islam there are some video games which are attacking Islam and the video game says that if you bomb Makkah then you get thousand points if you bomb Medina then you get fined at points and there are some games we show that there is a non Muslim country fighting with the Muslim country and the Muslim country is normally the weaker country and if you defeat the Muslim country you win the game so these sorts of games which ability Islam and after saving Islam and I gave the prints of Islam all these Ihara there are many video games in which there is nudity today if you have most of the car racing game and told and read articles in between you'll find ladies coming which are not properly dish they come in bikini they come in scantily dressed clothes bodies most in all this is Haram there is nudity there's opportunity even in sports you find opportunity invariably not there just to make the game more popular you have games in which there is gambling you have games in which there drinking of alcohol so all these things are Haram even though you may not be drinking yourself physically but virtually if it's involving or Haram activity that game is Haram it takes the children away from Islam and unfortunately unfortunately there are many Muslim parents who willingly beifuss game for the children there are scrutinizes of the game is right or wrong what's the problem he's not drinking what's the problem he's not killing anyone that just in a game these parents are actually taking the children away from Islam they are ruining their life if anyone would be responsible is not the child is the parents and today if they want to get rid of the child or they want to keep the child quiet they give them the mobile phone so that you know the child is busy with the mobile food and the parents can do what the they can do they can do their work on the social media and what's happening they keep mobile phone to a small child or four years I was happy my child can operate the mobile you are ruining your child what is so great in handling a mobile when he grows up and requiring even you know how to use it why give a mobile phone to a child and let them play this video game most of which are Haram so if you analyze today's video games majority they are involved most of them have what music music is haram in Islam there what such sound effects so most of these games if you analyze and if you scrutinize majority maybe more than 80% more than 90% or maybe a larger number I've done a survey but during the reports they will lead to Haram activities directly or indirectly so such game surely should be prohibited and should try and keep your children away from them as far as the first question was posed regarding a game called pob G of G the full form of pob G is player unknown battleground many people who play the game may not be knowing the full form anyway I don't play this game I just did because of the news that for the last couple of weeks a lot of news has been coming regarding this pop G so I just went and checked up the background this game is one of the most popular game in the world today it was launched in March 2017 more than three years back the trial version and the full version was launched in December 2017 about two and half years back and by the end of 2019 it had the maximum sale it sold till now it has sold more than 60 million games and only on the mobile there are 600 million downloads 600 million downloads that means somewhere close to 8% of the world had downloaded it and among the children it would be somewhere close to more than one-third of the children have one third or close to it have downloaded this and in this game this game mainly involves killing the more you kill the more points you get and we have to save yourself and if you are the last person alive the other winner this game can be played solo my 1% can be played up to 100 people you can play alone you can play with your friends you can play online you can even play in groups of two three or four then if your group survive your group is the winner it's an addiction and many of this video games including this pub gee it takes a person away from Islam there are haram i - besides that besides that if it is the time for salah and the prayer call is a father on the child continue okay nope and he misses the Salah and they may be chances that he doesn't miss he will pray at the last moment when the Salah is going to get Gaza just before the time for the next cell I pray the previous owner so all these things takes a person away from Allah subhanAllah this addiction is not only causing problem to Muslim children even a non-muslim children so much so that there are program that have been created for the addiction of pop G but the question mainly is talking about the latest version of pop G was launched on the 28th of April 2020 about one and a half month ago and in this new version a person has to glorify idols or literally new idol worship in order to get weapons or get equipment which will help them to kill other people so this is going to the highest level shake murder is the second major sin in Islam shield is the major sin in Islam so of course it's totally Haram beside the other aspect of murder of music of nudity etc idol worship with the major thin it is promoting idol worship so surely we should see to it that the parents are very strict they should not only not give babji should not give videogame there may be some games which may be Halle entertainment per se if it doesn't break the Sharia it is permitted there may be some video games which may not be having the element so there may be some Sharia compliant video games out in the market but the best is avoid the general game unless you are sure that it is Sharia compliant it doesn't break any of the principles of Islam I required the Muslim pair is not to be lazy and not to give them this game so that you know they can do their work without being disturbed you're ruining the life of children as well as your life because one of the ways for you to go to Jannah is a pious child praying for you so this game publish Wally schirra previously the many fatwa that Ferrum now after the new version where there is glorifying the idols including idol worship it's totally Haram and I request the Muslim parents and the Muslim children stay away from it and don't play this game"
