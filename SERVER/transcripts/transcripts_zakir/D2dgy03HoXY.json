  "transcript": "in islam men and women are equal and according to a hadith which is mentioned say bihari verb number eight in the book of adam chapter number two hadith number two a person came to the prophet muhammad muhammad peace be upon him and asked him that who is the person who deserves the maximum love and companionship in this world and the prophet said your mother the man asked who next the prophet said your mother the man asked after that who the prophet repeated for the third time your mother the man asked after that who then the prophet said your father in short 75 percent three-fourth of the love and companionship of the children are due to the mother 25 percent one-fourth of the love and companionship goes to the father in short the mother gets the gold medal she gets the silver medal as well as the bronze medal the father has to be satisfied with the mere consolation prize these are the teachings of islam in islam men and women are equal but equality does not mean identicality there are many misconceptions especially when women are concerned in islam many muslims are non-muslims they have a misconception which can be removed if you understand the authentic sources quran and the sai hadid correctly as i mentioned men and women are overall equal but equality does not mean identicality let me give you an example that if in a class of students two students student a and b they come out first and both acquire 80 marks out of 100 but if you analyze the answer sheet there are 10 questions each carrying 10 marks in the first answer student a gets 9 out of 10. student b gets 7 out of 10. so in question 1 student a has a degree of advantage than student b in question 2 student b gets 9 out of 10 and student a gets 7 out of 10. in question 2 student b has a degree of advantage than student a in the remaining eight questions both get eight out of ten and if you total the marks of both the students both get eighty out of hundred so if you analyze both student a and b are overall equal but in the answers to some questions student a has a degree of advantage in answers to some questions student b has a degree of advantage but overall both are equal similarly in islam men and women are equal brotherhood in islam does not only mean that the same sexes are equal the universal brethren islam means that besides race caste and creed even the sex are overall equal men and women are equal in islam but in some aspects the men have a degree of advantage in some aspects the women have a degree of advantage but overall both are equal for example if a robber enters my house i will not say that i believe in women's rights i believe in women's liberation therefore my sister my wife my mother should go and fight the robber because allah says in surah chapter 4 verse 34 that allah has given men more strength than the other that men have more sin than the woman so where strength is concerned the men have a degree of advantage so since they have been given more strength it's their duty to protect the woman here the men have a degree of advantage where love and companionship is concerned where children should give to the parents the women have a degree of advantage as i mentioned earlier the mother gets three times more respect and companionship than the father here the women have a degree of advantage but overall if you analyze men and women are equal in islam and for more details you can refer to my video cassette i had given a talk on women's rights in islam modernizing outdated it's part one that's the lecture and part two this is the question under session these discuss the issue in great detail and many misconceptions which are there in the minds of the human being have been removed here and in this talk i have divided the women's rights in islam and the six broad headings spiritual rights economic rights social rights legal rights educational rights and the political rights and i've described there that overall men and women are equal"
