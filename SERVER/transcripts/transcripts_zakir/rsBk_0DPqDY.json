  "transcript": "before I'm done I got involved in a major sin by having sex with a woman from escort service in Delhi I don't know how I got involved in this act I regret it now do I have a chance of forgiveness in this month of Ramadan I cannot sleep or walk or talk to anyone about my condition I got into zones of Blackness I am from a very religious family because of this I got frustrated I had no hope left inside me I am not getting any job by paying 5000 Rupees to this escort woman now I can't help myself I may commit suicide please help me out I would like to tell you brother that Allah says in the Quran that he is most merciful and most forgiving his most compassionate and one of his one of his attribute is he is most compassionate most loving and he's also forgiving and beloved Prophet said that you may do any sin as tall as the mountains as big as possible as numerous as possible if you repent sincerely inshallah Allah will forgive your sin and the prophet Muslim also said that Allah stretch it stretches his hand at night seeking forgiveness from all human beings who have sinned the full day and it stretches out his hand in the morning to forgive all human beings repent who have sinned the full night so my request to you brother is that you see forgiveness from Allah with sincerity and Allah inshallah will forgive you and there are certain prerequisites for seeking forgiveness in which case inshallah Allah will forgive your sin number one is agree that the sin you're doing is wrong and which I can see you've already done that number two stop it number three seek for forgiveness number four do not do it again and number five undo it if you can for example if you have robbed something then return it back but in your case I already have we already know that you have agreed it is wrong and inshallah you stop it you seek forgiveness from Allah and see to it you don't do it again and Ramadan was a very good month and I'm sure you might have asked for forgiveness is one of the night which comes once in a year every year and it is equal to a full lifetime as Allah says one night is equal to a thousand months now since he says that the one day in a week that is Friday is like Ramadan in the whole month and the one r on Friday that is one hour after assar where Allah forgives the sins of all those who ask for forgiveness is like the lies so I request you that you situate that on Friday one hour after assar before Maghrib one away Allah forgives all the sins you sincerely seek for forgiveness as well as every day in tajud the best time is the last one third of the night with Allah descends to the lowest heavens and he asks is there anyone who's there to ask and I will give is there anyone asking for forgiveness and I will forgive so these two times that is during the during the Jud in the last one third of the night as well as one hour after Assad on Friday if you seek forgiveness of Allah's mother sincerely inshallah Allah will forgive you and this is the beauty of Islam and the bigger thing that you do if you ask for forgiveness Allah and if you leave that sin Allah will give you a reward equal to that big sin so I pray to Allah tell me if I give your sin and I pray to it that you stop this act and you never indulge in again in your lifetime"
