  "transcript": "the next question I am Majid from pondicherry India my question is is it compulsory to do tarawi if not why they do in Masjid al-haram as far as concerned the right word is the prophet and the Sabbath and I'll tell you about it is night to stand up at night it means standing in prayer at night so the right word is when it is prayed in Ramadan because it is a habit that in Ramadan after every four akata after every two rakat we stop and we give rest so the word was coined as paravi not at the time of the Prophet not at the realm of Sabbath much later on so tarawi is a word later on coined because we rest in between the Salah that's the reason how the word was coined but why do they pray 20 a prophet peace be upon him said that at first is concerned as much as you can in cycles of two rakat the prophet said you pray that means there's no restriction on the number it should be in cycles of turaka the Prophet himself he always prayed in his full life the Hadith is that we have say Hadith he predator and then it becomes and doing Ramadan if you want to call it but there is no restriction he clearly mentioned you can pray as much as you want we have records that at the time people foreign the time when the duration is more important you can pray in multiples of two wine Haram because the majority of the Muslims in the world the hanafi about 50 percent and in their school of thought which is valid that they play 20 rakat so maybe the authorities of the Haram didn't want to displease and since it is permissible Not to cause a displeasure among Muslim ummah most of the mosque in Saudi Arabia but they both the hermene they have 20 rakat it is valid it is permissible the good thing about the 20 rakat in the harmony is it is wrong it is in a proper speed not at a frontier meal not at a bullet train speed like many of the most you have in other countries it's good you have the sohun you have the sahina you have the khushu that's more important hope that answers the question"
