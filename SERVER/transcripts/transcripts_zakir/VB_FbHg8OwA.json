  "transcript": "is regarding a woman who is pregnant or is nursing breastfeeding nursing raring the children why they Exempted according to the words of the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 that if a person is ill and traveling he can make up his prescribed periods of day of fasting later on so most of the fukas most of the scholars they say that these women who are pray pregant and breastfeeding they come under the category of those who are ill so therefore if they want they can abstain from fasting but there are clearcut say in which the prophet has Exempted these women from fasting mention in MA Hadith number 1667 that our beloved Prophet says the obligation for a person to fast and part of the prayer has been lifted from a traveler and the obligation for fasting has been lifted from a lady who's pregnant and with breastfeeding our beloved Prophet malli wasallam also said it's mentioned in in the book of fasting Hadith number 2 to 74 that Allah subhana wa taala had relieved The Traveler from fasting and half his prayer and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has relieved the pregnant woman and the woman who breastfeeding from fasting So based on these two Hadith also it's clearcut that the pregnant woman and the women who are breastfeeding they have been Exempted and The Logical reason that one can think is because when a lady she's pregnant or she's breastfeeding the food she eats is not only for herself it's for herself as well as the baby she's carrying or the baby she's feeding so but natural if her fasting makes it difficult for her or become difficult for a baby then she's Exempted from fasting but if she's in the early stage of pregnancy and if she feels or she's breastfeeding and if she feels that fasting will not cause any damage to her health and will not cause a damage to the baby then she should fast if she has a doubt if she can do it with hardship as long as there's no damage to herself to her health and the baby she has option to fast not to fast but if it's causing damage to a health or the baby it becomes Haram for her to fast because Allah subhana wa tala does not want to lay a burden more than what a person can bear and in this regard that the reason Allah has Exempted them later on when they're healthy when they stop breastfeeding or when the pregnancy ends after postn bleeding then they have to make up for the F they have missed before the next Ramadan"
