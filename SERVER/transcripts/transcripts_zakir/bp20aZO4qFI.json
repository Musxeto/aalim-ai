  "transcript": "what are the special Elements which go together to make a sincere repentance there are four things required number one a person should realize the power of Allah subhana wa tala his power and his greatness that if he wants to punish you he can punish you immediately so this will make person repent and we should not look at the minuteness of our sin we should look at the greatness forgiveness of Allah subhana tala as Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 71 verse number 13 and 14 Allah says that what has happened to you don't you have hope in the kindness and forgiveness of Allah subhana tala that he created you in different stages so if you know the mightiness of Allah subhana tala and he going to forgive you inshallah you'll repent number two everyone should realize that one day is going to die and he's going to go to the Grave Allah says in the Quran in Al Imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 Every Soul shall have a taste of death and on the day of judgment shall be the full recompense that means everyone has to die and the final the final recompense will be on the day of judgment and Allah says in the Quran in Sur chapter number 31 verse 34 Allah says that no one knows what will earn tomorrow and no one knows in which land will he die so we have to realize that everyone has to die and we don't know when will that time come so that will help us in repenting as soon as possible we don't know when is our last hour the third point is that all the rewards for this world and is based on your Deeds for what you're going to do for your the deed for will actually reward you in this world and the that's very important and Allah says in the Quran in Sur F 35 vers number 5 that the promise of Allah is true and let not this present World deceive you and let not the chief deceiver deceive you against Allah subhana wa ta'ala that means we have to be careful that all our acts and deeds should basically Target about the about the Hereafter and there's a Hadi mentioned in Hadith number 2320 where the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that this world for Allah subhana is equivalent to the wing of life and Allah subhana wa ta'ala would not allow a disbeliever even to have a handful of water from it this world in comparison here after is like a wing of life and you would not allow a disil even to have a handful of water a similar message is given in say Muslim volum number four in the book of paradise Hadith number 6483 where the Beloved Prophet said that in the sight of Allah subhana this world as compared to the Hereafter is like a person putting his finger that the four finger into the ocean and when he gets it out whatever stuck to the four finger is like the present world the present world just hardly some little water that get stuck to the forefinger that's equivalent as compared to the mighty ocean that is the here after so so little is the significance of this world as compared to the Hereafter so therefore we should realize that this life is the test for the Hereafter as Allah says in the Quran in Sur chapter number 16 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of his good and deeds the fourth point is that human being should realize that the punishment can be expedient in this world and whatever punishment they get it is because of the sin whatever Calamity takes place in this it is basically for this sin as Allah says in Z Chapter number 43 Verse number 76 that no wise shall we be unjust to them but it is they who have being unjust to themselves so these four points are very important to be remembered"
