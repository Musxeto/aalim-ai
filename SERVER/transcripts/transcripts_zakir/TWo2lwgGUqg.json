  "title": "How the Label Identifies and Protects a Muslim - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "every religion has a certain label the Christians their label is the cross the Hindus the label is the m or maybe a Vermon AA they wear on the head the Jews they were a small cap behind you can e identify this not Muslim cap it's a Jewish cap small cap every religion has a certain label but the community which should be appreciated which should be maximum appreciated for wearing the label is the sik community the SS they hardly 2% in the population of India which is close to a billion people less than 2% are six but they are proud to identify themselves as six always they wear the label you know they wear that turban which is a particular type of turban the way they tie it and they also have a beard they are proud to identify themselves as six and if any person wants to indicate that this human being is an Indian coming from India he will always focus on a sick for example if you see in a cricket match or any match which is going abroad and if they want to identify that Indians are there in the audience they'll focus on a SI though he's less than 2% he's not an Indian which is a sample Indian less than 2% a minority of a minority yet when the people want to identify that he's an Indian they focus on a sick because he's proud to wear his label irrespective whether he enrolls himself in the army or the Navy all the Air Force he does not give up his label and I was shocked that when I'd been to Canada I read a report that aik who migrated to Canada and was a citizen of Canada the Canadian government they objected that he cannot wear the turban in the Army he fought a case in the court and he won the case that even in Canada he was allowed to maintain his label imagine in can he wants to identify himself that he's a sick and he won the case we know many of the Muslims who when they go for a job and if the boss says you know the beard is a bit shabby I'll give you a job if you remove the beard and many of us next day will shave the beard it's a shame on us it's a shame on us the six a minority of minority in the world population it's insignificant yet they want to identify themselves as six I'm not talking about all the Muslims I'm talking about few Muslims who are afraid to wear the label it's a shame and our beloved Prophet Muhammad s wasallam he said it's mentioned s Muslim volume number two in the book of Salah Hadith number 1932 as well as 1933 and 1934 in three Hadith the Beloved Prophet said that when you go for the Salah for Salah of and the Raman and the which as we know here when you go for the Salah of this to take along with you the young woman as well as the menstruating woman as well as the PARTA observing woman even though the menstruating women they do not offer Salah they only supplicate take them along her Prophet said when you go for the Salah Take Along With You the children the young women the par observing women even the minating women even if they cannot pray what was the logic of the Beloved Prophet to command the Muslim umah to go along with the young women P observing women as well as the minating women even if they cannot offer Salah what was the logic the logic is that as We Know for the E Salah all the people gather on a one place especially in The Villages if two three villages are close by they gather in a eah a place where they offer e Salah together in the city in Bombay it's a bit different you know because it's a city it's a vast City it's difficult we can't go outside Bombay it's too far so we have the E Salah in various MOS but yet we try and see to it that the congregation is big but normally in the other places vill Etc you gather together in the open ground in idah for example if there are three small villages if they have a common EA so the Muslim when he come for the E Salah he sees 30,000 Muslims in these three small villages 30,000 Muslims the morale of the Muslims is boosted he feels proud 30,000 Muslims all gathered together you know you can make out that Muslims the moral is boosted and if a non-muslim when he sees 30,000 Muslims in these three small villages he will think 10 times before creating Mischief with the Muslims if he has to create any trouble for the Muslims he will think 100 times and simultaneously the moral of the Muslim is boosted that's why beloved Prophet said when you go forah Gather in congregation along with the children young women par observing women as well as the minrating women even if they cannot offer Salah for example if you're traveling a bus traveling a BST bus and Suppose there is a Muslim sister of us who's traveling a bus and if in that bus along with the Muslim sister sitting somewhere else there are about 5 to 10 Muslims sitting in the bus wearing the label wearing a cap and sporting a beard these 10 people don't know each other neither do they know that Muslim girl but if a non-muslim wants to create Mischief with the Muslim girl if he wants to create trouble for the Muslim girl for the muslima the non-muslim will think 10 times oh there are 10 people in the bus you know Muslims wearing a cap and sporting a beard he will sing 10 times before creating Mischief even if those 10 people are old people they can't even raise a finger even if they can't hurt anyone yet only seeing them he will think 10 times oh 10 people who are Muslims if I create Mischief these 10 people will pounce on me it does wonders wearing the label does wonders it does not only benefit you it even benefits your other Muslim brothers and sisters"
