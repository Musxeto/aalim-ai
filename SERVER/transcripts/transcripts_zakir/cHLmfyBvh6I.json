  "transcript": "could you explain to me what is the authentic method for performing the e prayer and perhaps you would give us a short description for the benefit of the viewers watching today as far as eid salah is concerned there are different types of muslims pray and their different opinion but as far as you go for the authentic sources the quran and the say hadith then you have one common method and according to the authentic sources of all the say hadith if you collect we come to know that as far as each salah is concerned whether they'll be idle we have to offer two salah two rakat salah two units of salah it's mentioned the hadith of sunan bahaki vomit number three book of jama salah hadith number 5719 umar may allah be pleased with him he said that the traveller's prayer is 2 rakat the other prayer is 2 rakha talking about idul ada and the jummah prayer is 2 rakhat this is the full length of all these prayers as it came from the messenger of allah that means allah should be two rakat point number two that before each salah there is no other and there is no karma it's mentioned in say muslim volume number two in the book of salah hadith number 1929 jabar bin samura he said that he prayed along with the messenger of allah both the eats on more than one or two occasions and there was no aadhaan and no akama that means for each salah there should be no other and no karma it's different than the normal congregation point number three that there is no salah before the each salah and after the salah there's no torah sunnah before after that and it's mentioned in the hadith of sunan abu dhabi volume number one in the book of salah hadith number 1155 where ibn abbas minlab pleads with him he says that the prophet came out to pray the eat salah on your fifth day and you offered two rakat and before that and after that he did not pray that before and after salah there are no other prayers further point number four when a person starts to eat salah he should say the al that's allah and then say the open supplication this is followed by seven takbir in the first rakat and in the second record he should say faith be this we come to know from the authentic sources of sunan abu dawud volume number one in the book of salah hadith number one one four five and one one four six we had aisha rather she says that the prophet when needs to offer the idol futher salah and the idol that means she used to say 7th takbir in the first akkad and 5th in the second record this is the authentic way of offering each salah after that a person should say ausbila him in a shirt and in the name of allah most gracious most merciful and then he should recite surah fatiha and after surah fatiha in the first takakat recite surakov chapter number 50 followed by in the second rakat surah kamar chapter number 54 or in the first akkad he can recite surah allah chapter 97 and second rakat surah gasha chapter number 88 both these types of first and second rakah have been proven from authentic hadith but even if a person recites any other surah any other version of the quran yet the salah will be accepted these are the recommended ones it is sunnah with the prophet recited furthermore after the eat salah there is a qudba of the allah it's mentioned say bihari volume number two in the book of tweets hadith number 962 ibn abbas manila episode me said that he has offered each salah with the messenger of allah subhanahu wa for muslim with and all of them they offered the it's allah first then was followed by all of them they gave the khudba after offering the salah it further mentioned in sunan abu dhad number one in the book of salah hadith number 1151 prophet muhammad after offering salah and before starting the khudba of eid he said that all those who want to listen to the khutbah can listen to the khutbah all those who want to go they can go now here's a very important point most of the times you find in the khutba of each salah most of the imams say they don't get up it is wrong and they prevent them from going and they say you have a sin and they say many things it's haram to get up etc imagine the prophet muhammad he gave the khutbah he said if you want to listen you can listen if you want to go you can go does it mean that the imam the quran that they give today is much more important than the quran it's a pity they say says said if you want to hear the bible the hadees if you want you can go but it's preferable to hear the khadbah but the prophet gave permission that if they want they can go and further it's mentioned in abu dhabi number one in the book of salah hadith number one zero six eight the prophet said that both the eids have synchronized the idle switzer and the friday friday is called as weak lead so those who do not want to offer the juma salah may not do it because the eid saline congregation is sufficient but we will offer the juma salah that means imagine the eighth prayer is so important in congregation so if it falls on the same day eid sallah is sufficient juma salah may not be prayed but if you pray it is good alhamdulillah but those who don't pray juma salah it becomes compulsory that they should pay the duhar salah this was in short regarding authentic way of offering the it's allah"
