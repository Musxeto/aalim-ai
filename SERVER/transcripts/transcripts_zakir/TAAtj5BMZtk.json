  "title": "Is it Compulsory to Learn Arabic Language to Understand the Quran? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "and good evening to my brothers of islam and non-islam people too my name is ramjay jayaraman i'm a technologist from usa having lived there for about 35 years and now the last three years i've been practicing spirituality with the motive of getting liberated while i'm alive i have read the quran i have one of my friends as my life friend for the last 45 years who is a true muslim my question here is first let me make a little statement and after that i will post my question in order to understand something either it is secular or spiritual we read the book when we read the book we read it with an understanding with that statement why was there a stress for about an hour of speech from your son that understanding quran reading it while understanding and a language saudi arabian arabic language was stressed because quran is beyond language according to what i feel and what i meditate on so the stress on every muslim to learn arabic kind of seems to me as compulsive is that what quran says brother is a good question he says that he wants to learn about speciality and he has read the quran but he fails to understand why was there a lecture given by farik knight my son on the stress of learning arabic to understand the quran and why is it compulsory if you heard my son's complete speech he never said it's compulsory for every muslim should know arabic he didn't say that knowing arabic is not a criteria to go to jannah because i myself don't know arabic i myself don't know arabic as a language show a little bit here and there i understand i don't know arabic as a language but my son knows mashallah he knows better than me he can translate the quran directly i can't but in his speech if you heard his speech he says that if you don't know arabic at least read the translation of the quran so his stress was quran should be read with understanding the question mark was al-quran should it be read with understanding yes or no and the answer was yes he didn't say a person should know arabic what he said you should at least understand the quran but the best way to understand the quran used to know arabic as a language whenever you translate any book when you translate any normal book the translation can never be hundred percent perfect it can be 80 90 99 more difficult language more pure is the language more difficult is the translation now quran is the most untranslatable book in the world so translation of the quran can never be close to the quran because the arabic language is so powerful and so pure and secondly it is the word of almighty god allah that is the reason the best to understand is to learn arabic or the language secondly if you don't know arabic the language then he said that read the translation in the language you understand the best if you know english read in english if you know tamil read in tamil if you know hindi reading in hindi if you know urdu read the translation of the quran so his stress was the bottom line was read the quran with understanding and the question is logical for a layman your question is that why should a person say that read the book or understanding it's understood that whenever person reads the book it is to be read with understanding but you failed to realize in the muslim community unfortunately as my son said more than 80 percent of the muslims are non-arab and they don't know arabic the language now there's hadith of the prophet who says if you receive the quran you get sabab so based on that most of the muslims when they recite the quran they recite in arabic but they don't understand it so it is the most widely read book in the world but it is also the book which is maximum read without understanding so my son was saying that after reading the arabic portion which most of the non-muslims don't understand at least read the translation of that portion in the language you understand the best so he was linked stressed that quran is the book of guidance it's the book of almighty god he's requesting all the muslims that besides reading arabic also read the translation that is secondly but the best is learning arabic as a language because if you know arabic and knowledge which is taught in our school which we started islam international school in bombay islamic then we find the attachment and the understanding of the quran is far more superior hope that answers the question"
