  "transcript": "morning Mr Zakir Naik my name is James Damani first of all I want to thank you for what you're doing here I've really taken a lot away from here I'm sure um my question is on your point number three actually I have three questions if you could be so kind but on point number three first of all I felt that you it was very evasive your your answer but what I'm going to ask you is very simple when you talk about terrorism when you talk about Islam now this is a very simple straightforward question I hope I can get a straightforward answer with what's happening in Pakistan Iraq Afghanistan just to name a few I'm not stereotyping I hope no one takes offense but when you hear on the news that a woman is cooking food for our kids and then a suicide bomber comes and kills them I want to ask you a simple question what is that is that Islam or is that people who don't understand what Islam is and they have their own perception of Islam and please let me ask you one more thing can you give me an answer that is not in World War One or something there were more people that died or this is all propaganda and these are Americans killing people and that was Germans yeah the brother of the question that the years in Afghanistan and Pakistan a woman cooking food a suicide Mamba comes and blows up and kills as far as Islam what the media is saying forget about it I'll give you ruling of Islam whether what the media says right or wrong Quran says chapter number five verse number 32 if anyone kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity any person kills any other human being whether Muslim or not Muslim unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if any human being says that the human being it is as though he has saved the whole nation so according to the Quran killing any single innocent human being is prohibited if a suicide bomba comes and kills a woman who's cooking she innocent it is 100 prohibited whether than in Pakistan or Afghanistan or America Dubai is the answer clear okay 100 wrong whoever was doing it whoever's doing it whoever's doing it whether namesake Muslim or American or propaganda whoever's doing it it is totally prohibited okay fine so is it clear answer that is clear 100 clear whether you do anyone does wrong yeah 100 wrong it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity there is no other scripture that I know of today there's no other scripture that I know of today that gives the statement that if you kill one human being it is as though you killed holyman except the Quran there's no other scripture that I know we say that if you say one human being you have saved the whole of humanity no other scripture perfect"
