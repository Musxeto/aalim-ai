  "title": "Are Muslims to be blamed for the Negative Image of Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign is he has said that in hindu philosophy we believe that the full world the whole humanity is like a family and everyone should live happily in the family earn money live happily enjoy life without this question is it similar in islam and he says surely in islam it will be somewhat similar and then he comes to this question and asks that this quran it should reach the full world is there a mistake in the muslims explaining the quran or is there a mistake in the people understanding it that today we find muslims are being labeled as terrorists as fundamentalists as extremists so what is the real problem as far as the first question i do agree with him that hinduism does say that the whole world is a family we should live happily earn enjoy islam says somewhat similar except for the ending allah says in we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other so the quran says that all the humankind has got one common grand grand grand grand great great great great grand grand grandparents adam and eve may allah be pleased with them both and allah has divided us into nations and tribes different color different languages so that you may recognize each other and the criteria for judgement in the sight of almighty god it's not wealth it's not caste it's not color it's not sex but it is taqwa and god almighty said most honored in the same verse of surah chapter 14 allah continues and says and the most honored amongst you is the person who's takava in hinduism he said that we have to lead a life happily earn in islam we have to lead your life happily yes but on the basis of sakwa the only criteria in which makes you superior it is taqwa it is righteousness it is god consciousness it's not money it's not wealth it's not sex it's not cause now coming to his question that the quran is such a good book is it that there's problem in communication regarding the preachings of quran or are we not able to understand that's the reason whether we're having this talk islam the solution of humanity the problem is in media portraying islam and we muslims it's our fault i do agree with you we aren't expert in media we muslim not to blame as it is the duty of every muslim to convey the message of islam to convey the message of the quran to the whole of humanity we aren't doing a full job we are trying we are trying a level best today the best way you can reach the masses now see the gathering surely hundreds of thousands i don't know how many but yet for us it is retail 100 000 is retail for me we believe in millions therefore we're showing live on the satellite channel and there's estimated viewership of more than 60 million people watching 60 million the hundred thousand two hundred thousand is peanuts i can give shahada to allah that we have delivered the message to humankind and sixty million is at least one percent yet it is nothing one percent of humankind if you accounted to be six billion what we want that we muslims should be more forward in media there should be more channels it should spread much more and i do agree with you there is a problem in understanding that's the reason as you mentioned that we are being labeled as extremists as fundamentalists as terrorists and my talk was based on that that how should it reply when a person says that you're a fundamentalist you're a terrorist you're extremist so hopefully inshallah you'll get the translation after this lecture hopefully hope that answers the question"
