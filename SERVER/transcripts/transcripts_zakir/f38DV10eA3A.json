  "transcript": "and of course after 2017 I've been traveling mainly to Muslim countries and yes I did receive invitation from several non-muslim countries but the closest that accepted it was in 2020 when I got invitation from Canada when one of the Muslim MPS in Toronto he invited me and said that Justin Trudeau was going to be the chief guest and he wanted me also to be one of the chief guest and it was supposed to be organized in April 2020 and because it was from the government side and from Justin trudo I had accepted the invitation but unfortunately covid-19 came and most of the countries in the world started being blocked from March onwards so by time April came the date that we were supposed to have the conference it got cancelled and that was the last that of course I received nut from many non-muslim countries but even there a there the country I won't name it that gave me invitation from the head of state from the president but my advisers told me it's not safe to go there even though I have invitation from the head of state please don't go because they may be close to India so I had to politely refuse but normally if I accept invitation it should be from the head of state and I doubt the UK head of state will invite me"
