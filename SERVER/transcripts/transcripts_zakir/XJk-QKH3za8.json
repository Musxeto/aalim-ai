  "title": "Spending the Nights of Ramadhaan in Non Ibaadah Activities - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "all the errors that I mentioned earlier were General Muslims throughout the world there are some errors which are made mainly by people living in certain country belong to certain culture for example in the Indian subcontinent there are people living in India in Pakistan and Sri Lanka during Ramadan many of the Muslims in the night they play night cricket and they spend most of the time in night Cricket rather than doing I of Allah subhana tala so this playing night Cricket is more common in the Indian subcontinent now if you go to the Arab countries especially the gulf countries there many of the offices many of the working places that is in the market Etc they change their timings they hardly work for a couple of hours in the daytime and they open most of the time during night so what happens it encourages people to do shopping in the night rather than the day and they get more business and they're inviting people rather in spending time in Remembering Allah subhana ta'ala Muslims spend their time in shopping and eating during night time and furthermore those people who are employed in the shops they forced to come at night time because it's the duty so these Muslims are even preventing their employees rather than remembering Allah subhana wa ta'ala they're involving themselves in business and spending most of their time in activities which are not according to the Sunnah"
