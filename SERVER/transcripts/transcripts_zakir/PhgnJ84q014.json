  "title": "Four Madhabs and why do they Differ? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question posed by Abdul Kareem from Lahore Pakistan if all the Muslims believe in the same Quran and the same Hadith then why are there for madhavs and why do they differ this is a very important question and a very sensitive question the principles the question that if the Muslims believe in the same Quran and believe in the same Hadith then why are they four madhavs and why do they refer I do agree that as far as the LSU novel jamaat is concerned major chunk of the Muslims all of us believe in the same Quran we believe in the same Hadith we believe after the Quran is the bukhari the most important then say Muslim is there then you follow that Abu dhab termed these four are the main collection and there's unanimous agreement foreign in regarding a question that why are there four madhubs and why do they differ as far as the four popular mother that we have today and we follow the four Emma's that Imam Abu hanifa Imam Malik Imam Shafi may Allah have mostly on them all I love all the foreign and I really prefall of them Allah and may Allah put all of them in general let me correct you first that these four madahib they came to explain to the Muslim ummah Islam in detail let me tell you that they don't differ always they differ really more than 90 to 95 percent all the former type are the same they may differ in some issues maybe minor issues as far as the major issues are concerned about Salah we have to purify times regarding zakat regarding all these are same in the minute aspects of Salah or if they be different there but there are minor differences it's not a major difference at all it is not worth fighting over it so let me tell you that 90 to 95 percent of all the former type are the same exactly they may differ in small issues and very few all these four eye masks they said that if you find any of my fatava any of my verdict which goes against Allah and his rasool which goes against Quran and say Hadith then you throw my father on the wall so all these four areas they were great Scholars and they came to explain the Deen to us Regarding why do they differ if we follow the same Quran and the same Adidas is a very important question and this question troubled me for many years alhamdulillah has blessed me that I have met many scholars from all this for motherhab and I interacted with many of them many hours and I spent time with them and I post the same question why do they differ and the replies they gave was there some less satisfying some more satisfying but there's no convincing reply for the masses meeting these Scholars from all this for motherhab my vision of Islam and the differences alhamdulillah expanded a lot Allah clearly mentioned in the Quran in suriman chapter 3 verse number 103. hold to the Rope of Allah strongly and be not divided we Muslims are supposed to hold to the Rope of Allah that the Glorious Quran and the say Hadith and all it's ijima all the Allah the Muslims we believe in the Quran and they say Hadith then why are the differences to explain to a common man I will give you some examples and always believe in explaining people by giving examples which they understand I would like to ask a simple question to the people who know English what is the spelling of the word color can you guess give the reply you can give the reply on the WhatsApp you can give the reply on the Facebook you can give the reply on the YouTube what is the spelling of color I'm not getting any reply what is the spelling of color what is the spelling of color some may say the spelling of color is c-o-l-o-u-r some may say the spelling of color is c-o-l-o-r which is correct a person who is well versed with English will tell you that the first spelling is the spelling of British English c-o-l-o-u-r is the British spelling for the word color c-o-l-o-r if the American spelling for the word color I am asking the question which is correct c-o-l-o-u-r or c-o-l-o-r and again you'll have different opinion some will say c-o-l-o-u-r-s correct if you're the British some will say c-o-l-o-r if he's an American correct but even if they differ you never find them fighting over this issue is correct I am an Indian we were ruled by the britishers and quite a large portion of the world was ruled by the producer so all those who were ruled by the britishers and we were British colonies we will follow British English and we will say the spelling of qara c-o-l-o-u-r the American will say c-o-l-o-r we agree to both a britisher would prefer c-o-n-o-u-r but if someone says c-o-l-o-r fine we agree to differ same with American he will say c-o-l-o-r but he agrees he believed that is better but he agrees with c o l o you are also similarly this is just an example I've given you how do you pronounce o f t e n how would you pronounce o f t e n some will say often some will say often previously well often then it became often now new people are saying often is correct T is not silent it should be pronounced some said t sand and then the big debate for that but we realize that both are correct in known ways similarly these schools of thought four that we have actually there were many tens and hundreds of imams and Scholars they were more popular or maybe the students made them popular there were many other imams many other sheikhs many other Scholars but these four their teachings became more popular maybe the students made it more popular and that's how we have these four major madahibs but all these four great Scholars and four amas they never came to bring a division in the Muslim ummah they explained their point of view because if it's very clear-cut in the Quran there is no problem at all the different comes when there is a difference opinion now why is there a difference of opinion I will discuss that previously as to think okay fine you know maybe the difference is some people say Hadith some people say that's the difference that is not the real answer that may be in some cases after meeting so many and Scholars of the different I've come with this example of the spelling or the example and pronunciation so similarly these mother have differed what is the major reason according to my study foreign that in areas where it is not very clear-cut Quran says no thick in it Allah says so no one will differ aloud or Not Alone where there is difference in understanding the Quran or the Hadith Etc then they fixed art so as far as the full effect is concerned there are different criteria for giving your ruling on fake some may have five criteria some may have six some may have seven some may have nine some have even ten I will not discuss in detail time does not permit and difficult for commitment to understand I'll just give a few examples for a better understanding number one difference is difference in the criteria as far as the first two criteria are concerned it is the same number one criteria in all madahib all schools of thought it is Quran number one there's no difference in it number two is all the schools of thought believe that number two criteria for fish if what is there are various different classifications of Hadith one of the classifications is depending upon the narrators the chain of narratives means the Hadith in which there are various chains of narrators in every generation that means that Hadith had been narrated by various many sahabas who heard the prophet say that then the next Generation turbine there are many turbines who repeated that Hadith so in every generation there are various many narrators so in one of the classification of Hadith it is based on narrators it is maybe a single chain of Hadith one narrator is there at any one stage only one narrator for example the very famous Hadith the first Hadith of he said that the prophet said your actions are based on your intention all you find this Hadith in bukhari in Muslim in various books but there's only one narrated it so if any of the stages where the stage of saba or other any of the stages of narration if any of the stages the only one narrator come in in all the Hadith it becomes so there are various chain of narrator but all the narrators end to um and then um narrated what the prophet said so it becomes it may be a mashoor Hadith if there may be two worthy narrators and it keeps of various category the highest category is that means several narrators at every stage that means every stage I have many narrators number is not fit has to be more than four or five every stage some are 20 some are 30 at every stage so number one is the Quran number two is all the schools of thought agree that the number two highest category of evidence after the Quran is third category onwards the third criteria of evidence differs in different schools of thought some fi criteria summer six summer seven some have ten criteria in some schools of thought the third criteria highest criteria of evidence is foreign some will say no it is chaos analogy so different schools of thought have different criteria in order first two is the same the third may be acai some may say no Earth the custom some may say class analogy other group the fourth becomes the fourth becomes custom in some schools of thought so form the third onward it differs So based on this difference some may prefer custom as a higher so if it is not there in the Quran if it's not there Hadith it is foreign do you give more importance to chaos analogy or do you give more importance to Hadith from third level it keeps on differing in different source of thought so because of that what you give more importance to differs that's how the ruling differs but all these ruling in a minor what we have to understand that we have to respect the ruling of all the four schools of thought because all the four schools of thought are based on Quran they are based on Hadith but the level of importance May differ some schools of thought say they may have a criteria if you are talking about Salah it should be because Salah the prophet paid in public almost all the sabbas saw him so if you give about Salah I will not follow if it is Salah it has to be evidence their thinking you may agree we not agree you may say no it's one Sabha reported it it is sufficient for me it's a say Hadith fulfilled the criteria it is sufficient for me other school of thoughts say no if it's other matter I will believe in such important thing Prophet paid every day five times a day it should be different opinion so how do you differ so the third and the fourth and the fifth level of criteria after the first to defer this is the reason why the major difference is there in the four schools of thought it may be difficult for people to understand number two the difference may also be that you may differ that whether it's a Hadith or not some message is the lowest level of Sayed some will say no it is not an evidence for saying something or something is Haram it may have other values so the scene May differ and when they defer the different mind with some message if Hassan is the lowest category of sahih classifying Hadith on the basis of whether they say they for mozu is another classification say Hadith itself there are ten types then comes if then comes time will not prompt details so the second type of difference of opinion in fig besides the criteria is whether the Hadith is human third may be difference in understanding the Hadith for example the Hadith of the Prophet Muslim that after Ruku the prophet stood and he kept his hands where they were so some schools of thought I'm not mentioning their names purposely some schools of thought say the prophet kept his hand on his chest before he went to Ruku the hand was the chest so after Ruku when they get up they keep them on the chest the other I must say no before starting the Salah where were the hands the hand were at the side so when they get up from Ruku they keep the hands on the sides so here you understand that the difference is because understanding the Hadith all of them but one agrees this Hadith refers to where were the hands before going to Ruku the other Focus agree that it was before starting Salah so different in interpreting so one is because of criteria which is the major difference number two is that difference in whether it's a science number three in understanding the Hadith similarly they can be a difference in understanding the quranic verse also for example the verse of the Quran says that when a woman touches your rubrics so one Focus grief the physical touch breaks Arabic word is coming from the word lamasa lamasa has got two meaning in Arabic one means the sexual touch one means a physical touch so one foka takes it as a physical touch and just physical touch breaks the other focus is no it will be sexual touch so physical touch does not makeup so the difference is that there in understanding the meaning of the verse of the Quran so because of these differences where there will be difference in criteria whether it be difference in whether if Hadith whether it's a reference understanding the Hadith whether the difference in understanding the verse of the Quran because of this the differences are there and these differences are minor we should not fight over it what we find today that because of the issue there are some people who just study for a few months or few years and they start saying that okay my freak is the best and is only right one which is wrong all these are great Focus we love them all we respect them all even they among themselves when they defer they respected they agreed with the view what they said my view I think is afzal it is better that doesn't mean you are wrong but today most of them you are wrong I'm right what I say even I am right to say I am only right is a big problem or you can say I think this is afzal this is better that you can say but today what we have no I am only right you are wrong because of that there is tension and there is fighting we Muslims should be United these are pet issues the differences are going to be there there were difference in the Sabbath we should not fight over it and we should agree that we agree to disagree we should not fight over it and all these issues are not on the major issues they are minor issues so I require the Muslim that we should be United and we should respect these eye masks and we should respect the scholars and see to it that we follow the Quran and say Hadith as close as possible hope that answers the question"
