was leaving this world he told this his fellow I'm going the Holy Spirit Will to end time sister do you know the reference excuse me I have really studied many many many many religions including H Islam Buddhism traditional and a lot of them even the Jewish the same but from my own observation every religion is talking about peace so concerning what this say that the only way somebody can have peace is through islamism you are right but that should be only only for the Muslims so that for those who are not Muslims they can still find Peace by doing the right thing because God is one and that is the concept of God so let us stop talking about religion politics let us talk about uniting our nation because this is the problem we having look at our good oil we have refin Aries and

problem no do know one you have a problem she told Jesus said I and my father our in Gospel of Matthew she's lying Jesus said in the Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 30 I and my father are one she doesn't know a Bible she she claims to be a Christian she's quoting a verse of the Bible and she's saying it's in Gospel of Matthew she's trying to pull a fast one she's trying to pull a fast one let me reply what is the context what is the context of Gospel of John chapter number 10 let the lady listen to my answer brother let her listen to the answer she has a problem she wants to give a lecture free lecture when she saw 20,000 people coming she wants to give a free lecture she wants to break the rules so anyone breaks the rule I clearly mentioned that the question should be ask in two or three sentences the sister quoted a verse from the Bible Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 30 I and my father are one what is the context I request everyone to be silent I request the people to be silent please I request the audience I request the audience to be silence are the people here Muslims of Nigeria are you Muslims so please keep quiet please keep quiet I want silence I want silence please if someone is talking about Islam please keep quiet mashah may Allah subhana tala reward all of you the sister quoted a she quoted a verse of the Bible she gave wrong reference what she said Jesus Christ peace be upon him said I and my father ofan my challenge was point out a single unequivocal statement a single unambiguous statement where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he says worship me I'll accept Christianity I am my father does not mean I'm God what is the context for the context you have to go seven verses before if you read the Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 23 it says Jesus Christ peace be upon Him entered the porch in Solomon's Temple verse number 24 the Jews surrounded him and asked him how long does make us doubt if Thou Art the Christ tell us plainly verse number 25 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said I told you but you believe not the work that I do bear witness of my father verse number 26 you are not my sheep therefore you believe not in me verse number 27 who follow me they listen to me verse number 28 no man can plug them out of my hand verse number 29 my father is greater than all no man can plug that of my father's hand I and my father are one what is the context if I say my father is a doctor I a doctor I and my father are one do we become one human being don't know English my father is a doctor I a doctor I and my father are one mean in purpose we are one we both are doctors so your Jesus Christ pleas be upon him saying no man can plug them out of my hand the followers no man can plug them out my father's hand I my father that means in delivering the message of God they are one nowh does it mean they one in purpose the sister does the context therefore I say I'm more Christian than you because I follow your Bible more than what you are following verse number 31 the Jews they pick up stones to Stone Jesus Christ peace be upon him so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him replies in verse number 32 many good works have I done for which of the good works do you Stone me verse number 33 we do not Stone you for any good work we Stone you because you blaspheme you being a man you call yourself God same thing like how the sister is thinking that Jesus called God so Jesus replies is it not mentioned in your scriptures 82nd Psalms verse number six if the word of God comes to him and if you call him God the scripture is not broken Jesus is telling the Jews who want to Stone him I'm not blaspheming if the word of God came to him and you call him God the scripture is not broken so I'm reading the Bible I'm following the Bible more than that brother more than the sister they are screaming screaming screaming she's saying Matthew Matthew doesn't say only and my father a one she doesn't want to apologize also I made a mistake she wants to keep on talking and wants to give a free lecture you want to give a lecture give an ad in the paper you have mass communication and see Omni turn up I doubt whether even 200 will turn up leave us at 20,000 so Jesus Christ peace be upon him never claim Divinity he never said I'm God"
