  "title": "Why did Allah give Hidaayah only to Cassius Clay, Sonny Bill Williams, Mike Tyson and some others...",
  "transcript": "the first question is from a non-muslim he's saying peace be upon you my name is ibrahim from new delhi the question is when people revert back to islam like cassius clay sonny bill williams and mike tyson and many more so muslims say that god gave them guidance hidayah so that's why they reverted i wanted to know why he god didn't give guidance to everyone why he gave guidance to some people and not to all and this is a very important question by a brother ibrahim allah says in the glorious quran in surah yunus chapter number 10 verse number 99 that if he wanted he could have made all the human beings in this world as believers so for allah to make hundred percent of the human beings now there are more than seven point seven five billion human beings for allah to make all the human beings as believers as muslim is very easy confess but the question is that we human beings are one of the best creations of allah and allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 67 verse number two it is he who has created death and life to test which of you is good indeed so this life is a test for the hereafter so when you are coming in coming for a test for an examination the supervisor cannot help you and even if you do something wrong can parcel i mean supervisor can can can see to it that you don't that you don't break the rules the teacher can give you grace marks but cannot pass you if you have failed and did not write anything or broke all the rules so in the same fashion regarding the question if allah wanted you could have made all the human being the muslim but then what is the difference all the other creation of allah except the jinn and the human beings they obey him so what difference is in this creation of human being regarding why does he select few people there are some criteria for allah to select who he guides allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 29 verse number 69 that if you strive in the pathway of allah he will open up your pathways that means anyone whether muslim or not muslim if he strives if he struggles in the path of almighty god allah he will open up the pathways all these people whether it be cassius clay whether it be mike tyson whether whether it be cast even if you read the history when when they were non-muslim they strive they like you if you hear the story the background of cat stephen was a pop singer now he's called issues of islam when his life was in ninja he said that if if you save my life oh my god i will dedicate my life towards you and then someone gave him the copy of the quran he read the quran and he came close to islam so if you strive irrespective whether you're a christian or a hindu or a non-muslim if you sincerely strive to come close to allah you will come close to almighty god allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala so the only criteria required for you is striving and struggling that i want to find the true almighty god and follow his commandments inshallah allah will get you closer whether you will read the quran come close to allah whether you will hear the lecture of hadaya come close to allah you may attend the event you may hear the azan the main criteria is you strive to come close with almighty god and inshallah allah will give you hidayah hope that answers the question"
