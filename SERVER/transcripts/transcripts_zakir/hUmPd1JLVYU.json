Sarkar it will start at 11:30 inshallah Malaysia time that would be the GMT would be 3:30 in Bangladesh it would be 930 a prime time in India would be 9 o'clock in prime time and park even 8:30 against prime time but in Malaysia it would be 11:30 and in Indonesia again we have a viewership would be 8:30 and inshallah it will be every Saturday maybe few times in a year due to my busy schedule we may have to avoid the live session where insha'Allah if Allah wills will continue throughout the year every Saturday GMT 334 one and a half are ask dr. zakir and this would only contain question answer session it will not have a talking in the third if you have question answer session exclusively mainly questions ask one comparative religion question asked by non-muslim question asks on science on other aspects on logical questions with the non-muslims attack Islam with so that the Muslims can continue doing the Dawa and propagation the second part of the question that how did I set up in Malaysia and relocated and maybe now everything is set up and we have a big team here let me tell you that in Malaysia at present I have only two full-time paid employees as far as the setup is concerned I am the director I am the dop director of photography I am the cameraman I am the light mind I am the setting man it is a last man out are you helping me and lastly I am also the speaker how we set up I asked no one of the staff to sit here and I go via and believe me we have got no professional equipment you'll be shocked to know that this program I'm recording is with my iPhone iPhone Levin maxpro the only equipment I purchased is the stand for my iPhone which cost less than 50 US dollars and the microphone which cost less than $25 that's it there was the time a few years back in 2015 and 16 we had the best equipment of the world we had 8k cameras 4k camera film cameras each camera posting about 250,000 US dollars more than a million ringgit more than approximately 2 crore Indian rupees and for Crowe Pakistan rupees one camera and we had 18 cameras all of it now is in custody of the NA of India the illegally they confiscated all the camera which what is the camera got to do with the allegations against me but this is how they want to stop the activity but I had this way alhamdulillah I am recording with an iPhone with this microphone of less than $25 and this kind of less than 50 US dollars there is no professional person alhamdulillah Allah has given me the passion for which I'm involved in many technical aspects and I was also involved as the technical head of the of the pitch TV alhamdulillah and I'm using that knowledge with no professional equipment with home lighting you can see that there are no shadows that's very important you may have the best camera in the world where the lighting is poor it will be atrocious here we have an iPhone and all this occur it is home these plans are from home this chair is from home the curtain is home there is no studio and while I was doing recording with one of the satellites he said masha'Allah your setting is better than the studio I don't agree it's better but it is good around Anila and if you cannot compare with the recording of pitch TV that was par excellence we had the best recruiter in the world but yet this recording alhamdulillah is better then most of the recording done by done for the Islamic program I have been to many studios of Islamic channels and Islamic organizations alhamdulillah some hamdulillah with all the limitations we have yet mashallah it's better than most it's not the best and what do I do I ask my my one stuff is I asked him to sit on this chair I go behind the camera I drew the setting we do the light thing and then see how much is the head face on top and then after that company he only pushes the button so this is mainly because of help of Allah and the support of Allah so this is just to show you that money is not the requirement for doing that and I always said this in the past and also saying by the our training program or the 10 most important things the least important tenth is money Allah this is the most important and in Bombay we had the largest private the organization in the world more than 500 pool full-time paid employees only in Bombay outside Bombay in India and 100 I was outside India another mini so total about 650 people Bombay alone we had more than 500 employees and now I have only 2 less than 1/2 percent yet we are and didn't even our I had were additional 2 staff on the social media overseas and maybe 5 stuff for the pitch TV network technically uplink that's it and yet we're continuing with our we are reaching masha'Allah tens of millions and increasing Bella's help so main thing required it Allah said we started organizations with $100 per month budget $80 sorry per month budget with a $1000 a year and in a span of next several years it became the largest and the biggest private the organization from the river so it's mainly Allah said and I believe that the help of Allah is increasing every day the difficulties are there but Allah has blessed means so much frm the first in life is concerned it is becoming better every day multiple death better than what was in India and Allah is helping us multiple times move and I'm even if we thank Allah billions of time trillions of times it will not be sufficient it has a mean for therapy it's only because of the grace of a las manos"
