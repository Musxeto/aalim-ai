  "transcript": "muhammad nadeem from pakistan the quran says none can touch it except those who are pure however we see that any non-muslim can type the quran does it not go against the verse of the quran quoted that none can touch it except those who are pure i do agree with the brother if you go at the supervision meaning of the quran what is referring to is the verse of the quran from surah chapter number 56 verse number 77-79 which says this is the quran most honorable a book well-guarded who none can touch except those of you if you go supervision meaning yes i do agree that non-muslim who's unpure can easily come and type the quran and the quran has proved wrong if you see the newsrule of quran when were these verses revealed it was revealed when there were allegations made by the pagan arabs against the prophet that what the prophet is getting the quranic revelation it is actually it is from the devil from the shaitaan knows bella so then this verse was revealed that this is a book most honorable a book well guarded who none can touch except those are pure so this verse is not referring to the normal mustafa the quran that we have it is referring to the quran in lohan mafus in the heaven that none can touch it except those who are pure indicating it's not talking about the bodily purity that if you're in vudu you can touch you know it doesn't refer to that it's referring to not only purity in body but purity of mind purity of sense total purity talking about the angels referring that no one shall be able to touch that quran the original tablet in the heavens not even the shayati not even the jinn except the angels and cross reference it says in suraburg chapter number 85 verse number 21 22 that this is the quran in a tablet well preserved so this verse of the quran is talking about the quran in the law force in the tablet well preserved no satan can go close to it like the allegation led that the prophet is getting these all these revelations from the satan knows bella none can touch except those who are pure totally pure talking about the angels this verse is not at all talking about the musa the copy of the quran that we have this quran of course a muslim can touch it with vudu can touch without also this verse is not referring to urdu talking about total purity a non-muslim can very well take the quran even a muslim it is mustaf for the muslim to be in vudu even without wudu a muslim can touch the quran it is not a father that a person should be in vudu though there's a misconception of among some of the muslims that you should have been with the quran it's not a fair it is abseil it is mustafa it is preferable but this verse is talking about the quran in lahi mahfuz the original copy it's not talking about the musaf the copy of the quran that we have today"
