  "transcript": "of quite equal importance actually is about how people welcome Ramadan with certain sayings Ramadan Mubarak some people say it's a bidder and others say to Sunnah what is your uh ruling on this to welcome month is good alhamdulillah and our Prophet always informed they're the people about this month and as I mentioned earlier that a beloved it's mentioned in musnad Ahmed ROM number two page number 230 Hadith number 7148 which is also repeated it is chapter number five Hadith number 2106 that our beloved his two always tell the people when the month used to approach when it is to come the prophet will tell the people in advance o people the Blessed month of Ramadan is approaching you and Allah has ordained for you that you fast in this month so the prophet used to welcome this month he used to wish other people the same way today if we wish as the prophet said the Blessed month is approaching if someone says Mubarak is more often said in the Indian subcontinent but Indians by the pakistanis because this word mubaraka is an Arabic word means blessing and it is nothing but blessed month but when the Indians in pakistanis when they use the word Mubarak it is more of a sort of congratulation when someone passed the examination they said so when Ramadan comes saying that it is the Blessed month or a sort of congratulating and wishing each other that the Blessed month is approaching means you can welcome the month it's a good thing that you're calling this month a blessed month and you're informing other people reminding them that in this month is a lot of blessing so according to me it's not Abida but how you wish the words you choose that is that's optional like in Indian subcontinent we use the word Ramadan Mubarak in the Gulf countries so all these words are good the holy month or the Blessed month or the month of forgiveness so the choice of words is yours but the prophet Muslim he used to say to the people that o people the Blessed month of Ramadan is approaching so I feel people should wish each other and they should remind each other about this decent month masha'allah"
