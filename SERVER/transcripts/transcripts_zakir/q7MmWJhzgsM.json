  "title": "Can I Worship God in any Form I Wish, as long as it is from the Heart? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yes brother Hind [Music] philosophy mam has the question that he's a Hindu and he has different types of worship he has no problem in any type as long as done with the heart for one good thing can in two different ways if both are right we agree with it now coming to your question that according to me and I said earlier here that Prophet Muhammad is highest highest means after almighty God I said that after almighty God is number one that is in following Commandments then comes the sahabas the companions so the question is that in their philosophy a person can rise to any level he asked me can I come to the level of prophet Muhammad never I can try I can strive I should try I can never reach why I cannot reach I know that he was a messenger of God why I cannot reach it is mentioned in the Hadi that the prophets on the highest level if I believe in God if I believe in the Quran and if I believe that whatever Prophet command we have to follow from the Quran and the Hadith we come to know that the highest level of the human beings are The Messengers I'm not a messenger why Allah is clearly mentioned in Sur aab chapter 33 verse number 40 that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is not the father of any of you men but he is the messenger of Allah and the Seal of the prophets Allah is all knowing full of knowledge after Prophet Muhammad anyone who says he's a messenger he has to go to psychiatrist why I have tested this book see once you come to know that this book in mathematics is authentic you have tested it then what the book say you have to follow unless the book is wrong so when the book of the Quran and the say tell me that no human being can reach the level of the Prophet if I start saying I can reach yes I should strive to reach now while striving I may come from lower level to maybe 20% High 30% 40% Closer Closer I'm trying to emulate trying and following 100% for example if the teacher has clearly said in English language no one can 100% why there are some rules in math you can get right so here we realize that when it's clearly mentioned in the Quran the Hadith that no other human being can come to the level of the messenger was chosen people of almighty God I will strive to come close I can come close but not on the same level that's the reason in your Hindu philosophy not only can we go to the level of messenger you can even go to the level of God and then if you become God people have to worship you right right or wrong so why limit that means believe in you can become God right or wrong can you become God can you become god brother why not God why limit there are limitations sh sh means mathematics sciencey sence dobs MD specialization of heart DM brain Bas I can become a full 35% 35% specialization differ huh Statics in 33 verse number 59 oh Prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the believing women that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested Brother David go and tell his wife that Bible says you should cover your head and maybe he will tell his sister or his mother that I just come to know that you should Dr up modestly like mother Mary so maybe he will go and tell his sister tomorrow or today or his mother and if he's married I don't know whether he's married or not will'll tell his wife that see this is what is mentioned in the bible modesty same is mentioned Brahma has created you as a woman therefore lower your grave and cover your head wear a veil if you refer to my video C said similarities between Hinduism and Islam have you seen it no please come to give one more vcd similarities between Hinduism and Islam to our brother and what I spoke about Christianity I can again speak for three four hour about Hinduism similarities and what we should agree what is different forget about it see brother both of you what Quran says inah Al Imran 3:64 come to Common terms and you see instead of arguing Bible is the word of God temporarily keep it aside whether is the word of God or not keep it you you agree the word of God fine you agree Bible is the word of God fine I agree Quran is the word of God what is common let us agree to follow simple what is different we'll think of it tomorrow at least what is common Bible says there's one God V says there's one God Quran says there one God there's one God Bible says don't do idol worship V say don't do idol worship Quran say don't do idol worship we stop doing idol worship Bible says that Prophet Muhammad going to come V says Prophet Muhammad is going to come Quran says that prophet M the last messenger we believe in Prophet Muhammad Bible says that be modest women should be dressed up should cover the head V says that Quran say that the woman should be Bible says don't have alcohol V says don't have alcohol Quran say don't have alcohol we don't have alcohol Bible says don't have F don't so at least let us agree to follow what is common difference come come what is common at least let us agree to follow say say"
