  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum i am urban my question is does iman increase and decrease iman can be divided into three types the first is the belief in your heart that is faith the second is the words or sayings of a believer the third is the actions of a believer iman it does increase and it decreases and the sahaba even their iman it increased and it decreased the sahaba they came to a beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him and they told that o prophet of allah when we are with you our iman it is at its highest it is at its peak but when we are away from you our iman it decreases so even the sahaba their iman it increased and it decreased now let's talk about the first category of iman that is the belief of faith the more we are in the company of good people of righteous people the more our iman it will increase we should be involved in good deeds in righteous deeds be in the company of good people if we do so inshallah our iman it will increase the same case was with the sahaba when they were in the company of the prophet their immanuel increased so we should see to it that we are in the company of good people the second is the sayings and the words of a believer we should involve in the zikr in the remembrance of allah allah subhanahu wa says in the glorious quran chapter number 13 verse number 7 verily in the remembrance of allah do hearts find satisfaction the more we keep our tongue moist in the remembrance of allah the more we will find peace and tranquility in our life and the more our iman it will increase so we should be involved in the remembrance of allah besides this we should also read the glorious quran and if we do not know arabic as a language we should read the translation of the glorious quran so inshallah our iman it will increase and there will be less chances that our humanity will decrease the third is the actions or the deeds of a believer we should try to do as many good deeds as many righteous deeds as possible if we do so our iman it will increase and there will be less chances that our iman will decrease among the righteous deeds that we can do is offer the five daily prayers in jama for the men which is very important fast in the month of ramadan give zakah there is no better time to give zakah then to give it in the month of ramadan such a great reward imagine you giving zakah in this blessed month of ramadan where in the gates of heaven they are open and the gates of hell they are closed among the other good deeds and righteous deeds that we can do is perform hajj stay away from all the things that are haram do as many sunnah acts as possible in ramadan we can offer the tarawih prayer and we should see to it that we offer wither prayer regularly because after the five daily prayers the most important prayer it is the wither prayer besides this we should also give voluntary sadaka voluntary charity even smiling at your muslim brother it is a charity so we should involve in good deeds and in righteous deeds and inshallah our iman it will increase we should try to be in the company of good people of righteous people try to involve in good islamic activities for example doing dawah involving islamic activities attending islamic programs etc the more you are connected to islam the more you are connected to the glorious quran the more your iman it will increase and there will be less chances that your iman it will decrease and we should see to it that we make our intentions pure any act we do it should be solely for the pleasure of allah and even when our iman it is at its lowest we should see to it that we do not commit anything that is haram even our lowest level of iman it should not lead us to commit something that is haram the sahaba their lowest level of iman was much higher than a highest level of iman the sahaba they could give their life for the sake of islam their iman it was much better in fact you cannot compare the iman of the sahaba to our imam so iman it does increase and it does decrease but the more we are connected to the glorious quran the more we are involved in good deeds and righteous deeds the more we do the remembrance of allah subhana wa tala inshallah our iman it will be at its highest and it will increase"
