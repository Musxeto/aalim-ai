  "transcript": "my question is regarding Insurance actually some say the insurance is allowed some say it's not allowed now I work in a company where by default we get insured myself my family and the spouse Etc and part of the salary is taken in as a premium so we don't have an option now in case there is a medical requirement can I Avail the benefits of insurance for myself and my family and secondly since this company has forced him into a policy of insurance from a salary so can you Avail of the benefit as far as the first question is concerned regarding is Insurance allowed or not per se insurance is not Haram it is option it's Halal Insurance per se but because most of the insurance they involve interest that's why it becomes Haram so business per se is but if the business deals with alcohol it becomes Haram if the business deals with everybody it becomes Haram the similar Insurance person is not Haram but because most of the insurance is based on riba it's connected with interest therefore it's Haram there are many Islamic insurance companies which I know you know by many there are many which I'm aware of so if it's based on the Islamic Sharia guidelines Insurance per se is allowed but in India also most of them which I know of now as far as in your case since you're working in a company and they say that you have to take out a medical insurance and they cut from a salary and then can you Avail the benefits see there are many things which are rules of a company which you have an option to Avail or not and some places you don't have option as far as medical insurance is concerned if the company cuts I feel if you go and approach the management and say I don't mind insurance but because it is Haram in our community please don't cut my salary first thing you have to check up with the medical insurance that a company has involved in is it haram Halal most of them are Haram so you can request them that situated that you choose a company which is halal see one thing in the life insurance a life insurance whatever premium you pay there are some Clauses to it maybe 10 years life insurance so you keep on paying a fixed amount of Freedom every month and if the policy matures after 10 years if you don't die you get the same amount back but if you die in between you make a double if an accident you may get more so depends upon the policy so this surely what money you give it comes back to it is surely interest based most of the others also interest based in the medical insurance you pay amount whether you get sick or not if you don't get sick you don't get the amount back so depending on what the policy is and what is the basis of it to give you money back because if they're giving you money for treatment they have to acquire from somewhere else if there's Islamic pooling where you say that everyone gives a thousand rupees and if there are hundreds of thousands of people and if one person gets sick you give their Med so that becomes halal but most of the insurance company don't work like that they take your money and they invest and they keep it in the bank and they get interest out of it so it's the money that's taken from you the premium taken from you if you've invested in a business which is not Haram then the policy is halal but most of the insurance company they keep it in a bank for safety and they take interest which becomes Haram so which medical company has your company taken the insurance off your checkup I know that I can't say 100 percent and if it's a Haram we're falling Haram category surely you can go and speak to the management and say let's see I know that it is for my benefit that if I give a medical insurance claim my money is being cut maybe a few hundred rupees but any problems so you can give in writing that please don't cut my medications claim and if any medical expenses I will pay for my own salary if you're given nighting or not whether any company will object now that's the difference is people don't go and speak to the management that way so there's no rule of the government that the company should take medical gain from you it is the policy of the company and if you're able to convince to the company they say My Religion it is we explain to them majority I think inshallah most of them will agree with the demand and there are many such cases which I have guided people in other aspects like offering Salah you won't request by one day accept it but speak in a good way that if you are taking a few minutes I will work extra for that situated that the work is not disturb seat to it that you bet output so if a performance is good the company will not mind exceeding to your request but generally taking a insurance policy of anything which involves is"
