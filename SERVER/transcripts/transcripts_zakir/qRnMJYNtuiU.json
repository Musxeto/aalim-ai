  "title": "Why do Certain Muslim Countries do not Allow Propagation of other Religions? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "sir my name is Gilroy from Bombay I'm a businessman and thank you for the opportunity to speak here I really enjoyed today my first time now many Muslim countries do not permit conversion out of Islam but correct me if I'm wrong I don't know of any non-muslim majority country which prohibits people from converting into Islam now what what is the right thing in Islam because as you say you know you don't need the sword for Islam and thousands and millions of followers will anyway get into Islam what would be your response the brother asked a very good question and a very important question that why don't some of the Muslim countries allow conversion or Allah propagation they don't allow the propagation to take place they're not allow conversion from anyone to convert Muslim to a non-muslim basic question whether it be anyone brother as far as the propagation is concerned there are countries for example Saudi Arabia which does not allow propagation the only country which I know very well which does not allow propagation it is Saudi Arabia and the reason is that suppose brother you want to start a school if you want to start a school you are taking an interview of a match teacher so when you take the interview of the match teacher you ask the question 2 plus 2 is equal to how much so one match teacher says 2 plus 2 is equal to 3. the second match teacher says 2 plus 2 is equal to four the third mad teacher says two plus T is equal to five now many people say what's the problem let them preach any religion who wants to accept let them accept I will ask you a question will you allow a match teacher in your school to teach two plus two is equal to three will you select the match teacher who says two press equal to five you say no I know maths I'm definite about it in match 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 and nothing else so as far as religion is concerned Saudi Arabia is very confirmed it agrees with the verse of the Quran in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse number 19. Islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of almighty God is peace acquired by sublingual to almighty God they will not allow anyone else to preach anything wrong but in science and technology they say to the Americans Helen was silent you're most welcome they get people from England they get people from India no problem in science and technology they're not number one for enzymes and Technology they have people coming from America from England from Singapore from Philippines from India from all over the world but as far as deal is concerned they are culture the hundred percent sure this is right same as your cultured that two plus two is equal to four you will not allow any wrong teaching same way I agree with that I must learn of compiled religion rather there's no religious scripture on the face of the Earth beside the Quran which says that this is the only true religion you read the scriptures of the Hindus you read the scripture of the Christian the Bible know what does the bible say that Christianity is right the word Christianity doesn't exist in the Bible do you know that the word Christianity doesn't exist in the Bible the word Hindu doesn't exist in The Vedas do you know that nowhere does The Vedas say that this is the only right religion nowhere does the bible say that this is the only right religion so Quran is the only religious scripture on the face of the Earth the almighty God says emphatically Islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of almighty God is Islam so as far as preaching propagating and religion is concerned I'm sure that if you know what is confirmed they will not allow anyone else to preach something which is wrong this India it's the secular country it's not a Hindu country it's in the Constitution of the people for the People by the people I am an Indian geographically I'm a Hindu because I'm an Indian but practicing Muslim I'm a practicing Muslim it's my Birthright in this country to preach propagate and practice this religion that is what is in the Constitution"
