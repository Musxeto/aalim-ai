  "title": "Was the Fatwa of Talibaan to Destroy the Bamiyan Buddha Statue Islamic? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "hello my name is b.d pak i'm a chartered opponent i would like to ask a question to you sir regarding the the ursula taliban regime issued a fatwa for the destruction of bamiyan buddhas terming it as an islamic i would like to know whether it is really an islamic and if it is one of the footsteps which the satan has laid and the muslims should be aware of brother asking the question the same question was asked to me in surat when i was giving a lecture talking surat just a couple of days after this issue it was very hot in the oven the taliban that were destroying rather at that time the statue of buddha bamiyan brother asking the question that is there islamic etc the same question asked by a non-muslim to mean surat that is it right or is it wrong at that time yet there were conflicting views whether they were destroying or not so again i said at that time that i don't know whether destroyed or not but today we know there are confirmed news that they have destroyed it whether right or wrong what i can say what i can say that i'm being a student of comparative religion whether right or wrong i'll tell afterwards what i can tell that surely the talibans if they destroyed the statue of buddha what they were doing is actually they were educating the buddhists i am a student of compared religion i have with the buddhist scriptures i have a dharmapad i have read the scriptures no way in any of the buddhist scriptures did buddha ever say make a statue of myself buddha never said that the buddhist worship it is a later innovation so what i could say as a student of compact religion whether right or wrong will come afterwards what they were doing is surely they were educating the buddhists and in none of the buddhist scripture is it mentioned that they should make a statue come into the question and this question was asked to me even by the press when i was in bangalore that just because islam feels idol worship is not allowed there are other religions there isn't christianity if you read the old testament it's mentioned in the book of deuteronomy chapter number five verse number seven and nine azeroth book of exodus chapter number twenty verse number three to five it says thou shalt have no other image besides me thou shalt not make any graven image of me of any likeness of anything in the heaven above in the earth beneath on the water above the earth thou shall not bow down to them not serve them for i thy god thy lord is a jealous god so even according to christianity according to judaism making images of anyone we say is god is prohibited same it is private in islam so when i gave this reply that they were educating the buddhists so what they said that but didn't these talibans didn't they cause grief to millions of buddhists i said yes so does islam allow anyone to cause grief to millions of human beings i asked the journalist a question that what if suppose the indian government catches a hall of drugs cocaine brown sugar worth 10 crore rupees worth about 2 million dollars they catch a hall drugs what will the indian government do so journalists told me the indian government will burn the drugs i said good i said do you know for millions of women in the world drug is god for them so will you agree with the indian government or go against the government that they're destroying the god of millions of drug addicts because the indian government feels that the drug will cause loss to the body what they're doing is right even though it's causing grief to millions of drug addicts but if they feel it is wrong they're burning you cannot go and tell the indian government that why are you burning the drugs a drug addict will feel bad so similarly afghanistan is their government it is their property see the statue is their property if they come and do something in any other country then you can object they are doing in their country it is their property if they like it they'll keep it if they want to destroy the destroyed who are we to object we can't object and furthermore if you analyze that people who talk they are the person who says that indian government is so tolerant do you know in bombay when you come out of the domestic airport of the santa cruz airport there's a big statue of mohammed of mahavir just outside the hotel jar and it was unclothed so the people took objection and then they built a wall in front of the private parts later on after a few months removed the statue now those same people who objected to the statue being there those same people today are condemning afghanistan why the same people who objected to the statue being on the road see and do you know there are more jains in india than buddhist in afghanistan so when the government of bombay could remove the statue which is believed to be god or believe to be the tritanka of the jains and there are more gents living in india than buddhists live in afghanistan at that time no one objected and now when the afghanistan government is doing your objecting why these double policies you know why because of world bank [Applause] won't the gen feel bad so if the jain believes in keeping a statue of mahavira who's a tritanka why are we objecting at that time everyone objected the statue should be removed statues should be removed and the same people objected we are condemning that why did you destroy the bamiyan buddha statue double policies therefore we as logical people should have a single policy we should not be too faced champion where we keep on changing the rules so what i feel that it is their property suppose suppose the non-muslim he buys the house in the house there is a carving of kaaba suppose if there is there if that non-muslim does not like kaaba and he defaces the kaaba how can i object if someone and believe me if if any muslim if any muslim if he makes a statue of prophet muhammad peace be upon him and if you disturb the statue even if the full muslim world is against you i dr zakir naik will support you because making a statue of prophet muhammad peace be upon him is prohibited if any muslim lunatic makes the statue of prophet muhammad peace be upon him and he worships it and if you being a non-muslim knowing knowledge of islam if you go and destroy the statue even if the full muslim world is against you i dr zakir knight will support you [Applause]"
