  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum i am from kashmir my question is is it halal to earn money from youtube by creating our own channel starting a youtube channel it is easy also starting a youtube channel that is halal it is easy but you have to see too that it is within the purviews of the islamic sharia we should not break any rules of the islamic sharia and coming to a question regarding earning money through youtube earning money through youtube it is very easy if your channel is popular earning halal money through youtube it is very difficult because you have to abstain from everything that is haram and one of the main ways of earning money through youtube it is through the ads and you have profit sharing along with youtube sometimes 60 goes to youtube 40 to the user sometimes 50 50 depending upon the popularity of the person and depending upon the popularity of the channel so if you start a youtube channel the ads that come on that channel it should be halal it should not involve in anything that is haram more than 95 percent of the ads on youtube they involve something that is haram they will either have women without hijab or they have music so you should abstain from all the things that are haram and specially these two things because majority of the ads they have either woman without hijab or they have music so you can very well start a youtube channel you can even earn money through youtube but you have to see to it that it is through halal means it does not involve anything that is haram and social media whether it be youtube whether it be facebook it can be used for conveying the message of islam you can reach thousands of people so you should use this social media the various social media platforms to convey the message of islam to the non-muslims to those who are unaware of it and if your niyah is to start this youtube channel to serve the deen inshallah you will be rewarded"
