  "title": "Dr Zakir Naikâ€™s Approach to Religious Scriptures",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] my name is Chan haridas uh by profession I am a lecturer but I also do uh cross religious studies actually I have prepared a question but that question is not so relevant to the topic today and because this question was in with me for many years so so I'm going to change the question that's relevant especially uh respected Dr Zakir have mentioned about the vas the pishat and all the some of the is panish but uh I like to quote a quotation here fromat bhagavatam Kento 3 chapter 11 text 35 which says puraya par the meaning is in the beginning of the first half of Brahma kalpa where L Brahma appeared then brahma's life there is a millium called Brahma kalpa the birth of Brahma the birth of Bas was simultaneous with brahma's birth so here it mentioned that Lord Brahma takes birth after birth and the VAS appeared when he take a birth so in a based on the literatures Lord brahma's Age full age is 311 trillion and 40 billion years and if we go in that calculation I think many of us here are bewildered but this is a quotation from shat bhagavatam another thing why I mention this because Dr Zakir have mentioned that The Vedas says that the Lord don't have a form but in the same vas also mention the Lord have a formed I quote another verse from Brahma samita chapter 5 text number one it says iswar isna he says the Supreme personality of God it Krishna is the Supreme controller is par Krishna sucha sat mean sat Ananda mean etal beastful and full of knowledge so he s Anand vigraha vigay refers to the form a transcendal form which is given in the vas I think uh when we do a research on the particular scriptures I prefer that we have a whole idea that the vas also mention about the the form and I have many other quotes which says that the the Lord have been realized in different forms which V are you quoting brother this ISAT bhagavatam bhat is not part of the V vas are for r y s yes I agree with that but Brahma samita is the commentary by Brahma don't call commentary quote the text if you follow the commentary of the Quran the commentary of Quran is written by human beings you quote the text as far as vas are concerned there were many vas today there R yaj Sam yes that we also 18an is you ask the question let me reply you ask the question let me reply okay as far as the Hindu scriptures are concerned the Hindu scriptures are divided into two types shuis and smti shuti is considered to be the word of God Revelation from God in it you have The Vedas you have the upanishad then you have the is considered to be written by human beings there you have the ithas Raman Mahabharat bhagwad Gita as part of Mahabharat then you have the manusi so between the two scriptures the shuti is superior than theti if there's a clash between a shti and theti you have to follow the shti not theti because shti is higher same way with the Quran we have the Quran then we have the Hadith if there's a Hadith which is not sah it clashes with the Quran then we keep the Hadith aside what we have to believe in Quran and the say had authentic saying of prophet m wasallam there are certain things which people are manipulated so when such manipulated Hadith comes what we do we reject it so now I'm quoting you Veda Veda is the highest Noti can go against the Veda if it goes against the Veda we reject theti we follow the shti this I'm talking from Hindu Scholars as far as The Vedas are concerned The Vedas speak if you read the sarasti the founder of Arya Sam correct in the V that only talks about God what got no image I know there are other scriptures like manusi and IAS in which it talks about God having image but a lower scripture cannot overrule a higher scripture when there is a conflict you have to follow the highest scripture that the reason I have quoted you Veda so if you get me a quotation from any book which is a smti it cannot overrule the shti point number one point number two even if you get me quotation if there's a cont ition in the Veda then why follow a book which has contradiction you take out one contradiction in the Quran Quran says inah chapter number four verse number 82 do they not consider the Quran with care that if there were contradictions in it it would never be from God if there is a contradiction then that book is not the word of God do you understand so we as students of comparative religion what we have to do I am here to talk about similarities I know there are many things which are differences in Quran and the Bible Quran and the V I'm here to promote peace and Harmony not animosity therefore Quran says come to come in terms as us and you I know there are many things which I don't agree with the Veda I'm not going to tell you about that why because that will create animosity so my thing what I told you let us agree to follow what this common what is different we'll discuss tomorrow so let you and I agree if you consider V to be word of God I consider Quran to be the word of God let us agree to follow what is common what is common is 100% the word of God according to you and me but if you selectively don't follow passages of your scriptures why be selective you tell me anything from the Quran which I don't follow I will say sorry and I'll start following I don't claim to be a very 100% Muslim but alhamdulillah as far as what's my capacity I try and follow everything of the Quran you point out a single verse in the Quran whether you believe the Quran is the word of God or not you point out a ver and inshah I'll follow the same way when I'm am doing the same thing with the Bible with The Vedas if the Christian believe the Bible to be the word of God if the Hindus believe Veda to be the word of God you have to follow I know there are contradictions but I'm not here to talk about the negative point of the scripture I challenge anyone to point out a single contradiction in the Quran there is not as far as the age of the Veda is concerned according to Swami Dan sarasti the Veda is 1,310 million years old but the majority of the scholars today of Hinduism say the Veda is approximately 4,000 years old today the scholars say we don't know to whom the Veda was revealed in which part of the world it came there are references Quran everything is authentic yet the scholars believe even though we don't know what is the exact age of the V even though we don't know where and which part of the world it came the first time even though we don't know which stage it came to yet the Hindus as a whole they believe V to be the most sacred because they believe I respect it I may not agree everything of it because I respect I try and take out the communalities so as I told you vas talk about of that God there are no images punishers talk about that vas talk about it so if you get me scripture which is lower does not contradict it cannot overrule the vas and if you tell me that there are vers in the v talking about then there's a contradiction so you as a Hindu you have to try and find out why this contradiction is that no book of almighty God if it's in its true form can have any contradiction same thing we believe Quran mentions injil the which was given to ISA Alam is the word of God but the present Bible I can point out hundreds of contradiction I don't want to do it I know I'm a student of compar religion so what I said the present Bible is not 100% the word of God it's a mixture it contains the word of God it even contain the word of the prophets it even contains the word of the historians it even contains pornography I'm sorry to say that it contains Oben things so me as a student of comparative religion I'm not here to criticize the Bible I'm talking about commonality let's come to Common terms if I try and criticize that will bring animosity there are certain p of the Bible I cannot read to you even if you give me a million dollars I cannot read even if you give me a million US dollars to me and say read this passage in front of the audience I cannot because my religion doesn't allow to read obscene things in front of the audience you understand now but I'm not here to degrade the Bible I'm talking about common things same thing with the Hindu scripture as far as the Quran is concerned the language of the Quran is so Sublime you can e anywhere in the world you can e to your wife you can e to your children you can e to your father other but certain passage of the Bible I cannot so your brother have come for communial Harmony and based on that I have done research on the Hindu scriptures on the Jewish scriptures on the Christian scriptures unfortunately people of most of the religion they blindly follow what is mentioned by the church what is mentioned by the temple what we have to do is we have to ask them for proof but if you're truful so that's the reason what Dr Zak says in Islam ISO chapter number verse number if I say alcohol is prohibited carries no weight Allah says in Surah MAA chapter number five verse number 90 alcohol is privated so based on this brother I'm trying to get the Hindus the Christians the Jews the Muslims together to come on a common platform and at least agree to follow what is common in the scriptures so that Universal brother will increase hope that answer the question but Dr Zak I think you're limiting the knowledge that is in The Vedas Vas contain all the knowledge that is what vas mean so if you say I only take the smti not the smti so that is limiting because in the uh the way that we are thought okay we are I'm saying there's not one word in the r say Hinduism so but always we talk about Hinduism Hinduism comes in the few thousand years ago only word is there is sanatan Dharma so I'm see you asking question I'll reply about every question requires answer which take few minutes I'm not saying don't follow smti but if there's a contradiction between the smti and the shuti the shti carries more weight for example you go to a doctor who's a specialist heart specialist who done DM in cardiology and a general physician mbbs who's talking about heart food will you believe suppose a mother has a heart attack after mbbs MD after MD is DM he DM in cardiology will you follow him or will you follow mbbs doctor for heart speciality suppose m the heart attack who will you follow the one I have faith with sorry one you have faith with who will have faith more as a logical person a DM of heart specialty or mbbs doctor even though a person can have higher uh no not can if you don't know both of them higher knowledge he had not experience but you have two people you have come first time to a country and one as DM one as mbb who will you take your mother to the one who have a correct so similarly when there's a contradiction between shti and you have to follow shti that's what the Hindu Scholars say not I anywhere in the world so you have to tell Hindu Scholars are wrong now now coming coming to your word see every time you're asking a new thing I have to clarify you said the word Hinduism is not there in the Hindu scriptures correct javah Neu Pandit javal Neu in his book discovery of India he says the word Hinduism is not there in any Indian literature until the Arabs came to India this word Hindu was given by the Arabs the Arabs gave the the word Hindu to the people who live in the land of the indas even today when I go to Saudi they call me Hindi Hindi Hindi so Hindu is a geographical definition the word Hindu was given by the Arabs people living in the land of indas so Hindu is a geographical definition for the people living in the land of the Indus Valley by geographical definition I'm a Hindu by geographical definition I'm a Hindu and a Muslim Indian Muslim Hindu Muslim but if you say Hindu mean those who believe in worshipping Idol then I'm not a Hindu according to Swami vianda Hinduism is a misn NOA the right word should be vedantist because they follow the vas Hinduism is a misn NOA it was a word a title given by the Arabs when they came to India and today also on even today when I go to Saudi they call me Hindi Hindi I'm a hindii and I'm proud to be a Hindi but I don't believe in doing idol worship so coming to Hinduism this is a misn NOA the right word is vedantist or can be S I agree with you and S believe that God is one and God has got no images show me one person who's a pure follow of Sal who says that God has got image that means you have not studied have you studied I'm still studying that's why I say still studying yeah you studying you have not passed mbbs also yet you have not passed mbbs also Quran says Quran say in chter number 16:43 Andia chapter number 21 verse number 7 if you don't know ask the person who's an expert so I hope that answer the question brother get for next question you can go behind the queue behind the other non-muslims thank you brother"
