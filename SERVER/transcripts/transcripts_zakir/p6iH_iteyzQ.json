  "title": "The Qur'an Mentions that the Sun Rotates about its Axis 1400 years ago - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "previously the European scientists they believed that the Earth was the center of the solar system and the universe and all the planets as well as the moon and the sun it revolved around the earth this was called as geocentrism and this was believed since the time of Ptolemy in the second century BC till as late as 16th century until Nicholas Copernicus in 1512 he propounded the heliocentric theory of the planetary motion and he said it is the sun which is the center of the solar system and all the planets as well as the Earth it revolves around the Sun and later on a German Scientist by the name of Johannes Kepler in 1609 he wrote in his book by the name astronomianovia that not only do the planets and the Earth the revolve around the Sun but they also rotate about their own axis and when I was in school I passed my school 1982. about more than 25 years back there I too read that the planets and the Earth the revolver on the sun and the planets and the Earth they rotated above their own axis and the whole solar system also in the Galaxy it revolved including the Sun but the sun did not rotate about his own axis in this context the sun was stationary but when I read the verse of the Quran in foreign each one traveling in orbit with its own motion so the Quran says the Sun and the Moon besides revolving they also rotate about their own access the Arabic word used here is yes bahun derived from the Arabic word sabaha which describes the motion of a moving body if I use this Arabic word yes Baha for a person who's moving on the floor it will not mean that is rolling it will mean he's either walking or running if I use the same word for a person in the water it will not mean it's floating it will mean swimming similarly when Allah used this the same word for a Celestial body it does not mean that it is flying in the air it means it is moving along with its own rotation it's rotating about its own axis so Quran says the Sun and the Moon besides revolving it also rotates about this on axis and today science have discovered that even the sun rotates since we can't see the sun directly you get blinded if you see directly if you have an equipment and have the image of the sun on a tabletop we find that there are spots in the Sun and it takes about 25 days for the spots to complete one rotation indicating that the sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one rotation imagine when I was in school I was taught the sun was stationary didn't root about phone access and the Quran mentioned 14 years ago that it rotates and now alhamdulillah most of the schools have Incorporated that The Sun Also rotates"
