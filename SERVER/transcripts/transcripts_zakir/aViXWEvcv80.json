  "title": "15 Point Action Plan for the Muslim Ummah when Someone Insults Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) - Part 4",
  "transcript": "the sixth action that can be taken is that muslims should take out a protest a peaceful protest against the blasphemy or against the act that has been done but we should make it a point that the protests should be peaceful we should not use any violence we should not damage any property we should not do vandalization it should be a peaceful protest and larger the numbers the better it is and we know that there were large numbers in protests have taken place in the past in various acts of blasphemy then in the past where there'd be salman rajdhi whether it be danish cartoon and now also just a few days back masha'allah people did take out large prostrations in countries like bangladesh there were more than 40 000 people larger the procession the better it is it should be peaceful procession and they should be a letter drafted depending upon what the act that is done wrong in this case it can be to the french embassy or the french consulate in that city a letter should be given to the consul general or to the ambassador that we disagree what the president of france has said against islam against a beloved prophet muslim there should be a letter of condemnation these processes that are there it has an impact the larger the procession the better it is and whenever such processions are called for we muslims should take part but see to it that it is a peaceful protest because larger the audience that you have the public that gathers the larger will the media portrait it will have a better impact on the people the seventh action that a muslim can take is that if that act is such that it is promoted by a particular country like the act what happened in the beginning of this month was by france by president macron then the muslims can call for a boycott of the products of that country and in this case we could see mashallah that many muslim countries mashallah they called for the boycott of the french products of french goods and services and alhamdulillah inshallah it will have a great impact on france and in this campaign that i did on my facebook i made five posts last wednesday or three days ago mentioning that we should boycott the products of france and the services and since i could see that most of the posters that spoke about boycotting the goods the products weren't mentioned in detail and the brands weren't seen clearly so i decided to select the 100 most famous brands of france starting from louis vuitton channel hermes and so on so forth total and the first post i gave the top 10 brands of france the second post the top 11 to 25 brands of france the third post the top 26 to 50 brands from france and the fourth post the top 51 to 75 brands of france and the fifth post top 76 to 100. so i divided so that the brands could be seen clearly and alhamdulillah the response was phenomenal in the first four posts that i gave on the same day the least it reached in a span of three days was four and a half million people mashallah and the highest post was mashallah more than 7 million normally on my facebook as i told you though there are 22.6 million followers normally when i give a post it reaches about 500 000 people 800 000 people if it's more popular 1 million sometimes 2 million but martial at this time though all the posts were similar one post reached more than seven million in a span of less than three days i checked today before it reached three days masha'allah seven million people read that message and the lowest among the four posts was four and a half million people so all these four posts put together 22 million people mashallah read this post imagine 22 million people that means average each post was viewed by five and a half million people as i said that when the campaign is done we should see to it that we don't leave all our activities i decided to do this campaign on my facebook for five days only because i'm involved in other activities we should not stop all other activities and all of us are concentrating on this for months together yes we have to take out some time maybe five days six days one week and then continue with activities and there should be others who carry forward which i will discuss later in my 14th point so banning the products has a great impact and when this was done in 2006 in relation to the danish cartoons against the prophet when there were 12 cartoons that were printed in the danish newspaper alhamdulillah according to estimate they went in a loss of somewhere close to 2 billion dollars and it has a great impact this is the seventh point the eighth point is that every muslim should contribute for this cause whatever he can if he's a rich man he can give a big amount even if he's poor he should not say that what will my few dollars do because if allah has given someone a capacity to donate 10 million dollars and he donates only one million dollar and allah has given someone a capacity to donate 10 and he donates 20 this poor man who donates 20 dollars will get multiple times more up than the rich man who has donated a million dollar so allah will see on what capacity has given you based on that so percentage is more important than the amount if allah has given you capacity to spread the message to a million people and you spread it only to half a million people allah has given a capacity to spread to 100 people and you spread to 200 people your saba will be much more than the other person so whatever you can contribute for the full course whether to have protest or whether to have programs to put on the billboard give it to organizers involved in this or donate for the calls whatever you can at least there's a sense of belonging that you are giving your hard earned money for this cause to the best of your ability am putting the points in the order that a common man can do and then going to those points which is difficult for everyone to do so as far as the first eight points are concerned almost all the muslims can get involved number one condemning and agree the act is wrong number two using the social media to spread it as much as they can number three you can distribute booklets or pamphlets on the life of prophet muslim number four pointing out this issue to the important people who they think are public opinion makers number five you can put billboards hire big billboards in important cities and put statements of a beloved prophet the hadith of the prophet what non-muslims said about the prophet statements of important non-muslim personalities how they praise the prophet number six is taking out a peaceful protest procession number seven is banning the product of the country if it involves the eighth point is that every muslim should contribute for this cause whatever he can depending upon the blasphemy and who has done it these 15 points will keep on differing"
