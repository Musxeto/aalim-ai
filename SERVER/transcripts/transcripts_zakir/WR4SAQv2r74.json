  "transcript": "we will take the last question my name is tawfiq alam from kolkata india i am a student i read that in surah taha chapter number 20 verse number 55 it is described that human being is created from soil but in surah ambiya chapter 21 verse number 30 it is described that everything which has life is created from water are these two verses of the quran not contradicting the verse of the glorious quran that you quoted from taha chapter 20 verse number 55 it says that we have created you from the soil and unto the soil you will return referring to the human beings that the human beings they have been created from soil another verse in the glorious quran it says in surah chapter 21 verse number 30 and we have created every living thing from water so are these verses of the glorious foreign not contradicting and another place in the glorious quran allah subhana wa saying chapter 25 verse number 54 that allah has created the human beings from water these two verses they are not contradicting and i would like to give you a simple example if i say that t it is made from water and later on i say that tea it is made from tea leaves it is not a contradiction because tea is made from water and tea is also made from tea leaves it is not a contradiction but rather it is a content distinction similarly the human beings they are made from water as well as from soil so it is not a contradiction but rather it is a constant distinction that human beings they are made from water as well as from soil they are made from both these components and allah subhana tala says in the glorious quran so nissa chapter number four verse number 82 affair do they not consider the quran with care had it been from anyone besides allah they would have found in it numerous contradictions so the glory is quran it is free from errors it is free from contradictions and allah subhanahu talaha chapter 15 and it is we who have revealed the quran and it is we who will guard it from corruption so allah subhanahu ta'ala he will guard the glorious quran from corruption and the glorious quran it does not have any contradictions no two verses of the glorious quran they contradict each other this is the miracle of the glorious quran it is the word of allah subhanahu ta'ala it is free from errors it is free from contradictions so this was the time that we had today inshallah the remaining part of the session will be continued by my father i would like to end this session and alhamdulillah"
