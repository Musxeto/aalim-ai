  "transcript": "[Music] alhamdulillah [Laughter] [Music] my respected elders and my dear brothers and sisters I welcome all of you with the Islamic greetings assalam alayum it's a pleasure and honor for me to be back in Nigeria after 10 years and this is my second trip to Abuja and the second trip in this volum stadium and it's nice to meet all the brothers and sisters of Abuja back again after 10 years before I dwell into the the topic of today I would like to speak a few words regarding our brothers and sisters in Palestine most of us know the history of Palestine and how was the Israel State formed we know that Hitler incinerated 6 million Jews it was Holocaust and these Jews they scattered to different parts and many of them they came to Palestine and our Muslim Brothers in Palestine gave them shelter they said to the cousins the Jews are the cousins of the Muslims the Arabs the Palestinian Arab Muslims they welcome their cousin the Jews they gave them shelter they gave them protection and they allowed them to come to the land but unfortunately several years later the same people who were refugees they kick out the host out of the land imagine the owner of the house is kicked out and now when the Palestinians are fighting for their rights they're screaming that this is our land these Israelis and the westerners they're calling them as terrorist there is a saying in Hindi that means the robber is scolding and blaming the policeman for the robbery he has done and we know this is common that those people who are in power they control the media and as you know the media can convert black into white day into night hero into a villain villain into a hero so today the media the international media most of them they are painting as though these Palestinian Muslim brothers and sisters who are fighting for the freedom they are being called as terrorists and this is common we know that in history and we know that the britishers the French the Portuguese they ruled two3 of the World they occupi two3 of the world and the biggest people who did maximum atrocities in the world are the britishers but they change the history and they tell we have gone to different parts of the world to uplift them they did nothing but robbed many countries of the world they looted many countries of the world including the country where I was born that is India and when people fought for their freedom we know bats sing he was a great Freedom Fighter these britishers at that time they called him as terorist number one but we Indians we called him as a freedom fighter we yet respect him we yet R him in the 18th century when britishers ruled America George Washington he was fighting for the freedom of America and by the britishers he was called as terrorist number one at that time but but the Americans they called him a freedom fighter and when USA got its freedom they made him the first President of USA imagine the person who was called the terrorist by the British government USA makes him the first President of USA so many times the person who subjugated is labeled by the media as a terrorist we have several examples we have example in South Africa when Nel Mena was fighting against the White aparted government the white aparted government called him a terrorist and imprisoned him in Robin Island for more than 25 years he was called the terrorist number one at that time when South Africa gets its freedom they make n Mandela is elected as the president of the country and we know this history on the other hand where the Freedom Fighters are called as Terrorist on the other hand the media spining the terrorist as great people we know that the bombing that was done in King David hotel where many people were killed many Jews were killed many Muslims were killed and Menin Bean at that time he was the person who did this bombing later on that same terrorist he is made the president of Israel the prime minister of Israel the terrorist and then he get The Nobel Prize for Peace imagine the person who was a terrorist actual terrorist later on the world gives them a Nobel Prize for Peace this is all done by the media the media can convert black into white day into night hero into a villain and we know since the last about one month the last four weeks when Israel is attacking Palestinian when the Palestinians are fighting for the right and they retaliated Israel with the best army in the world one of the best army in the world with the support of USA and many of the Western countries they're attacking the least equipped country in the world they're attacking Muslims in Gaza and Palestine and killing them in thousands and targeting civilians targeting hospitals targeting schools is against the international law today Israel is killing thousands of our Muslim brothers and sisters and almost all of them are Ians more than one3 of children more than one3 of women with the best equipment they're targeting innocent people if you go and Target the military we have no problem they are targeting specifically innocent Muslims in Gaza in Palestine and the world is silent what is the Uno doing just because some countries can put veto it's only a symbolic protest that's it unless we Muslims get together we will not be doing a job I've given a talk on 13 Action point plan 13 Point action plan for the Muslim umah for Palestine since this is not the topic of the day I will not speak about that in detail you can refer to my video on that topic but all Allah is testing us as far as the test for the Palestinians are concerned most of them are passed with flying colors those who have died they Martyrs they are Shahid Allah will inshallah grant [Music] them those that are suffering may Allah give them steadfastness may Allah give them peace may Allah give them Serenity it's beautiful to see that the mothers whose children are being martyred they are praising Allah alhamdulillah this is from Allah they are not complaining that thanking Allah that we have got an opportunity to serve the cause of Allah for Allah subhana waala to solve the problem of Palestine is very [Music] easy Allah is testing us as Allah says in the Quran inah chapter number 6 verse number two Allah has created death and life to test which of you do good in Deeds whenever Calamity comes it's either a punishment or a test as far as the people of Palestine are concerned it's a test for them and according to me when we are seeing the vide the social media alhamdulillah most of them will pass this test with flying colors what about the Muslim umah throughout the world today we are more than 2 billion out of the 8 billion population the Muslims are more than 2 billion we are about 26% of the world population are we doing our job do watch my video on 13o action plan for the Muslim ummah and it was four years ago in August 20 9 I gave a talk in kantan where mashallah in Malaysia where more than 100,000 people came in the stadium and it was so successful that the enemies of Islam in Malaysia could not digest the popularity and the impact so they started malining me some of the non-muslims in Malaysia especially those of the Indian origin they started malining me they started criticizing in me they started calling me a terrorist what I did the five main important people who malign me all of them were politician all of them politician one of them was a cabinet minister of Human Resources one was the deputy chief minister number two of pinang State in Malaysia one was the Member of Parliament very popular person and the other two they were member of legisl of assembly when they malign me I picked these top five people who were involved in malining me and I filed a case against them that was four years back in August 2019 and they were wondering when we speak about the prime minister of Malaysia one of them is complaining when we speak about the Prime Minister against the prime minister of Malaysia no one complains who is this Foreigner coming in a country and doing a case against us most of them they came and apologized and did outside Court settlement I said no problem but the biggest enemy of Islam his name is P ramaswami I continued the case with him and the verdict was on the 2nd of November just three days before I could not attend the verdict because I was called by the sultan oako and my talk was I could not cancel it but just before the talk a couple of hours before the verdict came by the high court of Malaysia that they asked ramaswami P ramaswami who was at that time the deputy chief minister too of pinang to pay a fine to pay damages to me of 1.52 million ring which if you convert it to us doll it is $320,000 us and if you convert it to to naira at that time the rate was 1,200 naira per dollar it came out to be 383 million naira and the court told he should give this fine within 30 days and when I got this information I pledged this complete amount of 1.52 million ring to the Palestinian cause I've donated this complete amount to Palestinian cause 1.52 million ring that is 320,000 usar that is 383 million naira may Allah subhana ta'ala accept this humble support from my side to the Palestinian Cause And I pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may he give steadfastness to the people of Palestine may he give them sa may he elevate them and may he remove the suffering and may he give the strength of the um to join together to see to it that they are able to stop this genocide in Palestine and I pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may he give the martyrs of Palestine J inshah"
