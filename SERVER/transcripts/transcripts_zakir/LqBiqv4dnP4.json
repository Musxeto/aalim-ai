  "transcript": "this is uh i'm so grateful to the irf that we get this opportunity to ask you some questions and for the first time i've seen you and i'm glad that i can ask you a simple question i am a businessman and one of my rather my only hobby is studying religions so one of them obviously being the quran so my question is fairly simple like i really liked what you spoke about aisha that was a very wonderful thing that you said so my question is fairly simple i'll make it very small but i really hope that i have the opportunity to cross question you after you answer me on your answer thank you so uh we see in muslim uh book number four number two and two seven wherein it says a part of it that is uh he stuck me aisha on the chest which caused me pain further down if you look at mishkat al masabi volume 2 page number 690 repeated again in muslim book number 9 number 3506 a part of it i'll just get to the point where an umar is trying to say to the prophet or right rather trying to make him laugh he says messenger of god i wish you had seen the daughter of kharija where she asked me for extra money and i got up and slapped her on the neck god's messenger laughed and said they are around me as you see asking for extra money abu bakr then got up went to aisha and slapped her on the neck and umar did the same to hafsah now we see something of a pattern coming in then if we just jump to quran chapter 4 verse 34 and those wives you fear may be rebellious admonish banish them to their couches and beat them now as i understand from your talk and that there is equal punishment for both man and woman i'm not contending whether they should be beaten or not my point is what is the right of the woman if the man is wrong because he gets to beat her up brother asked a very good question and i give you the right to cross question me after the answer is granted the brother quoted hadith of saying muslim and mishka masabi do you know the relationship between hafsan and umar well i've not really got to the point that much i'm still studying do you know the relationship of aisha i am asking a question are you married yes yes do you have a daughter two of them two of them fine i get to go to heaven sorry i get to go to heaven no if you bring them up correctly i remember with love and compassion then you'll go to heaven but it's caring just but that is only righteous did without demand you can't enter jannah so for you to go to heaven besides bringing your two daughters correctly you have to follow the laws of the quran and the say hadith and be a believer i understand that we'll discuss after answer to you i understand after understand sharla i'm asking a simple question suppose your daughter if she wants to jump from a 10 story building what will you do i'll stop her is she adamant what will you do point yeah so you get the point very good you should also jump no i have to go i want to fly like superman dad you are preventing me from being your superman what will you do well i'll uh i'll stop her obviously will you slap her or not if if required he says no to jump what will you do well i i can ask the other way around i'm asking myself i'm asking if you want to jump from the 10th story i will hate her if required not normally you'll say yes now our beloved prophet muslim said anyone who does not love allah and his messenger more than his own life he is not a muslim anyone who does not love allah and his messenger more than his own life he's not a muslim so there are many occasions what happened that sometimes they were disrespectful to the husband not a normal husband prophet muhammad there were many occasions it's not one occasion there are many occasions please with them and please with them when they came to know that one of the wives has caused pain to the prophet they were the father-in-law of the prophet but they love the prophet not only more than the daughter they love the prophet more than their own life there are many occasions which occasion you are referring to i don't know there were occasions when they came to know that my daughter has caused pain to the prophet of allah how dare she does it they being father they have the right to slap not you and me for us they are the muhammadin they are the mother of the believers but yet they were human beings even the wives of the prophet though they were wives of the prophet they are the best examples yet they were human beings and they didn't make mistakes like the i are recited by the khari so in chapter four i do they want equal rights the worst in surah chapter 33 where the wife of the prophet tells the prophet why don't you give us the luxury of this world they objected why are we undergoing such a life of poverty so allah sends a revelation if you want this world i will grant it to you but you will not get jannah the verse of the quran says i will free you that means if you want i will let you go free divorce not that he divorced and you can get the luxury of this world but you won't get heaven in the air after and the wives of the prophet they repented and they asked for forgiveness and allah forgive them so here also it's in context and going against the prophet is more bad than jumping from top jumping from top your daughter will kill herself that's it correct but going against the prophet is more bad did you get the answer sir but my question still stands i understood your point i haven't come to demand so okay you asked the question no problem my question is uh pretty simple i haven't completed my answer yet brother all right because i know your question was in two parts then you quoted the verse of the quran surah chapter 34 yeah and said about wife beating you on to complete that before you answer others say akira answered half i only answered one part of the question regarding hadith the second part is of surah nisa chapter 4 number 34 exactly after the verse that were recited by the khari afterwards which says that the men are the protectors of the women the verse says that if they're disobedient if they're disobedient then don't talk to her after that don't share the bed then the arabic word is daraba means beta lightly the arabic word is beat her lightly daraba abbas malala bps with him said when you beat your wife you should not beat on the face point number one point number two when you beat your wife there should be no mark left on a body and he gave an example beating with a miswak miss walk is toothbrush in modern way i will say beating with a handkerchief handkerchief now if you beat your wife with a handkerchief it is symbolic it is not wise bashing wife bashing in around islam wife bashing means one shot on the face hit so hard so that the mark remains she'll remember you for the next one week or two weeks in islam wife bashing is prohibited it is beta lightly that means first you tell her she's wrong you admonish her don't share the bed with her ultimatum last warning beater lightly now what i said for any crime committed the punishment is same punishment is same beating lightly is not a punishment as a warning can you do the opposite can the daughter hit the father what if your daughter slaps you will you like it no why equality let me commit man you talk about equality if your daughter slaps you will you like it no no there may be occasion when you get lunatic when you become very old and if you want to jump and then she slaps you i'll agree with her correct though you said no i'm agreeing you i understand i'm helping you you understand but you don't understand me i know i'm helping you okay if you grow up and you become a lunatic you become senile you want to jump from the tenth story your daughter says don't do father she may have to slap you she is doing in good faith accept it right now here where a husband is giving a warning to the wife if the wife does the same what will the retaliation be imagine suppose a big there's a massive person bodybuilder comes and axe measure with you if one small man come maybe you'll hit him a macho person anus watch comes and tells you something will hit him will you hit him no ah though you may have a lot of guts but arnold's questioning or no why similarly since allah says in the previous verse man has been given more strength than the woman so a physical warning a symbolic warning a man can give to a woman a woman can't give to a man a woman can't there are other things there are other things she can do such as such as for example if she has to cook food in the house it's the duty of the husband to get market she can refuse to cook if you don't get market i will not cook she can object very well chicken object saying i will not cook it's an objection on her part if for example he's not offering salah offering salah is important she can object nicely with love and affection my dear husband please offer salah then she may get a little bit angry also no problem getting angry with husband is not allowed unless it's for the sake of allah and his result but not physical she can't get physical if she gets physical there'll be retaliation it will never work imagine your wife slapping you will you leave her fine you may say jando so what do you realize this is a symbolic beating what the western media has done they portray to his wife bashing where's my passion you know hadith also so because of that islam is the best way of life it shows you how to lead life with your wives also hope to answer the question if you have any counter question your most welcome brother yes actually two points on that primarily the first thing that you said is a daraba which means basically tapping and as i understand from the hands were dictionary the it comes from the word idrib and now if you look at it the arabic word is used in two ways one to strike up a poem the word which from which the word darwah is taken out the first is to strike up a poem and the second which is used 12 times in the quran physical action of strikes strike off strike up up poem or poem strike up a poem metaphorically second part is the physical action of striking it's used again in surah 8 12 wherein it about an angel strike off their heads strike off the very tips of their fingers the same word is used so how can the same word be interpreted there as lightly but here as very long question the second part very good question very good question the second part is that if we come back to sahih bukhari volume 7 number 715 again the respectable i truly mean that respectable woman aisha a great scholar i read about her narrated aisha said that a lady came wearing a green veil and complained to her that is aisha and showed her a green spot on her skin caused by beating it was the habit at that time for women to support each other means when they get beaten up so you support each other so when allah's messenger came aisha said i have not seen any woman suffering as much as a believing woman look her skin is greener than her clothes that was my second part as the second part around so first and first paranoia is a second no problem she's complaining to the prophet that somebody has done injustice to her it doesn't end saying the prophet agree with it if someone has the injustice if you read ahead in some other hadith the prophet may have done justice too it doesn't say that someone beat her and the prophet agreed with it correct she's just reporting that maybe there is injustice done to a woman that's it the moment she's complaining means she's disagreeing with it she didn't say prophet i heard a very good thing i saw that the woman was beaten up the moment she's complaining means the wife has aisha mella beeps with her disapproved of it so the lesson we get from this is no one should beat the woman such a way that she becomes green but sir see the exact statement she makes is that i have not seen any woman that's aisha herself it's not my interpretation i have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing woman so we see at the time of muhammad that women were really in very very bad shape even though you know you know that is saying i have not seen a person a believing person like hazrat billah suffering what was he suffering from his master tortured him and said don't say there's one god and i will leave you hazard bilal may allah be peace with him on that death stone he's agreed to die he will say i will not denounce allah i will keep on saying there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger he's taking the pain that means if i say hazard bilal is a believer who is being tortured that does not mean that what act that being done may with him is right it is wrong but he is a believer who is taking the pain in this context we have to see the context and go to the shara you have to see father bhari and what was the woman was she what was she who tortured her was it the master was she a slave woman you have to go to the shahrah i'm not a mohaddis i'm telling you what the answer can be you have to go to the shuttle and find out why was she who hit her who beat her did the husband do what has been a believer there are 10 000 reasons excuse me volume 2. yes what i would like you to do there are so many people waiting at all the mics precisely concisely i would like you to put your question in a few words and then close because you've got such a big sheet of papers there are many people i see waiting with small slips or something so we cannot allow this whole thing to go on this is not a debate session it's a question answer session i want you to put your question in the next four sentences let dr zakir answer so that all the many ladies standing there here also get a chance we have exactly one hour 12 minutes left we have occupied 20 minutes already brother initially you asked two questions answered you said i want to counter what counter you gave in the counter you're asking one more question i don't mind answering a hundred questions but in this rule one question at a time go behind the queue no problem you ask two questions give the answer you send out a counter question with the counter question you're asking one more question so you know i'm very kind i don't mind i would love after finishing you can come in the cabin and inshallah i will answer all your questions i want to ask you after i answer your question what will you do will you believe in the religion i believe yes or no i yet have to answer your counter question well it's not just this one point there are many many more i'll answer inshallah all how many are there 10 20 50 100 how many well we can sit on that how many approximately well there are many more i have not how many 10 20 100 000 10 000 how many do you have now in your mind well i do have how many 10 20 30 how many probably quite a few maybe quite a few is how much five or ten approximately i don't maybe 100 questions 100 questions you have brother after this session is over we sit together okay write down all the hundred questions inshallah inshallah i will try and answer everyone okay i request you we'll spend the full night together i don't mind because you're a seeker of truth and i am also seeker of truth and my job is to try and clarify the truth not that i'm a scholar i will try and answer all the hundred questions but i doubt whether you will be able to write hundred questions i doubt coming to your main counter question brother that will be basically counter question counter question of yours is that daraba has got two meanings one is take off the head you ask me then how do you come to know which is correct correct exactly in the counter question don't ask one more question that means breaking the rule sir i'm just refuting what you said not refuting see you asked the counter question counter question was of dharaba has got meaning of striking that is the counter question in that counter question you asked one more question you can't ask one more question in a counter question you cannot one count a question but there was a fresh question that you asked now coming to your question of daraba you said striking i agree with you how do you come to know one time it is lightly beating one time it is stacking off the head you know the verse in the quran is there in surah maryam chapter 19 verse number 47 mary may allah be pleased with her she says when archangel gabriel says that you shall have a son so she says how shall i have a son when no man has touched me how shall i have a son when no man has touched me now if you go to the loka your hands wear dictionary all lanes i believe you read my dictionaries all these things are internet it's not difficult you go on the internet and type you'll get 100 questions against islam 100 you'll get thousands very easy not that a person has done research if you had done research you'd have come to know who was whose father and who was those husbands and mother everything but you go on the internet you get this very easy now the arabic word masa has got two meanings physical touch it means sexual touch so when mary mella be pleased with her she says how shall i have a son when no man has touched me it is understood it is not physical touch it is sexual touch correct yes similarly there are several verses in the quran now when there are two three meanings even both can be correct or one can be correct to have more details you go to the hadith hadith is the commentary of the verse of the quran correct maybe the same word has got two meaning in that words it means meaning number one in the second verse in mini number two hadith is the commentary so when we go to the hadith of this surah nisa chapter 4 verse 34 talking about daraba there the prophet said do not beat on the face do not leave a mark beat like a toothbrush i gave the answer but you were so much concentrating on the notes you have that you forgot my answer if you have heard my answer that if there are two three meanings all meaning may not be right maybe one is right maybe two right maybe all three are right therefore you have to go back to the prophet the quran says obey the messenger so when there are two three meanings you have to go to the hadith and find out what did the prophet mean by that word so there when says tax of that it means strikes off here it means strike lightly so therefore if you know the supplement in the commentary of the quran it's the hadith without the authentic hadith you cannot understand islam so a prophet said it means beat lightly like beating with a toothbrush don't beat on the face don't leave a mark on the body so these are the guidance given by rasool therefore it is obligatory that besides the quran you have to follow the authentic hadith hope that answers the question and inshallah i'll wait for you after 10 o'clock in the speaker's launch inshallah yes brother sheker thank you and since you have two daughters you said you have two daughters and you won't sorry and one son the son there's no hadith saying that son will take reject here yeah if he become the pious son and if he prays for you insha'allah even he will be a part of jannah what i want i want to see to it that besides good deeds you even have faith faith is one of the important criteria to go to jannah and since you have an urge to go to jannah to paradise inshallah i pray to allah subhanahu ta'ala may he make me the sarya the pathway to take rujana inshallah"
