  "title": "Can a Revert do idol worship initially till she reveals to her family that she has accepted Islam?",
  "transcript": "so my question is is it okay if she worships idols till she can't tell her family about Islam one more question is it okay if a man gives our trohman thank you either way is it okay that she can worship idols till the time she informs the family idol worship is the biggest thing in Islam Allah says in the Quran and sorry in the third chapter for 48 and it certainly sat up for 416 if Allah pleases he may forgive anything but the sin of Sheikh he will never forgive so I'd lower ship it's the biggest sin after doing sherek if you ask for forgiveness inshallah well forgive that also now that she has accepted Islam she should not do idol worship and it sort of must in the Hindu family they don't do idol worship every day if a family when it is a very pious and doing the rituals surely you can make an excuse and I want doing it if you feel telling your family is little bit risky now you can delay in telling maybe after a few days after a few weeks no problem but see to it that you stay away from the sins especially the major sin of idol worship can a man give Dawa to a woman yes as long as he doesn't break the rules of the hijab like I am coming now on the pitch TV on the Facebook on the social media and there are hundreds and thousands of ladies also watching no problem but if many people say that they want to do one-to-one Dawa with a man doing to a woman to a non Meryem that is not recommended and especially in a closed room and the Prophet said if a man and a woman the opposite sex in a closed room and there's no third person the third person is the devil so you have to maintain the hijab you cannot do one to one the hour you cannot laugh and joke with an Amira you can talk but we're lowering your gaze same length too much complicity in your voice so maintaining the hijab you can do best is through books or through social media hope the answer the question"
