  "title": "Do wet Dreams Nullify the Fast? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "another question for you is regarding a person who has a wet dream during the day whilst he's fasting is this an act which would nullify the fast is it permitted for a person to have a weight drinking the day whilst he's fasting if a person has a wet dream during the day while having a fast maybe offers rajasthan sleeps and he has a wet dream it is involuntary a person has a wet dream even if he ejaculates it's involuntary he is not to be blamed for that so in this case because it's unintentional surely it will not break the fast and he can complete the fast and the thing that is advised to him is that he should have a ghost a bath as soon as possible so that he can offer the salah that's excellent i think that's self-explanatory thank you for that another question very much related to the last one i feel um is a person allowed to be in a state of sexual impurity whilst they're fasting as far as the question that can a person be in a state of sexual impurity that depends if as long as it does not do any haram act during the fast for example it's mentioned in the hadith of muslim in say muslim volume number two hadith number two four five three it's mentioned that um may allah be pleased with her all the rights of the prophet she says that the prophet caught up from his sleep in a state of sexual defilement state of sexual impurity while he was fasting and he had a bath and he continued his fast further there's a similar message given in say bihari volume number three in the book of fasting hadith number one nine two five and hadees is narrated again by um pleased with her too both of the wives of the prophet and they said that the prophet used to get up in the morning in a state of sexual defilement because he had intercourse with the wife not because of a sexual dream and he used to have a bath and he never used to compensate the fast later on this proves that being in the state of june sexual defilement or sexual impurity does not nullify the fast even if a person has a red dream in between his fast is valid the only point to be noted is that the person should have a bath as soon as possible if he gets up in the morning after dawn breaks and if he's in the state of sexual impurity he should have a bath immediately so that he can offer the salah of fajr or if he sleeps after fajr salah and has a wet dream and then becomes sexually impure so you should have a bath at least before the zohar salah so that you can offer this allah after having a ghost"
