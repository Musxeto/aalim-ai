  "transcript": "is it permitted in supplication to negotiate with allah subhana wa taala the question is he goes on to say for example ask Allah to grant me something or forgive me and take something else away from me instead like my health for instance when we separated or last my house I'll have to remember that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala is mercy his beyond limits his mercy His grace we cannot limit the most of Allah Sobhan out then we cannot try and negotiate or neither can we ask a last mannered Allah to hit in the punishment or you know that you give me this good thing and take this away and they were negotiating we should realize that Allah subhanAllah less the most bountiful and most merciful and Allah says in the Quran in surah ghafir chapter 40 verse number 60 you ask me and I will answer pray Allah for the says in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 147 that what will Allah gain by a punishment if you believe and if you are grateful that means it's not worth negotiation las manos allah what we want you can ask him we cannot barter with him because he is so merciful in fact it will be our loss if we do that and that remind me of hadith of say Muslim vol 4 book of dhikr how did number six five zero one that works - Allah solemn he goes to one of the Muslims was sick and he goes to see and the person is very sick and he says as feeble as the chicken partner salah salem awesome that did you ask for something or did you beg allah for something so the person says yes i pray to allah subhanho wa taala that to hasten my punishment what i'm going to get an era let me have it in this world and then a last messenger says that you don't have the forbearance to bear the punishment of allah subhanaw taala in fact you should have asked rabbana Athena dunya has no Tawaf Allah the team has been talking as a banner therefore they quoted earlier that Oh Lord give us the good in this world and the hereafter and save us from the torment of hellfire so Bakara chap number two worse than me torn in one and after performance a Lhasa and prayed for him then that Muslim became alright so we should always realize that the bounty of allah subhanaw taala is beyond limits so whatever may be a sin whatever may be the sin we have committed we can always seek Allah's forgiveness and he is most of forgiving most merciful"
