  "transcript": "what is the purpose of Sunnah in Islam um isn't the Quran enough for guidance question mark As far as what is the purpose of Sunnah and isn't the Quran sufficient there are some people so-called modernist inverted commers they call them modernist the Muslim they say that is in the Quran sufficient wife refer to the Sunnah and they fail to realize that the Sunnah is the unavoidable second source of Islam the authentic Hadith of Salli wasallam his sayings his actions his approval are very important for us to understand the Quran and in fact the say Hadith the authentic Hadith the Sunnah of the Prophet is the commentary of the Quran there are certain verses which are there in the Quran which may not require any commentary the clear cut for example says Allah only to understand that simple Allah is one don't require a commentary but there are many other verses which without the Hadith without the Sunnah you cannot follow the verses for example the Quran says that a Muslim who is Rich he should give zakat the Quran does not specify how much percentage of zakat he should give only when you read the Hadith of the Prophet the Sunnah of the Prophet you come to know that if you have wealth gold silver money Etc you have to give 2.5% of that wealth as we discussed earlier if it's a farm produced crop then without irrigation 10% with irrigation 5% and so on and so forth without the Hadith how will you come to know the Quran does specify the people who you can give zaka to but how much to give is not mentioned furthermore the Quran say you should offer Salah certain things are mentioned in the Quran about suud about but the details aren't mentioned how many raat you have to offer Salah what are the exact postures of Salah where to keep your hand Etc so that you get from the Sunnah so imagine the pillars of Islam cannot be followed without the Hadith it's so important as Allah says in the Quran in Surah aab chapter number 33 verse number 21 verily in the prophet is the most beautiful pattern of conduct and that's the reason Allah says in several verses in the Quran including CH 4 verse 59 that obey Allah and obey the messenger that means if you have to obey Allah you have to obey the messenger and obeying the messenger is obeying Allah subhana wa tala therefore Sunnah is unavoidable there are some verses of the Quran where the commentary of the Quran is found in the Quran itself but many other places in the Quran the Hadith is a must for commentary for example I'll give you just a few examples for a better understanding Allah says in the Quran in Surah MAA chapter number 5 verse number 38 as to the thief be a man or a woman chop off his or her hand as a punishment from Allah subhana tala so that means anyone who robs anything anyone who steals anything according the Quran have to chop your hands but when when we go to the detail when we go to the Hadith when we of the Prophet we come to know it's mentioned in s bukari volume number eight in the book of H Hadith number 6789 the Beloved Prophet M wasam said that anyone who robs quarter of a dinar or more you should chop off his hand that means if he robs less than that then there's no chopping off hand imagine someone steals bread because they cannot eat so will you chop off his hand no and it's the duty of the ruler of that area the khif of the to look after his basic needs but someone robs for his pleasure Etc then it's Haram chopping is a must secondly where will he chop his hands from you get from the Hadi the prophet said you come from from the wrist other people think you can chop from the finger you can chop from the elbow you can chop from the upper arm where do you chop from from the Hadith you come to know it's on the wrist there are several such examples in the Quran a person can give where Sunnah is a must for example Allah says in the Quran Ina chapter number four verse number 101 when he travel through the Earth there's no blame on you if you shorten your prayers for fear of the unbelievers that they will attack you for the unbelievers to you are an award enemy now here the Quran Clearly say that you can shorten your prayer when you're traveling for the fear of the unbelievers that they may harm you Etc there's a Hadith which is mentioned in say Muslim volume number one number 1461 where one of the sahaba he asked Omar may Allah pleased with him that the quranic verse says that when you travel you can shorten your prayers for the fear of the enemy but now there's no fear of enemy so why should we shorten it now Mal be pleased with him he replies I asked the same question to the messenger of Allah and he said this is charity for you so accept the charity of Allah that means whenever you travel irrespective you have the fear of the enemy or not fear of the unbeliever or not yet you can shut in if the Hadith wasn't there the quranic ver only gives one type of reason but you can get the commentary in the Hadith from theth you come to the whenever you travel and then what's the distance then again you come to the had it is approximately more than 80 km you get that what is the distance where a person is called as a traveler then again you get the details in the Hadith so from the you come to know that whenever you travel more than 80 km then you call a traveler and you can shorten your prayers and you should shorten because that's a gift from Allah subhana tala it's a charity from Allah subhana tala you can go on and on give you examples I'll just give you one more example Allah says in the Quran in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 145 that I have only been prohibited to eat those foods which are mentioned in the Quran and the verse continues that which means that forden for you for Fooda dead meat blood the Flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides Allah's name is taken so by this ver you come to know that only these four types of food are prohibited all the others you can have but for details when you go to the Hadith there are several Hadith which say that even other types of foods are prohibited for example it's mentioned in s Muslim volume number three Hadith number 4752 the Beloved Prophet malli wasallam said that forbid for you to eat are the birds of prey those birds which have Got Talent which have Got Claws so these birds are prohibited which is not mentioned in the Quran it's mentioned that there are several Hadith mentioning say Muslim and S bukari that forbidden for food are the animals which attack others which uh Carnivor animals meat eating animals like tiger leopard cheetah lion Etc it's mentioned in say bukari in the book of fluttering Hadith number 5528 the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that for for you to eat is the meat of the donkey so all these things are not mentioned in the Quran you have to go to the Hadith from the Hadith you get the more details Quran is more of a telegraphic message it's very important very authentic alhamdulillah but for commentary you have to go to the Hadi that the reason Hadith is unavoidable and it's a must that's what a beloved Prophet said it's mentioned in Hadith number 319 that the prophet said that I leave behind the Quran and my example and my Sunnah so if anyone who holds to the Quran and my Sunnah he will always be on the straight path he will not go go wrong so that's the reason Sunnah is the unavoidable second source of Islam without which you cannot understand Islam in totality"
