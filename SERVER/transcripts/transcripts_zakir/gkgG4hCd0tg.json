  "transcript": "brother you're most welcome to ask any question I don't feel hurt at all I know you're not contradicting even if you contradict no problem brother it's my job I'm a d it's my profession you can criticize me you can criticize the Quran I'm young but I can take it alhamdulillah no problem brother I don't get agitated you can ask any questions no problem brother the question he said that when I said in my talk that you cannot kill for pleasure of hunting I said for pleasure hunting you cannot kill any animal just without any purpose pleasure of hunting we don't eat nonv only for Taste we eat for our sustainance so if you say we can't eat animals we can't eat plants also what will eat how will we survive how will we survive so graif for you I'm not asking if I'm eating it for necessity suppose I think okay this animal food is going to be tasty I want to kill it for my personal pleasure alone not I'm feeling of hunger nothing is it also a sin if it's for eating for eating tasty food also no problem you have to eat if if you don't e you can't survive if you don't eat you can't survive so almighty God as mentioned Manus smiti chapter number 5 verse number 30 some animals have been created to eat some to be eat I not read no but I have read it not interested in KN about that I'm just asking your point of view is it wrong point of view is it wrong to kill animal on the basis of just merely taste pleasure it is not wrong at all to kill an animal even if you want to have tasty as long as it is for food okay thank you why because Quran gives permission in Sur ma ch verse number one manusi gives you don't want to know but I want to tell people that I believe in this part of manusi other part I may not believe but this part of Manus believe Chapter 5: 30 that almighty God created some animals to eat some to be eaten so if you eat the animals which have been created to be eaten you're not doing a sin similarly Quran also says certain animals have been created to be eaten but if you eat the other animals which have not been created for eating then it's a sin so those cattles like sheep Etc which are permitted in the Quran that if you eat for food even if it's tasty food no problem some people want to have vegetable tasty vegetable some people like bringol some people like ladyy finger so no problem if I agree with you that nothing should be eaten then you will have to kill either the plant or the animal so while eating if you're eating good things as long as you're not wasting if you waste food it is wrong if you waste food it is wrong so if you kill for eating for sustainance even if it's tasty no problem it's permitted it's mentioned in the Quran 5 vers number one Sur N 16 vers number 5 as well as Sur M 23: 211 hope that answer the question"
