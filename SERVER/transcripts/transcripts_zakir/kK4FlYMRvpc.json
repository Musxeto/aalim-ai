  "transcript": "now leading on from the definitions of the terms and the fact that we know it's now compulsory upon us what are the best methods during these testing times let's say for Muslims I mean I don't know if it's any more or less testing than it was 100 years ago to be honest but because I wasn't alive then but I think that we need to know during this particular time with these particular attacks on Islam that you see prevalent in the media what are the best methods that we can utilize in order to give da to non-muslims there are many strategies and various methodologies that can be used for doing dawa some are less effective while the others are more effective the most common method used is that whenever a Muslim meets a non-muslim he speaks a 100 good things the word Islam even if the non-muslim agrees with the 100 points that have been mentioned to him regarding Islam yet he will have a few negative points at the back of his mind he will say ah you are the same Muslim who is a fundamentalist ah you're the same Muslim who a terrorist you are the same Muslim who marries more than one woman oh you are the people who subjugate The Woman by keeping up behind the whale these few negative points at the back of his mind will prevent him from accepting the beauty of Islam that's the reason whenever I meet a non-muslim I ask him up front I ask him the first question what do you feel is wrong with Islam with your limited knowledge whether right or wrong what do you feel is wrong with Islam and I make him comfortable he can criticize Islam he can attack Islam he can criticize the Quran and I make him comfortable that he can ask any question what does he feel is wrong with the religion of Islam and after I make him comfortable he poses about four or five questions and more than past 50 years that I've been in the field of dawa I have realized that there are about 20 most common questions that are asked by the non-muslims and when we post to a non-muslim what does he feel is wrong with Islam he asks four or five questions and invariably it falls amongst these 20 most common questions now how have these 20 most common questions come about they have come about in the mind of non-muslim depending upon how the media portrays Islam today we have on the international media in the international newspapers International magazines international radio broadcast stations internation satellite channels we find that there is virent propaganda about Islam they are bombarding misinformation about Islam so depending upon how the media portray Islam these 20 common questions arise in the mind of a non-muslim a couple of decades earlier these 20 questions were different maybe a couple of decades later these 20 common questions will change depending upon how the media portrays Islam these questions arise in the mind of a non-muslim and I always say that if every Muslim knows the logical reason and the scientific reason regarding the answers to these questions with the quotation from Quran Hadith and other Rel scriptures even if he cannot convert the non-muslim at least he can neutralize the animosity which is there in the mind of the non-muslim it will be the best tool and I've written a book on this topic answers to most common questions are been nonm Muslims and if a person memorizes this inshallah he will be able to remove the animosity from the minds of the non-muslims regarding Islam inshallah that's excellent and uh may it continue to be a benefit all of this knowledge which uh you've uh alhamdulillah been able to move forward in the field of da inshallah"
