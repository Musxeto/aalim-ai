  "title": "Can we Eat Iftaar in a Personâ€™s House whose Earnings are Haraam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "if a person's earnings are known to be haram can we accept his iftar invitation there's no hadith saying that you cannot accept the invitation of iftar of a person who has unlawful earning in fact there are hadith showing that prophet muslim he went to the meal when invited by the jews and the quran said the jews used to involve themselves newsreel and usury is haram so based on the fatwas of various scholars they say that if such person calls you for iftar it is a blessing for you and a sin for him he has earned something from wrong means he'll be responsible you won't be responsible for that"
