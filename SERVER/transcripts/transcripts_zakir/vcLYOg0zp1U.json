  "title": "Working as a Handyman Repairing Apartments which are still on Interest - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum wum asalam my name is Joseph sidiki and I work with my brothers as a handyman for their real estate business I fix the rental apartment on an early salary basis income they own approximately 300 apartment units that they repair on a daily basis most of the apartments are still on interest based investment that have not been paid off yet I don't own any real estate property with them but I am one of the workers my question to you sir is is my income Halal according to the Islamic law or should I find another job question is posed by Joseph sidiki he is doing a freelancing work and he's working for an estate company Ali basis he's not fully employed and he's handyman who fixes Plumbing or things of the apartments and the apartments on RBA so is it permitted to work for a company which owns uh apartments and those apartments on RBA is it permitted as far as working in a company if the core activity of that company is Haram you cannot work for that company you cannot work for a riab based Bank you cannot work for alcoholic company because the core activity is Haram you can't work for a company which owns the gambling den and the main activity is gambling Den but for example you're working for five hotel in the festar hotel the sale of alcohol income is maybe 2% 3% so can you work at the reception no problem if you're working at a reception of a festar hotel is permitted but you cannot work as a waiter in a restaurant which seres alcohol because they will be forced to serve alcohol so that F star hotel may be having a restaurant which serves alcohol so you can work as a manager or a receptionist of the hotel where the main income is halal maybe a small percentage is Haram so for the owner of that hotel it is Haram for him to have a restaurant which has alcohol but for the worker for him to work as a receptionist or manager no problem as long as he's not directly involved in the alcohol restaurant similarly you as working for handyman or as a electrician or as a plumber for a real estate company the main activity of the real estate company buying and selling property but it's taking on R so if you are working and just repairing an apartment is it Hal it's permitted so tomorrow if you are a mechanic and suppose a car comes to you for for repairs you'll ask the car owner okay is your car on riba or not if the car is on riba you can very well repair the car because the main activity you cannot buy a car on riba but repairing a car which is on riba is permitted because if not directly involving inba the same way you repairing a house or electrician or a plumber or a handyman off a house which is taken on as permitted similarly as you being a mechanic and a car or a motorcycle or a bus comes which is taken on RBA so you can repair it your money is H imagine there's a doctor and a robber comes for his treatment a robber comes and pays money the doctor can take his fees he cannot take something which is robbed for example if he's robbed an item and he gives that item that's not permitted but if he's robbed and he's earned a lot of money and if he pays his fees or a person who owner of a bank he's sick and he comes to a doctor a doctor treats him he takes money the money is Haram for him but when he pays the doctor for the doctor he's getting for his Halal work so similarly if a mechanic of a car takes money or you as a handyman or electrician or a plumber take money for your Halal work it's permitted it's not Haram hope that answerers the question"
