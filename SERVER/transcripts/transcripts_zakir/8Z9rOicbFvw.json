  "transcript": "the next question sayat faisal from uttar pradesh india assalamu alaikum why has allah made me a muslim and why was i born in a muslim family and my friends in a non-muslim family allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran 67 verse number 2 it is allah who has created life and death to test which of you are good in deeds so this life it is a test for the hereafter and allah subhana wa test different people in different ways and prophet muhammed peace be upon him said that every child is born in deenulfitra that is every child is born as a muslim it is later on that his parents they may make him a hindu a christian a jew etc and just because a person is born in a muslim family he is not guaranteed paradise a person may be a muslim throughout his life but a few days or just before dying he may commit shirk and his abode will be the hellfire similarly a non-muslim he may be a non-muslim throughout his life but a few days before he dies he may understand the truth of islam he may accept islam and once he embraces islam he will enter paradise so it is all subjective and allah subhanahu talaha says in the glorious quran in surah fusillah chapter 41 verse number 53 s soon we shall show them our signs in the furthest regions of the horizons and into their souls until it is clear to them that this is the truth so allah subhana wa will deliver the message to each and every human being so no human being has the excuse that he did not receive the message it is upon the non-muslim upon the human being to accept the message or to reject it so allah subhana wa tala test different people in different ways there are thousands of muslims who are muslims but they do not practice did not offer salah so they're just muslim by name so it is all subjective even if a person is born in a non-muslim family he has the opportunity throughout his life to embrace islam and once he embraces islam he is a muslim by choice many of us are muslims by chance and we take it for granted but many times non-muslims they work hard to search for truth and once they embrace islam they are much more practicing than many of the born muslims so it is all subjective allah subhana wa tala test different people in different ways"
