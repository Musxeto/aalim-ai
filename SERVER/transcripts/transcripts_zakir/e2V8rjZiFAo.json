  "title": "Why is Polygyny Allowed in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Joseph I have two questions to \nask why all the Muslims men are allowed   to marry for four women and the \nsecond one is how can you prove   that Jesus was not crucified there's \ntwo questions but are you a Christian where there's two questions that why does Islam \nvomit a man to have up to four wives where is   more than one wife and second question how can you \nprove that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was not   crucified the Quran is the only religious book \non the face of the Earth which says marry only   one you read the Bible you read the Rama and you \nread the Mahabharat read the Veda no religious   book on the face of the Earth says manual \nanyone besides the Quran if you read Dharma   in the Hindu scriptures the father of sriram he \nhad more than one wife if read Mahabharata Shri   Krishna Harmony four ten thousand ten thousand \nhe had sixteen thousand one hundred and eight   wives so if SRI Krishan can has 16 108 wives \nso why can't Muslims have maximum up to four   if you read the Old Testament it says that Solomon \npeace be upon him at seven hundred wife Abraham   peace be upon him at three wives so Old Testament \ntells you can marry as many wives as you want same   as the New Testament says that you should follow \nOld Testament so in Hinduism in Christianity in   Judaism you can marry as many as you want it is \nlater on that the church put a restriction that   Christian should manually one it is later on Yoda \nPastor Synod and say that you should marry only   one otherwise previously they used to marry as \nmany as they wished it is the Indian penal code   in India in 1954 that put a restriction and said \nunder the Hindu special Marriage Act the Hindus   should marry only one but the scriptures put no \nrestrictions let's analyze what does the Quran   say Quran says in Surah chapter 4 verse number \nthree married woman of a choice in twos threes   or fours but if you can't do justice marry only \none this statement if you can't do justice marry   only one is only given in the Quran and no other \nreligious scriptures let us analyze why does Quran   give permission for the Muslim men to marry more \nthan one woman maximum four the reason is that   by Nature male and female are born in equal \nproportion but if you ask any pediatrician   he will tell you the doctor of the children that \nthe female child is stronger than the male child   in fighting germs and diseases so you have more \ndeaths among the male children as compared to   female children so in periodic age itself the \nfemales are more than the males as life goes on   there is death due to Wars due to alcoholism \ndue to drug addiction due to accident in all   these cases more men are dying as compared to \nfemales so today in the world there are more   females as compared to males in few countries \nlike India and China the female population is   less than the male population because of \nfemale feticide and female infanticide   in India according to a BBC report every day \nmore than a thousand feet is something about   it after the identified as females if you multiply \nthis figure by 365 you get a total of more than a   million feet is that being aborted every year in \nIndia after the identified that they're females   according to the Tamil Nadu government Hospital \nreport out of 10 females born alive four are put   to death if you stop this evil practice of female \nfeet aside and female infant that India even in   India the female population will become more than \nthe male population even in China if you stop this   evil practice the female population become more \nthan the male population today if you analyze   in USA alone there are 4.7 million females more \nthan males in UK alone there are 1.2 million   females more than males in Germany alone there \nare 1.6 million females more than males in Russia   alone there are 10.6 million females more than \nmales and God Alone knows that how many females   are more than male throughout the world if I agree \nwith you that one man should only marry one woman   and suppose your sister happens to live in America \nor suppose my sister happens to live in USA and   the market is saturated every man has found a \nwife for himself yet there will be 4.7 million   females who will not fund life partner and if your \nsister happens to be one of them or if my sister   happens to be one of the 4.7 million females who \nhave not found a life partner for themselves the   only option for them is that she either marries \na man who already has a wife or becomes public   property public property such a harsh word \nit is the most sophisticated word I can use   I cannot use a better word you know in America \ntoday The Stylistics tell us on average a man has   eight different sexual partners before he settles \ndown with one having Mistresses in U.S is very   common 5 10 20 30 no problem having more than one \nLegal Wife and doesn't go down their throat when   a woman is a mistress she doesn't get a rights \nshe's Dishonored she is not treated well in Islam   when a woman becomes the second wife she gets \nthe honor she gets her right she's treated well   any modest woman if you ask her that would \nyou prefer being a second wife of a man who's   already married or become public property \nthey will opt for the first so Islam has   given permission for some men to have more than \none wife to protect the modesty of the woman coming to your second question is it \nallowed for ladies to marry for men   brother you're asking counter \nquestion the time is limited the brother asked that is a woman allowed to have \nmore than one husband if you do that this problem   will be exaggerated more I mean Muslims \nin Muslims as it is women are more than   men if Women Marry more than one husband the \nproblem will be exaggerated Point number one   point number two if a man has more than one wife \nand if the child is born you can easily identify   who is the father who's the mother if a woman \nhas more than one husband and the child is born let me finish the answer now you ask the question for the interfering was I interrupting yes or no   no so why are you interrupting after the \nFinish you can ask no I'm a medical doctor   are you a medical doctor no I am a medical \ndoctor I know about DNA testing I come to it once if a woman has more than one husband two \nhusband and if a child is born and if he goes   to admit in the school and if the question who \nis your father is she'll have to give two names you are talking about DNA testing I know about \nit DNA testing is recent while DNA testing the   50 years back was it there no it's a new recent \ndiscovery yet it's not hundred percent even if   I agree it's hundred percent it is now it wasn't \nthere before Islam is there since time immemorial   and this is not the only reason even if I \nagree tomorrow it becomes 100 perfect this   is not the only reason today science tells \nus that man is more polygamous in nature as   compared to the female today science tells \nus that during menstrual cycle the female   undergo certain psychological changes it's not \npossible for her to do the role of multiple wise   but the man doesn't undergo these changes \nit's possible for him to do a role of   multiple husbands today science tells us that \nif a man has multiple sexual partners and all   are faithful there is no problem but if a female \nhas multiple sexual partners and all are faithful   there are chances of sexually transmitted \ndiseases to emerge and that disease will   go back to the male partner so medically it is not \nacceptable that a female has multiple partners but   medically and scientifically it's acceptable \nthat a milk and a multiple partners [Music]"
