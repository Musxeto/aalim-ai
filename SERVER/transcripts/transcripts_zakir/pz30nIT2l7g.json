  "transcript": "monasticism is prohibited in islam our beloved prophet said it's mentioned in say bihari poem number seven in the book of nica chapter number three hadith number four the prophet said o young people whoever has the means to get married he should get married the prophet said whoever does not marry is not of me so if you marry you are submitting a will to allah the quran says in surah chapter number 4 verse number 19. that treat your wife with the footing of equity and kindness even if you dislike her the quran says you have to love and be kind to your wife even if you dislike her you have to be just to her so if you love your wife you are submitting a will to allah you are submitting a will to almighty god the quran says in surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 32 that come not close to adultery for it is an evil opening other roots to evil so if you abstain from adultery you are submitting a will to almighty god in islam we have a system of modesty which is the same in christianity quran says in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and guard his modesty whenever a man looks at any woman and if any brazen thought any unashamed thought comes in his mind he should lower his gaze the same message is given in the gospel of matthew chapter number 5 verse number 27 and 28 where jesus christ peace be upon him says it has been said of the old times that thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you whosoever looked upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery in his heart the same as the quran says that lower your gaze jesus christ peace be upon him says that anyone who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery in his heart the next verse chapter number 24 verse number 31 says say to the believing woman that she should lower against and guard a modesty and display not a beauty except what appears ordinary off and to draw her will a head covering over the bosom and despite her beauty except in front of her father her husband her sons and a big list of maram the close relatives who she can't marry is given there are basically six criteria for hijab given the quran and the say hadith the first is the extent which differs between the man and the woman for the man is from the navel to the knee for the woman the complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and hands up to the rest the remaining five criteria are the same for the man and the woman the second is the clothes they weigh it should be loose it should not be tight fitting it should not reveal the figure third the clothes should not be transparent fourth it should not be so glamorous so that it attracts the opposite sex fifth it should not resemble that of the opposite sex and six it should not dissemble that of the unbelievers these are basically the six criteria for hijab given the quran the sahadees and if you read the bible the bible too has similar criteria of modesty it's mentioned in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 22 verse number 5 that the woman shall not wear clothes that which pertinent to a man and neither shall man wear the garments of the woman anyone who does so is an abomination to the god that means wearing clothes of the opposite sex is even private in the bible it's mentioned in the first timothy chapter number two verse number nine that the woman should be dressed up with modesty and shame-facedness and with sobriety they should not have prided her or should not wear gold or perls or costly array and it's mentioned in the first corinthians chapter number 11 verse number five to six that the woman that prophesizes a praise with a head uncovered a head should be shaved off the bible in the first corinthians chapter 11 verse number five to six says that the woman who does not cover a head and she is praying to the god a head should be shaved off imagine even the quran and the say hadith is not as strict as the bible where the bible says the head should be shaved off so if christian means a person who follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him i would like to tell you that we muslims are more christian than the christians themselves [Applause]"
