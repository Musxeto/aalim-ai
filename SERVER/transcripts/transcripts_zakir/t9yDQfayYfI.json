  "transcript": "I am an Indian Muslim my name is aminola Islam my question to you is that is there mentioned anywhere in the Hadith about coronavirus and what should I do for getting rid of it I followed the word coronavirus or covid-19 is concerned it's nowhere mentioned in the Quran or the Hadith but there are there are many places in Hadith talking about epidemic talking about plague talking about leprosy which as epidemic as a contagious disease comes in the same group as coronavirus or the covet 19. but specifically by name it's not mentioned and I said in my talk where is Hadith in point number seven Hadith number 5728 5729 5730 where the Prophet said that if you hear of news of the brick of a plague in a land do not enter that land or if where you are staying in a place the plague breaks out do not leave that place and talking about which I mentioned in my talk so there is mention of epidemic disease somewhat similar to the coronavirus or covert 19. as far as how do you take precaution as I mentioned it's somewhat similar to the lockdown somewhat similar to confinement or quarantine these are words which are similar that if you are there in a place where plague have broken out do not leave that place do not infect others if if you are not in the place which has plague but other place has got plague do not go to that place where play give the all coronaviruses the guidelines given to us but and there are various to us that are there which we read the score that we did in the morning then the evening if that talks about keeping us in good health there's a particular one in a mentioned in number two that you pray to Allah that me he cure us and save us from the Vitiligo and cure us and save us from the leprosy from leucoderma but basically you have to have faith in Allah another mentioned inside bukhari number seven Hadith number 5734 that if a Muslim is in a land where there is play or contagious disease all covered 19. and if we have faith in Allah and if we believe that nothing will happen to him unless what Allah has ordained from him and even if he dies he will be getting the suburb of a matter and we do pray many times and even I pray most of the times that you know may Allah foreignty to be ashaheed when we talk about a Shahid normally in our mind as you know that when we go for Qatar in the way of Allah bearing Witness we we give up our life second category can be that being a die that because we are spreading the message of Allah if we have a large number of following we even have a small percentage of that large number as enemies if we have hundred million followers so surely you'll have tens of thousands of enemies in the world and there are chances that this enemy May kill you and if you die being witness to Allah's mother die even then you call it and even if you die in a plague believing what you ordained for you Allah what is this time and if you die then a beloved Prophet said you get the sabab of a martyr and repeat Allah that me he gave all of us all the viewers in Jannah in general and may he give us company with the matters"
