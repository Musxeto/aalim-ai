  "title": "Whatâ€™s Wrong in Saying Merry Christmas when My Intentions are Only to Improve Relations & not Shirk?",
  "transcript": "assalamualaikum my name is adil ahmed i'm a 16 year old student doing my gcses and my question regards dr naik's statement previously about saying merry christmas to non-muslim makes us somehow submit the fact that well the idea that christ was the son of god and it makes us one of them now that sort of shocked me in a sense that surely allah in his almightiness would know that my intention to saying someone merry christmas is as you said just to improve relations now the thing is that most people at least of my generation people who i come in contact with don't actually celebrate christmas uh because they celebrate christ's birth but actually it's a commercial thing to get the latest ps2 or whatever it is um so could you just please expand on that because i'm sort of confused how saying merry christmas could uh somehow bring blasphemy the brothers asked a question that he wants to wish merry christmas to his friend so that he can build relationships so tomorrow he'll ask me the question why can't i have a pack of alcohol to build relationship why not why what's wrong why can't i eat some pork with them why can't i go to church and worship jesus christ peace be upon him see you don't have to do anything haram for doing dhawa for reaching the goals you cannot use wrong means brother what is haram for them is haram for you also when you are wishing merry christmas to them you are agreeing that jesus christ peace be upon him was born on the 25th of december and you are agreeing that he is the begotten son of god which is shirk why it is wrong because the christians they believe that jesus christ peace be upon him is the begotten son of god now irrespective whether he may be a practicing christian or not they celebrate because the birthday why don't they celebrate any other day so if you tell your christian friend okay forget if you don't believe in that let's celebrate instead of 25th or december let's celebrate on the 10th of october will they agree they'll say no but that does not mean don't do that why do they want christmas i ask them that this is the christmas season why is it christmas so they tell me oh it's christmas because jesus christ peace be upon was born on 25th december who is this jesus peace be upon him oh jesus is the begotten son of god then i tell him that can you prove to me from one unequivocal statement from the complete bible where jesus christ peace himself says that he is god away says worship me i do dawah why do you have to use wrong means for doing dhawa you ask the question is saying merry christmas wrong means i'm telling you it is wrong okay 100 wrong according to me if you don't know what christmas is celebrated for like by mistake if you don't know it is alcohol and you think it is pepsi and you have it allah may forgive you so if you don't know what is christmas standing for being in uk do you know what christmas stands for well as of now have you come from somewhere outside well as of now i think it stands for a commercial i think it stands for a commercial business that's what it stands for it stands for a commercial business a place where people give each other presents what is the excuse no don't it's a holiday i'm asking the question do you know what is the excuse for commercial business what is the excuse why do they celebrate christmas for what because the birth of christ died finished you know about it and do they consider jesus christ peace be upon him as the son of god begotten son do you know that yeah i know that but i know that and then if you wish merry christmas if you didn't know if you're coming from timbuktu if you're coming from timbuktu when you did not know any ignorance if you wish allah may forgive you if you don't know that that is alcohol if you think it is pepsi and you drink it allah may forgive you but if you know it and you think you're building relationship you know what you're doing you're building a place in the jahannam so therefore brother for reaching any good means you never have to adopt wrong means you have to go as the guidance of the quran and the sunnah hope that answers the question [Music] alhamdulillah"
