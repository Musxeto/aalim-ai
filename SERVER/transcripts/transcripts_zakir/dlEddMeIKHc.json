this program of ask dr zakir you're most welcome to ask any questions on islam and comparative religion or any question which a non-muslim may have asked and you are unable to reply or any question that is portrayed in the media regarding islam this is the opportunity you can ask a question on any of my four social media platforms but the best is that you ask your question on the whatsapp as a text message mentioning your question in brief along with your name your profession your city and country of origin to the whatsapp number plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five i repeat plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five take the first question from the what's up the first question is assalamu alaikum i am ali from sri lanka i am a civil engineer currently in qatar can we drink non-alcoholic beer brother ali has asked the question that can we drink non-alcoholic beer as far as drinking intoxicants are concerned it is clearly mentioned in the glorious quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 19 allah says oh you believe in rule most certainly in talks segments and gambling while unsavor azam dedication of stones divination of arrows rich summon shaitan these are satan's handiwork first then he will come to freehold abstain from this honeywork that may prosper so this force of the quran surah maidah chapter 5 verse number 90 is very clear-cut that any intoxicants whether it be beer whether it be alcohol whether it be wine any intoxicants drugs etc it is prohibited now the question posed is that is non-alcoholic beer allowed in islam first let us understand what is a non-alcoholic beer in non-alcoholic beer when you read on the can it does not show any content of alcohol but how is it made we have come to know that the non-alcoholic beer it is made the same way as a normal beer is made which contains alcohol with malt with barley and they cook it but in a non-alcoholic beer what they do they extract the alcohol by various different methodologies for example the boiling point of normal water is 100 degree centigrade but the boiling point of ethanol ethanol is ethyl alcohol or drinking alcohol also known as spirit also known as alcohol it is at a lower degree it is at 70 degree centigrade so when you boil below 100 above 78 degrees up to 80 degrees this ethanol is extracted it evaporates the other method of removing is by the osmosis method but all these methods that are used by the companies which make the non-alcoholic beer it does not remove hundred percent of the alcohol they remove 95 percent of the alcohol yet five percent remains in that drink because to remove hundred percent of the alcohol is very expensive and these companies cannot afford and according to the rules and regulations of the food and drug association usa if the content is 0.5 and below it need not be mentioned in the ingredients list on the can so because the alcohol content in non-alcoholic point five percent or little bit low maybe point four nine or four eight percent they do not write in the can but it does contain alcohol normally it contains 0.5 percent alcohol or 0.49 percent alcohol because it contains 0.5 unless by law it need not be mentioned on the can but it does contain alcohol how does this come this initially was first introduced in the early part of the 1900s early part of the 20th century when alcohol was banned in usa so to circumvent avoid the law what they used to do is to make the beer and extract the alcohol out the content was 0.5 so legally it was allowed that's how it started initially and but naturally later on when alcohol was permitted in usa they have gone back to drinking normal wine whiskey alcohol but yet there are some people who yet have this non-alcoholic beer or alcohol free beer but let me tell you that this non-alcoholic beer or alcohol free beer does contain alcohol it contains 0.5 percent or 0.49 percent the normal beer it contains approximately five percent of alcohol it is less than the other drinks like whiskey wine etc so if we analyze non-alcoholic beer does contain a small percentage of alcohol the taste is same as beer the effect in terms of fizziness etcetera is the same the feeling in the mouth is the same so those who drink normal beer feel non-alcoholic by somewhat similar and unfortunately there are some muslims who think that this non-alcoholic beer is permitted and there are fatwa by some scholars who have said is permitted which is totally wrong because they may fail to understand in which type was this non-alcoholic beer made and just because it does not mention on the can that alcohol is present they think if no alcohol that meat is permitted but we have to realize that originally alcohol was there and alcohol was expected and our call is yet there now when we come to know from the hadith of our beloved portion of salam that once when a sahaba he asked the prophet that along with the orphans we have inherited alcohol so instead of throwing it away can i convert it into vinegar and the prophet said no you throw it away now if it was permitted surely the prophet said that why waste it convert into evidence and have it and especially if it's the property of the orphans all the more reason the profit would have been careful but because he said throw it away that means once it contains alcohol you cannot extract or use it so based on this hadith it is very clear-cut that once the drink contains alcohol even if you extract the alcohol completely you cannot have it in this case it is not extracted completely so in the first case also it's haram if it is extracted completely in the second case even though you extract it yet it contains point five percent alcohol now if you compare to the effect of a normal beer if you have one can of normal beer it contains five percent alcohol so if you have ten cans of non-alcoholic beer or alcohol-free beer it will have the same effect as one can of normal beer or if you have half a can of normal beer and have five cans of non-alcoholic beer it will have the same effect and a prophet peace be upon him is very clear it's mentioned in assay hadith of namaja wherein hadith number 3392 that our beloved prophet muslim said that anything which intoxicates in a large quantity it is also prohibited in a small quantity so based on this hadith it is very clear-cut that for a muslim having non-alcoholic beer is also prohibited number one original alcohol it is extracted number two the complete alcohol is not extracted so based on both of these evidences it is very clear-cut that a muslim should not have non-alcoholic beer though the alcohol content is not mentioned on the can it yet does contain alcohol which if you have a large quantity the non-alcoholic beer it will have an intoxicating effect based on this it is prohibited unfortunately there are many muslim countries including many gulf countries where this is freely available and many muslims think that it is permitted to have non-alcoholic beer and once when i was traveling the plane coming back from saudi arabia after doing mumrah there was a muslim sitting next to me and he was having beer at the first instant i thought he was not a muslim maybe the non-muslim having beer but later on he asked me to fill his immigration form so when i read the immigration from the name was muhammad so ask him you're a muslim he said yes then how come you're having beer he said i have the same beer he called it beer even in saudi arabia so that salad here so it's allowed so that person being a labor class he thinks that the beer he was having non-alcoholic in south area was allowed so here it is the same the taste is same and he had it it is ignorance so i would say that non-alcoholic beer haram and i would really recommend that those which are muslim majority countries where the haram products are not allowed we should see to it that even this non-alcoholic beer is prohibited in these countries because it is not permitted for a muslim to have non-alcoholic beer or alcohol-free beer because it does contain alcohol and in large quantity it will intoxicate you hope that answers the question the second question it's from mark's king is masturbation haram 14s a similar question has been asked assalamu alaikum dr zakir naik my name is abdul ghaniyu i would like to know the ruling on masturbation i traveled and left my family behind for greener pasture for about one and a half years now i miss my wife very much when i call her online for video chat we sometimes end up with masturbation i would like to know if this is sinful or not a similar question is asked by third questioner assalamu alaikum sir i am habibullah islam from assam india i am a student is masturbation haram in islam i do this and later i regret i do tawba but after some days i do it again i can't find the solution to this problem i am unhappy with masturbation and what i do the question that is masturbation permitted in islam is a very common question and literally every session i have one or two people asking this question but i've been trying to avoid answering this question but today i decided that let me answer this question as far as the act of masturbation is concerned the scholars in islam there are different opinions but the majority of the scholars they say that masturbation in islam is haram even though majority of the scholars say haram there's a large number which also say that it is mahru and there's another large number of scholars who say that it is muba it's optional so i would like to say at the outset that majority of the scholars in terms of percentage majority they say that it is haram but a large number they may not be majority but the number is huge a large number of scholars they also say it is macro it's discouraged and another large number do not in majority they also say that it is moba and we'll discuss this issue today and i'll let you know that which group of scholars do i agree with towards the end as far as the jurist the fukaha amongst the shafi and the maliki almost all of them they say that masturbation is haram and according to imam ashafi may allah have mercy on him he says it is haram and he quotes the voice of the quran from surah al-mumin chapter number 23 verse number five six and seven if you read surah mohammed chapter number 23 verse number one onward it says that believers will eventually be successful verse number 2 says those who humble themselves in prayers verse number 3 says those who avoid vain talks verse number 4 says that those who do acts and deeds of charity verse number five says those who guard their private parts or those who are obtained from sex verse number six says accept those who they have married that is their spouses that is their device and those which their right hand possesses for them there is an exception and verse number seven says that all those who cross these limits they are transgressors so here the quran says number 23 verse number five six and seven that the moments are those who guard their private parts abstained from illicit sex except from the spouses and what their right hand possesses that's an exception and all those who cross these limits they are transgressors so based on this verse of the quran imam shafi malala begins with him he says that here the verse is very clear-cut that sex you can only have with your spouse and what your right hand possesses and everything else is prohibited now this verse of the glorious quran can be interpreted in two ways the first group of scholars they understand this verse as here guarding your private parts in arabic it means that all types of sexual pleasure that means all types of sexual pleasures for a moment is only permitted with your wife and what your right hand possesses that is the slave girl and now the slave woman has been abolished so now it is restricted to only your eyes so based on this verse if all sexual pleasure is only permitted with your wife then even masturbation is haram masturbation is stimulation of your organ and most of the time it is self stimulation of your private part such that the ejaculation or this orgasm but the other group of scholars say that this verse guard your private parts it's only restricted to sexual intercourse so the verse of the quran actually means that you can have sexual intercourse only with your wife and what your right hand possesses other than sexual intercourse this verse doesn't refer to other things so if you agree with the second group of scholars then masturbation doesn't fall under this verse of the quran that's the reason the scholars are divided but if you literally know the verse of the quran the meaning it says guard your private parts so but natural there is no explicit verse in the quran which says that masturbation is prohibited and what we realized from this was it means sexual intercourse and there are various other verses which have prohibited sexual intercourse with people outside the marital bonds or if they are not what your right hand possesses if they are not your slave woman as allah says in the quran in surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 32 come not close to adultery sinner of fornication for it is an evil opening other roots to evil so based on this verse of the quran the other group of scholars they say that this verse specifically refers to sexual intercourse that means sexual intercourse is only permitted with your wife and with what your right hand possesses otherwise it doesn't mean other things so if you agree the meaning of this verse is only restricted to sexual intercourse then masturbation is not included in this verse so that's the reason scholars differ and according to ibn hasan he says that our beloved prophet has permitted a person to touch his private part and the hadees it says touch with your left hand no problem it is your organ you can touch he also says that it is your fluid you can emit it if you want so based on that he says when the prophet has permitted to touch your private organ and that is what you do in masturbation it is self stimulation so surely it is permitted and masturbation is of two types one is the self-stimulation the other type of masturbation is your spouse or your sexual partner is stimulating you and no scholar ever says that your wife or your spouse is not permitted to touch your private part so based on this surely the other type of masturbation where your spouse touches permitted so when you can enjoy with your spouse touching your private part then why can't you do it yourself so based on this the second group of scholars which is lesson number they say that this was does not include masturbation at all it is just talking about sexual intercourse so sexual intercourse is only permitted with your wife with your spouse and with what your right hand possesses it doesn't include masturbation so that's how the scholars differ there is another argument given by the first group of scholars who say that masturbation is prohibited and they call the hadith of a beloved prophet muslim which is mentioned in say bihari volume number seven hadith number five zero six six in which a beloved prophet muslim said that o young people whoever has the means to get married they shouldn't get married for it will help you to lower your case and guard your modesty guard your private parts and it continues those who cannot marry they should fast for it will reduce your sexual desire so here the first group of scholars they say here the prophet said if you cannot marry you should fast the prophet did not say masturbation that's the reason masturbation haram now this logic to say that just because the prophet did not say masturbate doesn't make masturbation haram yes what we have to understand from this hadith that the young people should marry if they can if they cannot marry they should fast that means fasting is mustahab nowhere does it mean that masturbation is haram because it's not mentioned as haram suppose if i say that eat date it's good for nourishment and for energy and if the prophet says he did that does not mean eating mangoes haram it means eating dead is good in mustab the other fruits become moba so it is wrong to conclude from this hadith of say bukhari that masturbation is haram it is wrong logic because for haram there should be strong evidence from the quran or from say hadith so based on this the second group of scholars who say it is not haram they say there is no text at all anywhere in the quran this is the only verse with the scholars quote of sorry mormon chapter number 23 verse number 5-7 which they say it doesn't include masturbation there's no clear-cut evidence it only speaks about sexual intercourse and there's no say hadees prohibiting masturbation there are some daif and maudu hadith we say masturbation is prohibited but that is not good enough for evidence so we come to the second group of scholars and we'll discuss what they say they believe that masturbation is mahru amongst them is ibn abbas malala be peace with him who was the companion of the prophet there is a person who comes to him and says that i have been masturbating he says that masturbation is better than fornication marriage is better than masturbation that means the call the verdict of ibn abbasman allah be pleased with him who was the close companion of the prophet muhammad according to him marriage is better than masturbation masturbation is better than fornication indirectly it means that surely masturbation is permitted but it is macro the best is marriage if you cannot marry then masturbate because it will prevent you from fornication so based on this the second group of scholars who say masturbation is permitted but comes in the mahru category is imam he's of the opinion that masturbation should not be done but if you're going to do fornication then you can do masturbation and he puts it in the makru category so the humbly school of thought most of them they say that masturbation comes under the makru category that means it's discouraged and this is also said by mujahid he says that masturbation it should be avoided but if it's done to prevent fornication or xena it is permitted this is the view even of ibn hassam that ibn hasam says that masturbation is macro it's discouraged but if you're going to involve in fornication then better do masturbation it is permitted in such cases and he says that though masturbation is permitted it is not amongst the deeds of the noble people it's not the deeds of nobility that's what his saying ibn hassan that means the noble people normally don't do it so it is discouraged so that's the reason this group of scholars put it in the macro category there are many other scholars in this category time were not permitted to discuss that the third group of scholars they put in the mobile category the students of ibn abbas some of the students they understood that bus has put masturbation in the makuru category and even they say it is makarov but the other group of students of nebraska be pleased with him they said that it is permitted without any condition amongst them we have jaffar bin said he was a taba in malaya mercy on him and he was the student of ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him and his opinion is that masturbation is permitted there is no harm at all in doing it is mubarak there is no sin and the normal circumstance is permitted there is another turbine by the name of amar bin dinar according to him also masturbation is permitted there is no restriction it comes under the mubarak category if you want to do it do it if you don't want to don't do it it is in the mubarak category even the famous scholar imam shahani is very famous just 150 200 years back he was there and according to him also masturbation is mubarak it is permitted it is optional if you want to do it do it there is no sin if you don't do it also there is no problem it is under the mubarak category and even according to maradavi he says that masturbation is makru but depending upon the situation if it causes you trouble it comes under the ram category and he also goes on to say that if you fear you will do fornication masturbation becomes further that's his opinion so here you have three groups of scholars one group which is the majority saying it is haram based on the voice of sorry mommy noon chapter number 23 verse number five to seven whereas the second group of scholars say it is makru it's discouraged and the third group say it is muba it is permissible it depends upon you according to me i being a medical doctor that in our medical college when i did my medicine they used to say that when you ask a person do you masturbate 99 percent will say yes and the remaining one percent they are lying anyway this is just a joke it's amongst the medical students it's not a fact but according to research today research tells us that amongst the males 95 percent masturbate amongst the females approximately 80 percent masturbate i am not saying that it is normal to masturbate but it is very common and there is a myth that which is there if you go to some of the islamic sides and those who believe in haram they say that masturbation causes blindness masturbation it causes nervous problem all these things are a myth in no way does masturbation cause blindness in no way does it cause a nervous problem yes if you do excessive masturbation they can be certain problem that is excessive masturbation and even medical science tells us if you do excessive sexual intercourse with your wife maybe 10 times a day even that will cause problem so excessive anything or excessive most of the things will cause you problem but normal masturbation medically doesn't cause any problem if you do masturbation according to multiple science it is normal if you don't know also it is normal but the majority of the people are involved in masturbation but i am not saying it is the norm but i am saying that majority people do it so based on what the scholars say and or medical sciences i agree more with the second group of scholars and i would say that masturbation is macro it is discouraged to make anything haram you require a strong evidence from the quran or from say hadith and there is no evidence whatsoever the verse of the quran i do agree with the second group of scholars for example the number may not be praise him and the other group was called abner boss may allah be pleased with him i believe in the boss call that it is not haram and this verse of surah mommy noon chapter number 23 verse number 5 to 7 does not include masturbation it's not prohibited it is restricted to sexual intercourse and i put it because there's no evidence it will either come in the muba i put in the makuru because i agree with the call of ibn hasan that it is not the act of nobility but because majority of them will be involved in it and there is no evidence from the quran and the sunnah to prohibit it i put in the macro category everything the majority do is not correct for example today according to research 95 percent of the women in the western countries before they passed the university the involved resina that does not mean zina not at all the quran is very clear-cut in surah israel chapter 17 verse number 32 that zina has prohibited it is haram majority do doesn't give it a sanction to make it halal but if there is no text in the quran or say hadith prohibiting it it becomes moba i put it into the makru category for various reasons one of the reasons it's not the act of the noble people number two that excessive masturbation is haram it can cause problems it can cause health problems it can cause psychological problems and most of the time masturbation is associated with haram activities most of the time masturbation is associated with pornography whether you're watching a blue film or a pornographic film or you are watching obscene photographs images here itself if it associates haram activity that again becomes haram so if you associate masturbation with pornography or with obscene photographs it is haram and that is prohibited and it leads to that high chances that's the reason i would say that best is to avoid but if you cannot marry for various reasons that we have so the best would be you fast as was recommended by beloved prophet and say bihari volume number seven hadith number five zero six six that all young people whoever has the means to get married they should get married for it will help you to lower your gaze and guarding modesty and if you cannot marry then you fast it reduce sexual purge and this is scientifically proven that if you fast it reduces your urge of your sexual desires so the best is to fast but it not be possible to fast always and depending upon the levels of sexual allergies that keeps on differing so based on this the mustap is too fast but if you cannot or if that's not sufficient to suppress your desire and if you have to masturbate it is permitted it is not a sin there is no evidence anywhere in the quran or say hadith which says that if you masturbate you get a punishment yo the reason i am saying this that i am being a medical doctor i know that there are many muslims many of them hundreds who have come to me for consultation and they believe because of the views of most of the muslims they are good practicing muslims but they believe it is haram so they come to me and the similar question was asked that he's tensed he's unhappy and he has got mental stress because they are good practicing muslims they pray fighter and salah but they realize and they think masturbation is haram so they get tensed up and worked up and this causes many a time big problem because they think it is haram and they are doing it and they have the guilty feeling this guilty conscious prevents them sometimes or many a time even to do good deeds it disturbs them in their salah it disturbs them in the ring of the quran so because of not knowing the fact what is there in the medical science today these people think it's haram it disturbs them so i would like to tell you that i'm not giving a blanket rule that do it i'm just telling you best avoid it but if you have sexual urges which you cannot suppress doing masturbation is not haram according to me it is permissible don't do it excessively once in a while no problem don't be mentally disturbed that's haram and as the question asked i have asked for forgiveness again i do it i repent again i do it so let me tell you that if you come under this category where you have sexual desire that keeps on differing from different people some people high sexual desire some people are medium some people have less so if you fall in the category of people who have high sexual desires and if you're not married and if you have to masturbate though it is makuru i would say it's discouraged but don't have the guilt feeling don't do it excessively don't do it along with pornography and i would go to the extent that if because of this you're going to do fornication or zina or adultery then according to me masturbation becomes mustafa and as mentioned by my mum humble and abbas may allah be pleased with him that masturbation is better than fornication so normally according to me i would like to repeat i'm not giving a blanket permission all of you should do according to me masturbation comes in the makuru category best is to avoid it if you have the gender if you're not married better that you fast if there is a head there then masturbation is permitted there is no sin there is no punishment you don't have to feel guilty and if you have the urge and if you think you'll fornication then build a masturbation and avoid fornication and marry as soon as possible we know that masturbation differs in different people even after marriage masturbation majority of the people masturbate 70 of the males after marriage they masturbate but of course by age it keeps on reducing marriage also reduces the more sexual intercourse you have it reduces so this is my view regarding masturbation avoiding is the best next option is fasting if you yet have the urges then it's permissible don't have the guilt feeling and see to it that you practice and stay on the quran sunnah or for your salah and do ibadah and inshallah prayed allah that he keeps you on the straight path hope that answers the question muhammad sayed love you sir from bangladesh mohammed saddam hussein love you i love you too amar english ishaq suleiman we miss you from indonesia assalamu alaikum alaikum salaam from india i love you too muhammad shabir i really miss you sir from india hafiz many people are doing duas and i do ask for you too we have on the youtube sajid ahmad mujahid hamza akram rosh um zakir naik my name is hussain muhammad from cameroon africa sir i'm suffering from urine inconsistency it is very difficult for me to be changing my clothes every prayer and every time i want to make wudhu it comes out i am in a very difficult situation sir please tell me what to do a similar question assalamu alaikum my name is firoz khazi i'm from cape town south africa i have irritable bowel syndrome ibs and i keep on passing wind at irregular intervals many a time after i do urdu a password is my salah valid the question posed by the brothers is that he passes urean he has inconsistency in the passing of urine dribbling of fury and the other person passes wind regularly so how will you offer salah the wudu keeps on breaking the reply to this is given in the hadith of say bihari volume number one hadith number two to eight that fatima binta abhi hubeish mella be please she approaches the prophet and she tells the prophet that i have been having a regular vaginal bleeding should i stop my prayers forever and the prophet tells her that this vaginal bleeding which is continuous is not your menstrual blood whenever you have your regular menstrual period at that time you stop praying the moment the menstrual period is over you have a bath you wash yourself you do wudu and you pray your salah and when you offer the next salah again you do a new this similar message is even given in the hadith of say muslim point number one hadith number seven five three the hazard aisha mella be pleased with her she said that she heard from the same sahabi fatima binta abhi habesh that she told the prophet that she has vaginal bleeding continuously she stops allah and the prophet said this bleeding is from a vein it is not your menstrual blood so when you have your regular menstrual period at that time you stop praying when your menstrual period ends have a bath do buddha and pray and when the next salah comes again and pray so based on this hadith the scholars they say that similar condition for inconsistency in urine where the dribbling of urine where you keep on passing urine at regular intervals or if you are passing wind or if you are emitting muddy or prostatic fluid at regular intervals all these cases all this bleeding regularly from the nose etc in these conditions the same ruling will apply what is there for the continuous vaginal bleeding which is a non-menstrual bleeding and here the scholars say that when the time for salah is there when the time for salah starts at that time you can wash your private part do wudhu and you offer the salah now when you offer the salah during that time if the urine comes or if the wind passes your salah is accepted but when the next seller comes again wash your part again do a fresh wudhu and you offer salah during the time when you're offering salah as long as you're done we do at the start when the salah time starts you wash your part do do after that when you pray your first or your nafl or your sunnah and if you pass urine or pass wind or bleeding is there your salah is accepted in this case there are two views one group of scholars says that the wadu is valid till the next salah starts based on the hadith of bukhari and muslim the other group of scholars says no the vadu is valid till the end of the salah till the end of the salah time and it's not valid to the start of the next salah now these two views the difference is that if you do urdu for fajr salah when the time for fajr razan is there the moment you hear the adhan after that you wash your private part you offer your fajr salah do the sunnah incongration no problem but if you want to offer the first group of scholars who say that your salah is valid till the start of next salah that is they say you need not do again and need not wash your private part again but the second group of scholar which is more correct they say that no the time for fajr is over the sun has risen if you want to offer salah to dua make a fresh vadu wash your private part make a fresh wuzu and then your salah will be valid i believe that it's better to be safe and i believe in the second group of scholars that for every salah time and since the fajr salah is over if you want to offer salah to doha then you wash yourself again do a fresh food and then you do that is the best similarly after risha you want to offer tajou and while offering kaya mul or sajud it is past midnight the salah time for isha is up to midnight at full so if you are continuing your salah after midnight it is preferable and rather a requirement that you do new wash your private parts again do wudu that is the best because the kaya mole or the time for isha is over so the voodoo is not valid this is difference of opinion and this is going to happen humble male 1 mercy on him this is opinion when this question was asked to shake abnorthamine he said when a person asked that i keep on passing urine regularly and magu breaks so how should offer salah so the reply he gave is that inconsistency of yuri is of two types one is it keeps on coming every few minutes the moment it enters the unity bladder it comes out or rather called a dribbling of urine the other type of inconsistency is that when the bladder is full and you urinate then urine does not come out for maybe 15 minutes or 20 minutes so if you fall in the second category type of people where once you go to the toilet once you empty your bladder then at least for 15 minutes or 20 minutes there is no urination then it is preferable you empty your bladder and then of a salah or even if you have to wait for emptying your bladder wait even if you miss your gemma no problem it is better empty your bladder then you wash yourself do do and pray that is the best but if you fall in the first category of people where the urine keeps on coming out every few minutes or dribbling of urine is there then in this case the moment the time for salah starts after you heard the other you wash yourself do your vudu and keep a cloth close to your private part so that while you're offering salah the ring doesn't spill it doesn't spoil your clothes doesn't come out on the masala keep a cloth and you offer salah even though your incomes are in between no problem you can offer your nuffield you can offer your sunnah you can offer your ferrari you can join the jama it is accepted this wudu is valid till the end of the prayer time if you're offering fajr then from the father till the sun starts rising or if you're offering zohar after the sun reaches half point after few minutes till just before the adhan of asar so for the full time it's valid your vulu is valid when this question was asked to sheikh bin baaz malaya mercy on him that it is a must to keep on changing clothes when you're offering salah after the urine comes out it's difficult so bin bad mercy on him he said that it is preferable that once you wash your part and once you do do your clothes should be clean and after that if you offer salad the clothes get dirty wear clean clothes wash yourself awakening is the best but if you cannot it's not possible you can do it always then even if you do with the dirty clothes as long as you wash yourself you do a fresh voodoo and you pray it's accepted and there are many scholars including sheikh nathamiya the man allah have mercy on him he says that if there are problems for a person to do voodoo and wash very often you can join your prayers you can join your zohar and assad together and pray any time from the start of zwar salah till the end of salah both together or you can also join your maghrib and nisha salah together if you have problems of doing wudu again or washing your clothes joining the sallah is permitted in such cases so this ruling based on the hadith of bukhari and muslim for a lady who has vaginal beating it is not the menstrual cycle it is applicable for people who have inconsistency in urine or dribbling of urine or passing of wind or continuous bleeding all these cases and i would like to say that if you have inconsistency of urine that nowadays you have adult diapers so my advice to you would be that after you wash your private part and when you do urdu you can wear a male diaper an adult diaper the adult diaper is very convenient it's the best there are good quality which is expensive you can't afford you can buy the cheap quality and even if you're praying five times a day you may have to change the diaper five times or if you're offering salad in if you're even offering caramel maximum seven times so if you have seven diapers adult diapers it solves your problem it will be very clean there's no soiling of urine so now the facility is there so best would be you wash yourself and do udu wear a male diaper it's very convenient it is the best if you can't afford even a cheap diaper and you're very poor then you can keep a napkin or a cloth and that will solve your problem it will prevent soiling but may not be very convenient in this way inshallah you can offer your five time salah you can offer salah to doha you can offer even your tajud or kayamul and surely all your salah as long as you do a fresh voodoo at the start of the time of salah and you wash your part and do fresh video it is valid till the end of the time of that salah and your salah would be valid hope that answers the next question uttar pradesh india is every hadith in bukhari authentic if yes then can it be compared to the quran a similar question is asked by shadab khatri london uk are all the hadith in syasitta sahih a similar question by suleiman khan birmingham uk what are the criteria that make a hadith sahih are all the sahih hadith of the same level why is sahih bukhari so special the three questions have clubbed together talking about say bukhari and the criteria that make hadi say and what makes bukhari special regarding the first question that are all the hadith in say bukhari authentic and can be compared to the quran yes all the hadith in say buhari authentic there are 7563 hadith in say bihari and all of them authentic can be compared to the quran the quran is the word of allah the quran is verbatim the word of allah which was revealed to a beloved prophet muslim to archangel gabriel then the scribes the sahabas they wrote down and prophet muhammad checked it up personally he asked them to recite it he checked it if there's a mistake he corrected it and prophet peace be upon him used to rehearse it with archangel gabriel every ramadan and the last ramadan before he died he rehearsed it twice so that means the quran is hundred percent the word of allah verbatim revealed to prophet muhammed the prophet dictated to the sabbath they wrote it down he counter-checked it he revived it with archangel gabriel so quran is verbatim word to word without a difference even of a letter the word of allah as far as say buhari is concerned it is the most authentic book amongst all the books of hadith the highest level but the hadith are the sayings of the prophet and his actions some hadith are verbatim words but the others are meaning wise they are not verbatim the word of the prophet and they were heard by the sahabahs sabah has memorized it then the tabai and tabitha and the chain of narrators so it is not of that the quran is the highest level it's the orbital word of god the hadith are the sayings of the prophet if it's the sahajas we believe in it we have to follow it but natural quran is number one then comes the say hadith and say hadith the highest is say and it's amongst the ali sunnah jamaa scholars among the sunni scholars that after the book of allah after the quran the next in authenticity the next to be followed is say buhari there's no doubt about it the second most important book of islam it is say bihari come to the second question are all the hadith in authentic it is six books of hadith so kudubu sitta is the right terminology for six books of hadith is a muslim she has a term in six authentic books the right terminology is kotobu six books of hadith and this book they say buhari these six books the scholars they say that if you read these six books of hadith you will come to know most of the rulings in islam but the hadith in all the six books are not hundred percent authentic the only books in which all that are authentic and say bukhari number one then it's a muslim the remaining four books in these four books most of the hadees is but not all hundred percent so these six books the scholars say if you read and you read the quran you will come to know most of the rulings in islam most of it not 100 but most of it there's a small group of scholars saying that instead of ibm they should be imam tamalik so this another small group of scholars say the six books should contain besides say bihari say muslim surname it should contain imam tamalik interviewed mnemaja that's a small group but we agreed that six books are there if you want to join imam at the moment it becomes seven but most of the scholars say that is included in this so all the hadith of these six books only the first two say muslim and say bukhari all authentic the remaining four majority authentic but not all there is a great scholar of the recent time ahmad this that is what he did he has divided the last four books of quran into sahih and faith you know and he differentiated the books of hadith the last 4 books then he took the next book then you can come to know all this say hadith in the last four books of kudu he's done a great work so this is how you can differentiate come to the third question that what are the criteria for hadith to be sahih and what is so special about say buhari and what are the categorizations of hadith as far as classification and categorization of hadees is concerned it is called as mustala hadis that is the science of hadith the mother scenes have classified hadith into various different categories the three more important classification i'll tell you there are many classifications one is based on who is the original narrator and according to abnessala has classified the hadith into who is the originator and number one the highest hadith it goes up to allah if it says that muhammad sallallahu sallam said it goes up to allah it starts with the narrator goes to the sabbath goes to the prophet and prophet said allah said that becomes security the highest category number two is the murph hadith the hadith which reaches murphrum is raised it reaches to prophet muhammad a chain of narrators are there then it says the sabbath name says that prophet muhammad said so that becomes murphy the third category is means stop it goes to the level of the sahaba so if the hadees goes to the level of sabbah but doesn't reach the level of prophet muhammad it is called as mokof that is stopped that's the third level the fourth is the makhtu means cut off it reaches to the table so if it reaches allah it's called hadith reaches to the prophet it's called as murphyhadis reaches to the sabha it is called as maukov if it reaches to the turbine that is the next generation after the sabha it is called as maktu so this classification is based on who is the original narrator one type of classification the second type of classification according to nisala is based on the number of chain of narrators and it is divided into two types the motherwater adidas there are umpteen there are several number of narrators the number is not specified it says several at every stage and this mutawat hadees is divided into two further muttawater in terms of wordings muttawater in terms of meaning i'll give an example of muthavatir in terms of wording that means all the hadith that you find the wording is exactly the same and muthavata means in every stage there are various narrators like at the sabha level there are various sabbahs who narrated it then there are various other people who narrated from the sabbath and the next level and the third level one example is a very famous muttawater hadith which is hadith in words that our beloved prophet muhammad said that anyone who deliberately or purposefully tells a lie in my name he prepares his seat in the hellfire now this hadith the words are same but arabic this is the english translation which metaphor but in arabic the words are the same it was narrated by no less than 74 sahabas 74 different sahabahs narrated this hadith that they said that they heard the prophet say this 74. now in the next level you have much more than 74 people who have narrated it each sabbah have narrated it to many other people so in the second level you have more than 100 of narrators then third level you have another few hundred narrators so overall there are hundreds of people who have narrated this hadith and all those have narrated the words are exactly the same so the scholars of hadith they say it cannot be possible that hundreds of people are narrating exactly the same words it has to be correct there is no different opinion that these are verbatim the words of the beloved prophet muslim so many narrators at every level that means minimum narrators of this adidas 74. next level there are more than 74 third level more than that so minimum so if there are several narrators at each level then the hadith is called if the words are same it's called words let's come to the second example in meaning that of the prophet sallam when he said that for fajr salah there are two rakat there are four rakat for the zohar sallah asar salaam and for maghrib fella there are 3 there are various narrators at each level umpteen number of narrators many sabbaths who narrated it followed by rabbi but the words kept on differing but the meaning was the same though the words differed the meaning was the same that in fajr there were two rakat in zoho and isha there were four rakat to be prayed and the maghrib tirakat so here the sin say it is meaning meaning is the same the words metaphor so this was the type of muthavat these two types in hadith it is further divided into three types of hadith one is mashur second is aziz and third is garib now all the these they do not meet the criteria of mutawater the highest level of hadees is the mashup that minimum three or more narrators have narrated at each level that means minimum number of narrators each level if they are three then it is called as a mashup that means that minimum three sabbah have narrated it then the turbine may be more than three but if minimum three is there at each level it is called as mashurati or even more than three it can be four also yet it's called a masurati if it is several then it becomes a mutabata but if it's three at each level or four at each level it is called as a mashup it is the highest in terms of aadhadi the second level in hadith is the aziz in aziz hadid there are minimum two narrators at each level with the chain of narrators and minimum two sabbas have narrated it and at the other levels also two or more have continued with the chain so that's called azir the third category of aadhadi is a grief that means at any one stage only one person other stages there may be 10 20 no problem and the best example is the hadith of buhari which was narrated by the tomorrow malala being pleased with him it is the first hadith of sai buhari one that your actions are based on your intention all the there are hundreds of the all hadith that are there it goes to hazard says omar manlap repeats with him said that the prophet said below after the summer may allah be business there are many narrators but at one stage there's only one narrator no other sahabah besides has um narrated this so this becomes it's a say hadith it is there in bukhari it's a hadith but it is all the chains reach towards the tomar mallapathism there is no other sahaba who narrated this so this is called as so this was the second type of classification based on number of narrators there are various classification i'll just come to the main one which we are discussing the third type of classification of hadith is based on authenticity in this type of classification there are two types of hadith one is accepted and the other is which is rejected in the accepted type of hadith there are two types of hadith say hadith and hassan in the say hadith what are the criteria for say hadith there are basically five criteria for hadith number one the narrator should be of good character that means he should be honest he should be truthful he should not lie he should not cheat he should be of good character that is the first criteria number two he should be a very good memory so that he can repeat what he has heard of the prophet or according to him is allah it can also be that what he heard from the prophet he remembers it and he writes it down and then if required he can again read it even that's accepted the second category the memory should be very good you can repeat it at any time or at least remember it is the time he writes it the third criteria for hadith is that there should be a continuous chain of narrators there should be consistency i cannot say that i heard from my great grandfather if my great-grandfather died before i was born how can i say i heard from my great-grandfather so there should be a continuous chain of narrative all the narrators have met each other and personally heard from them the fourth criteria is that there should not be any flaw i'll give an example of a flaw that two contemporary narrators who lived at the same time if one chain of naruto said that narrator a heart from narrator b and according to the history we know that these two narrators though they lived at the same time but they never met so how can narrator a heard the hadith from narrator b when they did not meet so this is the flaw so there should not be any flaw and the fifth criteria for hadith to be say is that it should not contradict with any other sound hadith any other hadith which is sound which is sahih if it contradicts then it is wrong so it should not contradict with any other sound hadith any other sayadi or hasanadee so there are basically five criteria for hadith to be said number one the narrator should be of a good character number two of good memory number three there should be continuity in the chain of narrator the salah should be there number four they should not be irregularities of flaws number five it should not contradict any other sound hadith if all these five criteria are met it is called as say hadith if there is a slight flaw in any of these then the hadith become hassan but it is accepted it is a mukbal in the say hadith there are two types of hadees that is the say hadith with continuous chain and say hadith with a broken chain in the hassan again there are two types hassan hadith with the continuous chain and hasan adid with the broken chain so these are the categories of the hadith except if it falls under say or hassan it is accepted as a huja as an argument for you to accept it if it's and if the prophet has prohibited it becomes haram for you if the prophet has commanded you it becomes complexity for you or it becomes for you the second category is hadith which is a modu they fit again got various categories they they did then they because of the chain of narrator they because of inconsistency in the narrator various there are multiple different types of cipher the time will not permit to go into detail same with maodu there are different types so basically the third type of classification based on authenticity and their other classification also makes a hadith which is magbud which is rejected now the question also asks one more question that are all the say hadith of same category that means all the hadith which are mugmul are they of same category no they are levels and i remember when one of my first teachers of hadith that is sheikh zayaram and azmi may allah grant him jannah he was the head and the dean of the department of hadith in the islamic university of medina and he expired just a few months back on the day of arafah on the 30th of july just three months back and may allah grant him jonathan he was my first teacher in hadith and he said that there are ten categories levels of hadith eight categories of sahih and two of her son imam buhari in his jamaica he put additional criteria for making hadees sahih beside the five criteria which i discussed imam bukhari put his additional criteria which obstructor then only said i will include in my james i'll give an example normally for hadith to be say the narrator should be of a minimum level of category five the more the scene they have written the history and biography of all the narrators and they have given 12 levels to the narrator number one is sikka all the sabbahs come in the sikka means the best number one truthful then one two three four last is khazab liar so if the narrator is up to level five it can be counted at hadith he says in myself in my sahih bukhari i will only take narrators up to level three that means he is putting a stricter condition so if bukhari put additional criteria to make it more authentic if it's a hadith in say buhari it's a high level imam muslim who was a student of iran bihari he put few additional categories on he said i will take narrators only up to level four four and above bukhari said three and above one two three muslims that i will take up to level four and not take level five his additional criteria so the scene they say that number one the highest hadith that that means the hadith which was compiled by bukhari and he said it is in his sahih bukhari and the hadees which were compiled by imam muslim and is a muslim and it occurs in both of them so if it occurs in say bukhari and in say muslim it is called as muttafiq allah that means it is available in both say bukhari and shy muslim and this book luluar marjan that has collection of all the hadith which occurs in both bukhari and muslim so that is number one the hadith that is present in both bukhari and muslim that is the highest level number one number two is the hadith which are present in sahih buhari number three are the hadees which are present inside muslim number four the month the scene they say that imam bukhari was not able to analyze all the hadith the muslims says that approximately today there are approximately 1 million hadith and bukhari memorized approximately 6 lakh hadith 600 000 hadith so the mother sin say that those hadith which imam bukhari did not analyze we are analyzing and applying the criteria of bukhari then the more they seem they say that those hadith imam muslim did not analyze we are applying the criteria of muslim on those hadith which imam muslim did not analyze and we are telling this fulfill this criteria so number four is the hadith which imam bukhari did not analyze the other modis in analyzed and which imam muslim did not analyze and the other mode they seen applied the criteria from muslim analysis and it's matching both the criteria of imam bukhari and imam muslim but these imam did not analyze themselves that is number four number five is those hadees which imam bukhai did not analyze but fulfill the criteria of imam bukhari that comes to number five number six is those hadith with imam muslim did not analyze but fulfilled the criteria from a muslim analyzed by the other mod the scene that comes at level six and imam bukhari as i mentioned there are seven thousand five hundred sixty three hadith even in say muslim there are seven thousand five hundred sixty three hadith the numbering differs in different editions so this is level six level seven is a sahih hadith with continuous chain which doesn't fulfill the criteria of buhari and muslim which fulfills the normal criteria of say hadith which are discussed five criteria of say hadees but it is a continuous chain number eight is a say hadith fulfilling the five criteria of say hadith but it is a broken chain number nine is hasan hadid a little bit doesn't fulfill 100 of site but very close to it with the continuous change that is number nine hasan hadith with the continuous chain and the tenth category is hasan so these are the ten categories of say hadith this science of hadith it is very vast and believe me if you compare to how the historians approve any historical fact and they say okay this is historically correct there's a criteria which normal non-muslim historians when they agree that this is historical fact but the criteria put by the muhaddi scene for a hadith to be say is multiple times stricter it is multiple times more difficult it is multiple times more stringent as was the story too that's the reason if for a hadith to be sahih i just told you the brief of it it's not that easy every narrator his history has been written there's a rijal all in detail it is so difficult it is such a minor study that if the scene when they give a verdict they can be a minor difference they cannot be someone saying it's a very high category someone saying that they're saying it's not possible it may differ level one of this or level two one or two level media for that's it if authentic good money seen they refer and they check so this is the science of hadith it is not possible for a or a person like me who's just a student of knowledge i cannot decipher others say say your life i have read about the criteria but i am not qualified at all so this to classify with hadith or zaif or modu or which level of say it is the work of a mohaddis specialization and in the recent time one of the famous mothers as i mentioned was sheikh nasruddin and the question which when i studied shakes me like random janna that when we talk about quran and say hadith we don't have all the say hadith compiled the maximum i could do i stayed with him in the year 1997. we could say okay takes in salah sahih muslim and the other four books so alhamdulillah after sheikh zayed asked me he retired there are many scholars in the last 1400 years who tried to compile all the say hadith together in one volume but all those who tried they never completed the project alhamdulillah sheikh zaraman as mean after he retired he took about 17 to 18 years to complete this project and he compiled all the sahara together and he compiled the book called as jammeh kamil al-hadees the full name is al-jamay al-kamil al-hadees short form it's called ajami kamen and about four years ago he compiled it and the first edition was published and after it was published the revision was done about two years before and it was printed just in this year and alhamdulillah after the second edition was printed and published and shakes me he checked it up and you're happy that at least the revised edition was out though he wrote the manuscript in 20 volumes it was printed the first edition in 12 volumes the second edition because the print was larger it came in 18 volumes he also made a mukta sir jammeh camel in five volumes in the original jamaica mill as texas me said there were more than a million hadith out of the million hadith there are many duplicates like inside bukhari if you remove the duplicates there are 2 20 hadith so if you compile all the 1 billion hadith and remove the duplicates according to exam and as mean there were about sixty thousand hadith from the sixty thousand hadith he collected only the say hadith removing the duplicates and in his jamaica mill there are sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six hadith so according to sheikh zarim and as mean after removing the duplicates the say hadith today in the world are sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six and we can safely say if not hundred percent at least this compilation of his at least minimum contains 95 percent of the hadith in this compilation he has given the huja he has his own criteria he compiled all the hadees which are saying and remove the duplicates he gave a reason that if this hadith was sahih and according to him it was if he even mentioned that outside is jamaica so there are additional 3000 hadith which other scholars say it is sahih but he says it is safe and he gives her why it is life and he mentions it so that people don't think he has forgotten then he has even added in that three thousand of these the very common hadith famous hadith but they are they famous for example the very common and famous hadith that external officer it is there's another modularity that as far as you go to acquire knowledge no problem even if you go to china china was never the seat of knowledge at the time of the prophet hadith so he mentioned this famous hadith but it did not say hadith it is a mountain giving his reason so totally jamaica mill contained 16 546 plus approximately three thousand hadees which other more this in assad say and he says it is if or the other famous hadees which are zaif and modu so people don't think he has missed out and in this the big volume which is printed 12 volume in the first edition in the second edition this has given the tahrir the details why they say why it is safe and all the reasoning and if the hadith is that he gives the references there in say bukhari the end of every hadith it is available in three books of hadith or i will five books of or two books of only one book of hadith the details are given so that you come to know from where it comes in the mukta sir jamaican which is in five volumes the research has been removed so that it's easy for a layman to read so the complete jamaican is mainly for scholars and for the what they seen for a layman the mukta said sufficient the mukta sir we have started translating it into english it was a three years project we started it about four years back but unfortunately when the translation was complete i wasn't happy with the english language so we are revising it so now we have completed one third of the revision inshallah next year by the end of next day it will be out so we will inshallah translate the mukta services in five volumes and it will be easy for people who don't know arabic to read it and to understand it we are translating also into urdu and other languages will be to allah this work is a phenomenal work so when we say quran and say hadith now you can say quran and jamaica chamberlain contains all the buhari all that is the muslim all the sahadees which is then the quotable in abu dhabi in sunnah in sunnah in ibn maja mata malik there are the books of the other books of sahih that we know that bukhari and muslim are only two books which are hundred percent authentic and scholars even say that imam tamalik also so for a layman if he wants to know he cannot do research if that is the bukhari or muslim or imam safely he can say otherwise he has to check whether they say or not there were other books of hadith compiled by scholars saying it's completely safe but the scholars don't agree everything you say after bukhari muslim there is a compilation of according to after bukhari muslim there are some hadith which scholars say is not sahih but it comes the third level the fourth is then there is the fifth book it's muslim he also claimed everything he said but the scholars differ and they say that everything is not saheed so these three books compiled as everything in sahih most of them almost all are say about not everything in the other kutuba sit at the four books when imam dawud when he compiled his main objective wasn't to compile only say his objective was to compile hadith which solves matter of salah or of udu or of other aspects same with the other mod the scene imam nasai imam tiramidi or imam ibn maja their purpose wasn't to compile majority assay so that's the reason they themselves mentioned in the collection that this is life i've done that but for a lame man for him to know hadith say if it's a buhari or a muslim it is safe to call it sahih or if it's a hadith which is there in imam tamalek it is safe to be say any other hadith he has to go and check up what have the mohadysen said and then he can decipher whether they say or not this was in brief what i mentioned it is just scratching the surface it is just scratching the surface on the science of hadith it's a huge sense because of this we know today alhamdulillah all the my new details of the last and final messenger our beloved prophet muslim there is no human being on the face of the earth whose life has been preserved with so many new details it is all because of the hadith that we have and when allah says in the quran in surah chapter 15 verse number 9 that we have revealed the quran and we shall guide from corruption the word here used zikr it surely means the quran and many of them this scholar says it also includes the say hadith that allah revealed the quran they given the zika and also the say hadith and he received that he protects it this was in short about say hadith and say bihari now we run out of time so we end the session here and inshallah we will meet again next saturday at the same time and for the next six or seven sessions i'll be handling alone my son will inshallah join fabric would join in the first session in january after his exam he is appearing for his final exam for his bachelor's sharia in jamaica imam in riyadh the exam will be getting over towards the end of december and afraid of allah may he be successful in his exams of bachelors of sharia inshallah until we meet next the same time next saturday at 11 30 time of malaysia 6 30 makkah time 3 30 gmt for
