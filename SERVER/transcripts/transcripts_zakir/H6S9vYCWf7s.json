  "transcript": "Shayan question about Satan Satan disobeyed Allah only once and he was a cursed Allah forgives human beings in spite of their Disobedience frequent Disobedience if they repent will Allah forgive if he repents today if you read the Quran the story of Adam Alam and is mentioned several times in the Quran in Bak chapter 2 chapter number 7 chapter number 15 chapter number 18 several places and if you realize in the story The Moment Adam Alam Adam peace be upon him he realized his mistake he repented Allah subhana TAA and Allah immediately forgive him and if both of them Allah be pleased with them all but if you note the story of el it's mentioned in Surah chapter number 7 verse number 14 when Allah subhana tal Allah says that we said to the angels bowed down to Adam all bowed down except mentioned Sur Bak CH 2 Sur chter 7 but instead of repenting to Allah subhana tala says in Surah 7:14 that give me respite till the day they are raised up that mean respite means please delay My Punishment give me respite and see what I do he challenged Allah subhana tala that I challenge you so Allah says in Surah chapter number 7 verse number 18 he gives them respect and says that all those human beings who follow you I will fill hell with all of you and as far as El repenting here the question doesn't come because Allah further says in Surah hij 15:34 that he is the Aur one that Allah has the knowledge of the future of the Unseen so Allah knows in advance that this person he will never repent as Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter 2 7 and 8 Allah says that Allah has put a seal on the hearts of those people on those CF and they will never come to the straight path and similarly we have examples of Allah predicts even about Abu laab that he one of the staunchest enemies of the Beloved Prophet Allah tells in advance he reveals the Surah the father of the flame he was one of the stest enemies to the prophet and he says that he will never accept Islam and he will burn in hell it was a prediction all he had to do to prove the Quran wrong was to say that I'm Muslim and say the sh 10 years he had the opportunity he did not do it so Allah knews he will never repent similarly Allah subhana tal knows that he will never repent so that the reason he said that he's to you an a enemy Allah says in Bak 2 vers 168 that oh you believe be careful of the of the footsteps of the devil for he to you is an a enemy so with all the verses of the Quran we realize that will never repent and Allah knows that therefore he is called he the a enemy of the human being and he is a cursed so he will never repent he'll never ask for forgiveness"
