  "title": "Reply to Muslims who do not want to Give the Quran to Non Muslims because they are Unclean",
  "transcript": "we Muslims we unfortunately want to sit on the Quran like a cobra neither do we read it neither do we want the others to read it and many of the Muslims they called the Quran saying that Quran cannot be given to the non-muslim because Allah says in the Quran and they quote yeah chapter number 56. verse number 77 to 80 where it says that this is the Quran which is kept in a tablet well preserved who None Shall touch accept those who appear it is from The Lord of the Worlds and many Muslims say that see the Quran says None Shall touch the Quran except those of you and the non-muslim strategies the unclean that's the reason these non-muslims they cannot touch the Quran Quran why were these verses revealed we come to know that the mushriks and the kuffas of Makkah the laid allegation that this Quran knows billah are the words of the Satan the words of shaitaan Allah reveals this that none can touch the Arabic word uses that means a book well preserved this noon does not refer to this glorious Quran this book Quran in Arabic is called as a musaf what the Quran is referring to if it cross-reference chapter 85 verse number 21 22 which says that Allah has kept the Quran in a tablet well preserved in afus so this Quran what is being referred is referred to the mephus the tablet well preserved the book well preserved it's not talking about this Quran because if it was this Quran and if Arabic would use mutaharin that it means that only body cleanliness than any non-muslim and easily go to the marketplace and buy a copy of the Quran for 150 rupees for 200 rupees for four dollars for five dollars and the Quran will be proved wrong the muthaharin word used does not refer only to body cleanliness it refers to a person who's pure in heart and mind in Soul person who's sinless referring to the angels that none will be able to touch the Quran in the tablet well preserved except the angels trying to give a reply to the allegations of the mushriks of Makkah that this Quran was not the words of the Satan so this verse of the Quran does not indicate that a person should be pure in body if he's it's good it is but it's not a must and furthermore even if it was a requirement imagine even if it was a requirement if a person's shirk can be removed from his life even if you consider this as a small mistake to touch the Quran without wudu yet removing the Sheikh which is the biggest sin in Islam to do a small mistake to remove the biggest sin in Islam it is yet a very good bargain but the scholars of tafsir they say this verse does not refer and does not indicate that a person should be in voodoo to touch the Quran but being in Vudu is good it is but not a must there are many people many Muslims will tell me okay give the Quran to the non-muslim but only give the English translation don't give the Arabic text or give the Hindi translation the Urdu translation I've got no problem if someone only gives the translation of the Quran but I personally prefer giving the Arabic text along with the translation why because the translation is the work of a human being and no human being is perfect as I mentioned earlier that no translation is perfect and if there is a mistake in the translation it will not be attributed to Allah because if we check it up with the Arabic text besides the translation we can easily verify that if there's a mistake in the translation it is the work of the human being and not of Allah so I personally prefer giving along with the translation Arabic text so that if there is a mistake Allah he'll not be responsible it is the responsibility of the translator and furthermore if Allah holds me responsible I will be in good company I've been the company of the Beloved Prophet Muslim why because if you read the theater of the Prophet Allah he dictated letters to non-muslim Kings in which he dictated of the Quran he told the sabbas he dictated letters to non-muslim Kings in which he dictated version of the Quran he sent letters to  of abyssinia to Emperor Heracles emperor of Persia king of Yemen king of Egypt many of these Kings alhamdulillah they accepted Islam but some of them David told the letter some of them even trampled it beneath the feet imagine of the Quran dictated by the prophet they were torn by these Kings and some of them even trampled it beneath the feet and one such letter is available in the koptaki museum in Turkey in which the prophet had declared the voice of the Quran of Surah al-imran chapter number three verse number 64 he says come to Common terms asking us and you which is the first term Allah that we worship none but Allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and patrons other than Allah foreign this verse of the Quran was dictated to the non-muslim Kings by the Beloved Prophet Muhammad it's yet available in the museum the koptaki museum in Turkey and I want to ask you the question today there are about 14 million Arabs who are Coptic Christians who are Christians since Generations I'm asking you the question which translation of the Quran will you give to these 14 million Coptic Arab Christians do you want to translate Arabic Quran into Arabic again you'll have to give the original text to these Christian Arabs once in Arabic are the language Arabic is the mother tongue which translation will you give will you give the Urdu translation we will give the English translation you have to give the original Kalam of Allah in Arabic that's the reason I personally prefer along with the translation give the origin Arabic text and the Quran was revealed for the whole of humankind and the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was sent as a message to the whole of humankind"
