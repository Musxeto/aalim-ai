  "title": "Making the Intention is a must for all Fardh (obligatory) Fasts - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "this one always have to make intentions regarding when you're about to fast and secondly the timing of the intentions can you just say something a little bit about that I further intention is I mentioned earlier that intention of the father and a beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in book of fasting Hadith number 2331 Prophet said a person fast not accepted if he does not make intention in the previous night that means for all the further fasting compulsory fasting making intention the previous night is compulsory it can be any part of the previous night it can even be till as late as just before the Fajr time anytime of the night you can make intention a person can make intention in the beginning from that and it can be valid for the full month of Ramadan unless he breaks it if he's sick or if he's traveling then he has to again make intention but one intention is also sufficient and many people think they have a misconception that verbally saying it aloud is a must which is not a requirement I don't have to say vertebrates that I intend too fast because my intention is from the heart for example if I get up late in the night much before further time for fasting suppose my son when we have got up to do a sohar late in the night and my son asked me that why have you got up I will tell you because we have to fast there's already understood the near is there I don't have to say that I have got up too fast so near as important near us in the heart you don't have to say it with your tongue that's what most of the people think and I don't know of any Hadith which says that the prophet or the sabbah never said loudly that I intend to fast intentions in the heart and one intention is sufficient for the full mother of Ramadan unless as I said it's broken but this is only for the first fast for a voluntary fast which is not a fourth fast intention is not a Firth because there's a Hadith again mentioned in Sun in the book of fasting Hadith number two three two three one is the prophet he tells his wife that I want food to eat and the wife said that there's no food to eat so he said okay I'm fasting that means his intention was not there before in the previous night he made it on the spot he abstained from Before Dawn but his intention was afterwards in the morning so for the voluntary fast it's not compressive to be made early the previous that except if it's a very important voluntary fast like the Ashura the tenth of Muharram Ashura or it can be the day of Arafat it's preferable to make intention before but that's very important fast for all the other voluntary fast it's not compressed to be made before previous night for the Nia there are other three things which are very important one thing if it's by force and if something's broken then it can be forgiven or by error or by forgetfulness as Allah says in the Quran in Surin hell chapter number 16. worse than 106 that after a person has believed then if he does something of unbelief there's something of course except by force that will be defeated by forces so if someone forces a person to break the fast his name was in there he can be forgiven verse number 286 that oh Lord please do not catch us please do not hold the responsible when we are when we make a mistake or when we forget so if a person in a forgetfulness breaks his fast like has water Allah I'll forgive him or if because of a mistake Allah forgive which we shall deal later inshallah"
