  "transcript": "next question from ahmad from ghana can i start fasting for the six days of shawwal a day after idle sitter all of us know that the prophet said fasting on eden fasting on the e days haram so the brother ascana starts my shavuot first immediately after it means the second of shawwal it is not haram to fast on the second of shawwal but it is makru the fukah say since eid is the day of celebration and there are three days of so fasting on the first of shawwal is haram fasting on the second and third is makuru it is not haram it's makru it is preferable you don't fast on the second and third day of feed because these are days of enjoyment meri making where people they visit each other's houses the relatives the family members and they eat so if you are fasting there will be difficulties in this merry making that is the reason it is preferable that you don't fast on the second and third of shawwal if you have to fast the six days of shawwal fasting after the third is preferable"
