  "title": "Solution for the Muslim Countries being Boycotted, Blacklisted, Blackmailed, Threatened or Attacked",
  "transcript": "the third question from muhammad s pakistan most of the muslim countries in the world are facing problems they are being put on sanctions being boycotted they're being blacklisted blackmailed threatened or attacked muslims in most parts of the world have been humiliated they have been persecuted oppressed and even lynched according to you what is the solution i do agree with this brother mohammed sarajuddin from pakistan that unfortunately today we find in the muslim ummah most of the muslim countries they are being blackmailed they have been blacklisted their sanctions have been put they have been threatened they have been attacked for no fault of this muslims are being humiliated there are rights muslims are being lynched what is the solution according to me the solution allah gives in the quran is imran chapter number three muslim 103 allah says that hold all together strongly to the rope of allah and be not divided if the muslim ummah is united then inshallah will be a strong force and no one will be able to bully us the problem today is that the muslim ummah is divided and we are not close to the quran sunnah the only way that muslims can be united is holding the rope of allah the rope of allah it is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith so if all the muslims hold strongly to the glorious quran which is the last and final revolution of allah and the things of prophet muhammad peace be upon him that are there in the say hadith if we hold strongly to this and if we're united then we will be a strong force today there are about 2 billion muslims in the world out of 7.75 billion human beings in the world more than 26 of the world population today they are muslims if you see the example of china china about 1.4 billion approximately 18 percent of the world population today they are a big force and they're so big that the least bother about the rest of the world they themselves are 1.4 billion do you know whatever social media that is throughout the world is influencing the world but it's not influencing china because they're banned facebook they're banned youtube they ban google they have their own alternative they have baidu they don't know whatsapp they have what wechat so they have got their own alternative and 18 are going to them is is a big chunk that's the reason today they are number two in the world but in many aspects the number one and the way they are developing coming from very low the way they have come up in the last few decades is phenomenal because they're united so we have to take the good points there are many negative points of china but the good point is they're united and they themselves are a big force so much so that even america is afraid what my suggestion is that the muslims should be united they can have their countries no problem but as a whole which is united today we have the united nations organization you know so whatever you know say most of them follow except the big superpower the five or six countries which have got the weight of power besides them everyone has to follow if they don't follow then the two is the arm they put sanction they put embargo and they they have armed twisting policies for their own benefit if they want to attack if they want to take over iraq they create force the big superpower america and uk they create false evidence and they attack attack iraq not the saddam muslim was a very good muslim but what right did america usa and uk to attack iraq and after the attack iraq was worse than what was before what was the muslims doing they were just sitting they were fighting among themselves we muslims should be united whatever said and done first of all we should remove let our differences aside and we should unite we may not agree with certain policy of the other muslim country but on the basis of quran and sunnah we should unite and we should have our own united muslim organization like they have no we should have umo all the 57 muslim countries should have united forget about what we have in the past we have some organization but they are not effective at all because they are controlled by one or two we should be united on the basis of quran if we are united on the basis of quran let quran be a constitution practically not theoretically there are some muslim countries theoretically quran is the constitution but most of the thing was quran prohibited goes on in that country it's only for theory we should practically have quran as a constitution and have united and we should have alternative like how there is a world trade organization wto we should have a world trade muslim organization wtmo and i'll give you an example the muslims we have the gcc gulf cooperation countries the six countries saudi arabia kuwait uae qatar oman bahrain these six countries are close to each other and they produce oil they have got petrol and if they fight among themselves the others will take advantage so many years back they made a cooperation gulf countries corporation so that they can fix the price so that everyone benefits in this way not only should we have for the petrol we should have for palm oil the two muslim countries which produce majority of the export palm oil is indonesia and malaysia these two countries so if all the muslims come together we'll have control over palm oil we'll have control over natural gases we'll have control over petrol if all united will be a big force and if someone tries to bully us all of us should be united unfortunately today many of the muslim countries are helping the enemies of islam and attacking the other muslim country because they want to have an upper edge against the muslim country it is totally haram to this one muslim country is being partnered with other non-muslim country to overpower the other muslim country this is totally not allowed we should be united we may have our differences but just because we want to prove that we are better than the other muslim country we are saying to it that we are spending money to destroy a muslim brother today we have some of the muslim countries are spending billions of dollars to destroy the other muslim country just because they want to be superior then they are the muslim country this is against the principles of islam if all the muslim countries unite whether big or small whether powerful or not if all unite if we have a united army a muslim army of all the countries put together then no one will be able to blackmail us you know that allah has given us the black gold we have the wealth if we unite we should use this well to promote islam not to destroy islam so if this is there then we have all the international organization if there is a who world organization we should have a world muslim health organization wmho and these health rules should be based on quran and sunnah unfortunately we are blindly following the rules made by the non-muslims some may be correct some may not be correct so if we have unity amongst all the muslim countries all the 57 muslim countries more than 2 billion muslims if there is interpol international police there should be an islamic poll islam poll that is islamic police if we have unity in all aspects of life and if some muslim country is breaking the law of the quran and sunnah the other muslim countries can get together and correct the muslim country why should we allow the non-muslim to interfere in the faith of the affairs of the muslims so if we have an internal check amongst ourselves and our constitution should be quran and the say hadith if we follow this inshallah within a few years within a decade muslim countries would be on the top and irrespective what's happening today we find the question pose about the muslim leaders and the muslim countries today there is one silver lining the silver lining is that there is a hadees there's a prophecy of a beloved prophet muslim that towards the end of time and if you go on my facebook i started a series of the signs of the end of the world minor signs and major signs and there are more than 80 minor signs out of which there are approximately 45 that have already occurred and there are approximately 40 that are pending not it occurred and then there are 10 major signs but towards the end of the world i believe that prophet muhammad prophesies that may the salaam will come if allah salaam will come may there is the leader and the muslims would rule the world for seven years that would be the golden years for the muslims and that time inshallah they will follow islam and the khalafat again would be revived and that time whether you wanted or don't want it i want you to don't want it this would be the best time so there's the silver lining i only pray to allah that may we live till that time when media allah come so that at least we will support him and a beloved prophet given bashar that that group of muslims that will support media islam they have been promised paradise i pray to allah that may he come during our time during my time and i would be the first person to support him and would love to see how islam flourishes and we wait for the time till the time he comes we don't know how long will it take few weeks few months few years few decades allah what we should do we should follow quran and sunnah and see to it that we force our leaders to follow quran and sunnah and the muslims should united on the ban of quran and sahadi inshallah again will be a superpower"
