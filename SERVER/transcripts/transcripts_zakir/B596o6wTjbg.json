  "title": "Is it Permitted to Drink Non Alcoholic Beer? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the first question is assalamu alaykum I am Ali from Sri Lanka I'm a civil engineer currently in Qatar can we drink non-alcoholic beer Brother Ali as the question that can we drink non-alcoholic beer as far as drinking intoxicant are concerned it is clearly mentioned in the Glorious Quran in Surah MAA chapter number five verse number 19 where Allah says oh you believe most certainly in toxic and gambling dedication of stones divination of arrows these are Satan's handwork abstain from this handwork that you may Prosper so this verse of the Quran Sur ma 5 vers number 190 is very clearcut that any intoxicants whether it be beer whether it be alcohol alol whether it be wine any intoxicants drugs Etc it is prohibited now the question posed is that is non-alcoholic beer allowed in Islam first let us understand what is a non-alcoholic beer in non-alcoholic beer when you read on the can it does not show any content of alcohol but how is it made we have come to know that the non-alcoholic beer it is made the same way as a normal beer is made which contains alcohol with malt with Bali and the cook it but in a non-alcoholic be what they do they extract the alcohol by various different methodologies for example the boiling point of normal water is 100째 Centigrade but the boiling point of ethanol ethanol is ethy alcohol or drinking Al alcohol also known as Spirit also known as alcohol it is at a lower degree it is at 78째 Centigrade so when you boil below 100 above 78째 up to 80째 this ethanol is extracted it evaporates the other method of removing is by the osmosis method but all these methods that are used by the companies which make the non-alcoholic beer it does not remove % of the alcohol they remove 95% of the alcohol yet 5% remains in that drink because to remove 100% of the alcohol is very expensive and these companies cannot afford and according to the rules and regulations of the Food and Drug Association in USA if the content is 5% and below it need not be mentioned in the ingredients list on the can so because the alcohol content in non-alcohol is. 5% or a little bit low maybe 49 or 4% they do not write in the can but it does contain alcohol normally it contains. 5% alcohol or 49% alcohol because it contains 5% and less by law it need not be mentioned on the can but it does contain alcohol how did this come this initially was first introduced in the early part of the 1900s early part of the 20th century when alcohol was banned in USA so to circumvent avoid the law what they used to do they us to make the beer and extract the alcohol out the content was 5% so legally it was allowed that's how it started initially and but natural later on when alcohol was permitted in USA they have gone back to drinking normal wine whiskey alcohol but yet there are some people who yet have this nonalcoholic beer or alcohol-free beer but let me tell you that this non-alcoholic beer or alcohol-free beer does contain alcohol it contains 5% or 49% the normal beer it contains approximately 5% of alcohol it is less than the other drinks like whiskey wine Etc so if we analyze non-alcoholic beer does contain a small percentage of alcohol The Taste is same as beer the effect in terms of fizziness Etc is the same the feeling in the mouth is the same so those who drink normal beer feel non-alcoholic beer is somewhat similar and unfortunately there are some Muslims who think that this non-alcoholic be permitted and there are fatwa by some Scholars who have said it's permitted which is totally wrong because they may fail to understand in which type was this non-alcoholic beer made and just because it does not mention on the can that alcohol is present they think if no alcohol that me it's permitted but we have to realize that originally alcohol was there and alcohol was extracted and alcohol is yet there now when we come to know from the Hadith of our beloved Prophet wasallam that once when a sahaba he asked the prophet that along with the orphans we have inherited alcohol so instead of throwing it away can I convert it into vinegar and the prophet said no you throw it away now if it was permitted surely the prophet would have said that why waste it convert into V and have it and especially if it's the property of the orphans all the more reason the prophet would have been careful but because he said throw it away that mean once it contains alcohol you cannot extract it and use it so based on this Hadith it is very clearcut that once the drink con alcohol even if you extract the alcohol completely you cannot have it in this case it is not extracted completely so in the first case also it's Haram if it is extracted completely in the second case even though you extract it yet it contains 5% alcohol now if you compare to the effect of a normal beer if you have one can of normal beer it contains 5% alcohol so if you have 10 cans of non-alcoholic beer or alcohol-free beer it will have the same effect as one can of normal beer or if you have half a can of normal beer and a five cans of non-alcoholic beer it will have the same effect and a prophet Peace Bear upon Him is very clear it's mentioned in the had of ma Hadith number 3392 that our beloved Prophet wasam said that anything which intoxicates in a large quantity it is also prohibited in a small quantity So based on this Hadith it is very clearcut that for a Muslim having non-alcoholic beer is also prohibited number one original alcohol it is extracted number two the complete alcohol is not extracted So based on both of these evidences it is very clearcut that a Muslim should not have non-alcoholic beer though the alcohol content is not mentioned on the can it yet does contain alcohol which if you have in large quantity the non-alcoholic beer it will have an intoxicating effect based on this it is prohibited unfortunately there are many Muslim countries including many Gulf countries where this is freely available and many Muslims think that it is permitted to have non-alcoholic beer and once when I traveling in the plane coming back from Saudi Arabia after doing mumra there are the Muslim sitting next to me and he was having beer at the first instant I thought you are not a Muslim maybe a non-muslim having beer but later on he asked me to fill the Immigration Form so when I read the Immigration Form the name was Muhammad so I asked him you're a Muslim he said yes then how come you having beer he said I have the same beer he called it beer even in Saudi Arabia so there it's allowed he also it's allowed so that person being a labor class he thinks that the beer he was having non-alcoholic in Saudi Arabia is allowed so here it is the same The Taste is same and he had it it is ignorance so I would say that non-alcohol be is Haram and I would really recommend that those which are Muslim majority countries where the Haram products are not allowed we should see to it that even this non-alcoholic beer is prohibited in these countries because it is not permitted for a Muslim to have non-alcoholic beer or alcohol-free beer because it does contain alcohol and in large quantity it will intoxicate you hope that answer the question"
