  "title": "How can I increase my Khushoo and Concentration in my Salaah?  â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there's a question asked by jamal abdul nasir assalam alaikum brother may allah bless you i'm watching from edmonton canada and this is the question that came on the facebook just a couple of minutes back my question is how can i achieve the khushu in my prayer i feel my salah lacks enough kosher and there is a similar question that has been asked earlier on the whatsapp i'll inshallah club them together so that we can answer more questions in a shorter time this question was asked on the whatsapp some time before maybe a couple of days ago from bangladesh currently living in usa my question is could you kindly suggest us some ways or tips to concentrate better in our prayers and gain taqwa fear of allah a similar question is posed by muhammad imran hussain assalamu alaikum sir my name is imran from chittagong bangladesh when i stand in my prayer i remember the worldly things and i keep thinking over and over again about the moments of talking to my friends how can i increase my attention in prayer a similar question again by zarin khandakar assalam alaikum sir i'm from bangladesh many children and adults ask what should we imagine while praying to allah should it be the kaaba or should we ask them to imagine space and there are many such questions asking mainly on how should we concentrate on masala and this problem of your mind deviating during salah is coming don't think it only happens to you it is very common it even happened amongst the sahabas so this is a common phenomena that your mind deviates when you pray to allah and when you're doing work of allah when you're doing dawah you know the shaitaan tries and comes and deviates your bow and just to make it a light moment you know once and mom was praying salah the mangrip salah and after the salah was over the mutadi says that imam you have prayed only two rakat your mom says no i pray tirakat so one person gets up and says you have to do that i'm confident about it he said how because in my magrib salah i calculate the profits of my business now i wasn't able to complete it that means they have not finished all the theater anyway this is just a joke just for light movement so your mind does deviate and though it's a joke it's a reality people don't even calculate the profit they even think which business should i deal in should i deal with biscuits or should i deal in cold drinks or should i deal style it happens i've given a full lecture on this salah the programming towards righteousness which is available on the youtube when you read your salah i always say that most of the muslims they don't understand arabic language so what we should do because we are non-arabs our 80 percent of the muslims the non-arabs so more than 80 percent of all don't know arabic as a language so i always tell them that at least you should memorize the meaning of those portion of the quran that you recite in the salah you should know the meaning of surah fatiha very well bismuth in the name of allah most gracious most merciful alhamdulillah mean praise be to allah the lord of the worlds most gracious most merciful and so on and so forth after that you recite the surahs the surah that you recite whether it be surah class whether it be surinas sorry phalaq whatever surah say to it that those surah that you recite in your salah you should know the meaning very well now when you are reciting the arabic portion in your mind because you don't know the meaning only a small portion of your mind is occupied maybe five percent ninety-five percent of your mind is free and most of the muslim you ask them to recite surah father from the middle of the sleep they will do it you know it's only a small portion so remaining is blank that's the reason he keeps on wondering now when you recite in arabic and when you also at the same time translate at the back of your mind recite in arabic at the back of your mind the meaning is being translated no more portion of your mind is occupied less chances it will deviate those who are bigger the language besides reciting also concentrate on the meaning it will deviate less now once you start doing this maybe after a few months it becomes mechanical you're reciting in arabic you know the translation so well you can say it in the middle of your night in the middle of your sleep so what then besides even recollecting the meaning also concentrate on the meaning a human being cannot concentrate on two things together you can concentrate 50 50 percent for example while driving a car you are concentrating partly and also talking no problem but if you're reading a book you can read a book and even listen to something else but your concentration is divided but if hundred percent you want to constantly reading the book and the meaning you cannot do hundred percent reading the book and understanding the meaning and doing something else no so similarly when you are reading the salah in your salah when you're starting the quran recollect the meaning concented on the meaning the more you concentrate on the meaning less will your mind deviate and less chances these evil thoughts will come less chances you will think of something else but to concentrate if you know the meaning if you don't know the meaning how will you concentrate this is the most important factor for concentrating and forgetting kosho insala and you try this it will get you wonders but your concentration level also keeps on differing the more you concentrate the more you will get the salah even for the children tell them the meaning of surah fatiha of surah class and that time it's not necessary that you have to think of something concentration itself occupies your mind you don't have to see an image i don't see any image yes if you don't have anything then you may have to bring an image like kaaba etc but when you're concentrating on the meaning image is not required and you'll get the real question hope that answers the question in brief for more details you can see my talk on salah the programming towards hsn"
