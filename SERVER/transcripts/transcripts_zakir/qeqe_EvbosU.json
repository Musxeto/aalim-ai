  "title": "Reject Waqf Amendment Bill â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I would like to make an important announcement this is especially for all our dear brothers and sisters in Islam in India this is regarding a new bill that was staed in the Indian Parliament by the BJP government by the Modi government to amend the wak bill they tabled a couple of weeks back in the parliament an amendment to the W Bill 24 and what this BJP government is trying to do along with its Coalition the NBA government is that trying to assur trying to take away the property of the Muslim wak board and many of you may not be aware that the Muslim V board is the third largest body which has the maximum land in the whole of India the first two are government bodies that is the defense and the second is the Indian railways and the third is the Muslim vak board which has or 9.4 lakh acres of land which is approximately 41 billion Square ft of land that is more than 3,800 Square kilm it's a size of a small country so the Muslim V Board of India had the third largest bank it is a body which has the third largest bank of land and let me tell my non-muslim brothers and sisters of India that this wak board property is not a public property unlike the property belonging to the government Etc this is a private property vak in Arabic means an endowment so this is not a public property it is a private property donated by Muslims in the past many centuries ago or decades ago or recently it is W meaning an endowment for the use of of the Muslims it's a religious act W for the cause of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and this is not a public property so no non-muslim can interfere in this religious and the Indian constitution has safeguarded the V property it is so secured and so stable but unfortunately this anti-islamic anti-muslim government the NDA the BJP government which is run by the Prime Minister Modi it is trying to assert eat the property of the Muslim so my request that with this amendment what they trying to do they're trying to say okay now we will reassess that if anything is a work proper goes in dispute we'll have a board that will assess whether actually it is work or not what is this it mean it's secured no one can interfere with it and they're trying to control it and trying to put non-muslims on this board what we have to do is when they table this in the parliament this time unlike the last 10 years unlike the last two election the BJP alone had won with a majority but in the recent election they have a coalition government and the opposition is also quite strong previously no opposition even at 5% of seat so to be a leader of the opposition you have to have minimum 5% seats of the parliament the Indian Parliament has 543 seat you have to have minimum minimum 54 55 seats and this time of course there's an opposition which is strong and they took objection that the it has been sent to the Joint parliamentary board and the joint parliamentary board has given a time limit till 13th of September if any Muslim has objection they can take objection and if at least 5 million the Indian population according to the Pew report of 2022 census there are 211 million Muslims in India and that's approximate the staty of the government also 14.6% of the Indian population they are Muslims and even if 5 million Muslim even 2 and a half% of the Muslim if they send the objection and they reject this wak board Amendment bill it will be stopped so now it is our duty that this anti-islamic anti-muslim coalition government which is trying to assur eat the property of the Muslims you know there are hundreds and thousands of mosques in the workboard hundreds and thousands of madrasas of graveyards the total bank is 9.4 lakh Acres 41 billion Square ft 3,800 Square kilm it may be worth billions and hundreds of billions of dollars it is a big asset and they're trying to eat this property trying to put non-muslim on the board if imagine just one mosque barar MK a couple of decades earlier when it was taken away there was a big human cry there was a big commotion there was rats if this bill is passed there'll be thousands of mosques that can easily be taken away from the Muslim umah thousands of graveyards can be taken away thousands of madrasas thousands of property worth lacks of acres of land can be taken away it is your duty it's my duty to see to it that we object to it and we have have to what we have to do only is that scan you can see it below on the link or maybe you will see if you go on my Facebook or go on my social media there will be a post which has a QR code you can scan you have to scan it with your mobile phone on the camera it will take you to the link and only raise your objection that you reject this wak board Amendment Bill even a 5 million hardly 2 and a half% of the Muslim of India object this bill will be stopped but we don't want that we want at least 10% of the Muslim um to object it to reject the amendment bill and I hope that my dear Muslim brothers and sisters of India they will see to it that they don't sleep this time we should be active otherwise our next Generation would blame us that this W was given by our forefathers most of it hundreds of years back tens of years back majority is coming since down the ages and it is for the benefit of the umah and just let me tell you one fact that the richest the richest residents in the full world belongs to an Indian that is Mukesh Amani and you know that Mukesh Amani has his own private residence in alamon road which is anela it is 27 story tall and it's set to be $2 billion some say 1 billion some say one and a half some estimate said is $2 billion it is the richest private residence in the world and do you know this residence of Mukesh Amani which is supposed to be the richest Indian it is built on a w property so much so that after it was completed there was a court case and finally he won it it was built on a property yet there are some of a Muslims who are corrupted who for small gain they take bribe Etc and they they don't handle the property well this should be stopped we have no objection in somebody having to take care of the workboard but interfering putting a non-muslim on the board trying to Asser the property do you know there are thousands of Acres of Muslim VX property which is taken by the government at a mere rental rate of a small amount all this is happening in our country which we Muslims should stand up for it is our right it is our property it's a private property for the benefit of the Muslim umah of India and I hope inshallah today and see to it that the imams of the Masjid in the next coming Jumba they see to it that they raise the protest and they tell the jamaat that see to it that we scan the code and we reject the Muslim W Amendment bill and I hope that inshallah that most of the Muslims almost all listening to this message of mine will take action immediately and LOD the protest and reject the Muslim Bak Amendment Bill 2024 which has been tabled by the NDA government the BJP government by Narendra Modi my dear Muslim brothers and sisters of India see to it that you scan the QR code and you object and say that you reject the wak board Amendment bill before the 13th of September 20204 the court has given a date for the parliament for the Judiciary panel that the protest should be launched or the protest should be made or by the Muslims rejected by the last date is 13th of September 2024"
