  "title": "Can a Muslim follow the principles of Mahatma Gandhi? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yeah good evening doctor my name is jem majitya i've completed my engineering this year and first of all uh this is my first time i've been visiting uh your open talk and it was really appreciable the knowledge of all the scripts you have and the confidence you have and a lot of muslim supporters which really follow you now my question and to you is a bit political now i would like to ask you doctor do you advise all the muslims to follow the principles of mahatma gandhi like example of non-violence satyagraha which he fought for us to get an independence from britishers as i believe and i respect all the holy books like quran gita bible apart from that in today's world i feel i am more an indian so would you advise muslims to follow principles of mahatma gandhi like non-violence satyagraha or any of the principles of mahatma gandhi because the question that do i suggest the muslims to follow the principles of mahatma gandhi any change it to any principle of mahatma gandhi that is non-violence and satyagraha whichever sorry sorry to interrupt doctor or any of the principles of mahatma gandhi i got a question starting you said the principles meaning all the principles then you said any principle i'll give answer to both all those principles of mahatma gandhi which match with the quran which match which our creator match with the saying the prophet muhammad sallallahu sallam i've got no objection telling the muslims follow followed wholesale for example the satyagraha movement of mahatma gandhi non-violence the prophet did the same not that he copied from mahatma gandhi it is mahatma gandhi copied from the prophet which i'll come to it later on if you see the mukki age of the prophet the first approximate 13 years that he spent makkah he told the followers no violence many non-muslims accepted islam they were fierce warriors the prophet said you are jihad sabar means patience many muslims were killed and butchered the peak in makkins that time they targeted the weak muslims they tortured them they killed them so those who were powerful they were angry they said that they killed our brothers we will take revenge the prophet said your jihad is saba see someone who has the power to fight back and he fights back it's good but someone who has the power to fight back and the commandments don't fight back and then he restrains himself that is real jihad jihad in arabic means to struggle it means to strive so here the prophet's commandment was non-violence they went on the streets only saying that we be witness that there's no god but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon the messenger of allah people stoned them they did not retaliate people abused them they did not retaliate the prophet went to tafe people stoned him he didn't retaliate so this is one of the strategies but not the only strategy so do you want to complete the answer no so after after dr zakir completes your question we'll allow you to ask you have to have some patience brother okay okay you have asked a question have to give the reply so this part of mahatma gandhi of non-violence depending on situation but now if you tell the indian government you know the person is robbing non-violence don't arrest him the person is raping non-violence don't arrest him the indian government will agree every country has a police force this force is meant to let peace prevail in that country so sometimes they use force against the criminal to let priests prevail you can't tell the government can't tell the police commissioner bombay that see mahatma gandhi said non-violence so a person is hoping let him rob only do shiksha but don't rob suppose they come and rape your sister he'll say okay don't rape don't drape non-violence so non-violence is the best in islam there is something like zoom zoom in arabic the best translation or can be operation and a person who does operation is called as a saline saline person and who is more saline than a person who can stop the operation and does not stop the operation the prophet muhammad said and hadith say muslim that if you see an evil you stop it with your hand if you cannot stop it with the hand then stop it with the tongue if you cannot stop it with the tongue then curse in your heart and if you curse in your heart you are the lowest level of movement you are the lowest level of muslim suppose you see a rape taking place mahatma gandhi said oh don't dip don't drip the best is if you have the power to stop stop it with your hand she may not be your sister she may not be a mother if you see someone raping if you can stop it with your hand you stop with your hand if you cannot if you're weak if you're not on the power at least dear brother don't rape at least with your tongue if you think if i say with my tongue also he'll kill me at least curse in your heart so depending upon the situation the strategy keeps on changing when prophet went to madinah there he was peaceful he did solely he signed a contract between the pagan unbelievers and muslim they broke the contract when they come for war then the almighty god said when they come for war don't get scared fight kill them so depending upon the situation and according to the people historians michael h hart he wrote a book of the hundred most influential people in human history number one he gave to prophet muhammad peace be upon him but i'm not mentioning him for that among the important misses was mahatma gandhi mike had a famous historian after mentioning the 100 most influential people in history he mentioned the important misses and in that he mentioned mahatma gandhi and he says the satthikrah movement of mahatma gandhi which was one of the important movements which led the britishers go back but what he said even if this movement wasn't there yet india would have got independence according to the famous historian michael h so what we realize that depending upon the situation we have to use the strategy you can't say always non-violence sometimes violence will have to be used to let peace prevail like how you have police in every country in every state so anyone who goes beyond the limits who rapes who robs who harms other people that time as a last resort like the country says the police can use force similarly islam says as a last resort as a last alternative sometimes force can be used to let peace prevail hope to answer the question if any other question you must welcome brother no sir i am convinced with it and thanks for that i said don't interrupt me alhamdulillah it's my profession i'm in the field if i give the complete answer people are convinced i start the answer people want to object when you are putting your hand up your mind is going on the question you aren't paying attention on the answer so when you listen with an open mind insha allah i will answer your question if not inshallah i'll give you a second opportunity okay and i would also like to advise all the muslim people over here uh you have a great scholar like dr naik so please follow muslims hundred percent there are some doubts like people do not follow 800 percent so i hope all the muslims will follow the muslim religion 100 percent and make the india proud thank you thank you very much brother i would request that all the muslims should follow prophet muhammad peace be upon him and the last and final revelation the glorious quran as far as the brother he said that muslims should follow me 100 i request him that even he should follow me at least what i speak about the quran they say hadith so brother we are waiting for an opportunity i want you also to follow me me as long as i match with the quran in say hadith if i don't match with quran and say hadith even dr zakir naik is hero zakir naik has got no value what i say if it matches with the last and final commandment the glorious quran and last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him you follow me i request you even you should follow me what i speak about the quran"
