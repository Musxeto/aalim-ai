  "transcript": "next question asked by Nawaz Sharif from Calcutta which is the most difficult question posed to you so far in your life this is the question this question which is the multi-vehicle question posed to you so far in life is the most difficult question in my life yes there have been difficult question I can narrate many as far as the most difficult question is concerned because it's not a very common question I will never tell it to the masses to the public because such questions can are for difficult so attacking and if it's not coming why should I make it public I have the answer and and I'll help me it through Allah help I got the answer this only discussed with the scholars and the focus and I asked what is the answer and about this to maybe fifty or hundred people who are scholars and people of knowledge and and and unfortunately the mole difficult questions have not been answered because of the Intercity not because of the knowledge based into the intricity of the question so those questions which are taking Islam and they are not common and it's difficult to understand the answer at the policy even if you ask I'll never tell you that's only to be discussed with people of knowledge and the scholars yes there have been many questions which are tricky many questions which may require logical answer nothing to do with Islamic knowledge and there are many I'll just give one example today I don't say it's the most difficult but it was a tricky question and I remember I think it was in the air 2014 or somewhere close to that in Dubai after my lecture and the way there were about 15 20 thousand people in the audience there's a lady who's a non-muslim who asked me a question and she said the doctors arkad you often give the example of why a Muslim lady should do a job and you asked the question that if two twin sisters were equally beautiful one of the one of them is very in islam makhachev complete body covered except the face and handle up to the wrist and the other twin sister she's inviting the western clothes with miniskirts and a low neck and the both of them are walking down the streets of the way and if there is a holy game if there the ruffian was waiting to tease a girl which girl will ities and you ask this question if I have given this example and I had this question since the early 90s when I gave the talk of woman that in Islam the first time in 1993 since this time I'm asking a question and I was this question in public forum that visually neutral and all of his hands has been but natural the girl wearing the Western puts in miniskirt or low neck because she's attracting and for for 20 years Lancer would say now this lady comes up and she repeats the question but she says there according to me the girl wearing the slamming his job would be teased I said why she said because the man would like to know what is behind the clothes that's why he will tease the girl wearing the schlemiel job and my daughter was in the audience he said no abashed wrap my father's truck and I was taken aback that this was never answered so what I see these type of these type of replies mainly definition applies to try and her but alhamdulillah in such situation Eliza one always helps I got up and I thorough Krishna has asked a very good question and I continued the question and I said though I disagree so the whole question not on your man sir I said I disagree with your answer it's an illogical answer but if you agree that your answer is correct then why you wearing clothes if you don't want people to be clothes you take off your clothes and believe me that women was so embarrassed and that was a very good slap to her reply to a question which the devilish question she went back and she sat quietly so these types of question might non-muslim to come to attack you it has got nothing to do with Islam man somewhat logical but what I don't know I disagree we can support if you agree with you and say why you wearing clothes and she was wearing clothes survivor includes and so so these type of questions the answer should be with jicama who do alas a mealy Rebecca Bell hikmah while more of a Turkish na vi's ability acid in white order the way of their Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them in the ways that are best and most gracious so such type of questions are many initial life within my videos and similar question answer session you will find many of such such questions"
