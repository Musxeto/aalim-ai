  "transcript": "uh next question is from muhammad khan from new york usa is the prayer valid when we pray in congregation in jamaat in a mosque keeping six feet distance between the two persons praying a similar question is asked by fahad bin alam if salah valid with worshippers standing two meters apart the generous circumstances all the  all the scholars agree that standing six feet apart two meters apart in a jamaat is the jamaat is invalid it's not acceptable at all a prophet clearly said peace be upon him that when you stand for salah stand shoulder shoulder the saba said that when we stood for salah it's hadith in bukhari it's then abu dhabi that when we stood for salah our shoulders touched the shoulder of the companions our feet touch the feet of the companion it's mentioned abu dhabi beloved performance said that close in the gaps and do not and do not give space for the satan so it is a unanimous agreement that when we stand for saline congregation we should stand shoulder shoulder and we should stand close to each other but this is a special situation because of the contagious pandemic that is coronavirus copied 19 in such a situation when there is a fear that the person praying can get infected is it permitted or not so this question was never it has never arised earlier so we cannot give the views of the classical scholars or the medieval scholars this is the first time in the history of islam that such a situation is taking place yes there were diseases which i would say is equally or more dangerous which have been in the past but never has this question arised regarding the prayer being valid there are very few scholars today who say that prayer is invalid which is a totally wrong wrong opinion majority of the scholars they agree that if we even if we pray two meters apart the prayer is valid the difference of opinion is whether it will be counted as a jamaat or not whether it will be counted as a congregation not so the difference in opinion of the scholars today is that if you stand two meters apart six feet apart in a congregation will that be counted as the congregation not because of the situation that we are in today because of the covered 19 surely almost all the foca has all the scholars today say that the salah will be valid the difference in opinion is will the jamaat be counted or not today majority of the scholars say that because of the pandemic the contagious disease that is covered 19 it is highly infectious the scholar says majority say it is permitted but yet there is a small group of scholars say it is not permitted it is not it the the jamaat will not be counted the salah will be accepted but counted as individual prayer so one is fatwa the other is taqwa so in the fatwa the majority of scholars today say that the jamaat will be counted but yet there is a small group of scholars say that no it will not be counted it is against ruling of islam it will not be counted as a jammer here what you have to understand that one is satwa and one is taqwa we have to take precaution but no one says it is further to pray two meters apart while praying in a jammer today yes if you're at home four people are there five people are there very well you can follow the sunnah of the prophet stand close to each other this is the taqwa the prophet said tie your camel and trust in god so depending upon a taqwa i personally would prefer standing close standing shoulder shoulder standing feet to feet it is the way that the prophet prayed and the sabbah spread and i believe that you take the precautions which i mentioned in my earlier answer take the precautions and after taking all the precautions i would prefer standing close shoulder shoulder and feet to feet hope that answers the question"
