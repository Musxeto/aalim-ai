  "transcript": "Zak next question from viewer he mentions some consider worldly Prosperity as seen as a sign of Allah's pleasure while Misfortune and loss are seen as evidence of Allah's anger is it always true if yes then why do many non-muslims lead a prosperous life while many Muslims lead a life of poverty and misery in this world it is not a thumb rule that if you're prosperous Allah is pleased with you and if you're poor or if you're misery Allah is not pleased with you this is not thumb rule normal rule is that whenever there is Calamity whether it be poverty whether it be misery it is either a test for you or it's a punishment from Allah subhana tala whenever there is prosperity any good thing that happens it's either a test for you or it's a reward from Allah subhana wa tala I give an example that Allah says in the Quran in Sur an that your children and your wealth are a test for you you know the're good thing the children and wealth is a good thing but it's a test for you on the other hand it says in chapter 4 vers 124 that whoever does Deeds of righteousness be a male or a female and a Believer we will put him in paradise and not the least Injustice will be done to them a similar message is repeated in Surah Nel chapter number 16 verse number 97 that anyone that does Deeds of righteousness beat a man or a woman and has Faith he'll be rewarded for all the good he has done so here it shows that anything good that happens the wealth children it's either a test for you or it is a reward and the reward is talking about Jenna when any Calamity befalls you as Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 155 be sure we will test you with something of fear and hunger with loss in Goods in lives or fruits of your toils and give Glad Tidings to those who patiently persevere here the test is talking about loss in wealth loss in life it's a calamity Allah is testing you and those who patiently persevere they'll be successful in this test on the other hand Calamity is also punishment as Allah says in Surah HUD chapter number 11 verse number 82 talking about the K that Allah subhana wa ta'ala makes the two cities upside down Sodom and Gomorrah and he showers brim Stones hard baked clay layer upon layer so this is a punishment Allah said in Surah bakar chapter number two verse number 216 that you may dislike a thing which may be good for you and you may like a thing which may bad for you Allah knows and you don't know it's for the mentioned in Surah chapter number 27 verse number 40 this is by the grace of the Lord and my Lord is testing me whether I'm grateful or ungrateful this was mentioned by Alam when he gets the throne in a wink so he say this is by the mercy of the Lord and He further says the Lord is testing me whether I'm grateful or ungrateful and those who are grateful they will get the reward and those who are ungrateful Allah subhana does not require them it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah n chapter number 4 verse number 79 all the good that happens is from Allah subhana wa ta'ala and all that evil it takes place it is because of your own self that all the good is from Allah and all the evil is from our own selves it's mentioned in Surah M chapter number 16 verse number two it's Allah who has created death and life to test which of you GRE Deeds Allah says inia chapter number 21 verse number 35 Every Soul shall have a taste of death and be sure we will test you with something that is evil and something which is good by way of trial and to us is our return we come to know that whenever there is a Calamity it's either a test or a punishment whenever something good that happens is either the test or it's a reward from Allah subhana tala"
