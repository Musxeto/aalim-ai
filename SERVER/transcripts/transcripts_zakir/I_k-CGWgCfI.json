  "transcript": "today i'll be speaking on the topic the 15 point action the muslim ummah should take when someone insults the prophet or indulges in islamic blasphemy this is a very short speech of mine for the longer version you can refer to my full length on the same topic i'll be only speaking on the highlights of these 15 points where action should be taken each point can be elaborated to more than one hour or one speech each point you can give a speech on that and depending upon how serious is the insult or the blasphemy maybe you may have to implement only the first three points or sometime only five points sometimes seven point sometime eight points depending upon the seriousness of the insult you have to decide how many points should we indulge in a beloved prophet muhammad said it's mentioned inside muslim world number one hadith number 177 a beloved prophet said that whenever you see an evil action you should stop it or change it with your hand by doing an action if you cannot then do it with the tongue that is by speaking if you cannot then by a heart that is hating that act in your heart and condemning it is wrong then you will be the lowest level of a believer you will have the lowest level of iman based on this hadith inshallah we'll discuss the 15 point action plan if someone insults a prophet or if someone indulges in islamic blasphemy the first thing that any muslim should do whenever he hears any insult against the prophet or sees anything against the prophet or against islam is he should condemn that act in his heart immediately he should agree what is being done is wrong and he should condemn it unfortunately today we have many muslims who have been so much impressed by the western world and the philosophy that when they see someone insulting the prophet they may say oh this is freedom of speech no problem and we should not take any action the first a muslim can do the least is condemned in his heart then only can he take the further actions number two today the whole world has become a global village and today one of the best and the easiest ways to make anything public or to convey a message to the masses or to the world is the social media today 4.14 billion people use social media 53 of the world they use social media and the most popular and famous among the all the social media is the facebook as of october 2020 facebook has got 2.701 billion monthly active users the second most famous social media it is a youtube which has got two billion monthly active users third is the whatsapp which again has got two billion monthly active users the fourth it is the facebook messenger which has got 1.3 billion the fifth is the wechat which has got 1.206 billion monthly active users in the sixth it is the instagram which has got 1.156 billion users as of 2020 and the list goes on amongst the top 20 social media platforms that are there we have also the snapchat which has got 433 million monthly active users we have the pinterest which has 413 million monthly active users we have the twitter which comes on the 18th in the list has got 333 million monthly active users as of october 2020. we have to use as much as possible of the social media to convey our condemnation against the evil that has been done we have to condemn if anyone insulted the prophet or anyone other islamic blasphemy on the social media for example my social media the facebook has got 22.6 million followers it is the largest amongst any malaysian resident whether it be a malaysian citizen or a malaysian pr holder there is no malaysian pr holder or citizen a malaysian resident which even has half the followers alhamdulillah what i have on my facebook we did a campaign on the facebook for five days only on posts and we put 16 posts then we had some videos which went on for in the few days in this one week alhamdulillah the total number of people who viewed our post and video was somewhere close to 45 to 50 million alhamdulillah we also did on the youtube on the youtube mashallah there are 2.2 million subscribers and one video posted against what macron said about islam and in a span of three days more than half a million people saw it so depending upon whichever social media platform you have irrespective whether the numbers are small or big you have to put it onto the social media platform and make it reach as many people as you can if you cannot say something yourself if you cannot write something yourself what you should do you should go to the social media platforms of other islamic speakers there can be other islamic scholars or other muslim leaders and see what they have said after maybe watching 25 30 40 50 of them you can select the best that you wanted the best that you feel and you can forward it onto your social media platform or to your friends to your non-muslim friends to your muslim friends and this is the least you can do and believe me it is absolutely free what you can do you can go online there are many articles available on a beloved prophet muslim written even by non-muslims by muslims we have a small booklet written on the life of the prophet peace be upon him by a hindu prophet ramakrishna your article is attained by lee martin by thomas carlyle by michael h chart pick this up and forward it there's a very good syrah which is called the sealed nectar by sheikh safir ahmad mubarak fury and it won an award you can take it in the pdf forward it to a non-muslim friend to your muslims very easy you can go on the website and pick up a good translation in the language you feel is the best whether it be english whether it be malay whether it be hindi whether it be urdu pick up the translation forward to a non-muslim friend very easy it doesn't cost you anything not even a penny this is the least a muslim can do after condemning the act in his heart number three he can distribute pamphlets dealing with the life of the prophet or small booklets or he can distribute copies of the quran copies of the translation of the quran he can take it up for muslim organization he can buy it from the bookstore point number four is that he should see in his list of contacts that who are the most influential people that he knows who are the top 10 or top 25 or top 50 opinion makers in his contacts and depending upon each one's capacity he may know maybe the prime minister he may know the home minister the religious minister him in a local politician he may know a celebrity listing no defeating in a part many men or the chairman of the society whoever you know make a list of the 10 most influential people in your contacts or 25 influential people or 50 and convey to them the message personally either on phone or on a personal text message that see this is what has happened so once a person has insulted the prophet we have to take action what happens when many people tell those opinion maker one person tells to them they may not be bothered but when many people write to them those who knows he gets into action and this is very important point number five is that there can be big billboards put in important cities on the main crossroad where you find a lot of traffic you can have the billboard for a month and sayings of the beloved prophet what other non-muslims have praised the prophet you can write verses of the quran where allah says in the quran and surah kalam that verily the prophet standeth on the highest standard of character a similar message given in the quran in surah azab chapter number 33 verse number 21 that verily in the prophet you'll find a beautiful pattern of conduct these verses let the people read when they are going by when they're passing by you can put similar posters or holdings on the bus on the cars on the taxis so more people will watch it whatever way you can promote it you can propagate you can have street place street place enacting place and you can have place condemning what people have done against islam see to that in schools you let your children enact this place and give short speeches on the life of the prophet the sixth is that you can protest against the evil action you can protest if someone has insulted the prophet and depending upon how serious the matter is sometimes you should take action only on the first three points sometimes four points depending upon the seriousness of the insult or derogatory remark against islam you may only indulge in the first five points or seven points or eight points or maybe all 15 points the sixth point is there should be a protest there should be a mass gathering so people get together and they condem this evil action they condemn the insult to a prophet or any derogatory mark against islam and larger the gathering the bigger is the impact and like we had a few days back maybe 50 000 people that gathered in bangladesh against the wrong statement made by the president of france macron we had a couple of years back in chechnya where more than a million people gathered just to condem against the insult made against the prophet so larger the gathering the better is the impact and when these gatherings take place you can give a letter to the embassy or the continent of that country like in this case it was the president of france who spoke against the prophet who spoke against islam who had sketches put on the buildings of france so we can call the french embassy or give a letter to the french embassy or the french concert telling we condemn the actions and the sayings of your president of your country president macron the seventh point is that we should boycott the products if the country which is condoning the insults or if the government of that country accepts that these incentives are correct and should be against the prophet what we should do we should ban the product of that country and we had done that in 2006 when the danish cartoons were there and danish country went in a loss of more than two billion dollars now we have to ban the french products or the services provided by france and in the 16 posts my five posts were only dedicated to banning the french products and my share of the first four posts in a span of three days it had 22 million views with each post on average five and a half million one post went up to seven million albums so whichever way we can we should boycott these products of that particular country point number eight is that we should contribute financially whatever we can for this course if you're a rich man give a big amount if you're a poor man you can give ten dollars give five dollars allah will see the percentage you give not the amount to give if a person who is a millionaire and has the capacity to only 10 million dollars and it donates only one million dollar a poor man of the capacity of donating only ten dollars and he gives twenty dollars but naturally the person who gives twenty dollars and is poor will get multiple times more up than a rich millionaire who only donates 21 million allah will see on your capacity so don't think what will i donate what will happen with my five dollar or with my 10 my social media account has only 100 people or only 500 people oh he says what million whatever capacity you have allah will judge you according to your capacity and according to your striving so we should give for this cause to organizations so that all these things can be done the ninth point is that we should make this condemnation public in the mainstream media whether it be on the satellite channel the television satellite channels the new stations it can be on the radio broadcast station that can be in the daily newspaper it can be in the weekly newspapers it can be in the magazines if you own any of the mainstream media whether a satellite channel secret that run a campaign for maybe a week or on your newspaper on your magazine or you know someone who owned the newspaper or you know someone who is in a high position in this newspaper or a satellite channel and ask him to run this campaign and surely it will benefit a lot more people in the world will come to know about it tenth point is that there should be legal action taken against this insult against the blasphemy there should be a battery of muslim lawyers who are dedicated for this cause and whenever such things take place what they should do they should immediately file a case in the court of law maybe of that country where this act has taken place or maybe in the international court of law and try and see to it that this thing is stopped and this insult is completely stopped now up to the first eight points it is meant for any common person any common man can surely follow the first eight points whatever to his capacity ninth and tenth everyone cannot do depending upon each one's capacity the eleventh point is for the politicians the countries where muslims are living in majority they should call the ambassador of that country which has condoned this act over the act has taken place and see to it that it is told to him the ambassador of that country like what happened now mashallah we have countries like turkey like pakistan like malaysia they called the ambassador of france and told them we disagree with what your president has said we disagree with what president macron has said against islam and against a prophet or if you have to voice it out you have to condemn that act 12th is if yet it persists what we should do we should have a trade embargo in that country the muslim countries should get together and allah has blessed us and has given us the good things which the world requires and we know today that oil is a very important commodity the petrol and this is mainly in the muslim countries so if the muslim countries which are main exporters of petrol for example saudi arabia uae kuwait oman malaysia they get together and they see to it that we will stop supplying petrol to this country i know you may think there may be a financial loss unless with you don't worry the more you support the cause of allah they will support you and if you put a trade embargo surely they will think 10 times before speaking against the prophet number 13 is if it is very high if the insult against islam is very high we have to cut all diplomatic relations with that country and this was done a few decades earlier by the muslim countries against israel when israel did atrocities and killing against the palestinians and operations the arab countries and muslim countries got together and we cut all diplomatic relationships with them one or two countries started many years back and unfortunately now in the last couple of months some of the countries had again become friendly and opened the consulate this is completely disunity we muslims should be united how can a country which is killing our muslim brothers and sisters which is against islam how can you again develop friend relationship with them the fourteenth is that they should be specialized organizations which are mainly meant for this cause which are mainly meant to reply to insurance against the prophet replied to attacks against islam if someone is attacking a muslim die these organizations should be full-time dedicated for this course the other organization like for example we are the organization we have dedicated maybe one or two weeks for this cause against the protest etc but imagine a full year we are only doing protest who will do the dawah sometimes what happened all the muslim organization leave everything and they jump into the thing yes that can be for a few days one or two days can be for a week can be for two weeks can be for a month but not always so when we are full-time dedicated organizations only for this cause which have got full-time cyber troopers which are involving in the social media checking who's attacking islam and replying to them if it's just a small level attack or having a battery of small lawyers maybe four or five lawyers in each organization if such organizations are there in every muslim country or in most of the major cities which are controlled by muslims and if anyone does any action against immediately they can do action and in such greater calls like what happened about the danish cartoons or what the french president said they can continuously follow up for the full year and the others they can go back to the activity so that there's no loss for islam so these organizations fully dedicated for replying to attacks against islam and point number 15 and the last point is that the muslim countries should unite together and this unity should solely be for the cause of islam we should forget our political differences unite together as one block and if anyone attacks islam we are together if they attack the prophet we are together if they attack the quran we are together if they attack allah we are together not that oh how can i say something in this country because there's so much of export and import going on if you strive for the cause of allah will take care of all your problems now what we find many muslim countries afraid to speak against country which are speaking as islam because they are afraid that they will lose business if the muslims are united and if all the muslim countries today the 57 muslim countries in which muslims and majority if all don't want to at least start with five six countries tomorrow it will be seven tomorrow it will be eight then it will increase and this unity should only be for the cause of islam for the cause of allah and israel and if this is done if muslims are united no one will ever be able to point a finger at us and i would like to give you example to prove this if you have heard of sultan abdulhamid ii he was the last active caliph of the atman empire which had power he was the third last but the other two were very weak he was the last one which actually had some power and in his reign in 1880s or 1890s in france they were going to conduct a comedy play against the prophet and when sultan abdullah too heard about it he got very angry and wrote a letter to the french government saying that i have heard that there is a plague going to take place and i want that this play should not take place and it should be banned initially france tried to sway away from it but when they came to know that sultan was serious they immediately banned that play and to please the sultan the people who are going to enact the play and the comedy they send them on exile to uk imagine though the ottoman empire was towards its lower side in strength yet the muslims were united later on the sultan comes to know that the same play is going to be enacted now in uk this island gets angry and he writes a similar letter to the uk government saying that this play was supposed to be enacted earlier in france and they wrote a letter and they stopped it they banned it even you banned it so they get a reply from the uk government saying that uk is not france and we believe in freedom of expression sultan abdullah me too got very angry he wrote a stronger letter saying that if you do not ban this comedy i will inform the full muslim world about this and what you are doing against a prophet of islam and if anything happens after that you will be responsible for the consequences the uk government was so scared that they immediately banned that comedy imagine at that time france was so powerful uk was so powerful but the muslims were united because the muslims were united they did not want to cross swords with the muslims because we had the caliphate and at that time though it was towards the last part of the ottoman empire even though uk and england had so many colonies they were ruling so many parts of the world yet they were afraid of sultan because of the unity of the muslim and do you know at that time muslims were much smaller number than what we are maybe they were less than 15 percent of the world population today the muslims are more than 25 of the world population today the muslims are more than 2 billion don't listen to the statistics of those people who are not aware of today according to authentic statistics in 2020 october there are more than 2 billion muslims more than 25 percent of the world population are muslims imagine if we are united what would have happened at that time when we were a smaller number we were a smaller percentage at that time the non-muslim were afraid if the muslims unite no non-muslim today will ever have the cuts to insult the prophet to insult islam the problem is that we are disunited if we unite we will never face the problem that we are facing today and believe me allah does not require us i believe these incidences are taking place allah is allowing it to take place to test the muslims that who is really striving to support the prophet is only testing us for allah to take care of this is very easy easily can take care of all this he is allowing these things to happen to see how are the muslims reacting to test this person has a muslim name but actually he's a monarch allah is doing just to test we as muslims should see how much do we strive in the cause of allah and a beloved prophet was allah said that anyone is not a believer until he loves me more than his father more than his children more than whole of mankind hadith in say bukhari worm number one hadith number 15 hadith number 16 says that a person will take the sweetness of belief if he has three things if he loves allah and his rasool more than anything else in this world number two is that if we love someone for the sake of allah and that person loves them for the sake of allah and number three he would never like to go back to disbelief to kuffar like you'd never like to go into the hellfire and allah doesn't require you and me the rubbish that we are unless sufficient allah clearly says in the quran in surah chapter 9 verse number 61 that anyone who abuses the messenger of allah will have a painful punishment allah doesn't require us allah gives a similar message in surah azam chapter number 33 verse number 57 that indeed anyone who abuses allah and his messenger allah will curse him in this world and the hereafter and will prepare for him a humiliating punishment allah doesn't require you and me that we are allah can take care and protect his messenger and i start my talk by quoting the verse of the quran from surah al kausar where allah says in chapter number 108 verse number 123 for lillian that we have granted thee the fount of abundance allah the lord of mankind has given the font of abundance in jannah the river and fountain of abundance called al-qausa given to the prophet who are we if allah is praising him the full humankind is against the prophet doesn't matter at all allah says turn to thy lord in prayer and sacrifice and anyone who hated thee hates prophet muhammad peace be upon him he will be cut off from all future hope allah doesn't require you and me the rabbi that we are and allah promises in the quran i would like to end this talk with the verse of the quran which is mentioned three times in the glorious quran in surah chapter 9 verse that allah has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that it will pray with all the other religions over all the isms whether it be christianism hinduism buddhism judaism atheism modernism socialism islam is destined to supersede all could master them all well here however much the unbelievers don't like it however the muslims don't like it and in one verse order three he ends it by saying what and enough is allah is a witness i like to end this that may allah give us hidayah to follow the guidance given the quran and they say hadith and unite the muslims as one inshallah"
