  "title": "Difference between Epidemic, Pandemic and Plague â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "by said Imam do pandemic and plague refer to the same thing pandemic by definition means it is different than epidemic an epidemic is a disease which becomes very prevalent in one particular locality if it gets more prevalent it's called an epidemic it spreads and it spreads to a locality maybe to one country or two three countries and it causes a lot of damage and death pandemic is something which is worldwide according to World Health Organization does not give exactly the number of countries for it to be called as pandemic but if it's prevalent in many countries across the world it is called as pandemic as far as plague is concerned plague is an epidemic it is one type of epidemic disease like as was told Allah send the plague on the people of Iran so plague is one type of at one type of epidemic for which a beloved Prophet Muslim said that anyone dies in play is called as a matter and anyone during a plague whether he dies or whether he's infected and does not die or whether he is prevalent in the plague and doesn't get infected but he has faith in Allah and he believed that nothing will happen to him except what is ordained Allah he gets the reward of a matter so this is specifically only for plague but some the some Scholars may say it may include epidemic other epidemics or other pandemics but what Hadith especially talking is only about plague so so every plague is an epidemic but every epidemic is not a plague"
