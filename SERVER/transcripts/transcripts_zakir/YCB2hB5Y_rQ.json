  "transcript": "does one who is making up kadas have to make them up consecutively or at random for a person who has missed his fast in Ramadan while he's making B fast there are two rulings there are two groups of Scholars one group of Scholars says that it should be consecutively it is based on Hadith which is present in as Al which says that if a person who has missed the fast in Ramadan he has to make up the fast consecutively but this Hadith is ath it's a weak Hadith there is another Hadith which is present in which says that a person who's making up for theas he can either make it consecutively or he can make it separately the way he pleases so the right ruling is that both options are available he can do it the way he wants because the quranic verse says in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 184 that if a person is sick if he's ill or if he's on a journey he should make up the fast later from the other days once Ramadan is over he can fast any other day in the same message repeat in the next verse in Surah Bak chapter 2 verse number 185 that it says that you have prescribed to fast in the month of Ramadan but if anyone who is ill or on a journey he has to to make up the prescribed periods from the other days so based on this right ruling is that the can be kept anyway whether consecutively or it can be kept separately the choice is his there is no one particular Hadith which is authentic in which the prophet said how the KFA should be kept or it describes how the prophet kept but there are other Hadith which speak about the call of the sahabas there the call ofn Abbas with him inkari volume number three in the book of fasting chapter number 40 abas with him said that a person who has missed the fast in Ramadan he can fast separately if he pleases there's another call in of Abu him he said that if a person who wants to make up for the fast has missed in the month of Ramadan he can fast consecutively if he pleases so the right ruling is that the fast can be made together if a person pleases if he made 15 fast he can fast 15 fast together or he can fast at random one fast a week one fast a month or once a fornite the choice is his"
