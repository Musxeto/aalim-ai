  "transcript": "but prophet muhammed peace be upon him was the last and final messenger i started my talk by quoting a verse from the glorious quran from surah azab chapter number 33 verse number 40. which says peace be upon him is not the father of any of you men but he is the messenger of allah and he is the seal of the prophets allah is all knowing full of knowledge because prophet muhammad peace be upon him was the last and final messenger of almighty god he was not sent only for the muslims or only for the arabs allah says in the quran in surah ambiya chapter number 21 verse number 107 verma we have sent thee not but as a mercy to all the worlds as a mercy to all the creatures as a mercy to the whole of humanity allah repeats the message we have sent thee not but as a universal messenger giving glad tidings and warning them against sin but most of the human beings yet do not know because prophet muhammad peace be upon him was the last and final messenger and no other messenger no other prophet is going to come after him that's the reason he was not sent only for the muslims or for the arabs he was sent for the whole of humankind we muslims because we believe that the glorious quran is the word of allah is the last and final revelation of almighty god whatever the quran says we believe that's why we also believe that prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final messenger and we also believe that he was sent for the whole of humankind but most of the non-muslims the non-muslims in general they do not believe that the quran is the word of god that's the reason they may not agree that prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final messenger of god and was sent for the whole of humanity that's the reason to convince the non-muslims i'm taking the help and guidance of one of the verses of the quran which i consider as the master key for dhawa for conveying the message to the non-muslims allah says in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 64. the come to common terms as between us and you when we are speaking with different types of people the best way is as the quran says come to common terms as been us and you so let us analyze what do the various religious world scriptures have to speak about prophet muhammad peace be upon him so the non-muslims if they believe in these scriptures which they follow if it's mentioned in the scriptures if they consider it to be the word of god then they have to even believe in the message of the scriptures"
