  "transcript": "yes brother I have reward brother in Mangalore his he lived about four years back he was married then now he has a child his wife has not reverted she's still a Hindu well we had this uh argument or a talk a week back where he said that he says he's living with his wife but he said that he's told his wife that if I have to live with you you say the shahada I live with you but she still goes to the temples she does not believe in Allah but he's living with her so you know what is the right advice for him and does he have to do Nikka again and Allah please help me with this without the question that there was a non-muslim Brotherhood Islam alhamdulillah but unfortunately his life did not accept Islam he was already married before he accepted Islam we also as a child so now if the wife does not accept Islam and is not ready to say the Shada can he continue living with her he told her you would say the Shada I'll live with you otherwise so what is ruling here and when she accepted Islam again if it's on different stages then again it requires together that also can be avoided but aha to another question changes questions but yet she goes to the temples about the ruling then the scope is a bit bigger that if she had said the Shada and he thinks it's only for namesake only for his sake and yet continues going to Temple so he should continue doing so he can live with her because and at the same time try and convince her that she should not go to the temple in whatever best way first with love and affection then maybe maybe pressure I think but if she has not said the Shadow the different thing altogether then he has a limited time he cannot continue for years together fine limited time is a little specified rule in the Sharia that he can stay for one day or two weeks or two months Etc but time can be given so that she accepts Islam because they've already married before in this case since she has said the I feel he can live with her and at the same time see to it that he reverts her in the true sense and he can use various methodology love affection then pressurizing whatever it is and I feel it's possible once she has said even for namesake it's easier and then you should make it possible more convenient for her to accept Islam and say to that he uses various techniques and logic Etc to make acceptance but he can live but she do that as soon as possible she comes on the straight path I will answer the question"
