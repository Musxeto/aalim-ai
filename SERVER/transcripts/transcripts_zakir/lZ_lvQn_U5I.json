  "transcript": "if a Muslim fast with an intention of reducing his or her weight or dieting will he get the reward of fasting he or she if you're talking about reward in general Islamic they're talking about Jannah forgiveness Etc a beloved Prophet said book of fasting Hadith number two three three one that there's no fast for a person who does not intend to fast the night before intention is a must intention means foreign a person doesn't have this intention surely he will not get the religious benefits you will not get the spiritual benefits the reason why we fast that is taqwa what we discussed in the last episode as far as the other medical benefits the person does for dieting oil fee does for weight loss he may get those benefits like there are people who fast maybe for political reason people do Hunger Strike people they fast for a pressure some people fast as you mentioned for weight loss for dieting so that part of the medical benefit they may get but not the benefit completely of Islam and as Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 11 verse number 15 and 16. anyone who does any Deeds for this world Allah will show give him the reward without diminishing for this world but he will have no reward in the Hereafter except for Hellfire and he's really the person who does such deed is really misguided so fasting only for weight loss dieting is just it is Pennywise pound foolish would have realized that we have to mainly fast for think of Allah then we get the overall benefit"
