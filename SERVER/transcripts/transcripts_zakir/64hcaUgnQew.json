  "transcript": "When the school starts after a couple of days on Monday, the principal calls the parent and tells I saw your daughter. So the parents say so what's the problem? So what is the problem if you saw and they started threatening that if you don't like it we'll remove your child we'll remove our child from the school. That means the management is at the mercy of the parents. The situation is so bad that the management is at the mercy of the parents. And this was the situation of the best Islamic schools at that time. And of course when we came back, alhamdulill Allah blessed I got a son the faric who gave a talk in 1994 about one year 3 month. One year two months after marriage born in July 1994 then later on I had one daughter then second daughter. We had three children and when the time came to put them into a school we thought okay fine we want to give knowledge of din and dunya both so put them in the best English school available in Bombay top school and we'll hire the best ad to come at come to our house and we selected also we selected the best person graduate from Madina University know Arabic very well and so that He come and teach my children at home. But then me and my wife thought how can we be so selfish? Allah has blessed us. So we can have private tutors coming to our school. Pay them high salary. You know what about the other Muslim Ummah? They may not have contacts to get the best teacher. They may not have the money. So why don't we start a school? So the thought came in our mind and when we discussed with scholars from Deuban from Nadwa from Islamic University of Medina Omul Kura and said we want to have a school which has education for both the world. We want highquality Islamic education at the same time highquality formal education. I call the other subjects like English, mathematics, geography, history as formal education. I was shocked. Almost all of these people said it's impossible. I said why? They said many people tried. It's not possible to have best Islamic education and best formal education together. It's not possible. I said why? Many people tried. They failed. You can never do it. I was quite disappointed. I'm meeting with the top people of Duband of Nada all these you know Islamic seminaries of Islamic Madina and of Umul I'm talking about '9s not now ' 90s in the late '9s except one person I met that Dr. Abdahim he was one of my first teachers who was head of the ROA department in the Islamic University of Medina originally in Hind but he was expert in Arabic he knew 20 languages mashallah he was the head of the Arabic department of Islamadina he said Dr. Zakir it's not impossible but extremely difficult possible but extreme only person who gave me little hope some hope all the others said impossible what you're talking is nonsense how can you have doctor engineer together can you have that no how can you start think of this concept and I always believed And even now I believe and I always say the most important part for success. Most of us Muslim organizations they think the most important thing for success is money. That's what they think most of them. And that reminds me of the saying that may Allah be peace with him. He said the death of 1,000 pious Muslims is better than the death of one Muslim scholar. The death of 1,000 pious Muslims, religious people who pray five times a day, is better than the death of one Muslim scholar."
