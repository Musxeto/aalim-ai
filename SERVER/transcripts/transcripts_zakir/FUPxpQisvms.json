  "transcript": "the next question is regarding injections is it permitted during the fast as far injections are concerned there are different types of injections it can be intravenous injection it can be intramuscular injection it can be subu injection but the injections can broadly be classified in two types one type of injection which gives a person a nourishment which is equivalent to giving food for example if you take intravenous glucose the people who have excessive dehydration Etc and cannot take food by the mouth so normally the medical treatment is giving intravenous glucose this is sort of nourishment it is equivalent to giving food this will break the fast but if it's not a nourishment if it's only a medical treatment like insulin it can be subcutaneously or it is penicillin all these Medical Treatments which are not nourishment the body are not somewhat like food these can be given during the daytime and the fast will not break though there are some schol say that it's Mak or discouraged it's preferable if it taken after the sunset but the right ruling is that it does not break the fast because it's not any sort of food"
