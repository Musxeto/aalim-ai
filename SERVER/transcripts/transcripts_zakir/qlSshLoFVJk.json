  "transcript": "Habiba Malik from India can you list the name of reliable scholars who you turn to for fish oohs so that we also turn to them for our finishes this is the very big questions mansome can go on for asked together I will turn answer in short because which color do I turn to for my Vicky shoes you know scholars are divided into classical scholars the medieval scholars the contemporary the pre-modern the modern you know as far as a beloved Peninsula solemn said we look our shiny as based on the Quran it's a hadith on Allah and the guidance of the prophets unsubtle and a prophet said the best generation is my generation then the next generation in the next generation so after the Prophet the best other Saba's then at the turbines then other tabatha mine so when you look for any in the lead to number one is Quran then the life of the Prophet after that the Saba then turbine the turbine turbine so but Nash is the best scholars for pick if other Saba fall far exceeded the sagas then we'll be turbine then with every topic so when you look at war what was they up winning when they endeavor difference of opinion among the Sabhas and then we see the Saba then with him with some Sabha the specialize more in the Quran some in other respects some some in Meerut different different so based on that number one ah the sorrowful Pharisee Dean yes ah but after unlined is a fool with the profession in the Nuba servers then turbine debate amines then here the classical scholars that are they you have the 40 moms the imam abu hanifa Imam Malik Imam Shafi Imam humble I mean the humble may Allah have mercy on all of them there were many moms 50 hundreds of Imam were they at that time but these four dare they were their students mashallah were were were able to spend the teachings more these four mother top imams there were other top imam also what may be the student didn't promote repeating so much so these were the top 40 mom that we have and all of them masha'Allah I love them I respect them I refer to them then then we have to move on to see your mom they believe in humble them what this Malik was there but then we have an imam imam Buhari their Imam Muslim then then Abu Daoud until midday then si even imagine all these there was Hollis and I look up to them and then I checked then we have the mo facility if we proceed then we have somebody then we have good - we end the list Islam therefore I had answered it very can give a short answer so deed then we have the classic is when your Saba than in the classical scholars we have then level different than wave my Hodja who who wrote the Shara of the Bihari many then we have the many I mean you can keep on naming but the other one that I can recollect now then we then we have the medieval scholars you know a few centuries later than methania Oh earlier we then we have e mama now we then we have after a few hundred years we have anemia mashallah a great scholar then Imam if New Jersey several then coming down the line we have the refinish colors you call them contemporary scholars there or you call them the modern scholars I have divided this into two levels in two parts one which was a few decades earlier and I not living any longer and one which a living in between there are many other scholar that did not name but what I could recollect in those scholars in the recent few decades but are not living I would really that they appreciate and I don't look forward is the shaking North Amy the Sheikh Nasser Al Thani Sheikh bin baz and unfortunately these three great scholars of our tank you know when I mean when we started doing now earlier the they expired within a few years a span of few years I mean the late nineties or the early 2000s and after that at that time that I believe one of the best call is living that time was up the left did you bring check up the Lebanon GB again he's from Bria then I met him several times and whenever I had any problems have to go to him and look forward to his reply at that time you have one of the best living scholars and Allah also my lifted him mashallah and may Allah grant Jana to all these fellows were mentioned may Allah have mercy on all of them Ramallah now that we have among the scholars really frankly now we have very few handful of scholars who we can really call them scholars however many what we really can you know the the level of level of six and the level of intelligence and the way to reply and to analyze according to me one of the best scholars today living or to be scholars one would be Sheikh Mohammed SL at the door he saw Mauritania worse in the past few is he living in Turkey in Istanbul and I have been meeting him for several years alhamdulillah the last time at him was at the care and before that when I was in Turkey he is one of the best living Islamic scholars in the world as well as Sheikh Abdulaziz Rafi and the other one that I can think of and again leave me check mama Solomon Rajat and all these scholars every year Michele I meet them many times for the last several years I've been meeting them except you know now some of them are in custody so in the last couple of years that they have been custody I could not meet some of them so these that I can think of today are the top scholars and were referred to but you have to realize that there are different specialities for example the speciality of Islamic finance in Islamic finance previously I know I used to discuss with dr. omerta Chopra he's Indian then became a Saudi and dr. Siddiqui he's from India gay and they were very well known in some finance and the one that again the maximum knowledge as Isis Lamech finances concerned is his doctor come he's an Egyptian he's yet alive but very old man like give him health and later on he spent many years in Pakistan and he was the founder of the Islam guru Saudi in Islamabad in Pakistan and he was the one who made the university or the rector for many years I think he spent 19 years day if I'm not mistaken then he shifted to Dubai and he is Michele referring to me the father of Islamic banking you're the chairman of more than twenty stomach bangs yes converted many conventional Bank fresh lamech bank and the maximum knowledge that I gained when I sat with him for us together we also invited him to Bombay for the Islamic peace conference I think in 2007 or 2008 I don't remember so in terms of Islamic finance knowledge one of the large one of the best scholars today living if dr. Hamid Hassan Hassan and the other one if move to take his money masha'Allah Mawlana move to Turkish man is also a great scholar these true scholar the one of the highest in the field of Islamic finance he from Pakistan and I met him a couple of times when he came to Malaysia masha'Allah he has great knowledge and what we find that in finance the hanafis for aha then if you scholars have done more advanced research on Islamic finance I've compared to others so each one has its speciality so in finance but natural I would believe more in most ethically lose money or dr. a medicinal Sun then shake the do Brujo that didn't a speciality each field like in lugar according to me one of the best person of lying to me is dr. farmer named dr. farm there him originally in Indian then shifted to Saudi Arabia and he was the head of the local department in the starting when local department for non Arab started in the Islamic industry Medina and when I tried to find which is the best teacher I can learn with I someone told me it is from the rim I said how will this person give me time so I went there and I was shocked he said you know I was there the lecture you gave a few weeks back in Medina was there on the city in the first row so mashallah he agreed to give me five hours every day and we were supposed to spend six months so that the diameter cord Mahama my my my Saudi resident permit in the year 1997 and unfortunately I could spend hardly about three three and half weeks with him there was an important issue in India to go back so for three weeks Marshall I sat with him five other day immediately after the zohar sala up to the end of Maghrib just before Maghreb spend about 4-5 every day and there I learned he was one of my first few teachers mashallah and the knowledge he has seen has he knows about 70 languages the fluency here mashallah and then the other person I studied was also great in the Haditha the doctors ar Rahman ask me notice ar-rahman ask me again in the Indian will be shocked to know you was a Hindu then he migrated to Saudi Arabia he did his master did bachelor's master's PhD became the head he became the Dean of the Haditha Department in Islamic resident Medina and I have to sit with him twice a week and my basis of hadith I learned from him mashaallah he's a great scholar and he has compiled after he retired in the past he spent about nine eighteen years in compiling all this I had it in one volume and that was might be there when I have to speak in lecture to the Quran and say has did nowhere in society yeah Bukhari Muslim but that's what all so what he did he spent about 15 to 20 years and compiled all this ideas in one volume and called it Jamaica mill and that's in that's printed in twelve volumes there's a motor server in of it which is in five volume and we are translating into English and you know when I said for an install even if not hundred percent you can easily claim that more than 95% of this I Haditha there and then this hadith is also then Bukhari chapter number soils overall number so and so also then Muslim also they're not without so all they say I did you can find in that he though there are other scholars in the field of science is they like dr. Moseley he specialized in science then you opportunity that's a nanny in science so they wear it when terms of faith issues as I told you that there are many scholars there are other scholars also there are there many like Sheikh Saud nasarah she three he's also great scholar but the one that I really appreciate amongst all of them is Sheikh Mohammed the son of the do Sheikh Abdullah the Tracy and and Sheikh masala and murajjab and worship of masala immunity has done that masha'Allah he has his own own website if some training which is the most popular Islamic website in the world and most popular site if you have any questions the best answer you can get is go to Islam qne it's in 14 languages hope this answers in short it's a very short answer you can elaborate for us together on this"
