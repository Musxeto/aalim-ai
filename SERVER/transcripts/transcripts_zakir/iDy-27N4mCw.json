  "transcript": "which is the best arabic tafseer of the quran available that has been translated into english as far as arabic the facilities are concerned there are many tafasis arabic the two most well known amongst all the arabic of acids is of tabri and the other is a bricosia there are many other fashions for example kurtobi then zamakshiri kashaf and various others but the two most famous are tabari and bricacie only abner kasir has been translated into english by many other publishers including from riyadh the name of the commentator of the quran tabari the full name is and he was born in 224 eh after injury and died in 310 age after history at the age of 86 and according to ibn khazema he says that he has read the book from the start to the end and he does not know of any person more knowledgeable than abner in the full world as far as knowledge of the quran is concerned there are many comments by mary various scholars on the commentary of a tabari another famous person sheikh al-islam ibn he says regarding this commentary he says that amongst the commentaries available now at his time he's talking amongst the commentaries available at his time the best commentary is of a nigeria than atabri because he gives the views of the salafs of the predecessors the surface solution and he also quotes from authentic sanad is authentic he does not quote sources which are dubious which are doubtful neither does he quote bidah that's innovation that is the reason sheikh al-islamiyah preferred his committee the best and in another book he has given his comments again sheikha islamic literature he says that tabri he quotes from the sahabas from the turbines and the turbines that the followers of the turbine and even give the exact sanat mentioning each name so those who are scholars it's good for them they can go back and check each ravi each narrator and check his authenticity which may not be useful for a lame and common man like you and me you know he says she could islam yeah that a common man is only interested in knowing whether that is he may not be interested in the senate so therefore this comment is very good for the scholars and the seekers of knowledge the other arabic to see which is very good and very famous it is and the name of the commentator of this tafe the full name is ismail ibn kasir al-tamakshi his commentary according to suthi he says there has not been a commentary written similar to abner kathy's commentary and if you read it because commentary he gives cross references and he quotes other verses of the quran he gives the commentary of the quran from the quran itself he quotes the other hadith say hadith and many a time he even gives the specially if it's a muslim because you're the person who had memorized the full of muslim ahmed so it becomes helpful for a person to check whether it's right or wrong so if nikace it says mashallah's commentary is very good so these two communities are tabria and ibrahim are the best in short as far as these two best communities are concerned atabri is more famous and better but especially for the scholars and the seekers of knowledge it may not be good for a layman or ordinary person but as far as abner kasir is concerned it's good for the scholar as well as the seeker of knowledge as well as ordinary muslim these two communities in arabic are the two best one according to my knowledge abdullah and allah but only abner kasir has been translated into english by many other publishers just one little point on that which is earlier earlier he died in 774 h after injury he came about four and a half centuries after the break okay thank you very much for that clarification"
