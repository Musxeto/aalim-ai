  "transcript": "alhamdulillah is special Scholars my dear speakers and my dear brothers and sisters I welcome all of you with the Islamic [Music] it's an honor and a pleasure for me to give a presentation in this conference and we speak on the topic of the virtues of Allah Allah says exalted is he who has taken a servant on a journey at night whose surroundings we have blessed to show him our signs he is seen and his hearing says that he has taken from Makkah and Jerusalem where the prophet he led the prayers may all the prophets were present and from there the prophet ascended to the heaven that is al-isra foreign we all know that Al-Aqsa is the third holiest mosque in the world but the difference between the other holy mosque is that beside the mosque be holy the land where Masjid the aksa is a sham itself is best foreign that the land we have blessed for all the worlds for all the nations in the Quran in several places that this land is blessed Allah says in the Quran in chapter number seven verse number 137. Allah says in several places number 21 and he calls this land asan the Holy Land so Allah says in the Quran several places about the blessings and the Holiness of this land it's mentioned the say Hadith of volume number six Hadith number 3954 where the Beloved Prophet Muslim said that means Allah so the prophet replied that man's Angel they spread the wings over this land it's further mentioned in Hadith number 7094 to the Beloved he prays to Allah bestow your blessings so your service as Jerusalem is concerned it's the Holy Land it's the holy city where many prophets delivered and it is sacred to all the three abrahamic faith the Jews they pray towards Jerusalem they prefacing the Willing wall that the Western walled and they consider the Al-Aqsa compound which they call as a Temple Mount they consider it as sacred as far as the Christian is concerned for then the Jerusalem is also a sacred City It's associated with and in the old city of Jerusalem is the Church of the Holy sepakra the Muslims when you call Jerusalem thank you the Holy House and and it is mentioned Hadith number two three zero nine zero a beloved Prophet Muslim said that the child be Christ he will prevail over the full Earth except with two words before the end of the world when the child will come he will prevail over the full world except it's mentioned in Muslim Ahmad Hadith number 22320 that the Beloved Prophet Muslim said there will be a group amongst my people my followers who will always openly speak the truth and no one will be able to harm them until the last time and the sambas asked the prophet where will they be and the prophet replies in Jerusalem as far as the virtues of Al-Aqsa mosque is concerned we all know that it means the foreign the old house that's the Holy House foreign [Music] the second house of Allah 40 years after most in heaven it smells inside bukhari problem number six Hadith number 492 that he says along with the prophet Qibla we Face the direction until the 17th month of victory and then we change so the first Qibla for the Muslim was Muslim up to the 17th month of hijri and then it got changed and as I mentioned earlier that was the third holiest mosque on the faith of the Earth volume number one 100 number 430 that Prophet Muhammad sallallahu he was transported that is he leads the Salah where all the prophets were pressing all the prophets were present and Muhammad it's further mentioned in word number five Hadith number 3886 they did not believe so prophet and Allah in front of him showed him and the prophet started describing the details of Masjid aksan which the quresh was shot it is number five eight eight three that when the sahabas they were discussing which has more blessings one prayer in my mosque is equal to four prayers and we know that the father for praying the mosque of the prophet is one thousand equal to prayer anywhere else that means if your brain must do that sir you get 250 times more than prayers anywhere else bukhari problem number two Hadith number 1189 said that there are only three places where you can travel for pilgrimage to a mosque and that it must do that sir is one of the three mosques where you can take it number 1408 Salaam up to Solomon peace be upon him when he completed mercedesa he prayed to Allah and asked for three things one that led the Judgment be as my judgment number two do not give a Dominion a kingdom give me a kingdom which you will not give to anyone else after that and the third was when anyone travels to this mosque solely for praying forgive all sins wash out all his sins as though he's a newborn from the mother's womb and the prophet said two prayers have been answered and I pray that even the third will answer and we know that Masjid is the only must mentioned by name besides only these two mosques are mentioned in the Quran mining and when we read the history we come to know and most Scholars say that masjidasa was built by other Melissa then it was rebuilt by Abraham later on the main building I started Construction without their Islam it was completely and later in 580 the Babylonians came and conquered Jerusalem the king of Babylonia he conquered Jerusalem and he destroyed Merced for the Jews they called it as the Temple of Solomon it was sacred for them also later on in 167 BC the Jews they rebuilt and in 70 CE the Romans they came and again they conquered Jerusalem and they destroyed the Muslim and so much so they were against the Jews and the Muslims that they made the compound of madridasa a plain ground and they used it only for dumping silk dirt and muck it was later on in 637 or 638 CE the second California second Calif of Islam Allah be pleased with him he liberated Jerusalem Patriot esophagus he said I will only give the keys of Jerusalem to the leader of the Muslims he came all the way to Jerusalem took the keys and without bloodshed he liberated Jerusalem as well as and he identified the spot where the Prophet had prayed he cleared it he cleaned with his own hands and he made a makeshift most and he prayed there more than 50 years later in 691 692 C Marwan who constructed the room of the rock the golden globe that you see that is made on the foundation next to multitasker he constructed that and it was for a long period promote the 450 years until the first first Crusaders came in 1099 CE and the Crusaders when they won the battle the conquerors looked and the massacred all the Muslims in the battle the massacred almost all the Muslims and they killed them the innocent Muslims the Bloodshed that they spill is known industry but alhamdulillah 88 years later in 1187. he again in the Battle of 18 He liberated Jerusalem and the Christian were free that this Muslim leader now will take revenge and Massacre all the Christians also like what they had done 88 years back thank you alhamdulillah the world knows that there was a sparkling difference between salad and ayubi Allah and the Crusaders he forgave everyone so much so that he said that all the non-muslims can practice their original Jerusalem if they want to stay the Christians were allowed to stay there and practice their faith the Jews were allowed to stay and practice their faith all those who wanted to go to their country anywhere else they were given safe Passage so much so that even the non-muslims they loved him and he's revered for his Humanity for his mercifulness for his forgiveness both by the East and the west but the Muslims as well as the non-muslims and after that it was under the control of Muslims until 1918 when the britishers they came and occupied Palestine and in 1947 there was a U.N resolution where Jews were made less than 10 percent but they gave them 55 of the land and the Palestinian only 45 percent then the first first Arab Israel war took place in 1948. where the Jews they captured about 78 of the Palestinian land and the second Arab is that what took place in 1967 and they captured the Asian slim and they had security outside there are people that tell us what is the solution people say that the people who are the first inhabitant of the land they are ruled over the land which I disagree I disagree that people who are the first inhabitant of the land are the rule of the land but even if you agree for sake of argument from history we come to know that the first people who settled in Palestine in Palestine were the Canaanites they were the Arabs a tribe from the Arabian peninsula in 6000 BC 600 years after Abrahim in 1400 BC did the Jews settle there that means 4500 years before the Jews came to Palestine the Arabs were settled there and later on in 73 they were kicked out by the Romans so I don't agree that the person who comes first is the ruler but even if that's the case yes the main rule of the world is the owner of the full world I will create a God almighty and those people who follow the laws of Allah and Allah says chapter number seven verse number 128 that to Allah belongs they are the full world and he gives it a Heritage to whichever slaves he wants then give it to whoever he wants and those who are blessed are the ones are the pious people that means the real rule of the lands are those who establish the law of the great Allah if there is Arab tribe which is doing not on the heat doesn't do justice they have no right rule in the world they are known right to rule that Earth the rightful people are calling the Quran are the people who are on tahit and on Justice hey all the Muslims in the world we have to unite as one ummah these borders of the countries were made later on ummah is one and the lion of Allah and we pray to Allah for the Palestinians whose rights have been taken we pray to Allah it's the duty of the Muslims that we see to it that we befit we ask for help in sujud in the last one third of the night foreign to protect the Palestinians many of our homes have been rampaged the houses have been destroyed many of them have been tortured in the message that they are and Allah tells us in the Quran chapter number two verse number 214. talking about the people the adversities and the problems they faced that the spirit was broken so much so that the messenger and the Believers they prayed when will the help of Allah come verily the help of Allah is here today the Muslim ummah is weak we are very feeble and we don't know what to do and Allah says in the Quran chat number three verse 139 that despair not let not your heart be broken Superior is the one who's on faith so the Muslims should stick to our faith and inshallah victim to us and Allah says in the Quran chapter 3 verse 103. hold to the Rope of Allah strongly that is the Glorious Quran and be not divided if you Muslim the United and if you're not divided inshallah and we are on the Faith with taqwan inshallah [Music] that may he liberate Palestine and may he give us an opportunity at least to pray once before we die I'd like to end my speech that the police Quran in chapter 17 verse number again for falsehood it's by its nature born to perishable [Applause]"
