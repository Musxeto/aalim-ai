  "transcript": "Dr Zaki other to your mind any important sunnis of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam that people avoid because they feel it will nullify their fast yes there are a few sunnahs of the Prophet which many Muslims avoid thinking if you break their fast or it is makro and the most important Sunnah of the Prophet which people avoid doing Ramadan is using the Savage using the tooth stick many Muslims feel that if they use this it is makro the main reason is there's a Hadith which is mentioned in say buhari volume number three book of fasting Hadith number 1900 and 4 where the Beloved Prophet Muslim said I swear by Allah in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad that the breadth of the person who fasts is more sweeter to Allah than the scent of Musk now based on this Hadith many Muslims think that if they use this the breath the bad breath or the fall breath of the person who fast will not be there and it will not please Allah that's the reason avoid using Sava now these people they fail to realize that when we use the stick it does not remove the breath the foul breath or the breath which people normally don't like of the person who fast the sivak mainly brushes the gums it cleans the teeth it helps in keeping the teeth healthy but in no way does it reduce the breath especially of the person who fast and furthermore there's a Sunnah of the Prophet where Prophet Muslim he said it's mentioned say buhari volume number two Hadith number 887 said that if it wouldn't have been too hard for my ummah before every prayer or to use the tooth sticks is a requirement before Salah the prophet is and here he did not mention any exceptions or they would have said Arabic compulsory foreign except during fasting this important Sunnah surely if this would have been makro while fasting or abnullified the fast surely you would have mentioned it so this proved that this is important Sunnah which Muslims should continue doing even during the month of Ramadan even while fasting it will not nullify the fast it's not macro in fact it is it's encouraged and the other important Sunnah which people neglect or avoid mainly fearing that it will spoil the fast or nullify the fast is putting water in the nostrils sniffing the water normally especially during so many of the Muslims even when they do hudu they just get the water close to the nose and touch the tip of the nose to the water that's it they don't put the water into the nostrils and they clean their nose they don't sniff it which is a requirement for Urdu thinking that if they sniff it may break the fast water entering through the nose into your throat will nullify the fast but the chances are very negligible what a beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned number two Hadith number 2360 a beloved Prophet said that when you do Voodoo sniff the water excessively except in fasting so normally when we do hudu we sniff the water excessively except in fasting because in fasting if we sniff excessively there are chances though very negligible for it to enter the throat and nullifying your fast but normally when we put water in the nostrils there are no chances of it going in the throat if only care that we have to take while fasting is don't sniff excessively but we have to put the water in the nostrils and clean the nostrils which is important for now which many of the Muslims neglect and they avoid it especially during Urdu and here since the prophet clearly mentioned except fasting during the sivakh he said I would have made it compulsory had it not been difficult for my ummah there because it doesn't say fasting it means that Shiva can be used while fasting and sniffing should not be done excessively but normally water should be put in the nostrils while doing so these two important sunnahs which people out of ignorance they avoid during fasting"
