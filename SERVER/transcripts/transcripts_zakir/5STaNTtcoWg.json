  "title": "Thank Allah even in Calamities, and Make Allah Your Partner in Business - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "And Allah says in the Quran in surah bakar chapter number two verse number 156 Allah says that for the believers whenever there is any calamity they say to him we belong and to him we return. Just a few days ago there was a person who called me and said shake my father has been admitted into hospital. He had heart attack. So I said rajun he said shake my father hasn't died. I said yes I know. Why did you say that? I said brother in a Muslim ummah they feel if someone dies we say this from him we come and to whom we belong. When anyone dies we say yes we can say that but for any calamity one of the calamity is death okay but even if someone is sick and you say that so many people think okay do you want me to die I say no no no I'm praying to Allah so this is a misconception amongst some of the Muslims or many of the Muslims I would say so this dua that from him we come from Allah we come to Allah we belong and to him we return. It's a dua that any calamity suppose electricity goes off in the mosque or something happens the AC goes off any calamity small or big you can say this dua so this is a verse of the Quran and our beloved prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said it's mentioned in Sai Muslim volume number 7 had number 7500 7500 in which the prophet said that for a true believer He's always says alhamdulillah. When any good thing happens, he says alhamdulillah and thanks Allah. When any calamity befalls, he yet says alhamdulillah. He has faith in what happened is good and he says alhamdulillah. This state of a believer can only be for a muslim. Imagine you're going in loss and you're saying alhamdulillah. You know some people I meet how are you brother it could have been better for how can a Muslim say that could have been better you know these are statements from western world you pick up and you think you're smart how are you it could have been better these are statements made by western world you pick it up it loses your iman you say alhamdulillah if there is a loss alhamdulillah only 20% loss maybe I would have lost 50%. You say alhamdulillah when prophet is alhamdulillah when lost this is only a state of a believer and a beloved prophet wasallam said it's hadith of bkari 6258 where the beloved prophet said that if I was given a mountain of gold as big as mount o I would distribute it in less than 3 days except take a little bit to pay off my debt. Because the richest people in Akara would be the poorest one except those who spend in the way of Allah and they are very few. Make note of this hadith that the richest people in the Akar would be the poorest people except for a few those who spend in the way of Allah subhana wa t'ala and they are very few. wealth the Quran says is a fitna. Fitna means test. So when you get rich don't be happy. When you are rich your test is more difficult. If you pass you get higher reward. Therefore even the sabas who are richd may Allah be pleased with him before entering Jenna will be questioned because he was rich. Therefore I tell to all the rich people Allah has given you immense wealth then make Allah your partner in business and when you make Allah your partner you cannot make him a small partner correct make him at least 51% partner so whatever you earn at least give 51% in charity then you are safe generally the Islamic ruling is that if you have wealth more than the nab level you have to give 2.5% this is fur for every rich person who is not a fak who's not a fuk who's not poor yes give 2.5% that is the sharia but if you're extremely rich this is my suggestion it's not part of the sharia it's my advice that if you want to be safe Allah has made you a millionaire other people earning maybe few hundred a month you are earning $50,000 a month $100,000 a month what do you You make Allah your partner. Even if you give more than 50% yet you'll be multiple times richer than the poor man. When my son started business two years back I said my son when you start business minimum 51% you give to Allah subhanaa tala minimum. I'm a veteran so I give more afterwards maybe you can maybe compete with me or catch up with me. minimum. The more you get, the more you receive. So wealth is a fitna. Allah says in surah taba chapter 9 verse number 34 and 35 that those who hold wealth and spend it not in the way of Allah, Allah will in the hellfire and akar will brand you on your forehead, on your flanks and on your back and Allah will say have the taste of the wealth you hold it. What is money? And unfortunately for many of the Muslim money is the most important."
