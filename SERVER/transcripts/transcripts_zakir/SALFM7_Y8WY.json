  "title": "Reply to Critics who say that though Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was the Author of the Qur'an he said...",
  "transcript": "first we will discuss can Muhammad peace be upon him be the author of the Quran whether consciously subconsciously or unconsciously it is rather a tragedy that a person disagrees when a person disclaims that he is not responsible for any great work where the literary over the scientific but this is exactly what the Oriental is and the critics of Islam do when they say Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him while the author of the Quran never ever has the prophet ever claimed that he was of the Quran not even a single word of the Quran he never claimed it yet when he disclaimed that he was not the author and the Quran happens to be a masterpiece in the work of Arabic so why will a person disclaim the responsibility of a work which is a masterpiece why should he lie and we know from history from his youth till the day he claimed prophethood at the age of 40 years never has a single lie reported to have been said by Muhammad peace be upon Him history never reports a single lie and before he claimed prophethood he was known for his truthfulness his honesty and Chastity and he was given the title al-ameen the trustworthy by friends and foes alike and there are several examples even those people after the prophet claimed prophethood and they said that he was lying yet his enemies his foes they kept their value bills with the profit for safety and this is known when the prophet migrated from Makkah to Medina and he told his name Allah peace with him that give this valuables to the rightful owners even if Force even after they said he lied yet they trusted him and kept the valuables with him why and we have the example sufyan who was the chief of one of the tribes of Makkah when he went to Emperor Heracles and asked him for support against the prophet and when the emperor asked him that do you know of any instance in which the prophet lied or has he done any Injustice even though he was the enemy of the Prophet that time he had to reply no so why should a person with such honesty and trust and Chastity why should he lie let us analyze the various claims made by orientalists and the grace of Islam against Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him we'll just discuss the major ones one of the claims made by the critics of Islam is that the prophet he lied that he was not the author of the Quran and said it was almighty God for material gains we know that there are many men who claim to be prophets who claim to be preachers who claim to be Saints in order to lead a luxurious life and we have hundreds and thousands of examples in this world today also but if we see the lifestyle of the prophet he led a more luxurious life before he claimed prophethood than after he claimed propheter he was married at the age of 25 to a rich Lady by the name of Khadijah and his life after claiming prophethood was unenviable so if it is for money his life should be better after claiming prophet like we see today those people who claim to be prophets and Saints and Sages furthermore we have records in several say Hadith including the Hadith Hadith number 492 that one of his wives with her she said that there were times when fire was not lit in the house for a month or two indicating that food was not cooked for a month or two in the house and we only survived on dates and water and sometimes milk given by The Neighbors there are various instances and even versus the Quran that the life was so simple though he had all the power he was the leader he could have led the most luxurious life in the whole of Arabia that is the reason that there was occasion when his wives they protested and they said that what is the need for us to lead such a life when we can live a much comfortable life immediately there was a revolution sent by almighty God and for azab chapter number 33 verse number 20-29 where it says that o Prophet tell your concerns tell your wives if they care for the enjoyment of this world and the glitter of this world I will set you free to enjoy this world and give you a handsome reward but if you care for the life in the year after you will be rewarded in the next life that means the wise the objected then why should we lead such a simple life when we can lead at least a much better life and immediately was revealed but natural wives of the prophet then death of forgiveness and the preferred the life and the Hereafter than this world we have the example in the Hadith Hadith number four six five and four six six that whenever the prophet received any gifts he never kept it for himself neither did he keep it for the future and he gave it away to the poor people and it is mentioned in this very same Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 79 foreign now imagine if the prophet would have lied that this book is from almighty God and when actually he was the author there were high possibilities that one day he would have been exposed and he would be cursing himself in the same book that woe to those who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from Allah if he would have written the Quran and attributed to almighty God would have ever mentioned in such a verse in the Quran"
