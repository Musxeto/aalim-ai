  "transcript": "Thank You dr. Campbell dr. zakir naik for your presentations as well as the response lastly we have the audience participation session namely the question and answer session to extract maximum benefit in the limited time of 60 minutes approximately that we have available we would like the following rules to be observed your question should be only on the topic the Quran and the Bible in the light of the subject of science questions out of the topic would not be entertained kindly state your question briefly and to the point this is not a lecture time neither account a question time for the questioners dr. william campbell and dr. zakir naik should answer from preemptively and each answer should not exceed 5 minutes 4 mics have been provided in the auditorium for the questions from the mics to next to the stage for the gents and - in the rare of the center aisles for the ladies those who would like to put forward a question to dr. william campbell may kindly queue up behind the mics on my left gents in the front ladies in the rare and those who would like to put forward a question - dr. Zucker may kindly line up behind the mics on my right gents in the front and the ladies in the rare I would like the audience in the balcony to kindly excuse us we are happy that this is a full session jam-packed hall but we would request you to kindly take the trouble to come down to the mics if you'd like to put forward a question only one question at a time may be put forward if you have a second question you would have to line up behind again to put forward your second question written questions on index cards from the volunteers in the aisles would be given secondary preference after the questions on the mics are handled by the speakers please write on the card to whom your question is addressed dr. William Campbell or dr. Zakir Naik so that they can be put in the appropriate boxes in front of you transparent boxes with the names dr. William Campbell and dr. Zakir Naik put on them so that the questions could be shaken up by the coordinators and the speakers themselves could select the questions at random these would be screened by the panel of the speakers to see that they are relevant and on the topic and okayed by the coordinators to be put forward on the coordinators mic with the speakers would have to answer kindly state your name and profession before putting forward your question we will allow one question at a time in ABS exact fashion alternately addressed to each speaker so first question next to the stage second question next to the stage third question on my left in the rare fourth question in the rare on my right and so on we would allow approximately 40 minutes for these questions then we switch over to the questions on the slips maybe have the first question from the mic on my left for dr. William Campbell I would like to ask dr. camp if in Genesis it says when it talks about the flood Noah flood it talks about that the water covered the surface of the earth all the creations and all the mountains and everything and it says that it covers the highest mountain of on earth and that was 15 cubits which is an Arabic 15 foot you know cut them so we know scientifically that the highest mountain on earth is not 15 foot you know it is a lot higher than that so how come the in Genesis it says that the water covered everything every single mountain on earth and the highest was fifteen foot thank you for your question I think it's saying that that is above the highest mountain if the highest mountain is 3000 meters well then the highest that it's 15 feet over 15 foots above it however brother will not allow any questions in between no counter questions please let the question uh put his question full stop then the speaker gives his answer in whatever manner he chooses thank you and I looked into this in the car in the Koran I think it actually would be understood to be the same way because it says in surah 11 verse 40 the fountains of the earth gushed forth and the waves like mountains and then it says that in in the places where it gives a list of prophets there's no prophet before Noah and so if the I know Adam can be a prophet but I'm so Noah is listed and I think that it says in the Quran too that the whole world was covered yes brother question for dr. zakir naik doctor doctor you say that there is a mistake excuse me excuse me the second question would come from the mic on my right for dr. Zakir okay you said that Allah reflects light and he's made understand that the better posed the question he didn't understand my explanation to the counter-argument of para William Campbell the gardener and Allah the Quran says in surah Noor chapter 24 was more 35 that Allah is Norris amaba'ti Willard is the light of the heavens and the earth he is a light the meaning of light in the Quran it is reflected light or borrowed light so he's asking does it mean that even Allah has got more light so the answer is giving further if you read in the worst its it's like a parable of a niche in the niche there is a lamp lamp at the light of its own that means Allah have light of its own as well as that light of its own is also being reflected the light of Allah subhana Allah is again being reflected by Allah subhanAllah pelham says like a halogen lamp that you see here it has a tube in between the lamp you can refer to that as a suraj or AHA Giardia and the reflector as you need or nude borrowed light or reflection of light and furthermore but natural this light actually doesn't refer to the physical lighter talking about it is a spiritual head of Allah subhana Allah but either answer I've given to not a william campbell and since i have got five minutes i would like to utilize it the william campbell gave a reply to nooh alaih-is-salaam i am a person who the concord is approached with the bible and conflicted proach with the quran because both way the from the villa Ronn will pass the test and even if I agree with dr. William Campbell and I agree with him it is right that it was 15 feet above the highest mountain but it's mentioned in Genesis chapter number 7 verse number 19 and 20 that the full world was submerged under water and furthermore archaeological evidence shows today and the time of Noah's time if you calculated by genealogy it comes to in the 21st to 22nd century BC archaeological evidence shows today that the third dynasty of Babylon and eleventh dynasty of Egypt were present at the 21st and 22nd century BC and there was no evidence of flood and the remain under Upton therefore archaeological evidence show us that it's impossible that the earth was submerged the full earth was submerged under water in the 21st 22nd century BC what about the Quran what about the Quran my number 1 Quran does not give a date but the 21st century BC or 50th century BC noted why number 2 no where does the Quran say the full world was submerged under water it speaks about nooh alehsalaam and his form and his people a small group of people or maybe a large group of people archaeological evidences tell today and archeology they say that we have no objection it's possible that parts of the world was submerged in the water but full world it's not possible so our hamdulillah the Quran is matching with the little discovered in the archeology but the bible does not furthermore if you read Genesis chapter number 6 verse number 15 16 it speaks about Almighty God telling you all as salaam that build an ark and it gives the length 300 cubits in length 50 cubits in breadth and height 30 cubed cubed is one and half feet the brother made a mistake it one and half feet and New International Version it says 450 feet in length and 75 feet in breadth and approximately 45 feet in height it's a cubit in height if you measure this I've done the calculation it comes to less than 150 thousand cubic feet in volume and area wise 33 thousand seven hundred fifty and the Bible says there were three flows bran flow first story second story so multiply by 3 you get an answer of 100 and 1,250 square feet that is area imagine a pair of all the species of the world was accommodated in 100 and 1,250 square feet imagine is it possible millions of species at the in the world if I tell in this auditorium 1 million people came in this auditorium will you believe I remember I think last year I had given a talk in Kerala and there are 1 million people that's the biggest gathering ever dress alhamdulillah by Allah's grace 1 million people I could not see the end it was not an auditorium it was a big beach I couldn't see anyone only few people in the front that's all few compared to the 1 million people that were there if you see on the video class they will realize how big is 1 million somewhat like Arafat you see two and half million people are fat in a area of 100 and 1,250 square feet 150 thousand cubic feet it is impossible and above that discrete for 40 days eating well per call of nature if I have 1 million people came in this order I will you believe so scientifically there are several things in which there are gross scientific errors in the Bible can we have the next question for dr. Campbell from the my Kadir a doctor Naik you said I scare easy this question is for dr. Campbell okay so next person would like to ask a question to defer dr. Campbell yes I'd like to post this question or rather this test to dr. William Campbell why don't you attempt the falsification test of the Bible given in the book of Mark chapter 16 verses 17 and 18 and prove to the audience here right now that you are a true Christian believer [Applause] well I don't agree with dr. Knights interpretation gods Jesus himself was tempted and devil said well if you're the Son of God throw yourself off the temple and Jesus said you will not tempt the Lord your God and so if I was to say and say oh yes I'm going to be sure and do a miracle in front of you I would be tempting God my friend Harry Radcliffe he had promised to go and so he decided to keep his promise and trust God to do his will it's a different situation I will not tempt God question for dr. Knight and maybe the question in the rare from the sister Jesus she's for dr. Knight at the back do you have a question for dr. Knight in the back ladies yes okay my question is just dr zakir naik the christians explain the concept of trinity scientifically by giving the example of water which can be in three states solid liquid and gas in the form of ice water and vapor similarly one God is a trait triune God Father Son and Holy Ghost is this explanation scientifically correct just to commend roof is the answer we should not tempt God she's not test God but here we on testing God we are testing the human being we should not test God but no we are testing you and God promises that any believer who has deadly poison he will not die he will do speak in foreign tongues we are testing God we know God is correct he will see to it that every believer can speak we are testing you whether I believe or not coming to the question of the sister that there are Christians who say that scientifically we can prove the concept of Trinity like how water can be in three states solid liquid and gas like ice water and vapor so similarly God is in three forms Father Son and Holy Ghost how to reply and is this scientifically correct scientifically I do agree water can mean three forms solid liquid and gas life water and vapor but scientifically we also know that the component of water remains the same h2o two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen the components remain the same the constituent remains the same the forms keep on changing there is no problem let's check with the concept of Trinity transfer of Trinity Father Son Holy Ghost form the form changes okay what sake of argument agree that's the component change God and Holy Ghost is made of spirit you made me in the made of flesh and bones they aren't the same you made me required to eat God doesn't require to eat to survive they aren't the same and this is stratified by Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself in the Gospel of Luke chapter number 24 verse number 36 to 39 he says that behold my hands and feet handed me and see for a spirit has no flesh and bones he says behold my hands and feet handle me and see for a spirit has no flesh and bone and he gave his hand and they saw and they were overjoyed and he said that do you have any meat to eat and they gave him broiled fish and a piece of honeycomb and he ate to prove what that it was God to prove that he was not God he ate and his flesh and bones a spirit has got no flesh and mode this proves that it is scientifically not possible that Father Son and Holy Ghost father Jay escaped if the Holy Ghost is Almighty God and the concept of Trinity the word Trinity does then exist anywhere in the Bible the word Trinity is not then the Bible but it is then the quran quran says in surah nisa chapter 4 verse 171 it says voila Kulu selasa don't say Trinity in the higher luckam this has published better for you then it is also their infra my the chap number five verse number seven 3 veces lets up come from Lavina Paulo in the Lassa Lassa Lassa they are doing tough they are blaspheming those who say that Allah is three in money the triune God Jesus Christ peace be upon him never said he was God the concept of breda then exist in the Bible the only worse which is closest to the concept of Trinity if the first epistle of John chapter number five verse number seven which says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one but if you read the Revised Standard Version revised by title scholars Christian scholars of the highest eminence backed by fifty different copy denominations they say this was of the Bible First Epistle of John chapter five verse number seven is an interpolation is a concoction is a fabrication it was thrown out of the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him never claimed divinity there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him says I'm God already says worship Me in fact if we read the Bible it is mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 was number 28 he said my father is greater than I gospel of john chapter number 10 was number 29 my father is greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devils with the Spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter 11 verse number 20 I with the finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number 5 verse number 30 I cannot now spell do nothing I turn off my own self do nothing either here I judge and my judgment is just for I think not my will but the will of my father anyone who said not my will but God's will he's a Muslim Muslim means the person who submitted a bill to Almighty God Zenith guys peace be upon him said not my event but God will he was a Muslim and he was a hamdulillah one of the mightiest Messenger of God we believe we believe that he was born miraculously without any male intervention we believe he gave life to the dead with God's permission we believe that he he is those born blind in the prophets got permission we respect Jesus Christ peace be upon him as one of the mightiest Messenger of God but he is not God and he is not a part of the Trinity 380 doesn't exist Quran says hola hug say he's a lover annually before we have the next question from the mic here earlier I had announced the lady should kindly queue up there unfortunately they have not queued up there so we are having a problem of balancing the questions ok what we do we disregard the labeled on the mic if the ladies want to ask from here will allow them just balance this in practical necessity the hall is jam-packed we understand we will allow now one question for dr. Campbell from here and the brer mic will be for people who'd like to ask question from the gents for dr. Zakir similarly for the ladies the front mic would be for dr. William Campbell and the rare mic would be for dr. Zakir are the people queued there for dr. Zakir yes people queued here for dr. Campbell right I think they have taken their own positions and change the position the organiser that given we respect it because of the rush in the hall when the next question for dr. Campbell from this mic thank you yes brother assalamualaikum hamdullah tonight's been praise be to Allah praise be to the One God of all mankind tonight it's been a very interesting dialogue and a dialogue at that it's talking about very noble topic for mankind for all of mankind and so we have gathered here as men of humanity and question play okay okay in the name of Allah the question is dress okay we've come here together for this event tonight it should benefit us and and so I'm asking dr. Campbell as a Christian and and with your colleagues as well has this event done its job has it opened your heart as it has it at least opened a glimmer towards looking further into the truth of Islam thank you well I think I'll use the last question to answer yours dr. Naik says there's no place that Jesus says he's God in mark 1461 he didn't answer and again the high priest was questioning him and saying to him are you the Christ the Son of the Blessed One in other words are you the Christ the Son of God and Jesus said I am so he did say I'm the Son of God and he did say he's divine and it that the the Bible clearly says I realize he's quoted the verses he wished to quote dr. doctors I wish to quote where Jesus was in his human form but there's other verses he says I and the father are one it says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God in the gut and God was made flesh and dwelt among us and Jesus baptism the Father spoke and said this is my beloved son Jesus was there and the Holy Spirit descended the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit we didn't make this thing up from our heads just look this little little thing the now my friend asked the question here we've learned many things and I'm always willing to learn but I still think that the 500 witnesses that saw Jesus after he rose from the dead have more power with me than Mohammad coming 600 years later as one witness thank you we'll allow a question for dr. zharko from the rare yes sister dr. Campbell did first attempt to bring up suppose it false facts pertaining to the Quranic views on the universe and you did refute these accusations however it was not addressed what the Bible says about the shape of the earth and its other aspects this does a question that I do not address regarding what the Bible says about the shape of their did lack of time I can point out another hundred points lack of time any of our system wants to know what is the Bible speak about shape of the earth it's mentioned in the Bible in the Gospel of Matthew chapter number 4 was the murid it says the same reference which not a william campbell news about tempting the devil took him that jesus kept peace be upon him to exceedingly high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the earth and its glory Gospel of Luke chapter number four verse number five the devil took him to a high mountain and showed him the glory of all the kingdoms of the world now even if you go to the tallest mountain the highest mountain in the world that's Mount Everest and supposingly you have a very good vision and can see for thousands of miles together yet you will not be able to see all the queen of the world because today we know the earth is spherical you will not be able to see the kingdom of the opposite side of the world the only way will be see if the earth was flat that the description what the Bible gives they are this flat furthermore the same description is repeated in the Book of Daniel chapter number four was the more ten eleven it says in a dream that the tree grew up into the heaven and then when the tree grew up into the heaven it grew up so much that everyone from all the ends of the earth they could see the tree this is only possible if the shape of the earth was flat if a tree is very long and the shape of the earth was flat it's possible today it's a universal fact that the world is fairytale you will never be able to see the tree however much long it is from the opposite side of the spherical shape furthermore if you read it's mentioned in the first chronicles chapter number 16 was the method D that the earth does not move the same is repeated in the Book of Psalms step number 93 was number one that Almighty God he has stabilized the earth that means the earth does not move and in the New International Version it says that God have established and stopped the movement of the earth as though one minute the earth is one minute left or one minute one minutes left I'm sorry to wait for one minute regarding not to William Campbell he said that Jesus Christ Peter said in the Bible in several places that he was God you can refer to my videos I said concept of God in major religion which gives all the references and the answers I'll only give you the references of what he quoted and my father of one is from John chapter number 10 was the method P and in the beginning was the word is from John chapter number one was number one you go to the context and will come to know Jesus Christ peace be upon never claimed divinity you can take my cassette which is levelled when the fire outside concept of God in major religion and similarities between some location ID which give the details that Jesus Christ peace be upon never claimed divinity time thank you the next question from the lady in the front for dr. William you mentioned the the test where a true believer can drink poison and survive because of their faith what about Rasputin who was poisoned with enough cyanide to kill 16 people and when that didn't kill him he died a blood loss he was not a good Christian he had orgies how do you explain this we're only a good Christian can drink this poison and live how do you explain that well I don't feel I have to explain it I mean if Rasputin wasn't a Christian why what happened to him has no basis for what happened in the Bible I said before Jesus God God didn't intend for us to line up here and start start taking poison and see whether he's the true God oh sorry it's we are not to test test God that was given that these guys that said that these things will happen it an example would be Paul he went to when he was in shipwrecked and he I think it's Crete but I have the wrong place in my mind and and he landed and so he was throwing wood in the fire and a snake bit him nothing happened to it but he wasn't trying to test God he was trying to throw wood in the fire it's a different situation no comment please thank you the next question from here air for dr zakir excuse yes brother excuse me sir sorry Kerry I just like to say about the circle of the earth in isaiah 40:22 it says he god sits enthroned above the circle of the earth thank you in the back foot off yes brother but dr. zakir dr. yaker you said there isn't any mistake in quran i see more than 20 mistake in arabic grammar and i will tell you some of them in lovina Emmanuel Levinas odd wasabi in rather one question at a time yeah the same thing he said in 63 in vanilla Saharan mistake in the in Iran can you explain that and there is more than that mistake the brother will allow you only the envoys who part of the question the second part will not allow because we have stated below hundred times others get a chance to okay the rather has asked a very good question I would like to be more concordance and agreeing you have mentioned all 20 grammatical points and the book is referring to Babel Fadi Abdul Fattah correct is the Quran infallible can see some things yeah under my head is good [Applause] I will answer all twenty together because I've read the book Ireland's all trending sharla inshaallah wine number one brother wine number one wine number one to be noted that all Arabic grammar is taken from the Quran Quran was the highest Arabic book a book which has the maximum level of highest literature all the Arabic grammar has been derived from the Quran Quran is the textbook of grammar since Quran is the textbook of grammar and all the grammars read from the Quran the Quran can never have a mistake why number one why number two why number two why number two it is like you know taking a ruler and the ruler if they have a measurement and not saying the measurement is wrong it sounds illogical point number two in the different types of Arabia and you know Arabic and dr. William gamble also will agree with me in different Arabic tribes the grammar keeps on changing in some Arabic tribe the word is feminine the same word is even masculine the other tribes of Arabia in different drives the grammar different changing even the gender keeps on changing so will you check Quran with that faulty gamma no and furthermore the eloquence of Quran is so high it's so high it is far superior and you know there are various books on the internet you go well if I'm article mistake 21 geometrical mistake abdul father wendy grammatical mistake do you think the christian people to cause these mistakes who taught these mistakes do you know about the Muslims the Muslim scholars like some are sorry what they did that the Quran grammar is so high that it goes against the conventional use of the Arabic the Quran Graham was so high to prove the Quranic grammar was high they gave examples and I'll give you a couple of examples which will answer all these 20 questions they give the example like we read in the Quran it says that the people of loot array Salam they rejected all the messengers did the messenger that mentioned the William Campbell said the people of Noah the rejected the messengers we know from history that there was only one messenger sent to them so it has a grammatical mistake Quran should have said the people rejected the messenger not messengers I agree with you with layman grammar like how UN I know it may be a mistake but if you read the books written by Arabs what is the beauty of the Quran the beauty of the Quran is why does the Quran defer messengers instead of messenger you know why because we know that the basic message of all the messengers was same that there is one God about tawheed or allah subhanaw taala by mentioning the people of Rupali salam the people of Noah rejected the messenger it says by rejecting luteal a Salam they are indirectly rejecting all the messengers see the beauty see the eloquence hamdulillah you might think it's a mistake it's not a mistake similarly people that and also it says that quran says kun fire kun be and it is it should be cool fatahna bien it was agreed past tense if cool [ __ ] and Arabic it's not cool fire moon but the kun fire kun is more superior it says Allah it was it is and can do past present and future thank you dr. Mike maybe have the next question from the brother in the front for dr. William Campbell yes dr. Campbell this is a very sincere question to learn little more about Christianity I want to ask that Jesus ministry was only for three years after he was baptized by John the Baptist so Jesus the second most powerful person after God the Son of God what are his contribution in his early life from first from one year to say 27 or 28 years what are his significant contributions this is a excuse me dr. Campbell this is not this is not the topic for tonight we have in the beginning of the presentation dr. Campbell mentioned zul qarnain from the chapter 18 of Quran the cave and he mentioned that her name is Alexander great can you prove me how you came to that line is Alexander the Great I only read it in the commentary of Yusuf Ali I was but regardless of whether it's Alexander the greater who it is the month the Sun doesn't sit doesn't set in a murky margwa Marsh and that's what it the first says oh yeah thank you yes sister the question for dr. Zakir I don't know the exact verse but when the Bible says for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the Son of Man be for three days and three nights the heart of the earth did jesus peace be upon him scientifically fulfilled the sign of Jonah what the sister the reformed reverse of the Bible Gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 was limited and 40 when people ask Jesus Christ peace be upon him show me a sign show me a miracle Jesus Christ peace be upon him says you evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign no sign shall be given to you but the sign of Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the whale so shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth sign of Jonah Jesus Christ peace be upon him puts all his eggs in one basket and if you go to the sign of Jonah the Book of Jonah is less than two pages and most of us know and if you analyze that Jonah was three days and three nights but Jesus Christ peace be upon him we know from the Gospels that he was put on the cross the alleys crucifixion alledged my late evening he was brought down from the cross and put in the sepulchre and on Sunday morning if you see the stone is moved away and the cephalic is completely empty so Jesus Christ peace be upon him is in the tomb on Friday night Friday night he was in the tomb Friday night he was there inside a morning one day one night one day and he was there Saturday night so two night at one day to night and Sunday morning the tumors empty so Jesus Christ peace be upon was there for two nights and one day it's not two days and three nights dr. William Campbell gives a reply in his book that you know part of the day can be counted as one day and if a patient comes to me who's sick on Saturday night on Monday morning and if ask him how long are you sick for he will say three days I agree with you Concordia's approach I agree I'm very generous you say part of the day full day I agree with you so Saturday night part of the day Monday Sunday part of the day full day one good Monday part of the day full day no problem if patient says three days no objection but no patient will ever say three days and three nights I challenge I have alhamdulillah met very patient I have not come off as a single patient including Christian missionaries wherever told to me who was sick in the night and day before yesterday saying I'm sick for three days three night so guess who deserves it three day Jesus Christ peace be upon myself three days and three nights so it is a mathematical error scientifically Jesus Christ peace be born in proof and furthermore the prophecy says as your novels so shall the Son of Man be Jonah was how how was durin the belly of the whale belly of the fish they derive all right when you are thrown overboard he was alive in the belly of the whale he goes around the ocean dead or alive I like he prays to Almighty God that I arrive I like he's vomited out on the sea show there are life alive alive alive arise when I ask the Christians how was Jesus Christ peace be upon him in the sepulchre in the tomb better life they tell me Dead Alive alhamdulillah is the Christian he feel alive alhamdulillah he was not crucified if he's dead he has been fulfilled the sign you can refer to my video cassette was Jesus Christ peace be really crucified it proved that Jesus Christ peace be upon was not crucified as the quran says in surah nisa chapter 4 157 ma market Eluga masala boo didn't kill him needed to decrease if I'm it was only made to appear so thank you doctor like dr. for the question for dr. William [Applause] dr. Campbell's since you are a medical doctor could you please explain scientifically the various medical aspects that in the Bible regarding because you didn't answer them in your rebuttal for example blood used as a disinfectant bitter water test for adultery most importantly that the woman is unclean for double the period when she gives birth to a daughter then as compared to a son thank you for the question and I'll get to it but dr. night keeps getting the questions that should be come to the mood to the Christian it says that on the next day when it sure was when after the preparation the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered together with Pilate and said sir we remember that when he was still alive that deceiver said after three days I'm to rise again therefore give orders for the grave to me made secure until the third day so they're using these words interchangeably as far as I'm concerned all of these words the third day after the third day equal what happened with Jesus in the grave the other thing is and then it's resurrection there is one other thing when Jesus was arrested on Thursday night please be quiet this is not going to work like this please be patient Thursday and when Thursday after he went he was arrested he said my time my hour has come and so I count that that's three in that three days and three nights now you've asked me about these places in the Bible I believe the Bible was written by God and I believe that God put them in there so I it's not up to me to explain what God said but I believe that God put those things in his Bible and now we will have the last question on the mic from the brother that the back for dr. zakir then we start the questions on index cards that the last question as per our time limitations please okay for dr. zakir salam-o-alaikum my name is Aslam Rauf and I'm a student studying biology right now and my teacher is teaching me evolution now and I was wondering about the Islamic answer to evolution right now if you could explain briefly what Islam says on the topic of evolution and creationism the way they ask the question just the two William chemistry in the Liberty to answer even at leat anybody know when the Quran is the name of Alexander mentioned it says dhul-qarnain not Alexandra if some commented I made a mistake it's a mistake in the commentary the men I made the mistake not the Word of God regarding the Bible saying that the world in Isaiah is the circle no problem it's a circle not spherical so one place Bible says like one page it's a circle if you agree both the verses it becomes like a disc see does it look like the earth in a circle and a flat this is not the earth regarding biology in the Quran and regarding evolution to question the bread the last I don't know whether I can answer both or not that was mine one which one first one a second one biology or evolution evolution will be the evolution are you choosing when he flew then we had the question for evolution I think to question biology first an evolution if you give me 10 mins an answer both only in five minutes whatever you can do okay fine I agree with the chairperson mr. Samuel no man I'll answer on evolution the exact answer you can refer to my videos I said karana modern science regarding when talk about evolution you start thinking about Darwin's theory and Darwin went on a ship HMS Google to Ireland by the name of color tropics and he saw birds pecking at niches based on that observation that the beaks of the boy became long and short he propounded the natural selection but he wrote a letter to his friend Thomas Compton in 19th century he said that I do not have proof to propound my natural selection but because it helps me in classification of embryology of rudimentary organs I put for this Darwin's theory is not a fact at all it is only a theory and I made it very clear in the beginning of my talk Quran can go against caries because theories take you turns but Quran will not go against any established fact and in a school we are taught about Darwin theory is the fact it's not a fact there is no scientific proof at all there are missing links therefore if someone has to insult his friend his colleague he will say if you were present at Darwin's time Darwin's theory would have been proved right insinuating he looks like an ape there are my signature Darwin theory and I know about the for fossils that are present the hominoids the Lucy Australopithecus with his guide the homo erectus Neanderthal man cro-magnon for details refer to my videocassette my molecular biology I find handsets Cray he said it impossible that we can be evolved from apes by DNA coding it's impossible you can refer to my video cassette it gives the detail some parts I have got no objection regarding biology Quran say this reimbursable tamati that which I'm nominal my equal a Shanghai a feminine we have created every living thing from water we do not then believe today we know that every living creature the basic substance the cell contains how to apply them which has about 90 percent water every living creature in the world has approximately 50 to 90 percent water imagine in the deserts of Arabia who could have imagined that everything in made of water Quran says that forty-nine years ago tire of you like ten days thank you thank you very much we will now start the questions on slips of paper we would have this box for dr. william campbell this box for dr. zakir naik we turn the boxes their names toward themselves so they don't see through Weiler can see they pick up the questions looking away from the box and they answer it themselves whatever they choose they have to answer the first question for dr. william campbell and the next question for dr. Zaki they can pick up the questions in advance so that we don't waste time in there reading the questions so one one questions we can start and will allow dr. William to read for some time if you want the first question I will read the question but first I just want to say about everything made of water it's perfectly obvious every time you smash a bug it's made of water every living thing is made of water but it's observable it's not a miracle okay dr. Campbell if you cannot answer the contradictions in Genesis regarding the creation don't you think that the that proves that the Bible is unscientific and therefore not from God I admit that I have some problems with this but I also have all the fulfilled prophecies and that's very important to me and jeath and it says that Jesus is the first cornerstone and built on it he's built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets and so the upon the prophets prophesied and the Apostles wrote down when God fulfilled the prophecy I know that doesn't answer your question but it my faith is in Christ far as my Savior okay thank you dr. Naik text and translation are two different words giving two different meanings in the Bible in English a text or a translation can scientifically text and translation we proved to be the one and the same did God reveal his messages upon Moses and Jesus peace be upon upon them in English it's a very good question can the text and translation be the same no a text & translation cannot be exactly the same can come close to it and according to Mawlana Abdul Majeed area body said the most difficult book in the world to translate is the glorious quran because the language the quran is so eloquent it is so superior so noble and one word in arabic has got several meanings therefore two tacit that quran is the most difficult it is not the same and if there's a mistake in the translation it is a human handiwork the human being was translating he's to blame not almighty god regarding was bible revealed in English no Bible was in field in English its Old Testament in Hebrew New Testament in Greek though it is a sketch peace be upon him spoke Hebrew but the original manuscript that you have it's in Greek the Old Testament the original Hebrew is not available do you know that the Hebrew translation of the Old Testament is from the Greek so even though original Old Testament which is in Hebrew is not present in Hebrew so you have a double problem no wonder you have scribal errors etc but the Quran alhamdulillah the original Arabic is maintained it has been a hamdulillah scientifically you can prove it is the same and regarding the revelation revealed to Jesus Christ peace be upon him and to Moses peace be upon him I said in my earlier and said I will have my talk that we believe the Quran says in Surat chapter 13 verse 38 that Allah subhana Allah has sent down several revelations by name only for I mentioned the taurah the zaboor the injeel and the quran the torah is the valley which was given - Moses peace be upon him the Subura is a revelation the bahi which was given to David peace be upon him ingeniously the revelation which was given to Jesus peace be upon him and Quran is the last and final revelation which was given to the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad people I am dr. Mike thank you so much the present Bible is not the injeel which we believe in which was able to Jesus Christ be here thank you sir dr. Campbell we have one more but the present injeel is the one there's always been we have we have text 75% of the text from 180 ad that's 100 years after John wrote it was dead he was alive and wrote you have people alive at that point who knew who their their their grandparents believed through John there's good evidence and good text the Bible is valid history now the question with the probability you presented it is a great calculation thank you but in the matter of of of God it is completely inferior God is all-powerful and can choose who he likes of course no matter rich or poor or any other thing so how then does your probability fit in Jesus was poor he was chosen he said the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head I'm not sure about this I don't see how the calculation is talking about that calculation was how many people could fill fulfill all those prophecies I hope that that's been helpful thank you thank you dr. Naik go ahead please go ahead thank you - an effort to prove in an effort to prove the Quran is so heavily agreeable to modern science what happens if modern science is wrong does the Quran always change to reflect the changes in fans that's a very good question it's a very important question and we Muslims should be very careful while bringing a compatible with the Quran modern science therefore I said in the beginning of my talk I will only be speaking about those scientific facts which have been established and a scientific fact which have been established for example the earth is spherical it can never go wrong established science can never take u-turns but an established signs like hypotheses and theories can dig u-turns I know Muslim scholars who have tried to prove the oven theory from the Quran nonsense so therefore we should not go overboard and try and prove everything of modern science we have to be careful to check up whether they established or unestablished if it's established alhamdulillah with scientific proof the Quran will never of God instead if it's hypothesis it may be right it may be wrong like Big Bang Theory it was hypothesis early or late for the hypothesis today after solid proof about the celestial matter or on Stephen Hawking that cetera it's a fact so Big Bang Theory today is a fact yesterday it was hypothesis once it become the fact I use it you know that hypothesis is saying that human beings have been created from a single pair of jeans Adam and Eve I don't use it because size has established it goes along with the Quran it goes along with the Quran that we have been evolved from one pair Adam and Eve peace be upon them but I don't use it because that is not an established fact so therefore while bringing a correlation between Quran and science etc see to it that you use only those scientific facts which have been established and not hypothesis because Quran is far superior to modern science I'm not trying to prove the Quran to be the Word of God with the help of science no not at all what I'm going to do for as Muslims Quran is the ultimate criteria for the atheist and for the non-muslims maybe science may be the ultimate criteria what I'm doing I'm using the criteria the yardstick of the atheist and comparing with the yardstick of the Muslim the Quran I am NOT trying to prove the Quran to be the Word of God with help of science what I'm going to do when I'm being a compatibility and I show the superiority of Quran that what your science has told us yesterday Quran has told us 48 years ago I am trying to prove that our yardstick the Muslim Josh speak the Quran is far superior to your a stick the science therefore you should believe in Quran which is far superior hope the answer the question last two questions for the speaker Vedas the audience we just bear for us for a few minutes more we have the last question on this left for dr. Campbell followed by a one last question for dr. Zakir and we last you to please wait till the end it's the same question as the last one really dr. Kamble agreed to dr. Naik that the errors he showed are not wrong and that he can't answer them so does this mean that dr. Kamble agrees that the Bible has errors so it's not the Word of God there are things in the Bible that I can't explain that I don't have an answer for now and I'm willing to wait until I see whether an answer comes there's many places where archeological things have proved that the Bible is true talking about towns and who was king and things like that and I think there's great proof that the Bible is valid in good history thank you dr. Campbell the question is are there any more mathematical contradictions in the Bible what is Bible or Islam sorry are there any more material contrition in Islam are there any more is that Bible I Salaam I don't know I'll answer both well is there anymore it should be Bible because I spoke about contradiction anyway regarding Islam the Quran says in certain insights after four verse the MIDI - Valetta the boodle Quran mother crying I mean in the gala would you do fixed elephant cathedra do they not consider the quran' with k had it been from anyone besides allah there would have been many contradictions there is not a single regarding more convictions in the Bible five minutes will be insufficient even if they give me five days it's difficult anyway I just mentioned a few it's mentioned in the second Kings chapter number eight verse number twenty fixed it says that Asia that Olivia he was 22 years old when he began to reign second chronicles chapter number 22 verse number two says that he was 40 years old when he began to reign was he twenty-two years old or was he fall two years old magnetic or addition furthermore in second chronicles chapter 21 was tumor 20 it says that joram the father of isaiah he reigned at the age of 32 and he reigned for eight years and he died at the age of forty immediately i havea became the next ruler at the age of 42 father died at the age of 40 immediately son takes over who's at the age of 42 how can a son be two years older than the father believe me even even in hollywood film you will not be able to produce it in Hollywood flim you can produce a unicorn which I mentioned my talk unicorn you can have torrid Isis which the Bible speaks about Cochran Isis and and dragons and serpents but in Hollywood you cannot even show a son being two years older than the father it cannot even be a miracle even in miracle it's not possible impossible in miracle you can have a person being more of a voice in birth but American you can't have a son being older than the father by two years further if you read it's mentioned in the Bible in second Samuel Chapter number 24 what's the man I know that the people that were involved in the battlefield it gives a list of these people in second samuel chapter 24 verse number 9 and it says that people that took part 800,000 of the men of israel took part and five hundred thousand of the men of judah same if you see other places first chronicles chapter 21 verse number five it says that 1 million one hundred thousand people took part in the battle field from the men of israel and ten thousand four hundred sixty men took part of judah was it eight hundred thousand people who took part from the men of israel or was it 1,100,000 was it five like people of Judah took part or ten thousand four hundred sixty a clear-cut contradiction furthermore it's mentioned in the Bible in 2nd samuel chapter number six verse number 23 that michel the daughter of Saul she had no sons circular I am use Sheridan even worse the maid Michelle the daughter of Saul had five sons one place it says no children no son no daughter other place five sons furthermore if you read it's mentioned in Gospel of Matthew chapter number one verse number 16 it says about the genealogy of JFK's peace be upon him I realized Luke chapter number three verse number 23 and it says that Jesus's father that Joseph his father was Jacob in Matthew chapter 1 verse 16 and chapter 3 verse number 23 Jesus father Joseph his father was hailey did Jesus's father Joseph had two fathers what do you call a person has two fathers Oh was it hailey or was it Jacob thank organisation thank you very much can we can we have you bear with us for two minutes we have the reknowned International Islamic scholar amongst us dr. jamal by the way and on behalf of the Islamic Research Foundation we feel it an honor if he would take the pleasure of inaugurating or releasing the book just written by dr. zakir naik the quran and modern science compatible or incompatible dr. jamal by the way to release the book which has just recently been published and printed few days back has been released here in Chicago on this appropriate occasion no more fitting way as a gesture of friendship than to ask dr. Zakir to give it to dr. Campbell by himself [Applause] as we have a very limited number of these copies available so we would request only the non-muslim guests who have come here to kindly take a complimentary copy of the book as they leave the auditorium if they are interested it would be a pleasure may I call upon dr.
