  "title": "Intermarriage between Muslims and People of the Book - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "on behalf of the audience here today I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr zag and earlier your son farit and the organizer for uh bringing us this uh Enlighten lecture and I'm very happy to see you today in person uh and I much uh also believe in what you say about peace and Harmony and I think today's topic about women's right and Universal Brotherhood is very timely yeah and um correct me if I'm wrong I just want to there are so many things which I agree with you and I suppose the main Essence is uh like what you said in the beginning you know should we adherence of the major fi uh religion in this world if we uh are the Learned one that means we truly understand the essence of the original Spirit of all the major religions then we will come to a common point where be it what terminologies you use whether it's a God is Allah it's a dharm or it actually in essence it actually meant the one and only right so if we could agree with that then uh interface dialogue would actually open away Po and arm and there would not be any uh sort things like you know differentiation but more of diversity in harmony yeah and I think one of my um by the way my name is Richard I'm an executive recruiter for me although I'm born a Buddhist but I study Islam and I'm if someone say I'm a Muslim I'm very proud of it yeah and if someone say I'm a good Christian I'm proud of you as well because uh my favorite verse in the Quran is uh in MAA verse 4 it I think it states very clearly that you know what is more important is the good work that we do right it's not so much uh uh because if God has so will he has make us a single people right that's why he make us a lot of religion right but he just want to try us and test it in what it giv us but actually all our ultimate goals go back to God and if there's any differences like we have today if we refer back to the scriptures whether it's the Quran or whether it's the Bible or whether it's a sutras in Buddhism or whether it's the Vas we will find that actually um it refers to the same thing that you you mentioned earlier I have two question which is related uh first is regards the women's right I think about uh Interfaith marriage actually um if from the Quran correct me if I'm wrong I think one of the words is ma verse five where it stated that uh lawful to you in marriage are actually the Believers or the chase woman of the people of the book right um but of course uh that would depend on whether you take the uh literal interpretation or you take the uh tap Mak I us or Mak if you took the literal of course some people would uh actually come to the conclusions which is actually upheld by many of the uh majority of the uh Muslim government today right uh states that the Muslim man is allowed to marry women of the people the bo but not wiy Versa right because if literally it states only the chase woman you never say to chase uh men right if you look literal approach but if you look at the maity approach which is a spirit of the law and just now you talk about equality of the woman and we know that we have to look at the language of the day because those days like we mention mankind mankind refers to both men and women just the same thing we mentioned chair men it actually can be a woman that's why today we rather use humankind and chair person so and because of the culture that day of that time most time is addressed to the male by the man the women as well so if we were to interpret in that way it would also suggest or men to say that actually the women should be allowed to marry the man of the people so now the contention is what is the definition of people the book right so the of course a lot of um government including in Malaysia here I suppose uh they take the quite the strict interpretation so much so that they claim there's no such thing as a pure people of the boat but I would like to lend your confidence in the sense that we find the common the Common Grounds the commonalities right in the sense that uh if is this is a book I will give it to you afterwards right this is a book by uh razar sha Scholars under the Common Ground initiative by Prince Jordan and uh it's actually uh contains a lot of uh proof from the quranic uh versus uh for example uh it is 7 uh 19 which actually uh conclude that uh religion like Buddhism is also considered uh people of the boat so my question is that in light of all these things and also to brother I've got a question I've got a question okay you have post two question got it short as the moderator said if it's two sentences is the question longer than it becomes the speech okay okay so sorry because I thought basically understood brother two question I asked mainly dealing with marry the people of the book Sur MAA chter 5 verse number five and regarding can Buddhist be called the people of the book correct two questions okay so okay uh let okay I just confirm one more question no no no this I just number one uh is the women Muslim women uh in light of the truth of the Quran uh should be allowed to marry I understood that I got the question no need of repeating my mem Mah very good okay thank you very much thank you very much okay and before the question you made a statement I'll comment after answer before you gave the two questions you asked you made some statements I'll comment that after I give the answer to it even that I remember okay okay thank you very much coming to a question that the Quran says in Surah ma chter 5 verse number five that lawful for you on this day is the food of theab and the woman of theab who are chased So based on this a Muslim man can marry a chased woman from theab but why isn't the vice versa not allowed his interpretation is many a time when word is used chair man it includes even woman can they chair woman when you say mankind it means humankind Quran in Arabic language is the same when they say for man many of times most of the times it's included but not always but not always for example if I say as a doctor that a woman gives birth to a child it's woman it's not man many times man includes wom but not always similarly in the Arabic grammar when you know the gist yeah you are Nas Nas is actually male but when I translate oh humankind I say so in Arabic also it's the same when the male is referred to female is included but not always and that you come to know by the context in this it does say lawful for you to marry a woman of theab so woman never includes man in Arabic never when I say woman it never includes man when I say man it can include women do you understand do you understand or not when I say man many of times it can include woman but when I say woman it can never include man even in English language when I say chair woman can it include chairman no when I say chairman can be chairperson when I say mankind can be humankind when I say Woman's right does it be man's right does it mean okay I even in English language when I say woman a man will never never be included when I say man many of times women are included though in the woman the man is there w m a an in writing man is included in woman but not in meaning when you write w m n man is included in the woman theoretically but not practically the same in Arabic whenever the gender male is used many times it includes both but never ever when female is used man is included coming now coming to the point what is the reason so your logic cannot be applied here in any language neither English neither Arabic neither Chinese also hopefully okay now coming to the logic you have to ask me why and I'll give you the answer the reason is first of all I defer with the majority of the scholars on this statement about women allowed that we'll discuss later I'll come to a main point why man is allowed to marry a woman but why not a Muslim woman allowed the reason is that when a man marries a woman the woman leaves the house and comes to the man's house normally now if you marry alab Jews and Christian the Christian believes in all the prophet from Adam up to Jesus peace be upon him we tell the Christian you believe one more that's Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and we as Muslims cannot degrade any prophet of the Christians what we say from Adam Noah Abraham Moses Isaac Jesus we believe believe in all peace be upon them all we say believe in one more so the woman who comes from the Christian family to the Muslim family she's not hurt she has to believe in additional Prophet if a Jewish comes she believes in all the prophet from Adam peace be upon Moses peace be upon him we say believe in two more Jesus and Muhammad peace be upon them it's easy now if I take the vice versa if a Muslim woman goes to a Christian man's home that Christian doesn't believe in Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him though he should according to the Bible he does not so when she goes to a Christian house she will be insulted do you understand understand your point Dr Z not I have not completed my answer yet okay okay okay okay Carry On sorry yeah so here because of that if a Muslim woman goes she will not be allowed to follow Islam so that's the reason one way is allowed for alab woman to come is allowed but for a Muslim woman to go is not allowed I further disagree with the majority of the scholars this verse of the Quran of Surah MAA chter 5 verse number five says lawful for you the food of theab and the woman of theab who are modest but there's one more verse in the Quran in Surah Bak chap 2 verse 221 which says that you cannot marry an idolatress until she believes a believing woman even if she's a born woman is much better than idolatress even if she allows you she may be a beauty queen she may be the richest woman in the world she may be the most beautiful woman in the world to marry a slave woman who's a Believer who's a muslima is far superior to marry an idolatress even if she allows you and the verse continues that do not marry an idolator until he believes a slave man who's a Muslim is a Believer is far superior to idolator even if he allows you he may be the most handsome man in the world he may be the richest man in the world a slave man who's a Believer as far superior this is the verse of the Quran now one more verse of the Quran of Surah MAA chapter number five verse number 72 says they are doing those who say that Jesus Son of Mary is Allah they doing KF so one verse of the Quran says you can marry from theab who are modest one verse of the Quran say you cannot marry those who do those who do sh another verse of the Quran says ma 5: 7273 that they are doing kuf those who say Jesus Son of Mary is almighty God based on this you cannot marry aab girl who says that Jesus is God who can you marry the answer is given inah Al Imran chapter 3 verse number 110 it says that o Muslim the best of people evolve for mankind enjoying what is good and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah and the verse continues if the people of the book had faith it would have been better for them among the there are some who are believers who are M but the majority of f people are transgressors so according to me there cannot be a contradiction in the Quran when the Quran says you can marry women from theab one ver say cannot marry those who do shik who associate partners with God one ver say that those who say says God are doing shik but one ver says there are among who are M that means today there are certain Christians they are called Unitarian not trinitarian majority of the Christians are trinitarian they believe in trune God which is not allowed in Quran don't say trinity this stop is better for youah chapter number four verse number 171 according to me you can only marry those Chas girls who are Jews and Christian who don't do shik who don't believe Jesus Is God and believe in one true God not any Mary Sheila anyone so I defer with the majority because I'm a student of comparative religion the majority of the scholars say you can marry any girl from alab I said no you can only marry that alab who's a m otherwise there will be contradiction so I believe only those those girls those women who believe in one God and don't believe Jesus Is God so based on that I differ and as I told you does allow a man to marry aab who believes in one God but does not allow the vice versa because that girl when she goes to a Christian or a Jewish house the prophet Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam will be degraded they don't believe in it so how can you continue you can't continue having a vehicle one tire of a tractor and one of a bicycle coming to your question that you p earlier that I'm happy to say I'm a Muslim I'm happy to say I'm a Christian it sounds good but for a person who has knowledge it sounds contradictory see when I said if Christian means following the teachings of Jesus Christ I am more Christian than the Christian themselves but normal terminology of Christian means a person who worships Christ correct the normal terminology majority of the Christians they say that Jesus is God so you say I'm a Muslim I'm a Christian it contradicts the moment you say Jesus say God you can't be a Muslim so that's the reason when you use words if you know what does it mean if you say Christian means following teachings of Christ that means you're a Muslim only but if you say Christian means a person who worship Christ you can never be a Muslim you can't say I've got 10 Rupees and then tomorrow you will say that I have got more than 100 rupes I the Arin spirit I don't believe Jesus Son of God correct that means you're not like a normal Christian very good then if you say you're a Muslim I can accept you very good that's the reason when you do comparative religion I'm very careful when I say I'm a Hindu geographically I'm a Hindu at the same time I say if you say Hindu is a person who do ID worship I'm not a Hindu I make it clear I don't try and butter everyone you understand so same way if you say you're a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits his will to God who believes there's one God who beli that God has got no image who does not believe in ID worship and who believes Prophet Muhammad is the last final messenger brother do you believe there's one God yes do you believe God has got no image yes do you believe our worship is wrong yes do you believe Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger I mean uh according to the Quran it stat so so I I that in that same point I believe Allah so if you believe that God is one and if you believe ID worship is wrong and if you believe that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God then you are a Muslim then you qualify to be a Muslim you can become more and more practicing later on but if you agree with the basic these two things are basic required for a person to enter Islam after that the other practices will come slowly and slowly so if you agree there is one God and if you say our leip is wrong and if you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God you are a Muslim and then agree with you when you said that Jesus is not God then I surely agree with you that you can be qualified to be call A musl Muslim that that that's what a man when I say I I want to be a good Muslim good Christian when I say I can be a good Christian the teaching the true teachings of Jesus like me like me very good I'm with you even I'm to be a good Christian what what I man that that is why I take the trouble to go into some background just to clarify that you know we have to uh encourage everyone to go back to the original Spirit and the truth of the all the religious text not not the majority of what the followers very good very good majority very good I agree with you say in correctly I agree with you majority is not always right I agree with you you have to follow the scripture not the church yes brother now what you said in English that I'm a Muslim ET would you like to say it in Arabic no would you like to say in Arabic that there's one God and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God no I think uh just a borrow a words of Prof tar Ramadan he says very Professor tar Ramadan tar Ramadan yeah yeah I happen to to attend one of his session I think he said very correctly he say he has no problem with Islam but only some Muslim he has no problem with other religious text no Bible or sutras or weas in original form just like you you said you know right they believe in the one or one God but is the the followers the majority of them right now correct same thing I'm not here to defend the Muslims every community of Black Sheep I'm here to talk about Islam and when you want to follow Islam don't look at the Muslim look at the Quran yes corre I'm asking you that once you believe there is one God and you believe that idol worship is wrong and you believe that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God this is basic to gain entry into the school entry into the school first standard then you may become second third fourth later on what I'm asking you would you like to admit yourself to the school of Islam uh Dr Zak uh based on verse 48 Ma I think uh Allah or God has made it so clear that is it is not his will you know he's said if if if I so will make you a single people but that's not his plan so in other words uh Allah knows best and all that that verse of the Quran if he wanted he could have made everyone believe then where is the test if the teacher says if I want I can pass everyone then no one will study so Allah is telling for him to make everyone believe is very easy but because this is the test as I quoted the verse of Sur M chapter 67 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good indeed if he makes everyone believe then where is the test he's already created that creation the Angels the Angels always follow almighty God but the human beings with giving a free will if they follow Allah's commandment they are superior to the angels if after free will they disobey then they go lower than the angels in this aspect I would rather interpret this passage as uh differentiation between the people of the book and the musun that means I I haven't come to your second question yet people of the book okay your question of people of the book I haven't come to it yet yeah that's your second question I answered the first question and I've given comments on what you spoke before asking the question the people of the book haven't come to it yet okay can can I can I just uh uh sum up on two common points that we share in common number one I think you you agree uh that uh most of the time if not all the time when Quran or any other text that we see you know in those uh culture language culture even today you know when you talk about a man it will also include a women right but that answer I gave you now brother yeah again coming back to the same question did you forget my answer no no no no no no I agree just want to but when you say woman the man is not included I mean uh um allow me to to go a little bit further I'm not answered a second question you're asking me a third question because the moderator told one question at a time first you gave a speech which I had to comment on then you as first question then your second question I have not answered the second question you're asking me third question that don't get don't get me wrong I'm not getting you wrong I'm getting you right but the moderator said one question at a time go behind the queue I will answer your second question I would love to answer I'll be here even if everyone goes I'll be here I promise you yeah thank you so much thank let me answer your second question you can go behind the other non-muslim I will be I will not leave but the first question uh can I I yet have to answer the second question of yours oh but don't you want the answer for that are the Buddhist I have not answered that did you get the answer did answer uh okay um okay I can understand your standpoint I have not yet given the answer how can you understand can you read my mind great you I have not started answer z I'm referring to the first uh answer that I gave to my first question so you have spoken so I think I know what you said because all the audience know what you said of the first answer second answer where have I given uh because the first answer I back to defer in certain areas so can you allow me to to to give my view points I at the end of the queue I love at the end of the queue I'll give the second answer then go behind the queue I would love but then there are about 7 8,000 10,000 people here 4,000 in the auditorium 6,000 outside so you can go behind the queue I'll just give the answer to your second question the second question you P that can we consider the Buddhist to beab elab in Arabic means people of the book kab means book kab also means Revelation it can be people of the Revelation in that way even we have a book even the Muslims areab but the terminology used in the Quran alab specifically refers to Jews and Christian and no one else alab is a word meaning people of the book but in context of the Quran it only refers to Jews and Christians we have many prophets but when the Quran says oh Prophet tell your wives and the believing women it means only one Prophet Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so if you know the language you can understand that when the Quran says oh Prophet do this it is only referring to the last and final Prophet Muhammad and not the earlier prophets similarly elab means people of the book even Muslim the people of the book in in definition but when Quran says it does not refer to Muslims it only refers to Jews and Christians so at the time of the Prophet this idiom alab was only used for Jews and Christians no one else there are many other people who have got Revelation there are many other religions which have got booked but in the Quran it refers to only Jews and Christians no one else it's very clearcut if you know if you know because if you read the commentary by our learned prop hashin Kamali forget about commentary I'm talking about the text I'm talking about the text you're talking depends how you interpret it depends how you interpret whether you interpret it using theer or using the interpretation of the Quran if you say come to common term that means oh Muslim come to common term what does it mean if I say you can marry a woman from theab alab are Muslims also so that means you cannot marry a man from alab Man is Muslim also so that's the reason if I use your logic there'll be contradiction in the Quran so which commentary you following I don't know the commentary should match with the text of the Quran if the commentary doesn't match with the text of the Quran and gives you a different meaning you reject that comment commentary this is my answer for the next question you can go behind the CU okay before I before I go just the last please go behind the CU please"
