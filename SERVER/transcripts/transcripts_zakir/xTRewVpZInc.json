  "transcript": "morning mr zakir naik my name is jamis damani first of all i want to thank you for what you're doing here i've really taken a a lot away from here i'm sure um my question is on your point number three actually i have three questions if you could be so kind but on point number three first of all i felt that you it was very evasive your your answer but what i'm going to ask you is very simple when you talk about terrorism when you talk about islam now this is a very simple straightforward question i hope i can get a straightforward answer with what's happening in pakistan iraq afghanistan just to name a few i'm not stereotyping i hope no one takes offense but when you hear on the news that a woman is cooking food for our kids and then a suicide bomber comes and kills them i want to ask you a simple question what is that is that islam or is that people who don't understand what islam is and they have their own perception of islam and please let me ask you one more thing can you give me an answer that is not in world war one or something there were more people that died or this is all propaganda and these are americans killing people and then you pass your comments your my answer then you can pass your comment right the brother has the question that the years in afghanistan and pakistan a woman cooking food a suicide bomber comes and blows up and kills as far as islam what the media is saying forget about it i'll give you ruling of islam whether what the media says right or wrong quran says number five verse number 32 if anyone kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity any person kills any other human being whether muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if any human being saves other human being it is as though he has saved the whole nation so according to the quran killing any single innocent human being is prohibited if a suicide bomber comes and kills a woman who's cooking no sin it is 100 prohibited whether done in pakistan or afghanistan or america or dubai is the answer clear okay 100 wrong whoever is doing it whoever's doing it whoever's doing it whether namesake muslim or american or propaganda whoever's doing it it is totally prohibited okay fine there's a clear answer that is clear hundred percent whether you do anyone does wrong yeah hundred percent wrong it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity there is no other scripture that i know of today there is no other scripture that i know of today that gives this statement that if you kill one human being it is as though you kill the holy man except the quran there is no other scripture that i know which say that if you say one human being you have saved the whole of humanity no other scripture perfect now can i ask you something yes this is wrong yeah 100 wrong fine fine fine now why are you here the way i look at it all of these are innocent loving people here why isn't this convention somewhere like afghanistan and pakistan trying to teach people that what they are doing is not islam and it's just some brainwashed chaos and that they're going to go to hell and they're not going to go to heaven for killing innocent people for the 911 attacks for the london bombings innocent people died if i don't like you and i kill you it's more justified than if i don't like somebody if i don't like jews and i go and kill innocent americans with families why don't you go and educate these people and have a better cause rather than converting four or five people here thousands of lives brother asked a very good question he's telling me why don't i go to pakistan to afghanistan and spread this message and prevent this brother i go every day even now i'm going there i'm on the satellite we have peace tv reaching 100 million people this is how much that's what i want to do this is 20 30 000 people the audience here will be 20 30 000 people not more than that you see the recording why do they recording so that i can go to pakistan i can go to afghanistan i can go to even america and my lectures on gis and terrorism the maximum viewership it has got more than 100 million people and it is meant for the full world i am giving here this big record have been telecast the thing is i cannot force anyone the point of the sword accept my message can i force you am i forcing you am i forcing you to accept my message how can i force the people of pakistan how can i fold the people of afghanistan at the same time at the same time at the same time i also tell the innocent people being killed i agree with you what's the numbers you said you know four or five people converting here is better than telling that my job is to deliver the message mentioned in the quran russia chapter 88 verse 21 our job is to deliver the message we can't convert hearts allah told the prophet you are not the manager of affairs it is allah gives the hidayah i can talk i cannot convert it is almighty god who converts i can talk whether they understand or not in pakistan it is almighty god coming to a basic question according to me you should see my cassette is a muslim monopoly is terrorism muslim monopoly if you see that cassette your mind your vision of terrorism will improve time does not permit me to give a talk here again but i'll tell you for sure according to me the terrorists are mainly the politicians it is they who create this you go anywhere you know in india all the rights that took place indirectly directly it's a politician babri masjid why did babri masjid right take place why because of the politicians gujarat is right politicians what happened about 9 11. c micah said it was inside job according to 72 scientists of america they say 9 11 cannot be done by 19 arabs it's impossible it was inside job 72 scientists of america not zakir knight inside job who did it george bush okay afghanistan babe let me compare manchester united afghanistan thousands of people being killed they are sending cluster bombs covered there thousands of people you are talking about suicide bomb that is haram i'm not condoning it i'm condemning it but the bigger thing to be condemned is the americans sending the fighters in afghanistan killing thousands of people in iraq killing thousands of people [Applause] saddam hussein i am not a fan of saddam hussein he has done mistakes the people of iraq they were fed up of saddam hussein but after america came there they are more fed up of the american than saddam hussein that does not justify just because saddam hussein was bad that does not justify america to come and take over iraq why are they doing it for the money for the oil what is the main interest is the oil who created taliban when russia came the americans supported the afghanistan taliban now they wanted to take over the fighting back who is the creation americans the biggest account to me in this history george bush now he's no longer there george bush number one sorry i'm with you on that you're with me on that so i'm also going to america i'm even going to america live and on satellite giving the message to americans i was the first person that i know of in the public after 9 11 in australia i said i'm a fundamentalist and i consider george bush to be the biggest terrorist it came at headlines in december in december 2001 when i gave a talk in australia when the consul general asked me that what do you consider who's a terrorist i said george bush number one it came as headline doctors akin and i calls himself the fundamentalist and considers george bush to be terrorist number one now every tom dick and harry is calling him a terrorist at that time no one has the guts what we realize we are speaking the truth now whether george bush you know many people say when i gave a talk in london on terrorism very good talk people enjoyed a youngster come then death to george bush death to george bush full talk of man gone our beloved prophet muhammad there were two staunchest enemy of islam both were called umar umarain the prophet prayed to allah that give hidayah to one of these tumor and umar bin khattab may allah please with him for the second islam allah gave hidayah who was the staunchest enemy of islam became the staunchest supporter therefore i said may allah give there to george bush i cannot i can speak i cannot give hidayah i can tell him what he's doing is wrong i don't want to kill him i want him to accept islam killing is useless what is the use of killing accepting is better so that's the reason we are giving the message those whose hearts are opening and accepting inshallah god will open your heart also one day when god opens your heart one day i cannot do it i can give the message i can't force you unless god gives you unless you strive if you strive god will help you if you don't strive your heart will not be opened some people ask questions only for questioning and a question push [ __ ] but the true gentleman when he gets the answer he accepts it you know people just ask for questioning my question push [ __ ] you spoke very loudly i am asking why i gave a speech i said so many things do you agree with or not yes i agree with it are you hindu i'm actually your favorite i'm an atheist i heard you enjoy you're atheist you're my favorite no i'm not your friend but i was told that you like having debates with such yes yes faith atheist okay brother you're an atheist fine i would like to congratulate you you'd like to what i would like to congratulate you you know why why the reason i congratulate you because all the others all the human beings are blindly following father is a christian the son is a christian his parents are hindu he's a hindu many of the muslim parents are muslims you are thinking i know their father was atheist father they teased no ah good so you're thinking these are the people they worship this almighty god who falls down and breaks so you are thinking and the reason i congratulate because you have said the first part of the islamic shahada la illaha there is no god you have already said half the karma we're not the second part they have said the full karma you are half muslim now atheist means half karma you know la ilaha only thing you have to do is shall do inshallah i am congratulating you because you have agreed to the other people who believe in wrong gods first i have to spend half my time in trying to convince them the god you're worshiping is wrong you have already agreed there is no god only thing i have to do is prove to you about allah which i shall do inshallah brother suppose this equipment which is bought equipment in front of you no one in the world has ever seen no human being has seen is but in front of you and if i ask you the question who is the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of that equipment i've heard this speech and it's the creator it's the creator so the creator of that equipment will be the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of that object you may say creator you may say manufacturer you may say inventor you may say make a whatever it is somewhat similar now i'm asking a question how did this universe come into existence how did the universe come into existence you are going to now mention the big bang and no i'm asking you yeah don't tell me what i'm going to mention i want to know what what if you no you are i'm asking you according to your knowledge no the thing is i've actually heard this speech before i'm actually a good fan of yours you know marshall you're a good fan good fantastical if you're a practical fan you will follow if i'm wrong you correct me if i'm right to join me no i only learnt about you about two weeks back actually fine so in two weeks you became a great fan marshall i'm very happy about it in two weeks you learn about me that means you know you know about the creation the big bang which we came to know recently quran mentioned 14 years ago in surya chapter 21 verse number 30. but you know that yeah similarly we did not know that the earth was spherical we came to recently quran mentioned 14 years ago in surah nazi chapter 7 and verse 30 is spherical we thought first the light of the moon is online quran mentions 14 years ago the light of the moon is not its own and reflected light which became known recently who could have mentioned this there's biology there is water cycle which you learned in school there is embryology there is genetics my question is who could have mentioned all these things in the quran so if i have heard this you also know the answer who could have mentioned in the quran same answer the creator the creator this creator who has mentioned in the quran v so that means you believe in the creator who could have mentioned this in the quran the creator the creator created the human beings the person who created all this universe it can't be a human being who writes all this so now do you believe in a creator well there are different perspectives you see a person perspective or you can think about god now the debate is which to follow we can follow both i believe in both i'm a student of science also also i'm a believer in god both as as my opening question stated innocent wrong i give direct answer now i am asking a direct question you give me the right answer you asked me you are happy with my answer no beating around the bush i am asking you directly when you believe in the creator why don't you accept the creator i am asking you directly do you ask me direct question in front of 30 000 people i give a direct answer i am asking you a direct question you didn't believe in god i congratulate you now i prove to you that the creator wrote the quran now i'm asking the question why don't you believe in the creator i didn't say that i believe in the creator making your speech brother i didn't ask you to come here to mimic me please did i ask you to come and mimic me i asked you who wrote you said creator i didn't say did i say that no because even in my speech i don't say that's what you said even i didn't say the question i said that means you haven't seen my speech correctly like how you are telling when i ask an atheist he gives the reply creator not i not i that means i haven't seen my speech correctly it is a person like you who i might have asked the question to he gave the reply like how you gave the reply now did i ask you to make or did i ask you to give answer from your heart so that means you are not a very truthful person no you ask me a question brother i give answer directly from my heart correct i am asking a question you give the answer now you're saying that i'm mimicking okay if i say the creator is what you want to hear now no no no listen hypothetically if we say that i agree to the creator now what if i say that i agree to the creator of what was written what i don't believe what was written justifies everything you're giving me six first correct very good very good very very very very very very very very good six things but there's a lot in life that's not written there fine gravity or you're just telling me about light on them very good very good very good brother says he believes in the creator but everything is not there brother this book the quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c-e it's a book of science s-i-g-n-s it's a book of ayaats there are more than six thousand signs six thousand irs in the quran out of which more than a thousand speak about science it's not a book of science two plus two is equal to four that's not written there but the beauty of it is what is written we did not know you mean meaning that's me the creator wrote if it had everything of science it would be a voluminous book as because the world trade center or maybe tallest building now it is not a book of science brother please don't misunderstand it is to prove to the scientist that this is the word of god this is the word of creator what do you have to tell me to disprove it you have to take out a mistake in the quran quran says in surah chapter 4 verse number 22. do they not consider the quran had it been from anyone besides allah there would have been contradictions in it there have been mistakes in it so for you to disprove the quran to be the word of allah you have to take out mistakes that i said please come up and take out mistakes in the quran why if it's wrong i will leave it if it's right you join me it's a two-way not one way but uh how old is the quran i don't exactly know how the quran is approximately 1400 years old okay and how long have human beings existed in this planet human beings in millions of years millions of years uh i'm not challenging you don't don't get this wrong i've just no i like people challenging me what is it i like people challenging me yeah okay if you want to challenge then i'll take that step then okay what is the reason that first of all is i believe christianity is older than islam you're wrong christianity is not older than islam what's the difference islam is there since time immemorial since man set foot on the earth okay from the first remain it's already there prophet muhammed is the last and final messenger he came 1400 years ago he was the last messenger quran is the last revelation not the first revelation this is the last testament otherwise islam is the same time memorial isla salaam jesus christ was a muslim according to the quran abraham was the muslim of the quran peace be upon them all so islam means peace acquired by submitting a will to almighty god it is there since time immemorial okay so getting to the point i asked you the time scale that the quran has existed and the time scale of human beings after you know what times year of quran islam is there since i mean i don't know of the quran the book the holy book not not islam we can say islam existed for forever but why was the quran invent placed on earth afterwards very good very good and i also wanted to ask you something i always wanted to know about that is the uh darwin's theory of evolution um i know there's a lot of controversy on that but why do you do you believe in evolution or you believe man was placed directly and the whole thing of apes the science that has proved that human beings emanated from apes do you agree with brothers true question that science sorry about that no problem two questions do you believe in darwin's theory science has proved that human beings have been evaluated from abe do you believe in do you believe that remaining are placed and second question why was quran revealed 14 years back why not before two questions regarding a correction in your question science hasn't proved that human beings have been all from me it is darwin's theory not darwin's fact it's a theory there is no book today there is no book today on the face of the earth which says the fact of evolution its theory the fact of the origin of human beings no its theory and for your information darwin himself said that there were missing links in his theory if you read his book on the origin of species he writes in this on a ship by the name of hms beagle he goes to an island by the name of calatropus and there he sees birds were pecking in niches in holes based on the holes they picked the beak of the birds became short and long based on that observation he propounded the theory of natural selection he wrote a letter to his friend thomas thompson in 1861 that i have no proof for my theory of evolution but because it helps me in giving replies to embryology to genetics that's the reason i'm propounding i had no proof on it that there is in a school you know to joke around we used to say if you were present at darwin's time darwin would have been proof right trying to insulate i'm telling my colleague he's an ape he's a monkey never missing links furthermore all the three stages today science in advance we have come to know that the first in the australis an ice man the next stage that we have neanderthal man crow magnon all these stages that we have today of the human being that we found there's no link between them certain things what darwin said that life is evolved from water i agree with it quran says that surah chapter we have created every living thing from water i believe in that but saying that we have evolved from one species to the other is the hypothesis according to molecular biologists and systems he said it is letting imagination run too wide to say that we have been evolved from apes if that was true today we will find someone in between man and human being you only find it mythology you don't find anywhere in the world a monkey man do you find so what do you think evolution has stopped now it is a hypothesis and most of the scientists today disagree with it there is only a small negligible percentage which you believe in diversity majority of the scientists have already disproved darwin's theory i feel your knowledge of science is not up to date brother but talk tonight not about wait all right you're asking me a question i'm replying then we have to give chance to others we have already five six questions having fun that's all sorry i thought you were being entertained having fun besides the other non-muslim brothers if all non-muslims will come back to you so what we realize darwin's theory brother your knowledge on science is weak we say adam and eve are the first human beings that's what the quran says furthermore regarding our second question okay i have to answer your question i have not answered second question you want to put the third question that means not listening to me or you have forgotten you have asked two questions no no i've asked you the person that we are a good questioner now you ask me the question why was quran revealed 1400 years back why not before you know my son he wants to become a doctor he's telling me why do you put me in school and college why don't you put me in medical college directly son first go to nursery then go to primary then go to secondary school then go to college then go to medical college i can't put him in medical college directly why he should know the basics similarly almighty god is our creator he kept on sending other revelations almighty god our creator thought 1400 years back was the right time that human beings could absorb this message he revealed it he is our creator he knows better than you and me fourteen hundred years back he revealed his last message the quran to the last and final messenger muhammad sallallahu asallah perfected my religion for you the perfect form and have completed my favor on you you taught the human beings and has chosen for you islam after this nothing new can be added into the basics of islam nothing can be subtracted that's it so almighty god knows when we can imbibe the message of the quran and this is the last testament last messenger prophet muhammad no other message will come after this hope this answer your question and i hope that you even accept besides being my fan you also accept my teachings in shock maybe next time when you come here maybe next time you tell me i'll come again tomorrow i'm fine tomorrow i'll come back fast for you alone"
