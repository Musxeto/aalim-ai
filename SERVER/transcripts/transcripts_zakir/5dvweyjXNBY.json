  "title": "Why do Muslims Shave their Heads at Hajj? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "we Muslims to shave our heads while performing and Hindus they also shave at tirupati is there any scientific reason other than religion because I was the question that Muslim when we go for and sometimes former also we shave our heads they've been shave the head is in scientific reason that the reason we Muslims shave ahead is because if you Analyze That a look of a person depends on the head therefore you have hair stylists you know different types of hair and then you have the punk style and this style and even the ladies that's the reason that Islam say that a woman should cover ahead because the beauty also lies in the hair different hairstyles Etc now when we go for Hajj and we shave off our head is for humidity that for Allah humbling yourself so it is mainly for humility not that Allah wants our hair Allah it's our party so we're shaving ahead to show that we humble ourselves before our creator so that's a sign of humility that is the reason maybe that is a similar reason why the Hindus may be doing it maybe but I'm mainly in my talk people ask me that why didn't I use these examples in my talk similar to the Hinduism in Islam and I said I'm talking about those similarities which are not known by the General Public and certain things may be a coincidence or maybe a fact but that doesn't get them closer to tahit for example we circumemble it around the Kaaba the Hindus or circumemed around the statue the reason we circum amulet is because it's a command of Allah Prophet The Logical reason I can give is when we circum ambulate around the Kaaba we are testifying this one Allah so they also have a customer succumbability around they idle so again in the scripture is mentioned there's one God only so I mainly have gone to the scriptures quoting their scriptures about the authenticity which is more powerful for me rather than quoting these examples which they'll be satisfied now your second memory we are doing right but what they're doing is wrong they circumen around an idol so I purposely leave out these similarities which may be very striking in front of a normal human being but may mislead a person so I give examples of those things that do not do vital worship as mentioned the scripture that's much more better to get them closer towards Islam rather than mentioning these things like circumambulation or shaving the head Etc which is a fact so why we do I'm giving the reason it may have been the same reason there but because they've manipulated it with an idol which is not the case in Islam the moment I give that similarities it may mislead a person that is the reason in my talk which is commonly known by many people they may not have thought over it but it's commonly known that when the soccer membrane is a commemorating around an idol it should not be same as you know that Kaaba is not an idol and I've given the reply that we don't worship the Kaaba to win Idol because Kaaba is the Qibla is the direction we don't worship the idol and other good man answer various reasons including that at the time of the Prophet Muslim there was sahabas who stood on the cup and gave the Azan this indicates that we don't worship the Kaaba no Hindu will stand on the idol Yoshi worships so I bring out the differences also not trying to mislead the person that's the reason I didn't include this but the reason we shave our head is for humility humbling ourself in front of the Creator hope that answers the question"
