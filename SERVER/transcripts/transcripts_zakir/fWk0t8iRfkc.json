  "title": "Should we Trust in Allah and keep the Mosques Open during Coronavirus COVID 19? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "what is your opinion on the groups of muslim who protest against the closing of mosques due to coronavirus on the basis that that would imply fearing other than allah the question poses that what is my view regarding those muslims who are protesting against the closure of the mosque in different parts of the world and they are saying that you are fearing others more than allah as far as i am concerned i am against those people who go to extreme la taglinukum do not commit excesses in your deen as far as the guidance given by the prophet muhammad the prophet clearly said in sharing which i discussed in my previous sessions that when you know of an epidemic of a plague in a particular land don't go to that land and if you're in that land don't leave that land where is hadith the prophet said if you see a leper if you see a leper run away from him as they have seen a lion so all these hadith says that we should stay away from contagious diseases but the prophet said tire camel and trust in god now what we have situation as for the group of people who are against the closure of mosque we'll discuss that later on what if you see the different scenario world over of muslim countries the first muslim country i won't take its name the first muslim country that openly announced that they are going to shut the mosque because of coronavirus in that country there was not a single death due to coronavirus there were few hardly about 40 50 positive cases of coronavirus covered 19. as a precaution they closed the mosque in complete country many muslim scholars objected and within a few days many muslim countries all over the world followed it i am not against closing the mosque to protect yourself from government if it's a requirement but don't go overboard to give a statement that you should fear allah and no one else is not correct because the prophet was the person who feared allah much more than us he said run away from malapar as we have seen a lion he said when you know of a plague don't enter that city if you're in that land don't leave that land these are precautions we trust in god but we have to tie a camel but what we see that some of the muslim countries were over precautious they're not tying the camel they're strangulating the camel in some countries when there is not even a single case of corona virus covered 19 they shut the mosque this is nonsense if there is a case where the cases are many and many people are infected there are people who have died and then you close the mosque after taking guidance from the medical experts and islamic scholars only hearing the medical experts who don't know about the deen who don't know about the religion then how important it is to pray in the mosque you cannot take that advice quran says first that if you don't know as the person is knowledgeable surah chapter 21 verse number 7 so there should be a striking balance so if the infection has spread quite a lot and you think that opening the mosque will really cause many more people to be infected not just being over precautious so there should be a striking balance between the two so those people who are not bothered about prevention and telling that we should have faith in allah they are wrong and those people are all precautious and closing it beforehand even they are wrong so we should not commit excesses in your religion allah says in the quran do not commit excesses in your religion surrender 4 verse number 171 so my view is that even if you take precaution as i mentioned earlier and so take precautions you can take a sahaja yoga you can take a masala a prayer mat wear mask hand sanitization can be done do widow at home spend the least time in the mosque go to the restroom in your house don't shake hands read the sunnah salah before the farasa at home after the farasala sunnah at home take all these precautions and continue till you think it is possible when you think it is really required to close and then you close i've got no objection but don't be over precautious and when the thing subsides also open it as soon as possible if you take precaution and proper guidance having a proper session with the health authorities and the islamic scholars in consultation and then taking the decision it's correct but just taking a decision to please the world or to please the other people or to say no i will continue praying this is not islamic so don't commit excesses follow the middle path"
