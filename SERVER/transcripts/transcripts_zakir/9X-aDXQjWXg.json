  "transcript": "by beshal money Tiwari from Nepal I am a sanatana-dharma follower the question is why do Muslim pilgrims practice Hindu rituals of shaving the heads wearing long Indian white sari clothes fasting oppas circumambulating the idols Kaaba seven times use the hindu lord shiva her scent moon symbol observed the moon as hindus for the religious days etc these rituals were all alien to arabs jews so why do muslims follow Hindu rituals and this is a very important question and replied to this brother from Nepal brother Vishal many Tiwari if that Almighty God has sent only one religion to be followed by all the human beings and that religion if submitting your will toward mighty God and Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has sent according to a beloved proton muscle assalam 124,000 messengers on the face of the earth and there were several messages and revelations given and sent on the face of this earth but by time most of these messages and revelations sent by allah subhanaw taala have been corrupted by the people due to the passage of time by name for a mention in the quran the torah the zaboor the injeel and the last and final one that is operon there were many messenger sent 124,000 messengers sent on the face of the earth MELAS bonnet allah to give the message of almighty god to humankind twenty five i mentioned my name in the glorious quran Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus Mohammed peace be upon them all all these messengers they came and they brought the basic same message of tawheed believe in one God and believing in the commandments of Allah subhana Allah now the question is that why are there similarities between Hinduism certain rituals you'll be shocked to know there are similarities Islam with all the major religions whether the Christianity with that be Judaism an other religion also I have given the talk on similarities between Islam and Hinduism has not spoken much about the rituals and most of the rituals that you mentioned I agree almost all of them except for mine all of them are common in Islam but in my talk of more than one and a half or two hours I spoke about the major pillars of Hinduism and Islam and I spoke in the talk that both Hinduism and Islam they believe in one God they believe that God is only one without a second both these written belief that idol worship is wrong Hinduism and Islam both agree that the last and final messenger sent by Almighty God His Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him both religion believe that if you have to pray to do the sujood that this is that and 404 for both the leading belief there having alcohol is prohibited what we didn't believe that gambling is prohibited and so on and so forth you can listen to my talk on similarities finish some and Hinduism what you mentioned for mainly rituals and these issues that you mentioned were a lie shaving the head and I do agree with you it's common in both in Flickr image of Hindus and Muslims wearing long white sari clothes talking about the harem fasting circle I'm reading on the Kaaba use the Hindu Lord Shiva Crescent symbol this is not because Christine is not the symbol of Muslims of the use their culture but I agree with you that most of the rituals are common why because on mighty God he sent in the same religion the basics were same later on people started adding other things of the own and the scripture got corrupted the religion got corrupted then Allah said the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and reveal the last and final message that the glorious quran this rule in the Quran is not adulterated it is in its pure form I always give a formula when the non-muslims come and speak to me I said let's come to a common formula let us agree let us believe that one scripture at least in the word of 100% Hindus will say I believe the Vedas are the Word of God the Christian will say I believe the Bible is the Word of God the Muslims will say I believe the Quran in the Word of God let us agree to follow what is common in the scriptures because all of us believe their scriptures the Word of God so if what is common in all the scriptures all will agree they will not be any conflict so let us agree to at least follow the common points in these scriptures what is different we can discuss tomorrow and when we discuss and do a research a comparative study we come to know that all the major religions in the scriptures were that within the scriptures the way they whether it be the Bible the Christian well that means of the Jews when they'd be of the Muslims the firaon all the scripture say there is one God all the scriptures say that worshipping anyone besides the true God is wrong all the Scriptures the idol worship is wrong all the major scriptures say and they mention the name of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and they mention that he is the last and final messenger all the scriptures say that you should do the food for praying all the scriptures say that we should fast all the scriptures say we should do charity all the scriptures say that I'll call is prohibited and so on and so forth so let us likely to follow orders from it so if there are commonalities it means that all of us agree the same creetur mighty God has created all the human beings is the main source of the scripture but these scriptures have been G I need you to passage of time except the last and final message the glorious quran all the message is bought by the messengers earlier were meant only for those people except the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him he bought the message for the whole of humanity that is there is a manifest to you his brother Bashar brother tiwari that do more research here my talk on similarity brief salaam and hinduism and will come to know that even hinduism say that ever submitter was to almighty god and submitting able to almighty god if we say in arabic it is islam and the person who submits to the world in arabic we call him as a Muslim so I pretty well last man oh Allah let me give you there so that you come closer 100 dollar and you accept the last and final message Quran and the religion of Islam"
