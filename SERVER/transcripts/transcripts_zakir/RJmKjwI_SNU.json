  "transcript": "the brother ask a question that can a father a husband or a brother force a woman the sister the daughter Etc to practice par if they don't wish to follow hijab can force but naturally the duty of every Muslim to ISL and especially among the Clos relatives he should try his L best to convince first with hikma quotation of the with reason logic that you should do hijab regarding forcing what is permitted within limits what is permitted I'm not using the word Force I'm using the word enforce can he enforce it through other means uh that's right the better said he's not using the ver Force he's using the word enforce I'm giving a broader answer so that the next questioner should not ask what about Force even when force is concerned within limits where enforce by other means he should do it by other means like economic means you know say I'm your father I'm giving you pocket money you know you go to college you don't do your hijab I will stop giving you pocket money putting putting economic pressure Al you should do it why not you should so enforce b means he should do it and if there are certain things the Quran gives permission at certain times to even put little Force within limits that limits are prescribed in the Quran and Hadith that if you know using little force can enforce a person for doing F like offering Salah a parent is allowed to use little bit force on the children for offering Salah it's a you know we required within limits so similarly for enforcing hijab husband can say okay I will stop giving you so and so things because you don't do hijab he can and he should the enforcement is concerned first with hikma in good ways with wisdom and beautiful preaching if that doesn't work you can use enforcement like using pressure I will not talk to you I will not like it and whatever you feel within limits is best you should and every Muslim or every muslima if for example the husband is not offering Salah the wife can say that you're offering Salah she can use tactics like certain pressurization so these can be used by both man as well as woman on the spouse on the relatives so that a person becomes a good Muslim if it's a f which a person is not doing they can very well pressurize even a woman can pressurize the husband for keeping a beard normal people only people normally P only the husband can pressu the woman why can't the woman do that to the husband sometimes the wife may say oh don't keep a beard it Pok we have tell them maybe it pokes inshallah if you're are finding discomfort here in the you'll get more comfort you know there are ways in satisfying so whoever is on the wrong track it is the duty because the Quran says in Bak 2 verse number 187 that you are the garments and they are your garments the husband and wife the garments under one another and the you see to it that both of them stay on the hope that answer the question"
