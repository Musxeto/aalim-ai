  "transcript": "there are various different types of Brotherhood Brotherhood based on blood relationship Brotherhood based on region based on race Brotherhood based on cast on Creed on color but all these brotherhoods they are limited and they are not univers and Islam does not believe that human beings should be divided based on color and cast I started my talk by quoting a verse of the Glorious Quran from Surat chapter number 49 verse number 13 where Allah subh says oh humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into Nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other and you may not despise each other and the most honored in the sight of Allah subhana wa ta'ala is the person who has tawa the person who has got Consciousness piety righteousness Allah says in this verse that he has divided the human beings into different tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of Almighty Allah is the person who has tawa God Consciousness righteousness piety Allah says in Sur Room chapter number 30 verse number 22 that amongst his signs he has created the heavens and the Earth and has created different languages and colors verily in it is a sign for those who understand Allah subhana wa ta'ala has created people in different colors having different languages so that you may recognize each other and this is a sign for those who understand Allah says in Surah is chapter number 17 verse number 17 that Allah subhana wa ta'ala has honored all the children of Adam irrespective whether they black or white yellow or brown rich or poor from America or Malaysia or India or Pakistan Allah subhana wa ta'ala has honored all the bani Adam all the children of Adam besides Islam there are other religions that believe that the humankind originated from a single pair of male and female from Adam and Eve may peace be upon them but unlike Islam the other religions they believe it is the woman because of which you humankind is born in sin because if may Allah be pleas with her she disobeyed God that's the reason human beings are born in sin in Islam we do not put the blame only on the woman in Islam if you read the Quran the blame is equally put on both of them Allah mentions in Surah chapter number 7 verse number 19- 27 where Adam and Eve peace be upon them both of them are addressed more than a dozen times both of them made a mistake both of them repented both were forgiven the blame is equally put on both of them there is not a single verse in the Quran which puts the blame only on Eve may Allah be with her but there is a verse in the Quran which only singles out Adam peace be upon Him Allah says in Surah T chapter number 20 verse number 121 that Adam peace be upon him he disobeyed Allah but if you read the Quran as a whole the blame is equally put on both of them"
