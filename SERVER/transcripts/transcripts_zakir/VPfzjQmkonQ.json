  "title": "The Non Muslim Media gives a wrong label to the Muslims but why do the Muslim Media repeat it?",
  "transcript": "Salam alaikum my name is Riyaz Ahmed I'm in sales and marketing profession well my question to a doctor is we all know that that the Western media is giving a wrong picture about Islam and Muslims we all agree that but the worst part and the painful part is how come in some of the Muslim countries and also in this part of this world even the media is using the same title terrorists and all to those people whether as a question that the non-muslims are using media and unfortunately some of the Muslims are using that word so that's what I'm asking you have to go and ask those people not me after all those people and what happened that many of the Muslim due to ignorant they start agreeing as I give you the example a Muslim coming and telling me the Taliban's are bad he was ignorant not that he was against Taliban so many a times we get so convinced with the media what we hear what we see we start believing in it so what we should do we as Muslims should remove the cobweb even from the eyes of these type of Muslims besides answering the non-muslim media and inshallah we should be logical not just by saying they are idea right we should prove logically that Islam is version of truth is the region of peace and only way that they can be totally peace in the world is no other way but by Islam Allah says in the Quran in surah al-e-imran chapter 3 verse number 19 in Medina in the lion Islam the only way of life accepted is Islam that is peace acquired by submitting a will to Allah subhana WA Ta'ala [Applause]"
