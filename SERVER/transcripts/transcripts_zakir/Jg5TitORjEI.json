  "transcript": "now we'll discuss the last and the first point that is that is the day of sacrifice the ease of sacrifice or the day of sacrifice and we know that allah had asked prophet ibrahim that what do you love the most in this world but naturally after allah he said my son ismail that can you sacrifice him for me and ibrahim islam goes and tells his son ismail and he says don't worry father you will find me straight fast and on the instruction of allah when he's about to sacrifice the son allah's mother replaces it with a sacrificer animal and this is what we remember every year in either other that we should be able to sacrifice anything in this world for the sake of allah and during her day of sacrifice and either other the day of sacrifice we if you have the means we sacrifice an animal for one person it is a goat or if you want to do a big animal like a cow or a camel it can be for for seven people and it's mentioned in surah chapter number 22 verse number 37 it is not their meat or blood that reaches allah but it is a party which reaches allah so we don't sacrifice so that the blood and the meat is just allah but we do it for our taqwa our party should reach allah and what do we do with the sacrifice when we sacrifice the animal we distribute it amongst the poor people amongst the friends among the relatives and keep some for ourselves normally it is recommended that that minimum one-third should be given to the poor people one-third to the family and friends and the maximum you can keep yourself is one third this is the practice let me tell you the salient features that should be done on either other or your number one that have a bath early in the morning number two put perfume on yourself it's a sunnah number three is that wear the best of your clothes number four preferable do not eat anything before the it's prayer number six go to pray early number seven that it is recommended that all the women including the children including the menstruating woman should go for the eighth salah even if they don't have to offer salah or they don't have to go to the masala and when you come back from eighth prayer see to it that you take another route not the same route in which you went for the salah and preferable to pay salah in a muslin open ground which is called as ethica now what is the reason that a beloved prophet muslim recommended that all the women and the children including the menstruating woman should go for the salah even if they don't have to offer salah either even if they don't have to go and pray what is the reason why did the prophet said that you go from one root and when you come back take the other root why did he say that pray in a large place for all this we come to know that the reason is so that it boosts the morale of the muslims normally we muslims offer five times salah congregation in the mosque once a week in juma we have a bigger congregation we pray in the juma mosque the congregation is multiple times bigger than what congregation we have during the fight time salah and twice in the year during the eden the idol and other the prophet recommended that you pray in an open ground known as the itga why so that a larger number can gather imagine if you're living in a village and during the east side i come to know there are 30 000 muslims there are 40 000 muslims the morale of the muslims is boosted and if you are living in an area which has a non-muslims also the non-muslims will think 10 times before interfering with the muslims oh the muslim the 30 000 in number 40 000 enough imagine if you're living in a big city and if you pray in one eath in which 100 000 gather or a few hundred thousand gather imagine the scenario it will boost up the morale of the muslims and at the same time would give a non-muslim a thought that they better not interfere with the muslims this is the psychology what is the reason that the beloved person even told the woman and the children to go even the women of the menstruating when you go through one way come through the other way not the same way why so that the other people in the other locality of that village of that town or that city no ah the muslims are going in large numbers if you go through route a come back through route b so that the people of route also come to know the people of root to be also come to know that muslims and large number the next important point when you come back if you have the means you sacrifice an animal if allah has given you the mean later on you go and meet your family friends it's the day of celebration and when you meet the greeting is up the good deeds from us and from you normally in india pakistan or other words the sunnah is to wish the cup will allow me oh allah accept the good needs from us and from you you can say mubarak it is muba but the right thing is as the prophet and the sabbath wished each other and the day of eid there should be a day of celebration be happy be cheerful let me tell you the important points of the eighth salah before i end this talk there are 14 important points of each salah number one the each salah is further for every muslim who is an adult and hussein male or female number two it is offered between the time after the fajr salah and before the salah but the earlier you offer the better it is number three it should be offered in an opening round almost allah also known as number four that if eid falls on a jummah then praying juma on that day is not further but it is sunnah it is recommended if you pray it is good but if you want you can abstain from faith masala at that time you should pray only the zohar salah next point number five is that there is no aadhaan or no akama before the salah number six there is no sunnah before the salah or after the salah number seven the each salah is of two raka number eight there are six extra takbirat in the first rakat before surah fatiha besides the takbira along with that there are total seven takbirat in the first takat before surah fatiha in the second rakat after you get up from the sujood in the starting of the second rakat after seeing the tag beat there are five additional takbira before the surah fatiha in the second rakat ninth point is that it is sunnah to recite surah allah in the first sakhas and surakasha in the second rehab the 10th point is it is also a sunnah you can recite surah in the first sakat and surah kamar in the second rakat the 12th is that after the each salah there is the 13th point is it is recommended that you hear the khudba of the imam after the salah but it is not afar it is highly recommended and the 14th point is when you go for salah in form one route see to it while coming back you take the other route these were the 14 salient points of the salah and i've covered in brief in as short a time as possible the importance of the first 10 days of the leader"
