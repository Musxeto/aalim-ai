  "title": "Why does Islam Oppress the Woman, and Confine Her to Housework? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "asalam alayum I've been asked by many non-muslims uh why does Islam suppress women I know that's not the correct answer I know that Islam does not suppress women especially the question relates to working um Muslim women are generally referred to stay home um you clarified in your last talk I've listened to quite a few of your lectures uh not all of them but quite a few uh you have also clarified that women can go to mosque but in India places like India and Pakistan women cannot visit MOS uh that's because it's a man-made rule not God's rule uh but what is Islam's opinion regarding women making a career for themselves if they observe modesty I as the question that there's an allegation by the non-muslim that Islam suppresses the women but the complete answer going refer to my video said women's rights in Islam but coming to a specific question regarding can they work and secondly can they make a career for themselves can they work work Point number one that it is not compulsory for them to work like for a man to earn his living in Islam before a woman is married it is the duty of her father and a brother and after she's married it is the duty of the husband and the son to look after lodging boarding clothing and all Financial aspects so the financial burden in Islam is put on the shoulders of the man she need not work but if she wants to work willingly she can work but if if she says I don't want to work the husband can't for her men and women are equal in Islam but equality doesn't me identicality tomorrow man says I want to give birth to a child I want to conceive you cannot conceive right I want to conceive no you cannot conceive certain things optional certain things Haram certain things F compulsory certain preferable so it depends so similarly depending upon the physiological makeup the biological makeup the roles of menale and female are different so the financial burden is put on the shoulders of the men but yet the women can work if they want to work if both the ends don't meet and if she feels she wants to work or if she wants to work for any other reason she can work but it should be within the purview of the Islamic Sharia within the modesty level you should be hijab fine there should be segregation of the Sexes not intermingling of the sexist segregation you want to know what segregation of sex is for example you can't have that a lady wants to become a secretary of the boss and the boss is sitting in the closed room in the cabin and dictating and the secretary is typing Prophet said if man and wom are alone foreign men and women alone in a room the third person is the devil and that's the reason we new what happen many a time what happen with the boss and the secretary many of times the boss tell the secretary why don't you stay a bit late you know I've got some extra work and you know what happens after that I don't tell that that the reason you see so it is natural if you are in the room months twice Thrice whether secretary is beautiful or not so therefore Islam say segregation of sexes segregation of sexes brother that if she's working she should be the hijab but natural and segregation of sexes means separate area for the Gen separate for women not that man and wom cannot talk when required they can talk but not in a closed room they can't talk not they can't but when required not unnecessary higgling hang like in the office you find did you see the movie or how you find this and then and unnecessary gossiping and then what happens later on so in Islam a woman can work but it should be a work which is within the P of the Islamic Sharia she can very well do Pottery she can do weaving she can do knitting she can become a gy Coles she can become a teacher she can do business also why not my sister M running both my sisters are doing very good business one of my sisters running a factory separate section for the Ladi separate for gents she hand lady section brother hand the G section what's the problem MD managing director other sisters doing exports no problem but within the pie of the Islamic Sharia no problem but she need not work if she wants she can she can't do dancing she can't do modeling same thing a man also cannot do dishonest business a man cannot work in alcoholic bar so what rules are there for women even many are there for the men also so what is Haram for women is Haram for women what is Haram for men is Haram for men something is Haram for both like working alcohol like bar is Haram for man and woman both working in a gambling Dent for both so it's not a separate thing can she make a career for herself why not why not she can make a career but it would not be outside"
