  "transcript": "all the audience and especially to my beloved respected brother zakir naik dr zakir naik it's been a long time since i see you last time i used to see you in penang now you are no more for coming to pinay you know there are some problems okay but i am from penang i come all the way to see you personally with my whole family they want to see you live masha allah always watching in tv now they want to see you live okay allah my question is masha'allah the subject today is islam is a solution for humanity but it is very unpleasant that we are seeing in this world today what is happening in syria muslims killing muslims what is happening in yemen muslim killing muslims what is happening happening in uh there's they're like myanmar yes we agree rohingyans they have been killed mercilessly they agree but there is a solution now what are we muslims are supposed to do what is going on in yemen what is going on in syria this helpless man woman and children being killed murdered what are we muslims supposed to do all over the world we muslims what we are doing so please give a solution that what we are supposed to do we muslims apart from we making dua tahajjud we're begging to allah and after that as human beings what are we supposed to do please my dear brother give a solution brother the brother asked a very important question a very relevant question that today we find that in many of the muslim countries we find that there are wars and muslims are being killed whether it be yemen whether it means syria whether it be rohingya whether in afghanistan whether it be iraq and most of these countries the muslim countries what is the solution besides doing dua number one first we have to find out that what is the cause of most of these killings whether it be in afghanistan whether it be in iraq whether it be in rohingya burma whether lately it be in syria or yemen what is the cause the major cause is again the solution is given in the quran the cause is that we find that the enemies of islam the my main focus of my talk today was that how the enemies of islam are trying to manage islam and how the enemies of islam are justifying to attack the muslim countries i'll give you one simple example you know that more than a decade earlier usa said that iraq has the weapons of mars destruction and cia which is supposed to be one of the most best organization of intelligence they said that we have got proof that iraq has got weapons of mass destruction not that i am a fan of saddam hussein i know that he may not be a very good practicing muslim but what right does usa have to interfere with iraq they together with uk and the other western countries attacked iraq saying that they had weapons of mass destruction last year according to the report by human rights organization they said it was a fabricated report so much so that tony blair the previous prime minister of uk came out in public when he was no longer the prime minister he said it is the biggest mistake of my life i am sorry you know how many people were killed more than half a million iraqis and muslims were killed because of this fabricated report and what is the reply sorry what are we muslims doing when the non-muslims enemy attack on muslim countries we muslims are sitting on a backside doing nothing and i think it is yesterday the previous president of usa w bush at the age of 94 he expired he was one of the cause for the start of the 9 11. then followed by attack on iraq by the next presidents of usa this what was the main purpose was to get hold of the oil of iraq they fabricate a thing and it was shown that they paid 540 million dollars usa paid 540 million dollars to create a fabricated video to prove that iraq had weapons of mass destruction 540 million dollars to make a video we muslims what is the fault of the muslims we are not united in afghanistan when afghanistan had a war with russia soviet union which was then which was enemy of usa the usa takes help of the muslim country along with afghanistan to take out russia hillary clinton said in a video that they spent 8 billion dollars in supporting the afghanistan and creating taliban to fight the russians they create and then say that they are terrorists who is the bigger terrorist the person who does the act or one who creates the person who makes the person a terrorist who's a bigger terrorist what are we doing nothing they send clusters bomb in the country which is one of the weakest countries in the world afghanistan they send cluster bomb the bomb goes down and then it disintegrates into various bombs killing thousands tens of thousands of ghani what did the muslims do nothing the problem is that we muslims are united all these what you find all the war zone when the muslims are being killed who is supporting the killing of the muslims not muslims who is the one who enjoyed most of the places you'll find it's a fabricated things created by the news of islam to attack the muslim country whether it be for oil whether it be for money whether it be for power whether to attack or destroy the enemies so previously the biggest enemy of the usa before 9 11 was communism was russia so they join hands with the muslim countries to take out russia the solution to this problem is given in the glorious quran in surah imran chapter number 3 was 103 says hold the rope of allah strongly and be not divided the rope of allah is the glorious quran and the authentic hadith if we muslims hold strongly to the rope of allah and the authentic sayings of muhammad allah sallam we will be on top of the world if you read the history before the quran was revealed the arabs were looked down upon it was called as yahweh the days of ignorance after the quran was revealed the arabs became on top of the world if you read the seer of muhammad sallallahu salaam and after that muslims were on top of the world we ruled half the world and people welcomed us come to our country so that we get justice the non-muslims invited our khalifas why because they wanted the unjust rule of their ruler to end the westerner says islam was paid by the sword deliste already gives the reply in his book on page number eight islam at the crossroad that people who delays already said that history makes it clear history makes it clear that the myth that islam was fed by the sword is the most absurd fantastic myth that the historians have repeated it's a myth at that time the muslims were united on the base of quran and sunnah today we muslims are divided if the muslim countries there are more than 50 countries in the world in which majority people living are muslims if all the muslim countries unite we will be a very strong force and if we implement the quran we will find this is the solution to the problem of humanity unfortunately our beloved partner said that close to the qiyamah we will find that muslim will be in large numbers and we find today more than 25 percent of the world population the muslims are going to increase but they will be like frat for up far away from the deen and we find that today muslims are going further and further away from the deen and this you are finding everywhere in the world the country that we looked on upon they are sticking to quran and sunnah today they are going away from quran and sunnah and the more they will go away from quran and sunnah the more will be degraded there will be more injustice in that country now hardly there are countries in the world which we can say are muslim countries that are following quranism hardly so the problem with as muslims is that we are not united we are divided we fight amongst ourselves if we are united today we know that previously muslims were at least united on the issue of palestine today we are divided there are muslim countries which are saying no problem that israel wants to take over the country what's happened to the muslim ummah the problem is today we muslims fear more the human beings in this world than fear allah yes everyone will be judged according to the capacity you have everyone has a capacity to dua we should do as you mentioned rightly said but if someone has the capacity to speak and if he does not speak allah will take over his power of speech if someone has the capacity to fight and he doesn't fight allah will take over his power you know today the muslims at the time of masala sallam you muslims were poor what prophet muhammad sallallahu sallam left behind was the sahaba today we muslims are the richest in the world we have the black gold we have the oil we have the petrol what are we nothing we have been used as dormants wealth is not required for us to follow quran and sunnah and our beloved prophet muhammad sallam said i will not fear for my old ummah poverty as much i will fear the richness and the wealth today the problem in others because we are wealthy we have forgotten those muslim countries which have the wealth those muslim countries which have the wealth which they can use in the way of allah they are using in the wrong way i don't have to give examples the world knows about it they are using it to bribe the other people not for the deen [Music] allah doesn't require us you and me the rubbish that we are allah does not require us to make his deen prevail allah is very clear and allah says in the quran in no less than three different places in surah alba chapter number 9 verse number 33 in surah chapter number 48 verse number 29 and surah 7 chapter number 16 verse allah says that allah sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth so that it will prevail over all the other religions all the over isms and allah says the wakafa bill is that this dean of islam will prevail over all the other religions with or without us allah does not require you and me the rubbish that we are his sufficient will make it prevail allah is giving us an opportunity to do a prophet job and to earn a prophet's reward allah is giving another opportunity to make hay while the sun is shining and wallahi we muslims are going away and away from allah and israel the only solution is we go back to allah and israel go back to the quran and the say hadith and inshallah you will find that there will be peace and the hadith allah said that before the world ends muslims will rule the full world for seven years and that would be the best years and we pray to allah we don't know when that will come we pray that may allah make us live to see those tears so solution is the muslims should be united on the basis of quran and they say hope to answer the question"
