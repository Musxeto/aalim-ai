  "title": "The Reason of Increasing Conflict in the World, According to Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "talking about Unity of the humanity which is very fundamental today we're living in a fragmented world a world full of hatred full of killings crisis and what have you confrontations around religious identities around ethnic identities and so on why is this happening to us a conflict in the world for various reasons one of the main reason is for power it is for money it is for status it is for land because most of the people think that world is everything but if you go back to the scriptures if you go to Quran Quran says in M chapter number 67 vers number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you good in Deeds so this life is temporary it's a test for you so if everyone realizes that the life is temporary then you won't run after wealth and Dunya so much for example when I'm traveling I come to Nigeria I stay in a temporary hotel I don't buy a house for me why because I know I'm going to be Nigeria for one week two week three week that's it so if you know that the world is temporary you will not behave like a person who wants to hold wealth so main life is the life after death and most of the religion say the same thing so if every human being understands that this life is temporary it's the test for the Hereafter then you find the difference and that's what I mentioned my talk alquran the global necessity that Quran talks about the part to Salvation about Jenna and our beloved Prophet malli wasallam said that this world for the believer is like a prison yeah and for the unbeliever it is like paradise so there was a poor Jew who approached haani the famous scholar who wrote the sharah of s bukari at this time when and and when he was walking in the marketplace you know on his mule with his big inro so this poor Jew comes and catches his mule and says your Prophet said this that this world is a prison for the believer yes and for the unbeliever it's Paradise it's Paradise I'm a poor man my clothes are tone tattered you're so rich you having all the luxury how can you explain to me this Hadith of your Prophet so H said that I know what awaits for a believer in the Hereafter Paradise that's right and if you compare Paradise to any human being living in this world he may be the richest man he may be the king but compared to the Life in Paradise which is million times better this is like a prison so the first part I explained that because if we know that in the Hereafter for the Believers who follow the Commandments of almighty God they'll go to paradise so Paradise compared to to the richest man in this world he may be a king he may be a sultan he may be a president he may be a prime minister compared to the next life this life is like a prison for that unbeliever if he knows the hell is going to go in even if the poorest man here yet this will be paradise at compared to Hereafter so if you understand this Hadith that life is a test then you will not strive to acquire wealth or power or status you strive to get benefit in the that's it"
