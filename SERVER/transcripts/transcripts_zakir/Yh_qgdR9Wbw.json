  "title": "Why do Muslims Kill Animals? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "brother Pras has asked a very good question very relevant question to the topic when I said that you should not kill any animals they are creational unless you want for food you cannot target practice so why do the Muslims kill animals you can lead a healthy life according to him being an mbb student so why only kill the animals for Taste brother Point number one a Muslim can be a very good Muslim even by being a pure vegetarian there's no verse in the Quran or Hadith which says you should compel have nonage or have flesh you can be a very good Muslim by being a pure vegetarian but Allah subh says in the Quran in Sur MAA chapter number five verse number one you can have all the animals which are lawful for you all four fed animal which are lawful for you with the exception named Allah says in Surah chapter number 16 verse number five that almighty God has created Animal for you so that you can eat the meat Allah says in suron chapter number 23 ver number 21 that verily in the cattle is a sign for you from among the body you get a milk for you to drink and from it you derive warmth and of the meat you can eat so when our creat almighty God gives us permission to have these meat why should we not have it now coming to your argument that in this meet you being an mbbs student even I'm a medical doctor I passed my mbbs and you being mbbs student you might have read I don't know which year on first also you might have I've read that that there are certain amino acids which are not synthesized in the body which are known as essential amino acids there are eight amino acids now these essential amino acids have to be given in the external diet if you don't take an external diet it can cause loss to your body no vegetable on the face of the Earth gives you all the eight essential amino acids no vegetable the only food which gives you all the eight essential amino acids is the meat fish the flesh Foods flesh food is rich in protein rich in vitamins rich in iron it is healthy but yet I do know if you want you can remain healthy even by abstaining from nonv food you can by having a proper diet and checking up and Etc you can I'm not saying you cannot remain healthy but when the food is healthy why abstaining from it the reason people give is that you're hurting animals which will come to it later now if you analyze the set of teeth of the herous animals the cow the goat the Sheep they have flat set of teeth they only have vegetables they will never touch flesh never if you analyze the set of teeth of the carnivorous animals tiger leopard lion they have canine set of teeth they have pointed teeth they only have flesh they never touch grass if you analyze the human being's teeth if you go and look in the mirror if I go and look in the mirror we find that almighty God has given us flat teeth as well as pointed teeth if almighty God [Music] if almighty God wanted us to have only vegetables why did he give us the canine teeth now you are a medical student the canine teeth is for flesh food so this proves that almighty God gave us for having nonv food furthermore the dice system of the herous animals cow goat sheep they cannot digest flesh they can only digest vegetables the dtic system of the Carnivor animals tiger leopard lion can only digest flesh they cannot digest vegetables but the DI of the human being you being a medic student no we can digest nonv also and veg also vegetables also flesh food also even flesh food if almighty God wanted us to have only vegetables why did he give us a DI system he can digest both but natural to have it now coming to your question that there is a misconception amongst the Hindus that the Hindu scripture does not permit them to have non wage I quoted the Quran if you read the Hindu scriptures brother if you read Manus smiti chapter number five Manus smiti chapter number five verse number 3031 it says that if you eat the Flesh of the animals which are meant to be eaten you're not doing a sin because almighty God has created some animal to eat and some to be eaten man SM chapter number 5: 31 that if you sacrifice the animal the sacrifice of animal you're not doing a sin chapter number 5 verse number 39 to 4 says that almighty God has created certain animals to be sacrificed so if you kill the animal to be sacrificed you're not killing Manus SM chapter number 5 verse number 4142 says that a Brahman who has knowledge who knowingly sacrific an animal even the animal goes to heaven and even the Brahman goes to heaven furthermore in r book number 10 himym number 27 verse number two a person says that I'm going to go for war when I come back you prepare for me a great bull furthermore r book number 10 himym number 28 verse number four it say that Indra he say that prepare for me Bulls to eat buffalo bulls to eat and if you read the Mahabharat anushasan chapter number 88 if you read that this is also mentioned Manus chapter number 3 verse number 266 and 277 udish he asked bishma what should we give in the yagna in the Puja in sacrifice so that our ancestors will be satisfied so bishma replies that if you give herbs and shrubs vegetables our ancestors will be satisfied for one month if you give fish they'll be satisfied for 2 months if you give meat they'll be satisfied for 3 months if you give hair rabbit they'll be satisfied for 4 months if you give goat meat they'll be satisfied 5 months if you give bacon for 6 months if you give deer for 7 months if you give birds for 8 months and the menu continues this is scripture of Hindus it further says that if you give a buffalo for 11 months and if you give cow for 12 months and I know is inexhaustibly so even according to Hindu scriptures even according to Hindu Scriptures it gives you permission to have non-v including beef I'm not saying this all the references are there you can check it up it's absolutely correct now coming to The Logical point of it that why do the human beings have to harm the animals when we can live without eating nonv the reason people give that killing an animal is a great sin and killing a plant is a less sin because plant don't have life this was the logic previously Hindu sages and S they had Don they had beef also but they were influenced by the gens of Thea philosophy who believed that plants have got no life therefore eating a plant is the Lesser sin as compared to eating an animal but today you know and even I know that plants have got life so now the logic has changed they say okay brother Zakir we agree plant have got life but plant can't feel pain therefore killing a plant is a lesser sin than killing an animal today science has further Advanced and you have come to know that even the plants can feel pain the plants have a nervous system they can feel pain they can even cry they can even feel happy they even feel sad but the Cry of the plant cannot be heard by the human beings because the human beings can only hear between a frequency of 20 cycles per second to 20,000 cycles per second anything below and above they can't hear you may be aware of a silent dog whistle the dog can hear up to 40,000 cycles per second so the whistle has a frequen quency above the human frequency more than 20,000 cycles per second but below 40,000 cycles per second the master Blows the Whistle human being can't hear the dog hears and comes so even the plants cry but we can't hear just because we can't hear that doesn't mean that we can torture them if you say it's torturing there was one person who argued with me and told me Z I agree with you plants have got life plants can feel pain but the plants have got only two or three senses animals have got five senses therefore killing a plant is a lesser sin as compared to killing animal I told him okay brother for sake of argument I agree with you plants have got two or three sentences animal have got five sentences but suppose you have a brother he's born deaf and dumb two senses L can't speak can't hear when he grows up somebody comes and kills him so will you go and tell the judge oh me Lord give the murderer L punishment because my brother had two sentences less you you will tell him give him a bigger punishment he was a mum you are sinless how did he kill my brother so Islamic logic doesn't work like that two senses or two senses more Allah says in the Quran in Sur Bak CH 2 verse number 168 eat of the good things have provided you what is good you can have what is not good you cannot have if you analyze that if you don't kill these cattles life cycle of the cattle is very short they reproduce very fast if you don't kill the cattles for food you'll have a problem of overp population of the cattles the cow and the Goat they reproduce very fast and if an Indian does not want to have nonv I've got no problem if you don't want to have nonv brother no problem at all personally I'm happy because if all the Indians and the Hindus start having nonv then the price of meat will go high"
