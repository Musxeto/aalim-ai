  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum i am sufyan a 15 year old from pakistan my question is if our purpose in life is only to worship allah then why should we spend most of our lives studying and trying to get degrees and looking for jobs we can just become an imam or a mufti and spend our life serving allah most people spend most of their lives studying and trying to become engineers etc why is that when we should work harder on worshiping allah and preparing ourselves for the next world allah subhana wa saying the glorious quran in surah zarya chapter 51 verse number 56 that i have not created the jinn and mankind except worship me the purpose of the creation of the human beings it is to worship allah subhana wa tala we human beings we have a free will we can either do the right or we can either do the wrong so the more we engage in the remembrance of allah the more we do ibadah we will get reward from allah subhanahu ta'ala and in the year after we will enter paradise and allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala chapter number 28 verse number 77 and do not forget your share in this world we should also not forget this world totally and we have the example of our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him even he was involved in dawa but at the same time he used to do the daily activities the daily things to earn his bread and butter therefore the best profession for any human being it is to convey the mystery of islam to the non-muslims as allah subhana tala says in surah chapter 16 verse number 125 invite to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preachings and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best and most gracious chapter 41 verse number 33 woman who is better in speech than the one who calls others towards allah works righteousness and says that i am a muslim so the best profession is the profession of hada and the best people are those people who are full-time guys those who dedicate their lives for the sake of allah subhanahu ta'ala subhana wa imran chapter a band of people calling towards what is good enjoying what is right and forbidding what is wrong they are the ones to attain felicity today in our community we have full-time doctors full-time engineers how many full-time dies do we have so the best profession is the profession of a die but i do agree that everyone cannot be a full-time die but every human being should at least be a part-time die and we do require certain people to be doctors to be engineers to be teachers etc so even if a person becomes a doctor or engineer or a teacher he should be a good practicing doctor he should be a good practicing engineer he should be a good muslim if a person becomes a doctor if a person becomes an engineer he should not involve in things that are haram for example bribing cheating etc it is good to be a doctor to be an engineer but it should be a good practicing muslim doctor you should be a good practicing muslim engineer and the best profession is the profession of adai the one who conveys the message of islam to others then we also have after that the profession of a scholar and we have after that the profession of a teacher a teacher who teaches islamic studies in a school in a college etc"
