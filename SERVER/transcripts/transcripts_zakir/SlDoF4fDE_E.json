  "title": "Is It Permissible to Read the Quran from the Phone without Wudu' - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question sir I have a question is it permissible to open the Holy Quran on the phone without performing wo open and read it the question posed was that is it permissible to read the Quran on the phone on any smartphone and now it's available there are many quranic apps you download it so if you open on the phone without doing woodoo can you read it or is it compulsory even while reading the Quran on the phone iPhone or tablet you have to have do regarding the question that can we touch a Quran and now I'm talking about the mus of then I'll come to a tablet or electronic device first we'll discuss on the topic is it permissible to tou the Quran the mus of the Quran without voo there is a verse in the Quran where people normally quote of Surak chapter 56 verse number 77 to 80 that None Shall touch the Quran except those who are now this people prove from this verse that because of this verse the Quran is very clearcut Allah says that no one can touch the Quran except in woo you have to be pure this is a misconception if you read this verse in the context of Quran whether you read or any of the it says that this verse was revealed when people laid allegation that the prophet is receiving the messages from the Satan the verse was reveal none can touch it except those of mut now this what they're talking about touching is not the mus of the Quran it's talking about the tablet preserved talking about theim not about the mus of the Quran and when it says except those are mut it's not talking about the person being in a state ofu it's talking about those not about physical Purity it's talking about everything spiritual everything this is referring to the angels so these words of the Quran of Sur CH 56: 77 to 80 when the word maharin is used it not referring to a human being being in Wu it's talking about those absolutely pure talking about the Angels so anyone using this verse of the Quran to prove that you should be in woodoo is totally wrong this is talking about the lus and is referring to the angels to reply to the allegation that the prophet is receiving from the Satan so satans cannot come anywhere close to the tablet well preserved where the original fools is there now coming to the question that is it compulsory to be in woodo when you touch the Quran there is no quranic words that tells you should be in woodoo but there Hadith of the Prophet wasallam that when he sent a letter to the people of Yemen he said that none should touch the Quran except those who are pure now there difference of opinion among the scholars whether is it f for a person to be in woodo the Quran the majority of the scholars say yes you should because the word purity has three levels that you should not be in n and the Quran says that every mush is Naas now here it's talking about impurity of Soul not impurity of body so when they saying that the mush is is N means impurity of Soul that's one level of impurity the second is if a person who is in janaba he is in major impurity or ceremonial impurity even though he is called he may not be in wodo and if he's not in naasa he's not in ceremonial impurity if he's not ejaculated if he didn't have a sexual intercourse if the lady is not going under menstruation then she's yet considered pure even if she's not in woodoo but that's called as the minor state of Purity and the third level is if you're not in woodoo that if you're in vooodoo then you are to pure that means you're not even in minor impurity the three types of impurity one impurity of kaf or mush the second is impurity of NASA because of menstruation ejaculation and third impurity is if you're not in voodo so if you're not in voodo then you are in minor impurity if you are not in woodoo but if you are not in woodoo then you in minor impurity if you have done ejaculation or menstrual cycle or intercourse then that's called a major impurity so Scholars differ so so but the majority of the scholars says that you should be in woo to so the scholars differ what did the prophet mean when he said what type of Purity event that you should be touching the Quran so if it meant that Purity only of the soul that is refering to non-muslims or if it meant only Purity from the major impurity that is ejaculation or menstruation that means okay fine you can't the Quran if you're not in woodoo if it meant that you should not be in minor priority also then you should be in woodoo so the major of the scholars says that you should be in woo but there are Scholars who say there's no evidence so being in Woo is not F but all agree it is must to be in W so while touching the mus of the Quran it is must to be in W some Scholars say it is f some scholar say it's not F but those also say it's not F they do agree it should at least be must and Scholars agree unanimously that if you are major impurity if you naasa or if you are uh have an ejaculation or intercourse then you should not touch the Quran physically now coming to the question that whichever School of whichever scholar you believe in whether it's a f or not to be in F can we touch the mobile can we open the Quran on the mobile and read it or on the tablet or on a computer computer or any electronic device all the scholars unanimously agree that the ruling for touching a mus a copy of the Quran is not the same for electronic device whether it be a mobile phone whether it be a smartphone whether it be a tablet whether it be a computer this doesn't apply so there is no question that you should be in woodoo all the scholars agree that reading the Quran you don't have to be in woo so if you open the Quran on iPhone and touch the iPhone or on a tablet and touch the tablet or on a laptop attach the laptop on a computer attach the computer all scholar manly agree that there is no requirement to be in voodo when you're reading or touching the iPhone or the smartphone or the tablet or a laptop or a computer all unanimously agree that electronic device you don't have to be in Voodoo it's no problem at all but generally of course all Scholars agree that if you are in woo it is preferable even while reting the Quran but it's not a f at all the answer the question"
