  "title": "Why are there No Muslim NGOs doing Dawah to the Terminally ill, the Victimised Girls Around ...",
  "transcript": "but return I have a question about um there are rape victims battered women abandoned babies and terminally ill children and cancer AIDS leprosy patients available around India and in the world but there is no Islamic NGO right now in Bombay to do dhava on them before they die for the akhira as spreading Athen our Islam would be the best charity now there are also 20 000 little girls who were kidnapped by Rebel soldiers a few years ago into African countries and are still held in captivity one would wonder why should we be concerned as we are so far away because my dear brothers sisters as a human being or mother sister or daughter or if you're a man then we are connected to one and pain is the same even if it is across several Seas several countries just imagine brother seven eight year old girl gets raped over and over again by 15 20 men over weeks continuously the first night till 6 a.m and constantly thereafter this is not one child but 20 1000 girls in Uganda and Sierra Leone in Africa and it has happened in our country in the gujarats in Afghanistan in the Bombay rides and keeps happening some Christian missionaries are taking care of those children who have escaped and are too ashamed to go back home I ask how come our Muslims haven't reached there to do al-kawa on those needing souls and Christian missionaries have just ask you a good question the thumbnail patients some with cancer some with AIDS some diseases no one is approaching them to Dava in Bombay or in India throughout the world and I do agree with her and she give the example of rape victims in African countries in Gujarat sister I totally agree with you but you are talking about this few thousand or maybe 10 000 or maybe a few lack what I'm talking about sister there are billions of people throughout the world who are healthy who have not received the message of Allah so what I am talking about is why aren't the Muslims going to this billion people the terminal is also equally important I'm not saying not important but when we aren't going to these billions of people are easily accessible what you're talking is of higher level first I'm telling the Muslims at least passed under 10 then talk about 12th and a degree and a post graduation what you're talking is perfectly right I don't disagree with you but what you're talking is of a graduation and a post graduation I am telling the Muslims at least start doing dhava there are more than 4 billion people in the world who do not practice Islam what we Muslims are lacking is we are doing dhava ourselves so what your concern is right sister I should first introspect myself am I doing my job as a Muslim so you point out very easy I went to this organization I am asking the sister how many terminally ill people did you visit you are the individual person every day can visit 10 yes or no sister sister can you visit 10 people or not or at least five yes or no sister I'm asking a question can you visit five people a day or not how many on average do you visit once in a week a visit once in a week our beloved prophets propagate even if you know one verse it's not that you ask me a question so I'm giving you back it's not like that I am praying to all of you that leave us at terminal at least talk to the healthy friends that you have got that's why we give talks on our destruction on concept of God major religions what we are telling that fine what you are saying is a requirement but the bigger requirement what is easier what is easier that should be done first what is difficult if somebody doing alhamdulillah I wouldn't prevent anyone going to these people but what I am telling that at least let the person pass standard to standard three standard four and then I will ask him that why don't you become a graduate or a postgraduate the problem with the Muslim um that we aren't reading the Quran and following it this Christian Mysteries they are more dedicated though they have got the falsehood with them yet they get results because Allah is with us our results are superior it is not because we are doing the job is because Allah is with us and the haq is with us but if we do the work if we have the dedication what the Christian Missionary have believe me Wallah majority of the people in the world would be Muslims majority the problem is that we don't have that much of zeal with the Christian Mission you'll have and there are limited Islamic organization involved in the field of dhava so what you should do sister you should start instead of once a week go daily you will surely get Friends Along inspired by we started and now Masha Allah we have about more than 70 employees in RF and we started a school 70 employee now you have a branch engineer another 14 price for 85 students so we grow then it became five then became hundred then thousand then ten thousand now we have billion people what we say why aren't you doing I'm saying why and I'm doing it and yet I'm not satisfied what I'm doing so sister you start and you call people that who's ready to join me not why aren't you doing you should ask your friend who is willing to come with me and surely you'll have one friend then two then five then ten and you grow the thing is what happens if someone does a job people normally think okay he's done this now you should do that also then you should do three then you should do five then you should do 10 they should do 20. this is the age of specialization sister we know I agree with you that we speak with the terminally ill people is a requirement but if there are two options we are taking the thing which is more required somebody should take the other if we had died if we had duas surely we would have even gone to the terminal patients to the hospital to the organizations what we feel that what is easily accessible Beyond doing that so what is more difficult that's there in our mind you would like to go door to door this Christian Missionary they go door to door they knock at the Muslim houses day to day foreign we don't have the Manpower with us even after having 70 people full-time paid employees we don't have enough speakers we are getting calls from different parts of the world from Australia from USA from Canada from Hong Kong we can go because of the work we're involved in so the thing sister is that each individual should realize that Allah will ask him what he has done or what she has done Allah will not ask why has any organization mummy done it Allah will ask each individual human being each individual Muslim what did you do for the ummah but to each and every one of us you are including myself that Allah will ask us that have we done the capacity Allah has given us have we done our duty and if every individual even if five percent or two percent of the Muslim realize this then the world will be a different place altogether inshallah as far as the question regarding rape victim that do agree with you it's happened in the African countries in Gujarat iron of many organizations who have supported these people not that they haven't but did what they have done is very little I have enough organization that have taken up these children who have become orphans and have given them education I know but what we have done is let's catch the surface not the Muslims haven't done there are many non-muslims who came and the Christian Mission is the specialty when any Calamity comes that's the time they give food they give clothing and that's the Run they win the heart we people talk about Islam you should do this do that and the stomach is empty how can the person concentrate these missionaries they give them the basic necessity and they win over the hearts they receive we should not use deceit people there should be Muslim organization you should go to Calamity not only do Muslim calamities even a Calamity before the non-muslims we should be the first to reach them the problem is that very few people of us are involved in this field of dawa and the work of Islam inshallah we hope that we have more people and more organizations involved in the field so that we can do a better job as far into them is concerned in the Christian missionaries and male accept our efforts hope to answer the questioning system"
