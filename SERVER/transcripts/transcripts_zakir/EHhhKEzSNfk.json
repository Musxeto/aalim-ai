  "transcript": "the next question is from aliza fatima she's studying mbbs from pakistan when a corrupt leader is elected we are also responsible for the sins he commits as a leader what should be our priorities while electing a leader in today's circumstances when we cannot find a loyal and honest leader what should we do should we give our vote or waste our right to elect a similar question is posed by majid khan from hyderabad india what are the qualities we should look for in today's age for selecting a leader for the muslims according to me dr zakir naik would be my best choice to lead the muslim ummah today basically the question posed here is that in today's world most of the muslim leaders are dishonest they are corrupt so who should we choose or should we let our vote go and waste and the second question is that what are the qualities that a muslim leader should have and the brother suggested that i should be the leader which will come to it later on which i'll answer inshallah as far as what should the qualities of a muslim leader be is the best exemplary muslim leader in the world is a beloved prophet muslim that's the reason michael h hart he places him number one in the list of 100 most influential human beings in the history of humankind imagine he being a non-muslim places no muslim number one and he says that prophet muhammed peace be upon him was not only successful as a religious leader he was even successful as a social and a political leader because of that he placed him number one that he was not only a successful religious leader he was also a successful social and a political leader so the best example of a political leader in the world today we have is prophet muhammad peace be upon him after that we have the example of the khul farashiri they are best examples for us after the prophet and that is the reason michael hart he places you know um him as number 51 because he was a very successful leader so if today unfortunately i don't know of any muslim leader who is anywhere close to the quality of leadership of prophet sallam not even point zero zero one percent liver says that not even close he was he was so successful that he expanded the muslim empire masha'allah and if you read his seerah you will find the example how a muslim leader should be unfortunately unfortunate today none of the muslim leaders we have about 56 to 57 countries in which majority of the people are muslims in some country hundred percent some more than 95 some more than 90 some more than 50 percent there are about 57 countries in the world out of little bit more than 200 countries that we more than 27 of the countries in the world they are countries in which muslims and majority unfortunately none of these leaders are anywhere close to umar al-khattab nowhere close and if you read the seerah of the malay pleases him he told his family that if any of my family members break any of the rules they will get double punishment because the family of a caliph should be following the rules much more than others if they break any rule they will get double punishment and you have several examples unfortunately we find today that most of the muslim leaders they are more as as their sister rightly ask the question that most of them are corrupt most of them are dishonest they are involved more in making money for themselves unfortunately just let me give you an example of that when he was the khalifah he had two of his sons abdullah and abed allah may allah be pleased with them both when they went to the governor of basarando pastor basra the governor called them and he was very happy to meet them he said what can i do for you then he said why don't you give this amana to amir al-mumini to your father but i give you permission that on your way you can utilize the money for business and when you get the principal amount back keep the profit and you can give the principal amount back to a little more money so both the sons of uh umara dalawan they take the money and on their way to business and they get a huge profit and they go and give the principal amount to their father mira mohammedin and they say this is what the governor of basra said and this is the amana so um was angry and he asked his sons that did the governor give this money to somebody else they said no so how come they how come he has given it to you so um commanded to his sons that give the principal amount as well as the complete profit give everything to my turmoil then the people who were close to the marathas they told that this is the business deal and the permission was given by the governor so what is the fault and if it's the business deal we're allowed to do that so finally after a lot of discussion when they said that you know he should change his ruling then hatha tomorrow said okay fine give fifty percent of the profit to the vital man so we see he was so strict and he made it a law that any of his governor before they appointed he checked their wealth and once they release the post he checks the wealth again and he allows only a small percentage of increase anything more than that he said give it to baithurman not that he accused them of corruption no he said that means even if you spend more time in the worldly affairs you're not fit to be a governor if you want to be a governor under my rule you have to give your pure time to your duty even if you make money honestly that is not your purpose unfortunately we see today in the muslim ummah most of the muslim leaders they are far away from the deen if you just take the basic concept of salah i believe more than fifty percent of the muslim leaders they may not be offering fighter salah in congregation there may be a handful just a small percentage who may be offering five times salad also in your congregation so unfortunately the state of the muslim ummah today we have gone far away from the quran and sunnah that's the reason we have today that the situation that the ummah is in today because we have gone far away from the quran and the sunnah we have gone far away from the teachings of allah and the teachings of beloved prophet muslim and i do agree with the sister that today unfortunately the choice that we have is so limited and unfortunately most of them would not fit the criteria of how a muslim leader should be as per the quran sunnah so what should we do in this situation what we have to do is that we have to select the best of the worst and if we analyze as i mentioned that almost all the leaders they don't have the qualities that a true muslim leader should have like or even a small percentage not even two percent of the quality of those one so what we have to do we have to select the best of the most and i do agree with the sister that almost all of the muslim politicians they are corrupt whether it be financially whether it be with iman they are almost all there may be one or two or three exceptions to the rule so what should we do in this situation as i mentioned we should select the best of the worst number one according to me is that select that muslim leader who is becoming a leader on the islamic card that he's proud to be a muslim and he says that i will i'm proud to be a muslim and i will upheld the islamic law whether he does or not is secondary because in today's world the basic rule for a politician today unfortunately is that he has to maintain his chair by who go back it may go against his set of rules it may go against his dean it may go against his family as long as he is sitting on the chair he is happy so he will do anything to maintain his chair because of this reason my first advice is that if two two muslim leaders are standing select that muslim leader who openly says that he's proud to be a muslim and he is coming on the islamic card he may or may not be a practicing muslim that is secondary i will go to the extent of saying that if there is one muslim leader who is practicing islam 20 percent but is coming on the secular card he is not saying that i will protect the muslims i will follow islam and there is another muslim leader who is following ten percent of islam but he's coming with islamic card he's openly saying that i will i will protect the religion of islam i will i will protect the muslims better select the person who's following ten percent islam is coming with the islamic card rather than the other muslim leaders falling 20 percent and is not coming on the islamic card because the person who's not coming on the islamic card will not go out of his way to follow the islamic principles because that is not that was not histamka to win the election whereas the other muslim leader who may not be following islam as much as the other person both are below average but at least because he's come with islamic card he will see to it that he'll make more massages he may not praise allah but he seated he will make sajid more mosque he will protect the law of islam he will help the muslim because his trump card to win the election was the islamic card this is a very key point unfortunately and we know as the sister rightly said that majority almost all are corrupt so but if you have a corrupt leader who's coming with islamic card is better than a corrupt leader who's coming without the islamic card there are maybe one two or three if we search in the muslim ummah who may be following majority of the farahs in islam but they may not be having the acumen to be a good leader we have on the other example some muslim leader who have praised in my speech they may be bold they may stand for justice they will not be following islam to the tea they may not be offering fight and salah may be offering maybe a few times in a week but they may openly produce islam because because that is the principle but they are not doing it for the islam because they are doing because that is what they feel is right they are more for the cause of humanity but islam is far above humanity so because of that they may bring a voice in the international media but the practice may not be islamic so such leaders may benefit in one particular aspect of islam to the muslim ummah but on the other hand there may be a danger so that is the reason i personally prefer that you select those muslim leaders who number one are proud to be muslims unfortunately when you look at the muslim leaders most of them they are not following the sunnah i am giving a small example of keeping a beard it's not a big thing to keep a beard doesn't take any effort but a beloved prophet muslim said if mentioned say buhari volume number seven hadith number 5892 that the prophet said that do the opposite of what the mushriks do what the unbelievers do grow your blood and trim your mustaches according to all four schools of thought all the four ammas keeping a bear different it's such a small effort but yet unfortunately majority more than 75 of the muslim leaders who are men they don't have a beard why that means they're not proud to be muslims that doesn't mean if you keep a beard you're fulfilled all the requirements no please don't get me wrong in requirements you have to follow the 70 majors in and see how good the person is so what we have to realize my basic point here is that select those muslim leaders who are proud to be muslims even though they may be less in practice a person who is proud to be a muslim and a practicing muslim is the best who's practicing and keeping doing all the ferris i don't think so if you search you may find one or two but they may not be good leaders but they may be following the ferris so here see to it that you like those who are coming with islamic card and those who are proud to be muslims and present themselves as muslims are not shy when they meet the non-muslim leaders they are not shy to present themselves and muslims coming to the uh to the second part of the question that these criterias the best is read the seerah of the prophet and see rafa umar the one and you see the examples in the life how how honest and none of these leaders they wanted to become leaders of the power anyone who wants to be an amir wants to be a leader is not the right person here we find that most of the leaders want to be leaders in the islamic teachings a person who himself wants to be a leader should not be made the leader the other people who make him and all the khalifas they were made by others and you have these examples as far as the question posed by the brother majid that he feels that dr zakir naik is the best choice i'm sorry i disagree with you totally i don't have the qualities to be a leader at all and i don't consider myself and what i've seen in my life in my personal life i've seen that many religious people when they enter into politics almost all of them went away from the theme i know several schools of muslim who are very good practicing muslims who offering fighters allah who are very honest and they gave such beautiful lectures but the moment they entered politics they got corrupt they got influenced because unfortunately the ummah that we have today they are not like the sahaba the time of the prophethin first they would take decision thinking what would allah want me to do they were more scared of disappointing allah today our politicians are more interested how will it benefit them personally they don't they don't want to disappoint the world bank the qualifier rashfdeen they did not want to disappoint allah they would take a decision which would be completely against them as long as it pleases allah as allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 135 that yah yo lazina or you believe stand out for justice as witness to allah even if you be against yourself against your parents against your talking against the rich or poor allah protects all there were many times the question was asked to me in india that why don't i enter politics and i said that i mean why do you want to become enemy i mean i have to jokingly tell them because in today's world if you enter politics there are high chances that you will spoil your very high chances because the way the ummah and the society is made that if you want to live and remain in that seat you will have to compromise on your principles and the best example i can give you is of dr israel you know that masha'allah he was a very great guy and he gave the fear of the quran he was very knowledgeable he was popular and he stood for election and he won the election after he won the election member of parliament he was made and he was given some post and after a few months he resigned he says asking me how what should be the width of the road that's not what i'm made for when i'm giving them islamic solution they don't want to listen he immediately resigned so good person who is following the deen he will either have to give up his deen or give up his position and whatever dr israel did was the best there may be few people like dr israel remadu may be islamic and may have gotten into politics but i don't know anyone who's a leader may have come on a lower position not as head of state and may be following the deen but the way the society is made today our ummah you will either have to give up the post that you are in or give up the deen so first of all i'm not fit to be in that position neither do i want to spoil my akhirah i would i'm very happy in being a guy and i am very satisfied with allah whatever yamaha has given me"
