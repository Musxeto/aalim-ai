  "transcript": "dr zakir you mentioned a verse just now can we just ask you the significance of that verse eat and drink until the white thread of dawn appears distinct from the black thread when this verse was revealed for the first time surah chapter number 2 verse number 187 it said that eat and drink till the white thread you can differentiate from the black thread movement this verse was revealed the sabbah's understood the meaning as the verse was revealed and it's mentioned in say al-bukhari verb number six hadith number four five zero nine that when sabha the moment he heard this verse he took two hair strings one black and one white and he kept it beneath his pillow and when he got up for soho he tried to differentiate between the white string from the black string and he could not really understand so i went to the prophet and asked him what does it mean and another hadith that's mentioned in say bihari volume number six hadith number four five one zero where it says that one sahabah he took two threads one black thread and one white thread and he tied it in his toes in the legs and he kept on eating until he can differentiate between these two threads but when they went to the prophet and ask what does it mean that until you can differentiate the white thread from the black thread then the prophet made them understand what it actually means is until you can differentiate the white thread of dawn that means the light of dawn from the black thread of night and then the verse was revealed incomplete and the word of dawn was revealed later on first the verse first until you can differentiate the white thread from the black thread then allah reveals in between white thread of dawn but the complete verse then is revealed so then it was made clear and a beloved person masala sallam he explained the meaning of true fajr and he said that the first fajr is known as the false fighter where you see a vertical white streak of light which is somewhat similar to the tail of a fox but that is known as the false fire and the second fajr which is the true fajr is when the redness of light it spreads horizontally in the sky which you can see it in the mountains and which reaches the houses and the streets so that is the true fajr that is the break of dawn when a person should stop eating at that time and this is clarified further in the hadith of the perfect masala sallam it's mentioned in assay hadith of al-bayaki hadith number 8003 where the prophet said the first fajr does not prohibit you from eating the food and it does not make the fajr prayer lawful and the second fajr that is the true fajr it makes the eating of food prohibited and it makes the fajr salah lawful so we made the differentiation between the two types of fajr and further it's mentioned in the hadith of sunnah verb number two in the book of fasting hadith number 2348 where the prophet said let the people continue eating and drinking and should not stop when they see the white vertical light and they should keep on eating until they see the horizontal redness of fajr that's the true fajr and it's for the mention in say muslim world number two in the book of fasting hadith number two four zero seven and two four zero eight hadaz with her she said that let not the call of bilal my life please with him and the whiteness of the first fajr deceive the people and let them not stop eating that means they can continue eating and there's another hadith which says that let not the call of father bilal deceive you continue eating until you hear the call of tom so this actually is the complete meaning of the quranic verse that you can eat until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct from the black thread of night"
