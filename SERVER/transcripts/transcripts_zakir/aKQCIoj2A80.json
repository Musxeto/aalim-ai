  "transcript": "the next question is from an anonymous from Kashmir I've seen you seeing many a time that where does Jesus himself say in the Bible that I am God or worship me I was on the YouTube when I saw Christian demanding of us from the Quran in which Jesus himself says I am only a prophet or don't worship me in in ordered commas kindly comment the question posed by a brother from Kashmir is that when I make a statement challenging the Christian that there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ being himself say that I am God or worship me the counter question is that is there any statement in the Quran where Jesus Christ Himself says do not worship Me yes there are and more than once unless word Allah says in the Quran in surah maidah chap number five was number 72 Allah says look at Carla Xena Carlo and they are because they are blasphemy those who say innallaha well if a broom ARIMA they are blaspheming they are doing good for those who say that allah is jesus the son of mary and there was continuous what calamansi but said Christ yeah but he is right universal oh boo doo la worship Allah Ribeira bakhoum who's my Lord and your Lord in no mushrik billah anyone who associate partners with Allah  Haram illogical janma Allah will make jihad Haram for me Omar Warner vimala's all women and SAR and Phi shall be well in place and they will be no helpers for him in the air after here in this verse also am i - at number 5 verse number 72 it's clearly mentioning that they are blaspheming they are doing cuff those who say that Allah if Jesus the Son of Mary but said Christ but they did this peace be upon him ocean of Israel oh Allah worship Allah yeah Jesus himself is saying Allah in the Quran but Jesus Christ peace be upon him said oh I worship Allah and Rabia were a book with my Lord and your Lord in no mushrik billah and anyone who associate partners with allah haram al al Jenna I love you big did not Haram for him wahoo narva Molly Solomon and sad and if I shall be dwelling place and he shall have no helpers in the air after this is clear-cut Jesus Christ peace be upon him in the Bible Allah says that G they said in his word that worship only Allah it further mentioned in surah my the chapter number 5 was from 160 117 that on the day of judgment when Allah will argue this case peace be upon him did you tell them to worship you or your mother instead of me and Jesus Christ peace be upon him replied inframan that chapter first number 117 you are my witness I never said that but I said o Allah worship Allah Rob ba-ba-boom with my lord in your God clearly mention it further mentioned in surah saff chapter number 61 Osama 6 that Jesus Christ peace be upon him faith that I have been sent to you as a messenger from Allah giving black tidings of a messenger to come whose name shall be Ahmad so Jesus peace be upon send as a messenger and you also said that there the messenger to come whose name would be a much a mother than in the name from Hamas Alesana so there are various many verses in the Quran Majeed FK speeds by point if you do not worship anyone where worship Allah and there are various other verses we save it said if ur Rasool Allah that ether is the Messenger of Allah many verses obvious question"
