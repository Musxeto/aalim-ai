  "transcript": "assalam alikum Dr Zak N I am Hamza from Morocco and one of your big fans I always wonder why you don't Target most famous personalities who have big influence on the world like singers Justin bber Ed shiran or actors or football players Ronaldo Messi neyar they have huge followers if one accepts Islam Millions will accept lastly when will you visit Morocco brother ham asked a very good question he's wondering why don't I Target celebrities you know the famous personalities like actors like football players Etc brother if you can arrange any meeting with any of the celebrities I'm welcome I am always available if you can arrange any meeting with any celebrity who has a large following surely I'll take out my time and do dawa with them to do dawa with the celebrities is not easy if we get any opportunity we don't miss it we sometimes go out of the way and there have been occasions in India when we had talks which I've very busy I thought to it that if there is a celebrity who we have a chance of doing dawa but we see to it that we don't break any rules of the Sharia we have to follow our principles we don't don't do anything Haram to do dawa to them and if you can do it though there have been occasions where we have done with many of the film actors you know had shows Etc with them but I would not like to waste my time okay if I can have to waste 20 40 50 hours and then I'll get an appointment I better not do it so if I'm going to waste 100 hours of mine my precious time where I can maybe convince many people or do dawa okay if it's possible little bit more time no problem once twice thce four times no problem but not spend time and then you may not get results you try for an appointment you don't get appointment so I don't really go out of the way if I know there is someone who can arrange the meeting I'm available but I Will Not Waste 100 hours and then after 100 hours nothing happens you know you try to meet someone you spend hours so the thing is there that it's good because even the prophet always and when the Quran says Target the head of the kufar so targeting celebrities is good but I don't want to spend times in which I will not get results so there are occasions there where we had opportunities to speak to celebrities important people with people of High profession and he went out of the way to do daas but since you have asked this question if you can arrange anyone I'm willing I'm always I in mind giving double the time also to anyone who is a celebrity and who has a l following whether they accept or not our job is to do Allah says your job is to deliver the message giving in hands of Allah subhana tala and I'm coming to your last question that when will I come to moru I've been to moru if I'm not mistaken in 2014 I visited Morocco I had been to kasab Lanka I've been to Marakesh I've been to rabbe it's a beautiful country mashallah very good scener I'd gone there to attend a conference and I gave a talk with that was long back in 2014 next when Allah wishes when you know my requirements are different now so my requirements are fulfilled and if there is time inshallah I wouldn't mind visiting Morocco again when will it happen Allah knows the best at present there are many invitations in the pipeline we are struggling with time and we trying to get slots for the various invitation that we have received inshallah inshallah if you receive invitation from Morocco from the criteria that I mentioned and if it takes place I would love to go to Morocco again hope that answer the question"
