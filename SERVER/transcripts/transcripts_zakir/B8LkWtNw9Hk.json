  "title": "Should a Person Change their Name before Accepting Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the question posed by the sister is is it compulsory for a non-muslim to change his or her name before he or she accept Islam seeing the tradition of beloved Prophet we have to analyze what he did as I mentioned my talk the prophet never ever advised anyone to change the family name because the family name gives the background from which region is coming from which family is coming it shows the lineage as far as the name is concerned that a given name the first name if the first name has a element of shik in it shik that's what partners with Allah subhana tala then the name should be changed like a person name is Ram or lakman it has element of shik because these are dieties of certain non-muslims has element of shik if it has an element of shik then the given name should be changed otherwise there's option you can continue or you may change it the option is yours many a time our beloved Prophet wasallam did not change the name of the people who accepted Islam many times they advise them change it if it contain element of sh it's a compulsory even if it doesn't contain if the person changes alhamdulillah no problem at all and once in ARF there was a non-muslim girl a Hindu who was about to accept Islam and many of time the reason is that because they want to marry a Muslim boy and which normally the Quran says in Bak 2: 221 that do not marry non-muslims not marry a woman to non-muslim men mush men until they believe a Muslim man who's a Believer a Muslim man who a jadua is much better than a non-muslim even if he allows you if a Muslim woman has option to marry a Muslim man who's a jadua as compared to a non-muslim who's a mushrik he may be the most handsome man he may be Aman but if the option is between a Muslim man with a jadua he's much better than a non-muslim even if he allows you and similar case is when a Muslim man has to marry a woman if she's non-muslim it's not allowed if she's a mushrik it's not allowed unless she becomes a Muslim once there was a case in which a Hindu girl wanted to accept Islam and after speaking with the the boy who bought that girl I could realize that you know the main reason was only because it was a love marriage you know infatuation but I cannot doubt anyone she wants to accept Islam I say le le we have to guide them in the right channels and having a discussion she asked me brother Zak should I change the name compulsory and but natur seeing that the meam was there seeing to it that meam was there I could talk through the meam and I gave the reason that why Muslim should wear the label and I gave a short synopsis of this talk he's saying brother Zakir how illogical can a person be for 25 years for 25 years I've been called by the name of Shilpa I'm changing the name so that the identity is not revealed I've been called by the name of Shilpa now after 25 years you telling me change the name how illogical can you be I told her to the husband when a person becomes a doctor he gets a doctor's degree he changes from Mr to doctor because being a doctor is better but she was not convinced I asked her do you like Islam she said yes and I could make out that the main reason she wanted to convert revert to Islam was for the boy what to do you have to use your hikma so I asked her sister what is your full name so she told me I'm changing the name my name is Shilpa pandurang desm Shilpa P so I asked her sister after you married this brother whose name was Abdul Karim shik after you marri this Abdul Karim shik what will your name be so she said my name will be Shilpa Abdul Karim shik so I said sister how illogical can you be for 25 years you were called Shilpa pandurang deshmuk and now you want to call yourself Shila Abdul Karim shik how in logical can you be and the discussion was over I was trying to prove to her the point that she's willing to change her surname because previously she preferred to be identified as the daughter of pandang deshmuk now she wants to be identified as wife of Abdul Karim shik so similarly previously you were a Hindu now if you know and you agree that Islam is a better religion why are you not willing to be identified as a Muslim and the discussion was over whether she changed her name or not I don't know but when you speak with them you have to speak with sikma regarding the reply it's not compulsory unless the name contains element of shik if it doesn't contain the option is there you can keep that name or change the name hope that answer the question"
