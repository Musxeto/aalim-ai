  "transcript": "eliana non-muslim by qualification teacher thank you very much for very interesting lecture i have one question i find it immoral and vulgar for a muslim to have more than one wife what do you think about this actually i know the roots of this but i want to know your opinion about this and i think if our religions christianity and islam unites i think that muslims should have one wife sisters asked a very good question very common question very important question she asked that she thinks according to her it is immoral for a muslim to have more than one wife and she is requesting me that if christians and muslims unite on this point it will be very good that's what i want to do but we unite on what is the truth not what is falsehood quran sister is the only religious scripture on the face of the earth which says marry only one there is no scripture on the face of the earth you read the bible you read the rama and you read the mahabharat read the veda no scripture except the quran says marry only one if you read the hindu scriptures if you read the hindu scriptures ramayana the father of sriram king dashrat he had more than one wife if you read mahabharat shri christian how many wife yet four ten thousand he had sixteen thousand one and eight wives if you read the bible if you read the bible solomon had 700 wives according to the bible abraham had three wives so according to the bible according to judaism and christianity a man can have as many wives as he pleases four five ten thousand no upper limit islam has put an upper limit quran says in surah nisa chapter number four verse number three marry woman of your choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one so according to hinduism according to christianity you can marry as many wives as you wish 1 5 10 thousand ten thousand no upper limit islam says mary won't have a choice in two threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one so islam says you can marry more than one only if you can do justice otherwise you can't and even if you can do justice maximum four now let's analyze what quran says quran says in surah nisa chapter 4 verse 129 it is difficult to be just between your wives therefore do not turn away from them altogether so many people have a misconception that in islam it is compulsory to have four wives it's not compulsory to marry more than one my sister is optional it's muba but if you marry more than one wife and if you can't do justice then you have problem now let us understand what are the logical reasons sister i'll give the logical reasons and then if you want you can count the question the logical reason why islam gives permission for some people to have more than one wife now by nature if you analyze male and female are born in equal proportion but you ask any pediatrician any medical doctor of the children he will tell you that the female child can fight the germ then the disease is much better than the male child so there are more male children dying as compared to female children as life goes on there is dead due to cigarette smoking death due to various other diseases that due to alcoholism that due to war they're due to accidents there are more males dying as compared to female today in the world system if you analyze there are more females in the world as compared to males there are more women as compared to men except in a few third world countries like india where i come from the female population is less than the male population it is because of female feticide and female infanticide if you stop this evil practice of female fetishized and female infanticide even in india the population of the females will outnumber the male population today according to statistics in new york alone there are more than one million females more than males in usa alone there are 7.8 million females more than males in germany alone there are 5 million females more than males in uk alone there are 4 million women more than males in russia alone there are 9 million females more than males and god alone knows how many millions of females are more than will throughout the world suppose i agree with you hypothetically that one man should marry only one woman and if my sister happens to live in america and if the market is saturated or if your sister happens to live in america and if the market is saturated every man has found a woman for himself yet there will be 7.8 million females who will not find life partners the only option remaining for these 7.8 million females is that they either marry a man who already has a wife or become public property people will say public property zakir such a hash word it is the most sophisticated word i can use i can't use a better word than that you either marry a man who already has a wife or become public property there's no third option so now if we analyze in usa according to american statistics a common american on average has eight different sexual partners before he settles down with one that means some may have two some may have ten some may have twenty eight different sexual partners before he settles down with one and you can have as many mistresses as you want one ten 20 no problem but legal wife more than one it doesn't go down the truth and you ask any modest woman if a woman becomes the second legal wife of a man she gets respect she gets honor she gets the rights if you become a mistress there's no honor there are no rights she's degraded so islam has the solution to the problems of humankind today there are more women in the world than the men according to me islam has permitted some men to have more than one wife so that the woman can live modestly otherwise it's not possible i do agree with you sister i do agree with your sister that a woman would not like to share a husband i agree with you that a woman would not like to share a husband but no woman under normal circumstances would like a husband to marry one more woman but the islamic sharia says let a small loss take place to prevent a big loss a good muslim a good muslim woman who knows the worst scenario she would not mind taking a small loss that is sharing a husband to prevent a big loss that is making a sister becoming a public property yes sister do you have any i said immoral because if a woman has more than one man she is a bad woman but if a man has more than one woman he is it's okay yeah that's a very good question sisters asked the question that if a man has more than one woman he's a good man no if a man has more than one wife no problem but if he has more than one woman even he's a bad man like in america one man has got four mistakes five minutes ten mistress even in india he's a bad man but if he has a legal wife if he does nikah if he marries her gives her due right give us man equal time equal justice then he's a good man but now the counter question why can't a woman have more than one husband correct is that your question is the question that why can't a woman have more than one thinking that in case if female population increases and male population decreases so female can have two or three husbands that's a very good question your hypothetical question but almighty god who's our creator he knows better than you and me he's our creator and the reason because god has made the woman a stronger sex she is medically more stronger than the man you know that i am a medical doctor sister medically a woman can live for longer years than a man we think the man is strong physically man is strong but medically the woman is stronger she lives longer her longevity the average span of a woman is few years more than a man they are led that's in the pediatric age group and regarding your main question that islam allows polygini a man to have more than one wife but does not allow polyandry that is a moment of more than one husband why the reason is that if a man has more than one wife and if a child is born you can easily identify who is the father and who is the mother but if a woman has more than one husband and if the child is born you can identify the mother but to identify the father [Applause] so if you go to admit your child in the school what is the name of the father you may have to give two names now we know that medical science is advanced by dna genetic coding we can come to know who the father but that is now not in the past islam is this this time memorial and this is not the only reason furthermore there are various other reasons man is biologically more sexual as compared to women thirdly a man can do the role of multiple husbands as compared to women doing a role of multiple wives because she undergoes menstrual cycle there are various psychological changes which it will be difficult for her to do the role of multiple wives and furthermore today science tells us that if a man has more than one sexual partner and if they're loyal to them like if a man has more than one wife more than one sexual partner and if all of them are faithful to each other the man does not neither the woman develop any sexual transmitted disease but if a woman has more than one sexual partner if she has more than one husband then the sexually transmitted disease will emerge she will have that disease and she'll retransmit it back to the husband so even medically it is not good for a woman to have more than one sexual partner hope to answer the question"
