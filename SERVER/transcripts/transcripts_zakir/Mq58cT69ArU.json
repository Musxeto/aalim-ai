  "title": "An Authentic Warning against Ahmadis Falsely Attributed to Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "again this information is not from me I have not published any such post but I'm aware that this is circulating again in the social media since many years and since we have a large collection of various English translation of the Quran we have this copy of the translation of the Quran by m Sher Ali and I'm aware that this translation is by the amedis and Ahmed is a sect of the kadis and they believe that Ahmed Mah gulam Ahmed is a Nabi who came after the prophet and there's a big history of one but this is not the mainstream Muslim they don't belong to jamat theis the ahed sect so this translation of M Ali is by an ahed so of course we Muslims should be careful about it so the information that we have to be careful and should not read it should not spread it is correct but this was not circulated by me this message is not from me so it falls under that category that this information is correct but I didn't draft it the warning is correct and we should not read it should not spread it because it's not a translation from jamat It Is by kadani it's by ahed which is not on the Quran and Sunnah"
