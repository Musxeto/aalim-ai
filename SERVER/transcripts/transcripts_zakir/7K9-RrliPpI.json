  "transcript": "mezzo chiefly Manchester UK is kosher meat halal kosher meat is the meat which is slaughtered by the Jews and our rather author of Jews is it halal as far as the Quran clearly mentioned in surah mine the chapter 5 verse number 5 that lawful for you lawful for the Muslims is the food of the ellicott up so all food of le kitab is lawful but natural the difference of opinion as far as if a christian gives food there are many scholars many Arab scholars who say that if Christians of the food even on Zambia it is halal according to me it's not a lot because they are not following the rules of the Bible then ask them the question if they you poke really have they said no I said well so these for example our focus Haram in the Bible no they may not be that much well verse with the comparative religion that's not the field compared which is my field so if we analyze the Bible according to the Bible also slaughter it should be done unfortunately most of the Christian don't follow but the Jews follow as Allah says in the Quran in no less than 4 different places in surah Baqarah chap number 2 was them 173 and so remind that chap number 5 verse number 3 and so the UNAM terrific was number 145 and so then held up number sixteen verse eleven hundred fifteen who Ramat alaikum old mind to to what the mualim will conceal omar ali get in lobby foreign for you for food are dead meat blood the flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides allah name is in war so all the muslim know very well that deals for food are prohibited red meat blood the flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides allah name has been taken and these four foods also probably in the bible that's the different thing that the christian don't follow but the Jews follow if you read the Bible Bible prohibits dead meat dead meat is probability in the Bible time will not permit to describe in detail I just mentioned the references it's mentioned in the Book of Leviticus chapter number 17 verse verse number 15 and the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number 21 that dead meat is private even blood is prohibited in the Bible in knowledge and five different places it's mentioned the book of Genesis chapter number nine verse number four in the Book of Leviticus chapter number 17 verse number 14 in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 12 verse number 16 in the first time wheel chapter number 14 verse number 33 and the book of Acts chapter number 50 verse number 29 that blood is prohibited if we'd poke is prohibited in the Bible in the Book of Leviticus chapter number 11 verse number 7 in it in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 14 verse number 8 and the Book of Isaiah chapter number 65 verse number two to five any meat on which any name besides Allah name is taken or it is soldered on an idol it is forbidden in the Bible in the book of Acts step number 15 verse number 29 and the book of Revelation chapter number two was no 14 so based on this when the Quran says food of the ellika table is permitted according to me even dead meat is prohibited if in blood is prohibited polkas prevent any name on which any name be says Allah's name will take in this prohibited so this machine are not strict and they they sell meat which is non Zambia which is totally wrong with a non kosher totally wrong but the Jews which are Orthodox they do in the way the Bible has commanded we see the same as a ceramic method almost same I remember in the late eighties on the early nineteen when ice to travel there was nothing like halal food in the flight but there was the option of kosher food because the Jews are very particular and they are more particular than the Muslims so when asked to travel eyes to order for sure mean for the Muslim if halal meat Zambia meat is available and the best to have but if they know that we are meet in this kosher meat you can safely have it it's permitted but don't have the non Zambia meat it is haram for you"
