  "transcript": "and many times they see that for the same person for the same activity two different labels are given and the best example is when India was ruled by the British government about more than 60 years ago there were many Indians who were fighting for the freedom of the country these people buy the British government they were called as terrorists but we come in Indians we call these people as Patriots as Freedom Fighters same people same activity but two different levels if you agree with the view of the British government that they had a right to rule over India then you have to call these people as terrorists but if you agree with the view of the common Indians that the britishers came to India to do business they have no right to roll over us you would call these people as Patriots as Freedom Fighters same people same activity but two different levels and many a times when I'm addressing the Indian press and they asked me the question that why are Muslims terrorists so I asked them a question that more than 65 years ago the britishers called bhagat Singh as a terrorist do you believe and the person is no I said well because we know that bhagat Singh was not a terrorist he was a patriot I said even I do not agree that bhagat Singh was a terrorist he was a patriot 60 years back when the British you don't agree with him now when the britishers are living Muslim are terrorists why do you agree with them why these double standards and we have this example in history in several places in the world"
