  "transcript": "you know assalamualaikum brother her question is when Almighty Allah can create anything why did it take six days for him to create the entire world the sisters asked the question that Allah can create anything so why did it take six days sister if Allah wanted you could have learned one day but then you would ask the why did Allah created in one day why not in six days so because Allah wanted in six days Quran says Allah can create whatever with many of us for example Allah says in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter 3 verse 59 in numbers that Allah created Adam peace be upon Him same as Jesus peace be upon him he created from dust and said be and it was so for Allah to create anything he says be and it is he just builds it and it becomes if Allah Wills that you should be born in nine months you're born after nine months if Allah is in one second we'll be born in one second now Allah filled the creation should be made in six days he made it not that Allah can't do in one day he can win one day he can do in one second also Allah will did six days therefore it happened in six days so whatever Allah wants he expresses even the creation was be and it is but Allah wanted it to be six days therefore it is six days not that he can't do it in longer period or shorter period that is what he wanted and whatever Allah wills it happens easily hope that answers the question"
