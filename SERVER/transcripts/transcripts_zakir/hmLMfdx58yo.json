  "title": "Difference between Daâ€™wah and Islaah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya it's a topic that you and I love very much together and I know that of course you are an authority in the world about it alhamdulillah by the grace and mercy of Allah subhana wa tala I prer calling myself a student inah Islam and comp religion I know a lot of the viewers would consider you to be an authority on the topic dter non-muslims and I think that's why it's an incredibly important show that we're going to start today I'd like to ask you the first question which is first and foremost in any scientific analysis of any topic which is to define the topic Define the term daah and to from our last show on is how does that differ from da alhamdulillah as far as the word dawa is concerned when anyone hears the word dawat especially the people from the subcontinent India and Pakistan the moment they hear the word dawat immediately they start thinking of mutton Biryani or chicken biryani they start thinking of a lunch party dawat does not mean a lunch party dawa or dawat means an invitation and today we will not be discussing about an invitation to a lunch party or dinner party we are discussing about da Islam the invitation to Islam and an invitation can only be given to an outsider so dawa that's the reason can be only done to a non-muslim when we give information about Islam to a non-muslim inviting him toward Islam the Arabic word used is dawa and the meaning of Arabic word ISL is to repair it means to improve so when we speak about Islam to a Muslim giving him more information about Islam the more appropriate word is Islam though both these words are interchangeable but if you want to use specifically the word ISL is is used when we speak about Islam to a Muslim giving him more information and dawa is a word used when we speak about Islam to a non-muslim inviting him towards the fold of Islam okay right thank you for that definition that's a very good start inshallah"
