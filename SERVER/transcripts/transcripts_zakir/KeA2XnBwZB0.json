  "transcript": "the brother asked a good question he gave a Christian name if I heard it correctly but said he's not a Christian yes he says he believes in God if there's a cell phone it has a Creator so that way he believes in God very good alhamdulillah congratulations but he says that how can you prove to me that I should only follow Islam that's a very good question brother Islam is Arabic word you may not know the meaning so forget Arabic leave it aside what you should follow is Allah says in the Quran inah Imran chapter number 3 verse number 19l the only religion acceptable in the sight of Allah subhana wa ta'ala it is Islam which is peace acquired by submitting your will to Allah subhana wa tala if you believe in God that he's there you don't believe in religion what is the definition of religion religion means believing in God so if you believe in God and said don't believe in religion you're contradicting by definition of Oxford dictionary religion means believing in a supernatural being or God that deserves obedience so if you believe there is God you also have to obey him right or wrong that's a different thing you may not know which book is God's book you understand so if you believe in God do you want to obey this Creator or not yes or no yeah but first have to be convincing right that's I agree with you I'm not telling you but you have to obey the Creator now what the creator has said you have to find out correct so now the brother agrees that there's a Creator he believes in God and he agrees that he should obey that Creator the same thing God is telling the only way of life acceptable is submitting your will to God that's it now what is submitting that's a different question correct forget the word Muslim forget the word Islam Muslim means one who submits a will to almighty God if you submit a will to God in Arabic you call Muslim just by telling your name is Zak Abdullah Sultan you don't become Muslim if I say my name is Zak I don't become a Muslim if someone say his name is Muhammad doesn't make a Muslim Muslim by definition means a person who acquires peace one who submits the will to almighty God now you want to know that how will you say that this is the right will of God correct for that you have to refer to my video cassette is the Quran God's word which is pro scientifically that this is the word of God which you and I believe in you and I believe in this is the same word of God for that refer to my video casset it is approximately four hours I don't intend giving a lecture and a question four hours here and tomorrow you can come for my talk sharah Sharia means the law of Allah law of Islam barbaric or perfect if you hear that talk it will partly convince you for complete answer refer to my video cassette is the Quran God's word and inshallah inshallah you'll be convinced that this is the only way which is right names don't go on Arabic names don't look at people what people do don't follow them don't judge Islam by what the followers are doing if you want to judge how good a car is If a driver does not know how to drive the car and he bangs up the car who will you blame the driver or the car driver so don't judge Islam by looking at the Muslims judge Islam by the authentic source of the Quran and if you judge according to this if you want to judge the go at the catalog what is the speed of that Mercedes car what is the safety measures what is the average etc etc or you judge by putting a driver behind the seat who's an expert driver so if you want to observe a human being to know Islam is the best example is the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam [Applause]"
