  "title": "Cleaning the Mouth while Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "cleaning the mouth and the nose with water whilst one feels just like refreshing the mouth um or in the middle of woodu is this a permitted act as far as putting water in the mouth or goling the mouth with water or putting water in the nose whether a person is feeling hot or whether while doing woodoo it is permissible because it doesn't enter the body as long as the water doesn't enter the body a person does not swallow the water it's permissible and in woodoo goling is a requirement putting water in the mouth is a requirement but natural doing woodoo is f before offering Salah and while fasting you have to offer Salah and you have to do Wu so how can it be prohibited so when a person puts water in his mouth while goggling in woodoo or otherwise he should be careful that he does not swallow the water and when he puts it into the nose there are some people who think it will break the fast based on a Hadith and that's the reason they only touch the water to the tip of the nose and they don't put it inside because the Hadith of the messenger of Allah subhana tala and wasallam said it's mentioned in Hadi of Abu da volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 236 that the prophet said snuff water excessively while doing woodoo except while fasting M that means the prophet recommended that you should snuff put the water excessively in your nose except while fasting indicating that if the water goes through the nose into your throat into the stomach it will break the fast that doesn't mean putting water in the nose is prohibited so normally when you put water it doesn't go into your throat and even if you snuff excessively always it doesn't go it can go so it's a precaution the prophet said that don't snuff water excessively while fasting otherwise to do that so this Hadith also proves that putting water in the nose it is permitted but you have to be careful you should not snuff excessively so that it goes into the throat otherwise if water goes into the throat and the stomach either VI the mouth or the nose it will break the fast but unintentionally while doing vooo or while goggling if the water does enter inshallah Allah will not hold you responsible because it's done unintentionally"
