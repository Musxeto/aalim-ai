  "title": "Does Eating or Drinking Unintentionally Break One's Fast? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "a couple of questions however this uh topic wouldn't be complete without some answers to the following questions first one if a person who's fasting eats or drinks during the fast unintentionally does this break his or her fast when a person drinks or eats unintentionally because of forgetfulness it does not break the fast and this not nor happens mainly in the first few days of the month of Ramadan a person is used to his daily activity and suddenly Ramadan comes so unintentionally may go to the kitchen or he may pick up a bottle of water and pour it in the glass and have it a person goes jogging and he comes back and he used to having water so it does happen so based on theith of Mami wasallam which is mentioned inkari number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1 1933 the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that anyone who eats or drinks unintentionally he has to complete the fast in the day the fast is not broken and whatever he has eaten or drunk Allah has provided him with that so if you drink unintentionally the fast is not broken but if you drink intentionally then it is broken and while drinking if you realize or while eating you realize immediately you should stop because then if you continue it will be counted as though you're having it with intention moment to realize you should stop it and if there's some food in the mouth and realize you're fasting you should spread it out but unly whatever is done it is Forgiven"
