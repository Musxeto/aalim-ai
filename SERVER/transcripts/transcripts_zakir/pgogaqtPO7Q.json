  "transcript": "richard hans dr amar cena mr krishna chanchowadya the other dignitaries my respect elders and my brothers and sisters i welcome all of you with the islamic greetings assalamu alaikum may peace mercy and blessings of allah of almighty god be on all of you the topic of this evening's talk is terrorism and jihad and islamic perspective and many of you may be aware that more than 20 of the world population they are muslims more than one-fifth of the world population consists of muslims but unfortunately islam is also a religion which has the maximum number of misconceptions the people that have the maximum misconception about any religion as a whole is the religion of islam which also happens to be today the fastest growing religion of the world and these misconceptions are increasing especially after the 11th of september 2001. and today number one top of the list amongst the misconception is terrorism and jihad in islam whenever a person hears about a muslim immediately he starts thinking of a fundamentalist or a terrorist what is the meaning of the word fundamentalist a fundamentalist is a person who strictly adheres to the fundamentals of a particular subject for example if a doctor has to be a good doctor he should know follow and practice the fundamentals of medicine unless he is a fundamentalist in the field of medicine he cannot be a good doctor for a scientist to be a good scientist he should know follow and practice the fundamentals of science unless he is a fundamentalist in the field of science he cannot be a good scientist for a to be mathematician good mathematician he should know follow and practice the fundamentals of maths unless he is a fundamentalist in the field of maths he cannot be a good mathematician you cannot paint all fundamentalists with the same brush that all are good or all are bad depending upon the field in which a person is a fundamentalist you can label him accordingly whether he's a good human being or a bad human being for example if there's a person who is a fundamentalist robber a fundamentalist thief whose profession is to rob whose profession is to steal he is a nuisance society he is not a good human being on the other hand if you have a fundamentalist doctor whose profession is to save human lives then he is a boon for society he is a good human being you can't paint all fundamentalists with the same brush that all are good or all are bad depending upon the field in which he's a fundamentalist you have to label him accordingly i am proud to be a muslim fundamentalist because i know i follow and i strive to practice the fundamentals of islam and i know that there is not a single fundamental of islam which is against humanity as a whole and i challenge any human being in the world to point out a single fundamental of islam from the authentic sources of islam which is against humanity as a whole there may be certain people who may find that certain teachings of islam certain religions of quran they are against manatee but the moment you give the logical reason for it the statistical record of the world there will not be a single human being who can point a single fundamental of islam which is against humanity as a whole that's the reason i say i'm proud to be a fundamentalist muslim and i say in the same breath that for a hindu to be a good hindu he should be a fundamentalist in the field of hinduism unless he's a fundamentalist hindu he cannot be a gundu for a christian to be a good christian he should be a fundamentalist in the field of christianity unless he is a fundamentalist christian he cannot be a good christian if you read the webster's dictionary it tells us that the word fundamentalism was first coined was first used to describe a group of american christians who called as protestant christians in the earlier part of the 20th century when they objected to the church previously the christian church they believe the message of the bible was from almighty god these protestant christians they protested and they said that not only is the message of the bible from god but every word every letter of the bible is from god if any human being can prove that bible is the word of god then this movement of fundamentalism is a good movement on the other hand if someone proves that bible is not the word of god then this movement is not a good movement if you read the oxford dictionary the oxford dictionary says that fundamentalist is a person who strictly adheres to the ancient doctrine of any religion but if you refer to the new edition the revised edition of oxford dictionary there's a slight change in the definition it says that fundamentalist is a person who strictly adheres to any ancient doctrine of any religion especially islam the word especially islam has been added in the revised edition of oxford dictionary"
