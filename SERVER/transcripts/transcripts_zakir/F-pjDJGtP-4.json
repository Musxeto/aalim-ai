  "transcript": "I'd like to give you an incidence to explain this verse of the Quran once there was a man who was catching a flight from Doha to USA and he wanted to reach USA the next day it was a very important business deal in which he would get a minimum profit of a million dollar while going towards the airport there was a traffic jam and due to the traffic jam he's unable to reach to the airport in time to catch his flight and he misses the flight and he says this is the worst thing that happened in my life I missed the flight and now I miss the meeting and I will lose a profit of more than a million dollar that I was going to make on his way back when he's returning back home he hears on the radio that the flight that he was about to catch from Doha to New York the flight while taking off it crashes and all the passengers in that flight they die so the person says Ah this is the best thing that happened to me that I missed the flight imagine just an hour before he was seeing that he missed the flight and that was the worst thing that happened to him in his life and He was cursing one hour later when he realizes the flight he was about to catch which was about to board it crashes and all the passengers die he says to Allah subhana ta'ala that this is the best thing that happened to him in his life"
