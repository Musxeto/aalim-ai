  "transcript": "come to the third question that what are the categorizations of hadith as far as classification and categorization of hadees is concerned it is called as muslim that is the science of hadith the mod the scenes have classified hadith into various different categories the three more important classification i'll tell you there are many classifications one is based on who is the original narrator and according to abner salah he has classified the hadith into who is the originator and number one the highest hadith it goes up to allah if it says that mohammed sallallahu sallam said that allah said it goes up to allah it starts with the narrator goes to the sabbath goes to the prophet and prophet said allah said that becomes category number two is the murph hadith the hadees which reaches raised it reaches to prophet muhammad a chain of narrators are there then it says the sabbath name says that prophet muhammad so that becomes murphy the third category is mokof means stop it goes to the level of the sahaba so if the hadees goes to the level of saba but doesn't reach the level of prophet it is called as mokof that is stopped that's the third level the fourth is the makhtu means cut off it reaches to the tabai so if it is reaches to the prophet it's called as murphyhadis reaches to the sabha it is called as maokov if it reaches to the turbine that is the next generation after the sabha it is called as maktu so this classification is based on who is the original narrator one type of classification the second type of classification accountability is based on the number of chain of narrators and it is divided into two types the motavata and the in the mudavatar hadith there are umpteen there are several number of narrators the number is not specified it says several at every stage and this muthavatha hadees is divided into two further muthawater in terms of wordings muttawater in terms of meaning i'll give an example of mutawatir in terms of wording that means all the hadith that you find the wording is exactly the same and matawata means in every stage there are various narrators like at the sabha level there are various sabbahs who narrated it then there are various other people who narrated from the sabbath and the next level and the third level one example is a very famous mutawater hadith which is hadith that anyone who deliberately or purposefully tells a lie in my name he prepares his seat in the hellfire now this hadith the words are same but not arabic this is english translation which might differ but in arabic the words are the same it was narrated by no less than 74 sabas 74 different sahabahs narrated this hadith that they said that they heard the prophet say this 74. now in the next level you have much more than 74 people who have narrated it each sabbah have narrated it to many other people so in the second level you have more than hundred of narrators then third level you have another few hundred narrators so overall there are hundreds of people who have narrated this hadith and all those have narrated the words are exactly the same so the scholars of hadith they say it cannot be possible that hundreds of people are narrating exactly the same words it has to be correct there is no different opinion that these are verbatim the words of the beloved prophet muslim so many narrators at every level that means minimum narrators of this adi the 74. next level there are more than 74 third level more than that so minimum so if there are several narrators at each level then the hadith is called if the words are same it's called the author in words let's come to second example in meaning that was the prophet sallam when he said that for fajr salah there are two rakat there are four rakat for the zohar sallah asar salaam and for maghrib fella there are three rakat there are various narrators at each level umpteen number of narrators many sabbahs who narrated it followed by rabbi but the words kept on differing but the meaning was the same though the words differed the meaning was the same that in fajr there were two rakaat in zoho and isha there were four rakat to be prayed and the maghrib tirakat so here the modest in say it in meaning meaning is the same the words metaphor so this was the type of mutawatara these two types in hadith it is further divided into three types of hadith one is mashup second is aziz and third is gary now all the these they do not meet the criteria of matawathir the highest level of hadees is the mashup that minimum three or more narrators have narrated at each level that means minimum number of narrators each level if they are three then it is called as a mashup that means that minimum three sabbah have narrated it then the turbine may be more than three but if minimum three is there at each level it is called as mashurati or even more than three it can be four also yet it's called a mashup if it is several then it becomes a mutabata but if it's three at each level or four at each level it is called as a mashup hadith it is the highest in terms of the second level in hadith is the aziz in aziz hadid there are minimum two narrators at each level with the chain of narrators and minimum two sabbas have narrated it and at the other levels also two or more have continued with the chain so that's called the third category of aadhaar is a grief that means at any one stage only one person other stages there may be 10 20 no problem and the best example is hadith of buhari which was narrated rather than male 1 i've been pleased with him it is the first hadith of say bihari word number one book number one hadith number one that a beloved prophet muslim said in amalu that your actions are based on your intention all the hadith there are hundreds of all hadith that are there it goes to other men says umar manila peace with him said that the prophet said below after there are many narrators but at one stage there's only one narrator no other sahabah besides has uma narrated this so this becomes it is there in bukhari it's a say hadid but it is all the chains reach towards the tomar malla buddhism there is no other sahabah who narrated this so this is called asgari so this was the second type of classification based on number of narrators there are various classification i'll just come to the main one which we're discussing the third type of classification of hadith is based on authenticity in this type of classification there are two types of hadith one is accepted and the other is which is rejected in the accepted type of hadith there are two types of hadith say hadith and hassan in the say hadith there are two types of hadees that is the say hadith with continuous chain and say hadith with a broken chain in the hassan again there are two types hassan hadith with the continuous chain and hasan adid with the broken chain so these are the categories of the hadith except if it falls under say or hasan it is accepted as a huja as an argument for you to accept it if it's a hadith or hassanathi and if the prophet has prohibited it becomes haram for you if the prophet has commanded you it becomes complexity for you or it becomes muslim for you the second category is hadith which are they a modu they've again got various categories they they did then they because of the chain of narrator they because of inconsistency in the narrator various there are multiple different types of cipher the time will not permit to go into detail same with maodu there are different types so basically the third type of classification based on authenticity and their other classification also makes a hadith which is magbud hadees which is murdered which is rejected"
