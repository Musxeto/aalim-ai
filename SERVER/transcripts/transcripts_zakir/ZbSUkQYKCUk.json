  "transcript": "previously we human beings we thought that the world was flat it was in 1577 when sir francis drake sailed around the earth that the first time proved that the earth on which we live it is spherical in shape the quran mentions 1400 years ago in surah naziat chapter number 79 verse number 30 and thereafter we have made the earth x-shape one of the meaning of daha is an expanse and the earth doesn't expand the other meaning is derived from the arabic word which means an egg and today we know the earth is not completely round like a ball it is saturn from the pole it is geospherical in shape and if we analyze therapy what the haha doesn't refer to a normal leg it specifically refers to the egg of an ostrich and if we analyze the egg of an ostrich is too geospherical in shape imagine the glorious quran 1400 years ago says that the earth is your spherical in shape previously we thought that the light of the moon was its own light recently we have come to know that the light of the moon is not its own light but it is a reflected and borrowed light the quran says in surah for khan chapter number 25 verse number 61 blessed is he who has placed the constellation in the sky and placed the sun a lamp having its own light and moon having borrowed or reflected light so the quran describes the moonlight as borrowed or reflected which we came to know recently in science recently science may 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back"
