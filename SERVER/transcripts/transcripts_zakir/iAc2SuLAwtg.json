  "transcript": "i would like to end my talk by replying to the allegation of the media that islam was spread by the sword and it's a common allegation laid down by the international media that islam was spread by the sword the reply to this allegation is given very well by a famous historian by the name of delesi o'leary he mentions in the book islam at the crossroad on page number eight billion says history makes it clear that the legend of fanatical muslims sweeping across the world forcing islam at the point of the sword over conquered races is the most fantastic absurd myth that historians have ever repeated i would like to repeat the statement of denise o'leary the famous historian history makes it clear that the legend of fanatical muslims forcing islam at the point of the sword over conquered races is the most absurd fantastic myth that historian ever repeated when we read history we come to know that we muslims the arabs they ruled the arab lands for the past 1400 years for a few years the britishers came for a few years the french came but as a whole the muslim arabs were the lords of the arab lands yet today there are more than 9 million arabs who are coptic christians coptic christian means the christians and generations these 9 million arab christians are giving shahadah a bearing witness that islam wasn't spread by the sword we muslims we ruled india for about a thousand years that time india was the most powerful country in the world the mughals the muslims if we wanted we could have forced every non-muslim to accept islam at the part of the sword we didn't do it today in india more than 80 percent of the indians they are non-muslims these 80 percent non-muslim indians they are giving shahadah they are bearing witness that islam wasn't spread by the sword [Applause] today the largest populated muslim country in the world it's indonesia i'm asking the question which muslim army went to indonesia which muslim army came to malaysia

his number one hero prophet number one and he writes that every new idea originates in the mind of one in one man's mind it dwells one man in the full world it will do little good if he takes up a sword and propagates it you have to first get your sword the sword of intellect as allah says in the quran in surah chapter 16 verse 125 invite all the way of their lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best most gracious thomas carla is talking about the sword of intellect today islam is conquering the hearts not with the sword

religion whether it be judaism christianism hinduism buddhism socialism modernism islam is this time to supersede all master them all and enough is allah as a witness i would like to end my talk with the quotation of dr adam pearson dr adam pearson said that people worry that one day nuclear weaponry will fall in the hands of the arabs they fail to realize that the islamic bomb the bomb of peace has already been dropped it fell the day prophet muhammad peace be upon him was born [Applause]"
