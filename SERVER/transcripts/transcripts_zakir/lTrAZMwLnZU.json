  "transcript": "my name is maryam i am from vancouver canada i work as a general manager in a private firm here i was a hindu i have recently reverted to islam a year ago i would like to thank allah to guide me to the right path and choose me to become a muslim my question is as there are levels in jannah as well as in jahannam is it possible for a person like me to reach jannaturf dos as it is the highest level in jannah a person can attain the people who do dawah are much more superior in deeds than me is it possible for a normal practicing muslim like me to attain jannatul for those dawah is compulsory upon every single muslim allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran chapter 16 verse number 125 well to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preachings and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best and most gracious we should do dawah with hikmah man is in a state of loss except for those who believe and do righteous deeds what was exhort people towards truth that is doing dawah wata wasabi exhort people towards patience and perseverance to enter jannah there are minimum four criteria iman that is belief second is amalu solihar that is righteous deeds the third is exhorting people towards truth that is doing dawah and the fourth is exhorting people towards patience and perseverance these are four criteria for a person to enter jannah if any of them is missing under normal circumstances a person will not enter jannah if allah wants to forgive you it is upon allah so every muslim he should at least be a part-time die and those people who are full-time dies those people who have dedicated their lives for the cause of islam for the sake of conveying the message of islam they are the best of people allah let there arise out of you a band of people calling towards what is good and joining what is right and forbidding what is wrong they are the ones to attain felicity today in our community we have full-time doctors full-time engineers how many full-time diets do we have so the best people are those who dedicate their lives to spread the message of islam so minimum you need to be a part-time die and if you are doing little dawah then you should try to do as many good deeds as possible you should try to compensate it with other good deeds and whenever we ask allah subhana wa tala for jannah we should ask for janet alfred so we should focus on doing dawah and we should focus on doing righteous deeds we should try to do all the things that are further in islam all the farah should be done we should not miss a single pharah a single further act we should abstain from all the things that are haram we should try to do as many sunnah acts as many things that are muslim we should try to abstain from things that are macro and also abstain totally from things that are haram if we focus on this there are high chances by the grace of allah subhanahu ta'ala that we will enter jannatul for those besides this you should focus on the sunnah acts the farah should be done after that you should focus on the sunnah acts for example offering the sunnah offering the withered prayer which is very important also offering the two rakah before the fajr prayer as a beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that anyone who offers two rakah of sunnah of fajr prayer it is better than the world and the wealth in it besides this we should also focus on the voluntary fast besides the obligatory fast we should focus on the voluntary fast fasting on the day of arafah as a blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that the one who fasts on the day of arafah it is an expiation for his previous year since as well as the coming year since this fasting is for the people who are not performing hajj we should fast on the day of ashura fast the six days of shawwal fast on mondays and thursdays the more you focus on righteous deeds the more chances that you will enter general for those and if you know that there is one person who will enter jannah you should have hope and trust in allah that you will be that one person and you should work hard towards it if you know that there is one person who will enter hellfire you should pray to allah subhanahu talaha that you are not that one person you should not take it for granted that i am a muslim i am such a good human being i am a righteous human being i cannot enter jahannam no muslim can take it for granted that he will enter paradise each and every human being will enter jannah with the grace of allah subhana tala with the mercy of allah subhana wa tala we should focus on doing good deeds on doing righteous deeds getting closer to allah subhanahu ta'ala and inshallah if we focus on these things inshallah we will enter jannatul firados by the mercy of allah subhanahu ta'ala i pray to allah subhana wa tala that may he admit all of us in the gardens of paradise and into the highest level of paradise that is jonathas"
