  "transcript": "question from a non-muslim friend of mine she is asking me like uh within you Muslims itself you have confusion like when you meet you ask first a question is uh whether you're a hobby or a Sunni whatever these kind of questions there's a confusion between you itself what do you want us to follow what is that we can exactly come follow and uh this is to ask a question that the non-muslim sister asked there's a confusion among the Muslim then you meet you are a Maliki so there's a confusion amongst the Muslims so what's the reply I do agree with the non-muslim sister that unfortunately many Muslims call different names but when I tell the Hindus to go back to The Vedas I tell the Muslims to go back to the Quran divided we have to hold the Rope of Allah the Rope of Allah is the Glorious Quran and the authentic Hadith Allah says chapter number six verse number 159 that anyone who makes division in the religion of Islam or Prophet you have nothing to do with him making sex making division in Islam is prohibited it is Haram but when we ask the Muslim what are you some says some say I'm humbly salafi what are the prophet or the prophet or the Shafi or the homily Malaki what was he he was a Muslim Allah says in the Quran Imran chapter number three verse number 52 Islam Jesus Christ peace be upon you are the Muslim Allah says in the Quran chapter 3 verse 67 that Abraham peace be upon him he was a Muslim Allah says in the Quran chapter number 41 verse number 33. who is better in speech than one who invited the way of thy Lord Works righteousness and says that I'm a Muslim a beloved Prophet Muhammad Muslim Allah has told us to call ourselves Muslim they cannot be a better level than Muslim I love them I respect them all they were great Scholars but all these great Scholars said all this said that if you find any of my Father which goes against Allah in the world so here if you analyze that all these Imam that came they came not to make a new sex they came for the people to go back to the original scripture the Quran they say Hadith so what we have to realize that I know there are people who say that is in their Hadith in which the prophet said there will be 736 it's Hadith Hadith number 171 the prophet said there will be 76 Prophet didn't say you should make Prophet knew that even though Allah says don't make amount to make so the best is to go back to Allah and the best label you can have is call yourself a Muslim any scholar let it be anyone in the world let him be the biggest call of the world you ask him for proof produce your proof If you are truthful if your honest produce your proof so any scholar is the difference of opinion you ask him for proof get the proof check it up therefore in my talk I always give references what I say what Zakir says is rubbish in Islam it is rubbish zero nil in Islam if Allah says it carries it if the prophet says carries it so therefore sisters Muslims should not be divided we should call yourself Muslims and follow the Quran and the say Hadith anyone who divides the religion they're going against the Quran"
