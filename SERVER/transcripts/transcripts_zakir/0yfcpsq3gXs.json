  "title": "Was Persia Forced to Accept Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "do we have a question from this mic here sure i' just first like to say thank you for coming here and my name is puya so I'm a student drama and I come from Iran not Iraq Iran the old Nam Persia so I come from a religious family my father I mean my family are Muslim but I born as a Muslim but I didn't wanted to born as a Muslim because you know so as a family I born but still I haven't accepted Islam because of sub points uh my main question was about I mean about the time like Asian time back to the thousand years ago when the time the Islam come to my country and we became a Muslim so as I read in the history and those kind of stuff I found it out that the Arab countries so they attack to my country and they invade my country and they brought Islam by force without that my king accept it so Persia was the old country and it was the most civilized country from the ancient until now we believe a real God we were worshiping a real God and our religious was zos so he was a prophet also so we believe in good te good thought good wordss so even Cyrus the Great he was the king of the word and he was doing a lot of good things even some people they was confused that they call him Messiah Messi he was doing many good things but he was never said I'm a prophet I'm a God but even though that King when he attacked other country he never killed the civilian he never raped the woman woman and he never make them to change the religion even somebody was worshiping a c he respect for them even though he was worshiping a real cut he can he can he could make them to worship also same as what is worshiping but in the Islam way if you're if you're going to promote your ReliOn doesn't mean that you have to force it to somebody else or you have to make them to accept that religion because you know human being means freedom so anyone they should have a right human rights so maybe those people that didn't want it that religion so why they have to attack and you know to bring it by force that was the main question that make my heart a bit you know to make me to my belief go down so brother are you Pary pardon yeah I'm from fars pars are you a Pary you mean fary are you a Pary are you a Zoran no I I'm not following any religion you don't belong to any religion I don't I don't believe but you said a parents my parents are Muslim but because of this confusion and stuff I never tried to follow the religion I just believe in real God and doing the good things so you believe in real God and good things what are the good things where you get the good things from good things like I don't harm the others whatever I'm doing not try to harm the others that's the first thing as much as you can do the good things even helping the others and believe in the real God not worshiping a stone or leaf or whatever and I believe God is single so but I didn't so you have your own philosophy so you want to bring a new religion I'm not going to make any religion I'm just following my brain because as I know God give us was a brain so I didn't make my mind busy by following the books I always when I was 10 years old was just thinking thinking thinking until now even so I tried to thinking thinking he's saying God as long as not a stone who told you stone is not a God anyway I'll answer your your basic question now basic question is that Muslims came to Persia and they conquered and they forced people to accept Islam so no one should force at all I agree with you point to be noted is that today the media the media media promotes that Islam was sped by the sword I'm aware that there are certain black sheep in the Muslim Community and there are certain Muslim rulers who did wrong things but as a whole Islam was never sped by the sword Islam was never sped by the sword it SP by sword sword sword sword sword mean force force like you said now Muslims came and conquered Persia Etc you see everywhere it's happening there are Wars taking place but in Islam it's clearly mentioned in Bak 2 vers number 256 there's no compulsion religion truth stands out clear from error what we see today if we analyze that we Muslims we Muslims we were the lord of the Arab lands for more than 1400 years for the past 1400 years the Muslims were the lord of the Arab lands for a few years the britishers came for a few years the French came but overall the Muslims were the rulers of the Arab land yet today there are more than 9 million Christians who are Coptic Christians that means they're Christian since generation if the Muslims wanted they could have forced each and every non-muslim to accept Islam at the point of the SW in the Arab land these more than 9 million Coptic Christians they are giving shahada they are bearing witness that Islam was disp by the sword we Muslims we ruled India for more than a thousand years we ruled India for more than a thousand years if we wanted we could have forced every non-muslim Indian to accept Islam at the point of the sord today more than 80% of the Indians are non-muslims these more than 80% non-muslim Indians they are giving shahada they are bearing witness that Islam was dis sped by the sword which Muslim Army has come to Indonesia Indonesia today has the largest number of Muslims in any country more than 200 million Muslims in Malaysia more than 55% of the citizens of Malaysia are Muslim I'm asking you which Muslim Army came to Malaysia your country which Muslim Army came which Muslim Army went to the east coast of Africa it was the business it was the Traders when they came here people accepted this religion it is the media hype which talks about Islam was SP By The Sword yes there were a few people there were a few black sheeps of the Muslim Community brother you ask the question your listening or you're raising the hand okay sure sure you asked the question you give the background I listen to it and now you want to raise your hand I have not completed my answer okay sure continue if you ask the question you should think because if you're thinking something I'm a doctor if you're thinking that mean you don't hear my if I ask you to repeat you won't be able to repeat 25% so when you listen you should give attention I'm a doctor I've done psychology also so this is the media hype if you read Thomas kalal Thomas Kal historian he writes in his book Heroes and hero worship he puts number one hero Prophet as proph mallam he's a Christian he says if every new idea originates in one man's head one man's head it dwells alone in the full world it will do little good if he takes up a sword and propagates it you have to first get your sword he's talking about sord of intellect there was a survey done in the plain truth magazine a survey in the increase of the major world religion in a span of 50 years in a span of 50 years from 1900 34 to 1984 in a span of 50 years the increase in the major world religion it came in R dig albic year book 1984 number one maximum in increase in religion it's Islam 235% Christianity only 47% I'm asking you which war took place between 1934 and 1984 which forced the non-muslim to accept Islam which war which war today today leave aside the past today the fastest going religion in America is Islam the fastest going religion in Europe is Islam I'm asking you who's forcing the Americans to accept Islam who's forcing the European to accept Islam you were not there born were you present in the past Arabs came to my land and forced where were you present this is history many things in history is false so that's what okay [Laughter] okay a very famous historian D oeri he writes in the book Islam at the Crossroad number eight he says history makes it clear history makes it clear that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping across the world forcing Islam at the point of the sword is the most fantastic absurd myth that historians ever repeated who says that Dei history makes it clear that the legend of fanatical Muslims forcing Islam at the point of the sword over conquered races is the most fantastic absurd myth that restorans ever repeated this is just in the media today mus Muslim terrorist Muslim terrorist I asking you did any Muslim attack you in this country no never but the media say Muslim the terrorist yeah media is just nonsense yes same way your history is also nonsense when media is nonsense the history is also nonsense some is correct some is wrong that's the reason if you hear the answer i' would like to end my answer with the quotation of Dr Adam Pearson Dr Adam pearon says that people who worry that one day nuclear weaponry will fall in the hands of the Arabs they fail to realize that the Islamic bomb has already been dropped the bomb of Peace it fell the day Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was born thank you doctor for your answer but the point is I didn't get the right answer because that's not media that's the history and history is not something that can be written the false way because if it written in the false way it can be changed but that was the true history in all all over the word and is written every brother did you hear my quotation of Dei oi can you repeat it repeat what repeat Del quotation I said it twice not once twice most of my answer was once I said twice now repeat it repeatedly 50% so what's the point of repeating that word I want to know whether you it went into your head or not no because that's what is in my head is that is a history first thing I'm asking you can you repeat the statement the answer which I gave earlier here if you cannot repeat that mean it's useless me repeating the answer you're not listening to me you're thinking something no I'm listening to you you're say canat that is can you repeat the statement of Dei oleri a very famous historian no I can't I'm saying it for third time listen listen to it and go behind the que Dees oi says that history makes it clear the legend of fanatical Muslims forcing Islam at the point of the sword or what conquered races it the most fantastic absurd myth that historians have ever repeated the says history has been telling falsehood and you're saying history I believe in history thei o is saying that what history says that Muslims are foreing Islam at the point of the sword is the most fantastic myth that hisory and they repeated so you have got influenced by the myth so now think it's a myth and forget it and believe in the fact the fact is you read the Quran and inshallah I want you to revert to Islam revert back to the religion of your parents insh"
