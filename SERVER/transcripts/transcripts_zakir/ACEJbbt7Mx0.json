  "transcript": "hi um my name is shenice and I'm a student uh studying business I'm actually curious about LGBT which refers to the community of lesbians gays uh bisexual and transexuals so what Islam's point of view of this uh issue because uh I used to believe that we have to accept people regardless of their sexual orientation so after I study some information about Islam I know that Islam rejects this so I want to know further about this issue thank you sisters as the question what is the Islamic view on homosexuals on gays and lesbians the ruling is that Allah says in the Quran in Sur chapter number 7 verse number 81 do you prefer men in preference to women that mean telling to men that do you prefer for men rather than women homosexuality is prohibited in Islam regarding what about people who are homosexual there article that came a few years back homosexuality is genetic and when this article came people asked me in the question and session if homosexuality is genetic then who's to blame the person is not to blame it is almighty God correct later on it was found that this is totally false and the person who propounded this himself was homosexual what today's psychologist tell us that when a person goes beyond the limit he keeps on wanting things which is unnatural so today you see in the Western World there is obscenity like my son said the women talk of liberalization is nothing but a disguise form of exploitation of body deprivation of a soul and degradation of honor the Western Society claiming to uplift the woman had degraded her to concubine to Mystic and Society but flies with are hidden behind the colorful screen of art and culture in today's society you have advertisement in a motorbike advertisement invariably there's a woman now how many women ride motorcycle percentage little but you see a woman in the why and I was told of a very famous ad of BMW I was told in front of the BMW car a woman is standing in a bikini and the ad reads test drive her now who the girl or the car so they're selling their daughters they are selling their mothers and they're saying that women are liberated what happens that when you go beyond limits all religion say that if you want to have relationship you marry correct according to American statistics America doesn't agree in Islam Islam say you can have more than one wife that's a different question in America the American stat tell us an average American before he sett down with a permanent life partner he has eight different sexual partners some may be having 2 10 20 average is eight eight different sexual partner before they settle down with one so they are disregarding the law of the Creator do you know according to American statistics every 12th person you meet has committed incest incest means having sexual relationship brother and sister son and mother father and daughter it's absolutely nonsense because they get so open Etc they deviate from the natural path so they want things which are different so when they get so much used to it having heterosexuality they start homosexuality it is not genetic it is based on the things which you do unnatural things psychologically you want something different then you go to homosexuality so if you stop this deviation from the path which is given guidance in the Quran and the other religions what you realize this will stop and I remember i' been to Canada in 1996 first time a man kissing a man and Canada has legalized marriage of gays now all this is coming because they're deviating from the truth and today psychologist tell us that a person who has no extra marital sex enjoys the best married life you deviate from your normal thing and this is what happens so that's the reason if you follow the Commandment of almighty God all these things will not happen therefore in Islam homosexuality gays lesbianism everything is prohibited hope that answer the question"
