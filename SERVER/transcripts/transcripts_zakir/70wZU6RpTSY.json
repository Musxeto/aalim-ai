  "transcript": "what is the meaning of alif lam meme as far as the meaning of the words alif lam meme etc is concerned these words are known as they are known as broken letters and they occur in several surahs of the quran sometimes they occur in single like sword in surah saud chapter 38 as of surikaff chapter 50 as noon in sura kalam chapter 68 sometimes occurs in tools in pairs like taha suretaha chapter number 20. tarzin in suriname chapter 27 as yasin suryasin chapter 36 sometimes it occurs in combination of three and the three combinations mentioned in the quran one occurs six times five times the other twice it's thirteen times that occurs in combination of three one combination is alif lam meme it is then sorry bakra chapter number two sorry imran chapter number three and surah number 29 30 31 32. it occurs in the combination of alif lam raw from surya you know step number 10 to surah chapter number 15. five times it even occurs as ta sin meme in surah chapter number 26 as well as number 28. it occurs in the combination of four letters alif la meme raw and other combinations it even occurs twice in combination of five so in short there are five combinations single double three letter four letter five letter totally there are 29 times that occurs in the quran equal to the arabic letters 29 times counting even hamza there are various reasons that people have said why do these broken letters occur several reasons and many books have been written volumes have written some say these are the symbols of allah some say the abbreviation like noon is for noor that is light some say they are signatures of allah some say they are used for rhyming some say they have got numerical values some say they have been used for calling the attention attracted attention to the prophet and prophet used it for the other human various reasons but the best amongst them i feel is the view which is also of abu bakr may i be with him for example we know what the body is made up of whatever components the body has the same elements and components are present in the earth in lesser or greater quantity we know the constituents of the human being you can buy it from the market you can put water but you can't give life that is the secret similarly allah subhana wa tala used these letters and tells to the arabs the arabs at that time they were proud of the language and arabic was at its peak so allah says alif lam meem yasin poff noon these are your letters with your letters have produced the quran he challenges them to produce somewhat similar to the quran and this challenge is given in several places in sritur chapter number 52 verse number 34 that produce a book like the quran allah repeats the message chapter number 17 verse number 88 allah says produce a recital like the quran then allah makes the challenge a bit easier and says in surah chapter 11 verse number 13 that allah challenges that can you produce 10 surahs like the quran allah further simplifies the challenge in surya you know step number 10 verse number 38 that produce a single surah like the quran allah makes it simplified further in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 23 24 allah says that if you end out as what we have revealed to our servant prophet muhammad peace be upon him then produce a surah somewhat similar to it and call forth your helpers and witnesses if any besides allah if you're doubts are but true find lump of aloo but if you cannot do it and of surety you cannot do it with little cafe then fear the fire whose fuel shall be made in stones which is prepared for those who reject faith so this is a challenge allah says to the arabs who are proud of the language this is your letter al-islam mean abcd from your letters i've created the quran he challenges try and produce a surah somewhat similar to the quran so this is the closest explanation that i feel is right it's a challenge allah is giving and that is the reason moment these broken letters mentioned in the quran immediately after that there is some attribute of the quran mentioned after that so i feel this explanation i feel is the closest to the meanings of the broken letters and allah"
