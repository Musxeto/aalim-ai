  "title": "Was the Quran Revealed in One Night or 23 Years? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "historical accounts say that the Quran was revealed over a period of 23 years is there an apparent contradiction between that and what the Quran says that was revealed in one night in laderthal qadar there is no contradiction between the Hadith and the historical records and the Quran because if you read the tafsir of the Quran that the Quran was revealed in it means that Allah he revealed the Quran from from the preserved tablet to the lower heaven on the light of Qatar that is in the night of power in one night and then from that lower Heaven parts of the Quran few verses at a time was revealed whenever required in a span of 23 hijriyas in a span of 23 lunar years or in a span of 22 and four to five Solem years so there's no apparent contradiction it was revealed in one night from the tablet preserved to the lower hand and from there as in time required was revealed in parts and verses and Surah wise in a span of 23 years okay thank you clearing up that apparent contradiction and similarly as far as the khadar is concerned that Allah has in his knowledge everything what's going to happen past present future and from that tablet he reveals in the night of Qatar to the angels whatever is going to happen in the next year from this level to the next line is so the Angels come to know everything was going to happen in the next one year in this night but in Allah's knowledge it is there till eternity"
