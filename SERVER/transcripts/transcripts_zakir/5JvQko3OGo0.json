  "transcript": "and the next question is from hassan pathan from kashmir sir how can we contribute financially for your organization is it legal to contribute from india a similar question was posed by qq mrs noor from dubai assalamualaikum kindly help how can i donate to peace tv i try doing it from its website but failed twice the basic question is that how can they contribute to the organization islamic foundation international uk or can contribute to peace tv and one of the ways is you can go to our website and once you go to the website of peace tv the account number is given and you can contribute and i am aware that when you transfer especially after 9 11 it has become more difficult to contribute to islamic organizations and especially if it's outside your country it becomes more difficult so when people try they are not successful and therefore they're trying to you know prevent all the dao activities you know those who don't want islam to spread if you can go to the website it's legal to contribute to the organization you can contribute even to peace tv the thing is there the account is there but those people who really are really wanting to help and you know somehow the other they get in touch with me that because of the restrictions that are there from the various and we have the policy we always believe that we follow the rule of the country in india whatever we accepted was officially in our trust account if we accept in uk we accept in the official trust account we believe in following the rules and regulation of the country so that we do not break the law of the context that we can do dawah freely but in spite of this following the rules you know the enemies of islam after us they're trying to see that the muslim organizations don't get the funding they're putting pressure on the banks they're putting pressure on the organization so in this case but naturally a businessman who is really rich he knows the situation because he's a rich businessman he's a millionaire or a multi-millionaire he's a billionaire he knows the difficulties because he doing business so in this case the businessman who really wants to help a guy who really wants to help me they get in touch with me and very easy people know where i am and once they get in touch with me they find out which is a very legal way to contribute without causing problem to the enemies of islam to contribute in big amounts and many people call me for lunch and for dinner and for meal and for every meal they give huge amounts and big amounts alhamdulillah so those who really want to contribute to come and meet me when i was in bombay they have to come to bombay when i mean the way they used to come to the way when i was in saudi arabia when i'm in malaysia they come to meet with malaysia they come and meet and we see an amicable way which is legal without getting into problems and yet they want to hide their identity which is good no problem so what we realized that those really big people who want to support any activity whether it be die whether it be me whether it be pistol whether it be other because they're in the field they know how to get in touch they get in touch and they support they can get in touch with my friend they can get in touch with me it's very easy in the age of science and technology today the whole world is a global village but for those people who are not so well-versed and maybe an average common muslim wants to contribute you try it through the website through the channel official channel if you cannot my advice to you would be you can always contribute to a dhawa organization in your country if you cannot contribute to pitch tv you cannot contribute to islamic research foundation international what do you do you search for the organization in your country in your city google it do a little bit research and contribute to them you will get double saw you'll get so up for helping them and getting some of helping us also and your server will not be reduced because i told you that so they will get sabbah the people who you contribute to they will thank you they will do what even i will do the main aim of ours is to spread the message of allah but see to it that the organization is authentic organization is a genuine organization doesn't take time to do research and contribute inshallah i will think the amount has reached me because our main purpose is to spread the message of islam if you're contributing to another organization indirectly or contributing to us and we will get the thumb up hope that's the question"
