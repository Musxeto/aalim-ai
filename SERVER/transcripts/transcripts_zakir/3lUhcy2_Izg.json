  "transcript": "the next question is relating to the time that should be practiced during the night what's the best time during the night our beloved Prophet wasallam said it's mentioned say of mus Ahmed volume number six page number seven the Beloved Prophet said that Allah subhana wa ta'ala has added one more prayer that is a wi so pray with between Isa and f that means the time of Isa is after Sunset when the redness in the sky disappears that is the time of Isa so after you offer Isa you can pray any time before the break off Dawn before the time of fa starts this is the earliest and the latest where you can pray the and as I mentioned earlier with the name for and I beloved Prophet wasam said it's mentioned in ABD number 4623 that beloved Prophet said that if someone fears that he will not wake up in the night then he can offer the or the in the early part of the night but if a person knows that he going to get up at night he should pray at night after gets up from sleep because praying in the later part of the night is much better Where Angels witness for the person and as I mentioned earlier the Hadith I mentioned earlier of s Muslim or number one Hadith number 1656 it's a Hadith which is also there inkari with a different wording it's also occurs inkari Vol number two in the book of tud Hadith number 1145 our beloved Prophet wasam said that Allah the Supreme the Glorious he descends to the lowest part of the heaven during the last one-third of the night and then he asks is there anyone who is supplicating to me so that I can answer his supplication is there anyone who is begging to me so that I can give him is there anyone who's asking forgiveness so that I can forgive him it's the occurs in Muslim also inkari it further mentioned in the Hadith ofi in the book of supplications Hadith number 3579 that the closest a servant is to his create Allah subhana wa taala is during the last one-third of the night and if he prays to him during that time it's the best so the the it's immediately after is ear to can pray up to the break of dawn but the best time is the last one3 of the night and that's what is further mentioned in say bukari volume number three Hadith number 20110 where pleased with him he said when people were offering in Raman immediately after Isa that it's good but it would have been better if they offered the last one of the night so praying in the last month third is the best but you can start immediately after Isa and pray just before the break of dawn before the F time but in the Moss generally majority of the Moss they have immediately after Isa that is approximately 2 hours after the break of fast after Sunset plus minus half an hour most of the months because it's convenient because there are people who are young in the congregation there are people who are elderly people there are women so to make it easier and not to make life difficult for them because most of them is difficult for them to get up in the middle of the night so in major of the MOs they have it immediately after is about maybe 2 hours or 2 and a half hours after the break of fast which is no problem at all it's better to pray than not to pray better to pray early than not to pray but the best time is the last month of the night so some of the MOs have during the last one of the night in Ramadan that's the best but the majority of the MOs have it earlier which there's no problem at all"
