  "transcript": "the first question remember the audience he asks or he or she could be different duas are recited at the beginning of the fast during the sahur which is the most authentic as far as reciting any Dua I do not know of any say in which the prophet has recited any Dua at the whole time or any of the sahaba has mentioned any Dua I don't know of any in fact what a prophet said it's mentioned in the Hadith of in the book of fasting Hadith number 730 a beloved Prophet said that anyone who has not intended to fast before Dawn there's no fast for him the prophet said Hadi of in the book of fasting Hadith number 2331 AB Prophet M wasallam said there is no fast for a person who has not intended to fast the night before that means intention is compulsory for fasting it should be done before the break of dawn or as the Hadith says that the night before means any time before the break of dawn you can intend but when you intend you need not say it loudly it's not required because intend in the heart so the main thing is intend in your heart that you're going to fast and that's sufficient when you want to pray you intend you do ni for praying and you pray you don't have to say it loudly the same way you don't have to say that I intend to fast but many people many of the Muslims have invented words in Arabic or in different languages that I intend to fast tomorrow etc etc which we don't find any of the say had and neither do we find in the sayings of the prophet of the sahabas so the best is to intend in your heart that's it and there's no particular Dua for okay that's uh very enlightening that answer hope that answers the question of the partis the audience next question from our audience if a person has the intention of waking for the S but unfortunately he or she doesn't manage to wake up is his or her fast still accepted if a person before sleeping has the intention of fasting tomorrow and he had the intention of getting up for S but could not get up for because he overslept Etc having is not our beloved Prophet said in Vol number three in the book of fasting number 1923 he said that in theur is a blessing it's a Sunnah recommended Sunnah but if a person over sleeps it's not a f to have because he had the intention of getting up he had the intention to fast his fast will be accepted"
