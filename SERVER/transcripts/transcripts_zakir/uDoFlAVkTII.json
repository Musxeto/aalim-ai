  "title": "15 Point Action Plan for the Muslim Ummah when Someone Insults Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) â€“ Full Length",
  "transcript": "the second message that i want to deliver before we throw the floor open for the open question session is the 15 point action plan for the muslim ummah when someone insults prophet muhammad peace be upon him or indulges in islamic blasphemy i will not be repeating what i spoke last week last saturday in the last session about what was done in france including the act of president emmanuel macron of france i will not be repeating that and had given a short message of 24 minutes last saturday in that message i did say that what president emmanuel macron said that islam is in crisis all over the world he got it wrong it is actually islam has the solution for the crisis all over the world and i requested that if you hear my talk islam the solution for the problems of humanity it will clarify all its questions and even my talk on is terrorism a muslim monopoly it will reply to the allegations of president macron that islam is a radical religion and islamic religion of terrorism it will give the details i also mentioned in the last session that regarding what muslims should do they should listen to my answer which i gave in 2006 regarding the danish cartoons the jolly boston newspaper in denmark which had given caricatures 12 cartoons of a beloved prophet muslim but because i got so many requests from the viewers that i should repeat the reply and but naturally since that reply was in 2006 that's about nine years ago today i thought of giving a short message on the 15 point action plan for the muslim ummah when someone insults prophet muhammad peace be upon him or indulges in islamic blasphemy if someone speaks against allah against the quran against islam so this answer is a brief regarding the 15 actions that the muslims should take it's not only focused or localized to what's happening in france it includes that but this is the general answer on 15 actions that the muslims should take this answer of mine will just be touching on the highlights of the 15 points i will not be going to the details because there is a question after session each action or each point in detail can be spoken for an hour or more it requires a lecture so this i'll be just touching the salient features of the 15 actions that muslims should take and it will be specifically dealing on this topic i will not be discussing about the general pharisees that all muslims should do that we muslims should be good examples to the non-muslims that we should be honest we should be kind we should be merciful we should be humble we should be helping all this is spoken by me in detail in other various lectures of mine so today i will be hitting the nail on the head only speaking specifically of the 15 actions that the muslim ummah should take when someone insults the prophet or someone indulges in islamic blasphemy the first action whenever someone reads any article against the prophet or sees a sketch or a cartoon insulting a beloved partner we should follow the hadith of the prophet muhammad our beloved prophet muhammad said it's mentioned inside muslim point number one hadith number 177 that the beloved prophet muslim said that if you see any evil action you should change it with your hand that means you take an action against it if you cannot then do it with your tongue that is by speaking if you cannot then do it with your heart that means hate that act and agree it is wrong then you will be the lowest level of moment the lowest level of a believer so the least a muslim can do whenever he hears any derogatory remarks against the prophet or any caricature or any cartoon against the prophet any insult against the prophet any blasphemy against islam the least he can do is condemn it immediately in his heart and agree that what is done is wrong this is the least anyone can do today after the society has advanced we find many muslims have got so much westernized and have started agreeing with the freedom of expression that many are times when someone insults the prophet you don't even bat an eyelid as nothing has happened oh this is freedom of speech today's world is you know it's a global village and the freedom of speech that someone wants to insult the prophet no problem a moment a true moment whenever he hears any insults the least he can do is condemn that act in his heart so number one that any muslim should do whenever he comes across any blasphemy against islam any insult against the prophet is condemn that act and agreed is wrong then only can you go ahead with the other steps if you don't condemn it if you don't hate that thing in your heart if you don't agree it is wrong then how will you be able to reply or to take the other steps so number one is you have to condemn that act in your heart number two he should take some action minimum the minimum today that the muslim can do besides condemning that is that tell to convey to the others that this act is wrong and today the world is a global village and today the social media has become so popular and so common that for us to condemn such acts we can easily do it on the social media this wasn't there 10 years back but now today internet is used by about 60 percent of the world population out of the 7.82 billion people that we have today 60 percent use internet 4.56 billion people and from this 4.14 billion of the people in the world they use social media that is 53 of the world population uses social media so what a muslim can do and most of the muslims will be having social media accounts whether it be facebook whether it be youtube whether it be twitter we have to condemn this act on the social media if you cannot write any articles yourself or you are not good with words the least you can do is go to the other facebook pages or the other social media sites and scan what the other muslim the either said what the muslim leaders have said what other muslim scholars have said the least you can do is copy and post it onto your social media account today facebook is the largest and the most used social media today as on october 2020 there are 2.701 billion users monthly active users mau in the world 2.701 billion active monthly users that's about 35 percent of the world population they are on the facebook even if you agree that the muslims use social media less at least 25 percent of the muslims be on the facebook and today the muslim population is approximately 2 billion i am shocked that in the last one week when i heard some of the heads of states of muslim countries they are saying that muslims are 1.6 billion in the world today some said 1.5 billion from where do they get the statistics this may be 10-15 years back according to the pew report which is authentic report in 2015 five years ago they said that muslims were 1.8 billion 24.1 percent of the world population were muslims and statistics tell us that the muslims increase 2.2 percent annually every year some statistics say they increase by 1.5 percent if you calculate and you multiply 1.8 billion by 2.2 by 2.2 by 2.25 times you get a figure of more than 2 billion if you agree the increase is only 1.5 percent every year yet you get a figure of 1.95 billion so today muslims are approximately 2 billion in the world so how can a head of state of a muslim country which is one of the largest in the world say that muslims are only 1.6 billion so even if we agree that 25 percent of the muslims use facebook that means half a billion muslims will be having facebook and imagine if we convey this message and we condemn this act it may be anything whether it may be the danish cartoon whether it be the charlie hebdo whether it be macron what he insulted the prophet or whether that would be sun man whenever such incidents takes place the least you can do today is on the social media you can wait and alhamdulillah i did a campaign for about five days on the facebook and it's going to end today inshallah from last tuesday to the saturday for five days and i had 16 posts that were designed and every day either three four or five posts were posted on my facebook and alhamdulillah in a span of these five days it's yet continuing about 35 million people saw this post mashallah and in the next one week it may reach about 45 to 50 million so everyone can put on his facebook we know today the more number of people that you have the facebook doesn't let your post reach everyone they let only a small percentage reach amongst the followers only a small percentage receive unless you pay a lot of money another policy i do not give a single dollar i don't give any paid ads or any paid post mine is 100 fully organic my followers alhamdulillah on the facebook are 22.6 million but on a normal post about 500 800 000 sometimes a million but in this mashallah the average was much higher you can even post it on twitter you can post your condemnation on the youtube the talk that i gave the answer that i gave last week it was for 24 minutes and when i put on my youtube in three days mashallah more than half a million people saw it so in this way a muslim can mashallah reach across the world imagine if all the muslims put on their social media account surely we will be able to convey this message to half the world everyone at least has some following and many people have this philosophy that oh you know there are hardly about a thousand people on my facebook only 500 people on the facebook allah will give you savab on your action suppose a person can reach a million people and he only reaches half a million people and a person who allah has given capacity to reach to a thousand people and he reaches all thousand people he will get more sub up than the person who has reached half a million people because allah gave him a capacity of 1 million so depending upon whatever ability you have got my request to the muslim ummah is that see to it that you condemn this act on all the social media accounts that you have whether it be facebook whether it be youtube whether it be twitter whether it be whatsapp and today we know alhamdulillah after facebook the number two most popular social media account it is the youtube youtube has got 2 billion followers as of october 2020. the third is whatsapp which has got two billion monthly active users the fourth is facebook messenger which has got 1.3 billion monthly active users the fifth it is a wechat 1.206 billion monthly active users the sixth is the instagram 1.153 billion active users monthly so if we make use of the more active or the more popular of the social media there are higher chances that you'll reach a larger audience at least if we take care of the top 15 or the top 20 most active social media you will be able to reach a large audience snapchat has got 441 million users pinterest has got 413 monthly active users twitter has got 336 million monthly active users so what we should do we should propagate as much as possible on the social media with whatever ability you have if you cannot do it yourself copy the post of other islamic scholars other islamic guys other islamic leaders and promote this as much as you can in my youtube channel i gave a reply for about 24 minutes to the attack president emmanuel macron made against islam and that video of 24 minutes in a span of less than three days it had more than five hundred thousand views alhamdulillah so you can use the facebook you can use the youtube you can use the instagram and this is how you promote and what you can do you can go on the internet and select some books or pamphlets on the life of prophet muhammed peace be upon him for example a short booklet written by a hindu life of prophet muhammad peace be upon him by professor ramakrishna rao you can pick up statements from the book of lama team on prophet muhammad peace be upon him in the book heroes in hero worship thomas carlyle writes about the prophet you can pick up that paragraph and send it to a non-muslim friend what michael had wrote about the prophet in the book the hundred most influential people these short things you can pick up from the net and send it to your non-muslim friends you can even send the seerah of the prophet muhammad one of the best seerah is the sealed nectar which is written by sheikh sophia rahman mubarak puri is by darussalam you can pick it up and most of these things are free send it to your non-muslim friend send it to your muslim friend put it onto your social media account and distribute it it's very easy and social media believe me is absolutely free you don't have to spend a single penny on it and no one can say that you cannot spend it on the social media it's very easy point number three is that you can distribute booklets or pamphlets on the life of prophet muslim non-muslim what they say about prophet muhammad on the seer of the prophet you can by the translation of the glorious quran and distributed besides sending the pdf file on the internet on the social media you can even give a physical copy it has a different impact pamphlets booklets translation of the quran islamic books talking about replying to the misconception about islam number four is that you should make a list of the most important people you know and convey this message to them personally everyone has some important people that they know some people who are celebrities maybe knowing ministers may be knowing other people even a normal man living in an apartment at least he knows the chairman of a society so what you should do you should make a list of the top important people that you know who are opinion makers and convey to them this message personally one to one that has a great impact and when this issue of the french president macron came up i use whatever i could on my social media then my wife told me that why don't you convey a message personally to the politicians that you know and i was quite reluctant saying that you know most of the politicians will not really take action on it but my wife said you should do your duty leave the rest of allah so i went on my mobile in my contacts and just like ministers and masha'allah there were plenty there were a few hundred 30 from one muslim country 25 from the other muslim country 20 from this country some are prime ministers some home ministers some islamic ministers and i gave a personalized message depending upon the person and i spent a couple of hours on it and alhamdulillah the result was phenomenal i never expected such a good result that many of them replied back some took action in the next few hours some took action after a day some took action after two days and they send me their response alhamdulillah some wrote directly to the embassy some wrote letters on the facebook on the twitter and alhamdulillah it had a great impact so if every muslim notes down the important people who they know it's most important that they know he may be a local mla he may be a member of parliament he may be a minister or he may be just a chairman of your society the top people that you know if you give a personalized message it has an impact because sometimes you require the muslims to be awakened and i have never done this earlier yes i did contact a few ministers many a time but not at such a large level and alhamdulillah it had a great impact and many of them replied to me back personally so the fourth point that should be done is every muslim whoever he feels are the most important people he knows there may be 10 there may be 20 there may be 50 there will be 100. you give them a personalized message whether a phone call whether a personal sms whether a personal message on the whatsapp talking about this issue about this blasphemy and what action should be taken and believe me alhamdulillah they will be a great impact fifth point is that you can put billboards higher big billboards in important cities and at the main crossroad you can have for a month and put statements of a beloved prophet the hadith of the prophet what non-muslims said about the prophet statements of important non-muslim personalities how they praise the prophet you can mention verses of the glory's quran how allah praises the prophet for example you can mention the verse of the quran of surah kalam chapter number 68 verse number 4 where allah says verily thou art standed on the highest standard of character talking about the prophet you can mention the verse of the quran from surah azab chapter 33 verse number 21 which says verily in the prophet you will find the best example to follow so by mentioning on the billboards condemning the act against the prophet mentioning the good points of the prophet let the world know hundreds and thousands of people passing on the street will watch it you can even be able to read it you can even put on the buses posters or banners on the buses you can even have street plays where you can enact place depending on profit and speaking against the insults against the prophet you can have in schools programs and train our children how to have programs in favor of the profit they can have nasheeds the fixed action that can be taken if that muslims should take out a protest a peaceful protest against the blasphemy or against the act that has been done but we should make it a point that the protests should be peaceful we should not use any violence we should not damage any property we should not do vandalization it should be a peaceful protest and larger the numbers the better it is and we know that there were large numbers in protests have taken place in the past in various acts of blasphemy then in the past where there'd be salman rajdhi whether it be danish cartoon and now also just a few days back mashallah people did take out large prostrations in countries like bangladesh there were more than 40 000 people larger the procession the better it is it should be a peaceful procession and there should be a letter drafted depending upon what the act that is done wrong in this case it can be to the french embassy or the french consulate in that city a letter should be given to the consul general or to the ambassador that we disagree what the president of france has said against islam against a beloved prophet muslim there should be a letter of condemnation these prostitutions that are there it has an impact the larger the procession the better it is and whenever such processions are called for we muslims should take part but see to it that it is a peaceful protest because larger the audience that you have the public that gathers the larger will the media portrayed it will have a better impact on the people the seventh action that a muslim can take is that if that act is such that it is promoted by a particular country like the act what happened in the beginning of this month was by france by president macron then the muslims can call for a boycott of the products of that country and in this case we could see mashallah that many muslim countries mashallah they called for the boycott of the french products of french goods and services and alhamdulillah in sha allah it will have a great impact on france and in this campaign that i did on my facebook i made five posts last wednesday or three days ago mentioning that we should boycott the products of france and the services and since i could see that most of the posters that spoke about boycotting the goods the products weren't mentioned in detail and the brands weren't seen clearly so i decided to select the 100 most famous brands of france starting from louis vuitton channel hermes and so on so forth total and the first post i gave the top 10 brands of france the second post the top 11 to 25 brands of france the third post the top 26 to 50 brands from france and the fourth post the top 51 to 75 brands of france and the fifth post top 76 to 100. so i divided so that the brands could be seen clearly and alhamdulillah the response was phenomenal in the first four posts that i gave on the same day the least it reached in a span of three days was four and a half million people mashallah and the highest post was mashallah more than 7 million normally on my facebook as i told you though there are 22.6 million followers normally when i give a post it is about 500 000 people 800 000 people if it's more popular 1 million sometimes 2 million but martial at this time though all the posts were similar one post reached more than 7 million in a span of less than three days i checked today before it reached three days masha'allah seven million people read that message and the lowest among the four posts was four and a half million people so all these four posts put together 22 million people mashallah read this post imagine 22 million people that means average each post was viewed by five and a half million people as i said that when the campaign is done we should see to it that we don't leave all our activities i decided to do this campaign on my facebook for five days only because i'm involved in other activities we should not stop all other activities and all of us are concentrating on this for months together yes we have to take out some time maybe five days six days one week and then continue with activities and there should be others who carry forward which i will discuss later in my 14th point so banning the products has a great impact and when this was done in 2006 in relation to the danish cartoons against the prophet when there were 12 cartoons that were printed in the newspaper alhamdulillah according to estimate they went in a loss of somewhere close to two billion dollars and it has a great impact this is the seventh point the eighth point is that every muslim should contribute for this cause whatever he can if he's a rich man he can give a big amount even if he's poor he should not say that what will my few dollars do because if allah has given someone a capacity to donate 10 million dollars and he donates only 1 million and allah has given someone a capacity to donate ten dollars and he donates twenty dollars this poor man who donates twenty dollars will get multiple times more up than the rich man who has donated a million dollar so allah will see on what capacity has given you based on that so percentage is more important than the amount if allah has given you a capacity to spread the message to a million people and you spread it only to half a million people allah has given you capacity to spread to 100 people and respect to 200 people your saba will be much more than the other person so whatever you can contribute for the full course whether to have protests or whether to have programs or to put on the billboard give it to organizers involved in this or donate for the cause whatever you can at least there's a sense of belonging that you are giving your hard earned money for this cause to the best of your ability i am putting the points in the order that a common man can do and then going to those points which is difficult for everyone to do so as far as the first eight points are concerned almost all the muslims can get involved number one condemning and agree the act is wrong number two using the social media to spread it as much as they can number three you can distribute booklets or pamphlets on the life of prophet muslim number four pointing out this issue to the important people who they think are public opinion makers number five you can put billboards hire big billboards in important cities and put statements of a beloved prophet the hadith of the prophet what non-muslims said about the prophet statements of important non-muslim personalities how they praise the prophet number six is taking out a peaceful protest procession number seven is banning the product of the country if it involves the eighth point is that every muslim should contribute for this cause whatever he can depending upon the blasphemy and who has done it these 15 points will keep on differing point number nine or action number nine is that we should see to it that we use the mainstream media to convey our condemnation for this act of blasphemy whether it be in the newspapers whether it be in the magazine whether it be on the satellite channel everyone cannot involve giving articles in the magazine or the newspaper or the satellite so whoever allah has given the skill of writing they should use their skill to write letters or write articles in the newspapers in the magazines or maybe give an interview on the channel in the news channel or give a talk we should use the mainstream media as much as possible and those muslims who own the mainstream media should see to it that we convey this message of protest on the mainstream media whether it be newspapers whether it be magazines whether it be radio broadcast stations whether it be satellite channels we convey this message as much as we can so that this message goes throughout the world action number 10 is that we should try and file a legal case against this blasphemy if someone insulted the prophet or someone has done some blasphemous act against islam we should have a team or a battery of lawyers a team of lawyers who will know that how this can be filed in the court of law depending upon the action that has taken place depending upon the insult that has been held on a beloved prophet we should see to it that we file a case in the appropriate court of law and we know that during danish cartoons there were muslim lawyers who filed the case in january 2006 this incident took place on the 30th of september 2005 and initially when the ambassador of the muslim countries went to the danish authorities government they didn't give much importance to it then the muslim filed a case in the court of law but unfortunately they said it is permitted in the freedom of expression to make such cartoon which is absurd how can blasphemy be permitted in the name of freedom of expression and the same thing was said by president macron he said that blasphemy is permitted in the freedom of expression can you believe blasphemy if he says that he is the biggest hypocrite just a few days before when president aruddhagan said that president macron required the mental checkup because he gave derogatory remarks against the prophet against islam so president of turkey president erdogan mentioned that president macron requires a mental checkup immediately he called the envoy to turkey back he called the french ambassador of turkey back to the country just by saying that macron requires a mental checkup he is calling his ambassador back and you're abusing the prophet and that's allowed in freedom of expression so isn't it double standard what we should do is we should file a legal case have good lawyers who are well versed with the law it may be in the international court of law or it can be in the court of that country based on the act number 11 if that if such an act like what has happened recently takes place the muslim countries should call the ambassador of that country which has done this act and convey the message of condemnation or give them a warning and alhamdulillah this has been done very well in many of the muslim countries not all many is wrong it should be few alhamdulillah when president macron gave this statement against islam there were some muslim countries who called the ambassador we know that happened in turkey it happened in malaysia mashallah it happened also in pakistan but it didn't happen in all the muslim countries all the muslim countries should at least call the ambassador of that country which had done this act and convey our condemnation of this act that we disagree with this blasphemy we disagree that a prophet has been insulted imagine if the head of that country was insulted by any other foreign country will the foreign minister keep quiet and the answer is no imagine if some caricature of the prime minister or the president or the king of that country is made in a foreign country and put up on buildings immediately the same day there will be a protest so imagine when the head of state if someone pokes fun at him you want to make a protest why don't you do it when someone makes fun of the prophet knows bella if you don't protest when someone makes fun of the head of state it is accepted yet you are a muslim but how can you agree that a prophet is being insulted and you're keeping quiet our beloved prophet muhammad said it is mentioned in say buhari point number one hadith number 15 that the prophet said that a person is not a believer until he loves me more than his father and more than his children and more than whole human kind the prophet said a person is not a believer a person is not a muslim al-nayashi loves the prophet more than the father more than his children more than whole of humankind our beloved prophet said it's mentioned inside point number one hadith number 16 that the three qualities of a person has he will taste the sweetness of faith number one is love allah and his messenger more than anything else in the world number two if a person loves a person for the sake of allah and he loves him for the sake of allah number three is that he wouldn't like to go in disbelief like he wouldn't like to go into the hellfire if anyone has these three criteria he has tasted the sweetness of faith that means it is compulsory for every muslim every moment to love allah and his messenger more than anything else in this world so how can we not take objection when someone insults a prophet when someone does any islamic blasphemy depending upon the seriousness all these points i'm mentioning is that sometimes someone writes a small article then maybe the first three points are sufficient you may not have to go to the fourth point or the fifth point depending upon the blasphemy depending upon the seriousness of an act you may have to do only first two points sometimes three point sometime five sometimes eight sometimes more the twelfth action that can be taken is that we can stop trade the muslim country can stop trade with that country which has done this blasphemy depending upon if the head of state or if that country promotes this blasphemy or condones this blasphemy then such action should be taken if the individual in the country doing some bless for me and if the country doesn't condone it then you need not go to these levels but like what happened in france the president of france he is condoning it and he goes out of the way to put the caricatures on tall government buildings printed in the mainstream media these blasphemous acts in the name of freedom of expression the 12th action that can be taken is that we can stop trade with that country and we know that alhamdulillah allah has given the muslim country some important products and number one it is the oil it is a petrol we know that most of the petrol most of the oil in the world alhamdulillah comes from the muslim countries if these countries make a pact or group the countries that supply petrol all over the world whether it be saudi arabia whether it be abu dhabi kuwait whether it be malaysia nigeria these countries which have a large export of petrol and if they combine and block and see to it that those countries which are indulging in insulting the prophet or involving an islamic blasphemy if they put a trade sanction on them alhamdulillah we see that america if they want to bully anyone they can put trade sanctions why can't we muslims and we muslims are a big economy as i said that today more than 25 percent of the world population are muslims imagine the amount of products that we use the amount of products that we produce both so if we have a trade sanction on a higher level if the blasphemy is very high or if they don't listen the 12th action that can be taken is a trade sanction we know in such time there may be certain laws if there's a trade sanction then there may be certain countries which are using a product if we muslims see to it that all the muslim countries support each other like as i mentioned when it came to petrol these countries hold the major portion of the world's petrol whether it be saudi arabia abu dhabi kuwait malaysia nigeria where it comes to natural gas number one is qatar when it comes to palm oil majority is indonesia and malaysia 45 of the world export of palm oil it is from indonesia and 30 seconds of malaysia both put together in these two countries 81 of the export of the palm oil imagine if they work together these two muslim countries and if any country tries to twist the arm they get together can very well get an impact fine if certain countries don't purchase from you you may go in lost little bit but imagine the impact that you have and if you cannot do this for land is rasool then how can you call yourself muslims and the 13th action that can be taken is complete boycott and breaking of relationship with the country and their example is the israel what israel did to the muslims in palestine there were many muslim countries martial even till today they have boycotted relationship with israel many of the arab countries unfortunately unfortunately in the last few months there are some arab countries who have again started the relationship if we muslims are together as allah says in the glorious quran in surah maidah chapter number five verse number two that help each other in bir and taqwa in righteousness and in good work we muslims should help each other in righteousness and in good work in piety if we are together and block we can be affordable force depending upon the act we know that what israel has done against the muslims is one of the maximum any country i've done against that is the reason we have gone to the level number 13 we have broken all foreign relationship many countries mashallah and it has had a great impact so we should see to it that we support our muslim brothers in different parts of the world the 14th is that whenever such issues take place in the ummah we find many people who take active part alhamdulillah but we have to realize that this is a specialized work muslim should collaborate but we should not spend our complete time only doing this and leaving the other activities for example if i am in the organization now what i do for the next six months i have stopped my daw activity and only concentrate on this then it will be a great loss for the ummah so what we require we require specialized muslim organizations for organizing these things or rather we would like to say organizations for firefighting and these organizations should be specialized in taking care of such issues like someone inserts the prophet or someone does islamic blasphemy these organizations should mainly cater to this they should write from the starting use the social media should be able to see to it that our programs go on air on the satellite on the newspapers as articles whether they have a protest whether they organize boycotts of the products of that country so these organizations who are specialized in dealing with anyone who has insulted the prophet or anyone indulging in islamic blasphemy is very important like when we have our conference you know we have the peace conference which is one of the largest islamic english conflicts in the world where we have more than a million people coming over a span of 10 days in this we have approximately more than 4 000 volunteers and we have about 30 to 40 different groups we have different 30 to 40 different committees whether hospitality committee whether it be transportation committee whether it be food committee whether it be toilet companies many communities and one we have which is called as firefighting this fire fighting has a separate head altogether but when required it has the heads of the other committees also joining so similarly we should have specialized organization who are specialized in dealing with how to handle such situations and these organizations should have maybe a few cyber troopers depending upon the organization should a few lawyers these cyber troopers should know what is trending in the social media how do they utilize it and how do they convey the message they should have few lawyers now these lawyers may not be high-end lawyers they may have medium level lawyers like anyone who insults the prophet or anyone who attacks any other die there should be legal action taken so such organizations should be there in most of the muslim cities most of the cities which have majority muslim they should be there or should be in the cities where muslims and minority but then large numbers so these organization the main aim is to handle this throughout the year so in such issues as president macron takes place all the muslim um joints some may join for five days some will join for six days some may join for a week for two weeks but you can't expect the muslim ummah to leave all the activities and full year be after this issue that will be a loss imagine someone is doing dawah someone is doing some teaching someone doing islamic teaching if you stop all these activities for one year and every year there are some issues so at this time all should get together for a few days or for a week but there are organizations who should handle the situation and they should be able to see to it that they take the impact to the highest level and in this organization they should have contacts as volunteers top lawyers top politicians top muslim leaders they will come when required but they should have full-time few cyber troopers full-time few lawyers and they should coordinate and see to it that the end result is achieved and the 15th point is that on a higher level all the muslim countries should unite and they should have a block i know that there are certain organizations which are there but i believe they have become inactive this collaboration of the muslim countries together there are today 56 to 57 countries in the world which have majority muslims we should all join together so that if any action is taken if we take it unitedly we'll have a bigger impact and i believe that this should be away from the normal politics what has happened now that there are certain organizations but they're more involved in whether will it benefit my country or not if i take objection will it benefit the leader of the country they are more bothered about the personal benefit of the country than the benefit of islam that's the reason unless a person loves the prophet more than he loves himself loves his father loves his children loves the human kind he is not a true believer and if we realize that there are certain countries it's not necessary all 57 countries should be together let's start with five countries it will become six it will become ten it will become fifteen let them come together and end block condemn rather than individually in such cases if we come unitedly we are a bigger force if there is a boycott of products or a trade sanction or helping each other if the countries are united the muslim countries we are a bigger force and imagine 25 more than 25 percent of the world population are muslims if we unite we can do wonders and i would like to give you an example in history what is the impact when muslims are united we know that the 34th sultan of the ottoman empire his name was sultan abdul hamid ii he was the last sultan which actually had powers he was the third sultan there were two sultans after that but the person who had some power and say after that it kept on deteriorating he was the third last sultan but the last sultan which actually had powers and we know that he ruled from 1876 to 1909 in his reign towards the end of the 19th century in late 1800 there was a comedy play that was supposed to be held in france on a beloved prophet muslim it was a satire a comedy play insulting a prophet and when sultan abdul hamid ii heard about this he got very angry and he wrote a strong letter to the french government saying that this is not tolerated by the muslims and you should not let this play take place and i am totally against it initially the french government tried to give excuses but they realized that the sultan was serious and what did they do they immediately did not allow this play to take place and they completely abolished the comedy play to the extent that most of the actors and the people involved they exiled them to uk to please the sudan few years later again news came that the same play is going to take place in uk so again sultan abdullah me too he got angry and he wrote a similar letter to the uk government that we have heard that there is a play which criticizing the prophet and this is not already in islam and you should immediately see to it that this play doesn't take place the uk government the british government replies veteran said that this was happening in france and now it's coming in uk it should not happen and they stopped it you should stop it too the uk government replied saying uk is not france and we believe in freedom of speech indicating that they will continue with the play sultan abdul hamid gets very angry and he writes a second letter he says you may not be aware that my ancestors they gave their life for the cause of islam and i am prepared to do the same if you do not stop this play see to it it is not done i will inform the full muslim world that you are doing a play against the prophet and you will be held responsible for the consequences then the british government realized that the sultan was serious and they were so much afraid of the muslim unity that time that they immediately banned the play imagine one sultan says that because that time if you know it was the end of the ottoman empire that means the last it wasn't that powerful at all yet just because the sultan gave a warning i'll inform the full muslim world that they're doing a play which is against the prophet and you will be held responsible for the consequences that letter was sufficient to bring shivers in the full government imagine at that time end of the 19th century you know the uk government the front government they were powerful that colonies in so many parts of the world they were even ruling india but sultan writes a letter at that time even though it's towards the end of the atman empire yet they're afraid and today we hardly see any muslim leader speaking just one two three or yes a few here and there but they are speaking individually imagine if all the muslim leaders in the world even half of them get together and give a warning there will be a world of a difference today the muslim leaders are more involved will it benefit me will it not benefit me will i remain in power will i not remain in power they are more bothered about their seat here they are not bothered about the akhira at all imagine a beloved prophet said anyone who does not love allah and messenger more than he loves himself loves his father loves his children he is not a moment how can we muslims keep quiet when someone is blaspheming against a prophet what has happened to the muslim ummah that's the reason when i gave my actions the lower actions are mainly for the common man and see this example that the muslims are united what an example even though towards the end i personally believe that allah all these actions that take whether it be salman whether it be danish cartoon whether it be the charlie hebdo whether it be the statement made by president macron allah subhanahu wa is testing the muslims do you think allah cannot solve the problem very easily for allah confirmed very easy allah says in the quran in surah alba chapter number 61 anyone who abuses the messenger of allah for him there is a painful punishment allah repeats a similar message in surah azam chapter number 33 verse number 57 indeed those who abuse allah and his messenger allah curses them in this world and the hereafter and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment unless allah for him to solve this is very easy what is he doing he is checking the iman of the believers iman of the muslims i believe all these incidences that taking place allah wants to check who is the true believer who is the namesake believer who is the munafiq there may be muslims who may be praying but they may be monafiq they may be calling themselves muslims but they're joining hands with the enemies of islam so i believe allah these incidences that he takes place to check what are you doing you cannot complain okay that's muslim leader is not good allah will ask what did you do allah will ask each and every muslim what did you do when you heard that someone was making a caricature of the prophet peace be upon him what did you do when someone insulted a prophet and everyone will be responsible for himself that's the reason in my 15 actions what i mentioned each one depending upon what capacity allah has given you you cannot say okay i am a layman what difference does it make okay at least in from one person whatever you have allah will check on your capacity as i said earlier if allah gave me a capacity to reach a million people and if you reach half a million people compared to another person who allah has given capacity to reach 100 people and he reaches all hundred people he will get more savable than the person who has reached half a million because allah had given him one million capacity that's what keeps me striving what allah has given nyama to me am i doing my job or not am i fulfilling my duty as a muslim or not am i taking correct action or not am i doing enough or not you cannot say okay what different does it make i am a normal muslim i don't have contacts whatever allah will not see on the results allah will see on how much jihad you do how much striving you do how much struggle you do so based on whatever capacity you have whatever ability allah has given you by the writing ability whether allah gave you speaking ability whether whatever context allah has given you whether you may be having 100 people on your facebook or a thousand people or a million people or 20 million people allah will check how much effort have you taken if allah has given you a popularity allah has given you we are nothing are we utilizing it for the cause of islam or not the more ability allah gives you the more facility allah gives you more will you be responsible so i believe personally all these things that are happening in the world allah is testing as believers allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 155 allah will surely test you with fear and hunger with loss of life and goods you can never enter jannah without being tested so this is the time that we have been tested and we pray to allah that may allah accept our efforts and may he guide us in the right way to react to such things that are taking place in the world"
