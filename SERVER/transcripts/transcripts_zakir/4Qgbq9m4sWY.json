  "title": "A Hindu Girl has a Live-in Relationship with a Muslim Boy and comes Close to Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "i am a hindu girl i was in a relationship with a muslim guy for three years we were in a kind of live-in relationship however through him i started liking islam now he has dumped me without any reason will allah be angry with him what punishment will he get i cry every day thinking of him we both are from india but studying abroad regarding this hindu sister that she said that she was in love with the muslim boy and they were living in a living relationship that means living together without getting married and staying together and and you know what happens but after some time he left her and he dumped her but she got close to islam because of him and now she cries thinking about him her question is that will allah punish her and what punishment will get number one live in relationship in islam is haram it's not permitted at all a girl and a boy who are nam haram living together is totally haram in islam only after marriage can husband and wife live together or brother sister fine but the unknown man and woman unless they marry they cannot live together living in relationship just to experience that haram so for that it is a major sin because they live in relationship there is illicit relationship and it becomes the tenth major sin in islam adultery or fornication and allah will punish him for that then your question was that you cry thinking about him my saturday to you sister is that i would look at it in a different way in your question you said that because of that boy you came close to islam so according to me if i was in your place and you started liking islam what i would have done i would have actually thanked him because he has brought you close to islam what he has done with you is wrong i am not condoning him at all if he left you for what reason he left you i don't know but he has promised you that he's going to be with you and he left you it is haram there may be various reasons unless we don't know the reasons why it left you i may not be able to tell but live in relationship itself is haram will be punished for that but the good point in this the silver lining in this is that because of him you came close to islam it is like someone giving you a million dollar and then robbing one thousand dollar from that million dollar and you're crying why did he drop that one thousand dollar you should not be pessimistic you should be optimus you should be happy he gave you a million dollar he wrote one thousand dollars wrong but he's given you a million dollars from that million dollar 999 thousand dollars yes he only wrote one thousand dollars and allah says in the quran and sorry bachrach number two verse number 216 that you may hate a thing which may be good for you and you may love a thing which is not good for you allah knows and you don't know so this situation if that boy has got you closer to allah has got you closer to islam and you have learned about it then it is worth it if he if he has ditched you he has done a mistake allah will punish him what my suggestion to you sister is that if you have come close to islam accept islam study islam i'm sure you may be believing that there's no god but one god allah not allah you should not associate partners with that god you should not divide the worship and believe that prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final messenger if you believe that there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah you become a muslim that is worth more than all the wealth in the world million dollar is a small example because on the day of judgment the unbelievers when they'll be put in hell fire they will not complain to allah that you are in just they will say we do not mind giving you the full world and the wealth in it to save us but god will say allah will save too late so what you have got is a treasure sister love it and cash it see to it that you practice islam surely you will find some good muslim boy who will like you who will marry you and insha'allah your life may be better maybe later on you thank allah that okay it was infatuation that i liked the previous boy but the new person who you have married will turn out to be a better husband will be love will be loving you more so look it in the positive sense and maybe you start doing dua to the boy that left you so look it with an optimistic view sister not a pessimist view and inshallah maybe you start praying for him that what he has done is brought you closer to islam"
