  "transcript": "Dr Zakia is it allowed for one to eat and drink even when the MU announces the uh C of prayer for f is it allowed to eat and drink some people I'm not sure whether it's correct or not but some people believe that you can eat and drink all the way up to the fan and Beyond I'm aware that there are some Muslims who believe that you can eat and drink until the F Adan ends and there are some people who when they can hear various Adan of different Moss from the house they wait till they hear the end of the last Adan so if they can hear five six Adan they wait till the last Adan ends till that time they eat and drink in fact this is not proved from any of the Hadith of the prophet and anyone who innovates a new thing in the dean it has to be rejected it's mentioned in in the Hadith of s bukari volume number three Hadith number 2697 that anyone who innovates a new thing in the dean it has to be rejected in fact it's clearly mentioned in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 187 that eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread that means the moment Dawn breaks moment you hear the Adan you have to stop eating and as I quoted earlier thei of bukari one number three book of fasting Hadith number 1918 and Hadith number 1919 where pleased with her she said when you hear the Adan of B with him continue eating and drinking until you hear the Adan ofum for when he give the Adan it is the time for f that Dawn breaks up that means the moment you hear the Adan you have stop eating the moment you hear the you stop eating but there is a concession given by beloved Prophet wasallam it's mentioned say Hadith of sun Abu da volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2343 where the Beloved Prophet said that when you hear the Adan and if you have drinking vessel in your hand you are allowed to satisfy yourself from that vessel that means our beloved Prophet has given a concession that while you're eating or drinking something is in your hand you can complete it but that doesn't mean that if if you have a big sandwich in your hand that you completed if you have a bite left of that sandwich in your hand and then you've had it it's fine or when you're drink a glass of water and there is something left in it you can have it that doesn't mean you can go out of your way and touch your hand and pick up another glass of water and keep on having have a big burger or a sandwich and keep on eating for a few minutes after the Adan started and it's a misconception that you can eat till the end of the Adan there's no Hadi saying that because you start the Adan the moment the fjer prayers time starts a moment it's the break of dawn the aan has to be given the moment you hear the aan you have to stop eating"
