  "transcript": "next question from abu abdulfatah from ghana is there a way or a manner that a non-muslim can die which can lead him or her to jannah very good question is there any way that a non-muslim can do any action that will lead him to go to jannah the only thing that will make any human being or even a non-muslim to go to jannah is to agree that there is no god worthy of worship except allah and that prophet muhammad peace be upon me is the messenger of allah so before dying if a non-muslim agrees and proclaims and bears witness that there is no god worthy of worship except allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah he will become a muslim so before dying if you become the muslim as long as he doesn't do it in the last moment of death when the moth when the angel of death has already come to him and that time if he says it will not be accepted like as is mentioned in the quran that firaon when he was about to die he says i believe that there is no god but allah it's too late so before the last moment when the angel of death come before that with the family before that one hour before that one day before that one year before that if the non-muslim accepts islam and agrees that no one worthy of worship except allah and agree that prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah he will become a muslim and insha allah he will go to jannah all his past sins will be forgiven"
