  "transcript": "i am abdullah from riyadh saudi arabia my question is that if a muslim dies in a plague will he be called a martyr or will he just get the sabbath of a matter there are various hazies talking about this incidence of a person dying in the play above muslim said it's mentioned hadith of the remainder number two hadith number one zero six three the that the prophet said there are five types of martyrs in islam the one who is killed in the way of allah a person who dies in the plague a person who dies of stomach illness a person who dies while drowning and a person who dies in a crush or a collapse maybe a house has collapsed so these five categories of the people according to the prophet they are martyrs so if a person dies in plague yes he is called as a martyr there are a hadith number four hadith number two eight zero four the prophet asked one of the sabas that what do you know about the martyrs amongst you so he said that those who are killed in the way of allah subhanahu wa they are matters then the prophet replied if this was the only case then matters in my ummah would be very few then he said martyrs are those who are killed in the way of allah matters are those who die in the cause of allah martyrs are those who die because of stomach illness are though those who die in a plague and there's another addition by another narrator saying that martyrs are those who even who even die while drowning so these are five categories of people who the prophet said are matters regarding the question if a person dies in a plague will he get is he called a martyr or will he get a sabab of a martyr there's another hadith of the prophet sallam which is mentioned inside bukhari one number seven hadith number five seven three four where the beloved prophet muslim said i shall be said that the prophet said that allah sends plagues as a punishment to the unbelievers to whomever he wants and as for the believers it is a blessing and if a believer during plague lives patiently and believing that nothing will befall him except what allah has ordained for him allah says he will get a reward of a matter in this hadith a person who lives patiently is the criteria and believes that nothing will be formal befallen nothing will happen to him except what is ordinary he gets the saba of a martyr and according to ibm he says that there are three categories of people in this a person who dies in place he gets a swab of plague a person who is affected by plague but does not die he too gets a sabab of a matter and a person who during plague is patient and has faith that nothing will befall him and he does not get sick he does not die yet he gets the savab of a martyr but a person who dies in plague besides being called a martyr he also gets a savab of a martyr he gets both ajar hope to answer the question"
