  "title": "Alhamdulillah! A Christian man finds the 'True Peace' in Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name's uh bezo Laurent cameroonian by nationality sales executive in a private company here in Dubai I've been in this situation I've been associating with Muslims and they've been telling me a lot about Islam and with the aware of life I've been cherishing and admiring it so much I began yesterday here with a question which was rightly entered but with some other questions in mind I could not accept Islam till all such questions are being answered so it's a privilege once more again today to bring before the audience this one more question after which I'm going to declare my intentions and my view of Islam so my question is this when you get to a company let's say you purchase a new car you take this car on the road and you get to discover that there is something missing from this car let's say the horn you discover that it's lacking I don't know in your mind what do you think is it that did not put the horn or something happened for that horn to just cease or what I don't know relating it to the world in which you are in I want to ask whether the world has a whole which was created by an almighty God somebody who is so powerful and the most intelligent being in the world he created a world we got into it and we are today looking for peace peace peace peace where did this piece go to when the world was created by the most intelligent being on Earth is it that he made an error somewhere or we are looking for something that he did not want it to be in his world thank you brother that's a good question and you give an example that if you buy a car a new car and then you find that there is no horn so is there something missing with this analogy he says that today in this world there's no peace everyone is looking for Peace So did almighty God did he create peace or did he want human beings not to get peace brother you asked a very good question I'll give you an example about the car you know the new BMW car the latest model 2012 the high model you know seven series or even a Mercedes and it's a true story once when you're traveling with my friend he told his friend that go and park my car so when he went to the car he said he could not find the ignition key ignition key so he phoned my friend and asked him that where is the ignition key so he started to laugh the new cars don't have ignition hole it is the latest technology if the key comes close to the car automatically it senses you push the button it starts latest so if you're outdated you may not know that there is no key hold required in the latest car this is automatic so you are searching for something it is very close to him but he could not understand it because he did not know about it so Allah as far as peace is concerned the main source of peace is assalam Allah the Creator is the main source of peace if you cannot understand the Creator you will never come close to true peace there are different types of Peace some people think that if they get luxury if they get facilities they get peace these are all temporary peace not the true peace the true peace is peace of heart Peace of Mind peace of soul when your heart is at peace when your mind is at peace when your body is at peace and this can only be achieved by understanding the Creator so those people who don't understand the Creator they are running after mirages you know when you go in a desert you see mirages so you run after mirages because you don't understand and to understand the Creator other Mission earlier require instruction manual you did not read the instruction menu of the latest BMW and you're trying to find out where is the ignition key where is the horn you read the instruction manual you will find Han you will find the ignition key hold as well as piece and I do agree with you many people talk about peace many countries talk about peace they are talking about their personal material thing about the security then you get peace the true peace is piece of Mind peace of heart beats of soul I don't know about what you are talking about other human beings martial I am at peace I don't know how many human beings interacted with I can tell you masha'allah I doctors I'm at peace mashallah and I found peace because Islam comes from the word Salam which means peace it's also derived from The Advocates film which means to submit your will to almighty God so true peace is Islam means peace acquired best submitting a will to God so until you do not submit your will to God brother you will never acquire two peace hope that answers the question hope that answers the question brother yeah I've got the question so are you prepared to accept the new peace really doctor thank you very much for the clarification at least we've uh that in mind I've really acknowledged Alam us I've really acknowledge Islam as a learning institution as a school where we learn to benefit ourselves so as from today I want to be part of that school to learn the right way of life but do you believe that there's one God I do believe do you believe that Jesus is not God I don't believe you believe in the messenger of God I believe do you believe Prophet Muhammad peace be upon is the messenger of God I do believe is anyone forcing you to accept Islam nobody is mine are you doing all of your free will it's a free will or your own conviction exactly no one is specializing you no pressure in Arabic and then you can repeat it who I bear witness I bear witness that that there is no God there is no God but Allah but Allah and I bear witness and I bear witness that that Prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is is the messenger the messenger and servant of Allah and soul of Allah you're a Muslim with Allah that to guide you further and inshallah through you may he make more non-muslims into peace enter the region of peace and I pray to Allah to Grant you the best in this world [Applause]"
