  "transcript": "one last question uh with so many school of thoughts in Islam can you tell me what happened to ISA why the Jews wanted to kill him sorry I didn't understand what did you say why did can you tell me what happened to ISA yeah why the Jews wanted to kill him and who was put in replacement of him the brother has a question that why did Jews wanted to kill Prophet Jesus peace be upon him who was replaced and what happened to him according the Quran the reply is given in the Quran in Surah chapter number 4 verse 157 it says they said in both the Jews that we killed Jesus Son of Mary they killed him not neither did they crucify him it was made to appear all those who differ are full out doubts with only conjectures to follow for assur they killed him not so Quran say they did not kill him neither did the cfy him it was made to appear so all those who differ are full of doubt and then the next verse Surah n 4 158 says Allah raised him up alive unto himself so according to the Quran Jesus Christ peace be upon him was not killed he was not crucified you ask him who was put in his place I don't know I know there are stories Judas was put this was put Gospel of babus Quran says he was not killed he was not crucified for meat is sufficient who was put in his place whether someone was put on Le bothered because Quran says anyone who defers is full of doubts so even according to the Bible I have proved I had a debate was Christ really crucified and from the Bible I've proved that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was not crucified but that will take time you can refer to my video cassette so from the Bible also you can prove Jesus wasn't crucified peace be upon him and even the Quran says he was not killed he was not crucified he raised up alive and Jesus Christ peace be upon he will come back again according to the Quran according to the Bible any Second Coming he will testify to the Christians as Quran says in Surah MAA 5 verse number 116 that I never told you to worship me but I said worship Allah my Lord and your lord same thing is mentioned in the bible any second coming he will tell to the Christians that you depart from you I don't even know you so Jesus Christ peace be upon has been raised up alive because people insonated that he claimed Divinity in Second Coming he will testify he never claimed to be God and he will come as um of wasallam hope that the question thank you"
