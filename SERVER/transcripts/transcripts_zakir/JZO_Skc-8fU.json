  "title": "Jihaad means “Holy War” is a Misconception - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there is another misconception that most of the people whether muslims are non-muslims they think that jihad means holy war in fact if you read the quran nowhere is the word holy war used anywhere in the quran nowhere will you find holy war mentioned in any of the authentic hadith of the prophet sayings of the prophet muhammad the arabic translation for the english word holy war is which means a holy war this word is no way mentioned in the quran nowhere it is mentioned in any of the authentic khalid prophet this word holy war was initially coined by the orientalists when they started writing books on islam and unfortunately many of the muslim scholars even they translate the holy war it's unfortunate if someone makes a mistake regarding the religion of islam unfortunately many of the muslim scholars even they use this english translation thinking that the most appropriate translation for the arabic word jihad is holy war which is totally wrong the word which is used in the quran it is fighting it is kital it means to kill and again fighting is of two types killing can be of two types for good purpose and bad purpose as allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 76 that the believers they fight in the way of allah they fight in the way of allah and the unbelievers they fight in the way of the satan so the believers let them fight against the brothers of the satan that means the evil people they fight in the way of the devil and the good people they fight in the way of almighty god so jihad does not mean holy war and kital merely means to fight kital fusabililla means fighting in the way of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and kitab shaytan means fighting in the way of the satan"
