  "transcript": "Dr Zakir another question of great importance regarding the fast in Ramadan unfortunately there are many brothers and sisters who neglect the obligation of fasting during the month of Ramadan some words of advice and indeed from the Quran and the Sunnah give us some proofs of the fact that it is an obligation upon the Muslim to fast in Ramadan there are many verses in the Quran as well as many say Hadith which very well clarify that it is further for the Muslims who are supposed to fast that they should fast and suffer we shall deal with the details for whom it is offered inshallah tomorrow Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 183. oh you who believe foreign fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-esteem here the Arabic word used means prescribed it is written amongst the other thing which are complicity it has been prescribed it has been made compulsory for you also fasting as it was made compulsory for people who came before you that means it was compulsory even for people that came before the Christian Etc but it's also made compulsory for the Muslims for the Believers and further it says Point number one is compulsory for you point number two is completely for people who came before you point number three so that you may learn self-esteign same as the root word for taqwa which means that you have to fear yourself you know from the wrath of Allah in short the meaning of the word taqwa it is somewhat like God consciousness piety means righteousness so you Allah is the link fasting has been prescribed to you so that you may learn self-restraint so that learn takwa you increase yourself in taqwa in God Consciousness in righteousness in piety and when a person fasts what happens that he feels hungry and normally when a person is well fed that gives them more energy to many a times do things which also prohibit it and to commit sins the moment you fast reaction towards things which are private goes down and the parameter of goes High that's the reason fasting helps you to improve your self-restraint and give it a quality furthermore it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 185 Allah says Quran as that Ramadan was the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guidance to humankind and in it assigns for guidance and judgment between right and wrong immediately after that Allah says the people who witnessed this month they should fast we again become the first for the Muslims that if you're in this month of Ramadan you should fast and give the exception is that if you are ill or if you are traveling then the period can be made later on etcetera Etc but here this verse says it is compulsory for every Muslim to fast in the month of Ramadan and the exception is that day furthermore there are several Hadith which make it compulsory for the Muslim to fast I'll just quote one which is the most important one that Islam is based on Five Pillars the first is the messenger of Allah the second is establishing prayers the third is giving zahat that's obligated charity the fourth is performing Hajj that the pilgrimage to the holy city of Makkah and the fifth is observing Psalm that is fasting so from this Hadith number one in the book of Iman Hadith number eight it says that fasting is one of the pillars of Islam not only is it further it is one of the principles one of the pillars of Islam amongst the five most important things for a Muslim one of them is fasting so from these evidence we come to know that fasting is further for every Muslim well I don't think it can be put in much of a clearer way to be honest I think that people should take advice and fast this Ramadan job"
