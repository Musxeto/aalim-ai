  "title": "Should Zakaat be Given Only During Ramadhaan or it can be Given Any Time of the Year?  - Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "zakat is should it be given only during ramadan or can it be given throughout the year is there any uh specific period that will ask the question that can zakat begin any time of the year or should be doing only in ramadan the basic rule is that any rich person who has more than a sub level more than 85 grams of gold are saving for more than one year then if that saving remains with that percent of one immediately applicable so moment you have that saving of more than the nisab level more than 85 grams of gold if it's for more than one year if you save it whether the savings starts in january december or april moment is with you for a period of more than one year then zakat is applicable and it can be given any time of the year but for convenience it will be difficult if i start calculating this money i have with me no in january i had one like rupees in february at one and a half lakh rupees then 50 000 added in march then again in april at 3 lakh rupees so it's difficult so for convenience what we do that we take any point of the year and most of the muslims they prefer amnam because being a holy but you can give any time at the time of ramadan in the first of ramadan you decide or the fifth of ramadan or tenth of ramadan you take a point in the calendar year it should be lunar canada it can't be december or january because that becomes the solar calendar which 11 days more so they will be paying zakat less in 33 years he will pay zakat once less so take any one point of time and since we don't follow lunar calendar arabic we don't know very well most of the people take any one data from them and at that time whatever money you have you give zakat on that now when you do this policy you remember you are actually maybe giving a little bit more than what is actually meant to be given because if we have a saving more than one lunar year then taka is applicable now once we calculate suppose the first of ram done so if we have suppose now 10 lakh rupees saving so you pay on that next ramadan you have only likely to be saving so here what happens it can be possible that you may be paying a little bit more zakat but you can't pay less you can't pay less because maybe when in this month of ramadan you have 10 lakh rupees next first of all you have 20 lakh rupees saving but actually maybe fire like came just one month before so on that five lakh zakat is actually not applicable so when you take one fixed time of the year it's a very safe thing now whatever money i have at one particular time of the year it is very safe that you are at least paying the minimum zakat you may be paying a little bit more means if you're saving two lakh rupees that comes to five thousand please if you have to like or if your friendly like repeal comes to 50 000 rupees so actually maybe two lag rupees came just one month before so zakat isn't applicable at that time it's applicable maybe after 11 months so you may be paying a little bit more but you can't pay less so this is a very safe system so normally people they prefer but there's nothing as such but once you decide suppose you take the cutting off point as ram and then suppose the rich people have one crow two crow property so two core property means they have to pay about five like rupees ah so what people normally do they can even spread it out like they know approximately like my zakat for the next year this coming year will be approximately five to six aggregates so every month that they got fifty thousand but you can do you can pay the cars in advance you can even pay two years in advance and this hadith he paid extra zakat he said that yeah rasul can i pay for an extra resource that is you can so you can even pay for one year in advance because to take out fire like immediately in one month may be difficult so people even can say that approximately as the class comes to five to six like so every month that i got 50 000 rupees and the final calculation is done at the cutoff date most of the non-arabs they prefer the cut off date became done because that's easy to calculate but there's no such rule as they should be ram done but if you have one particular date you can be sure that you aren't paying zakat less you may be paying a little bit more but not less so that's the reason people prefer giving charity in the month of ramadan because thinking they get more so if they do that there's no problem but there's no rule as such that zakat should be given in the month of ramadan but if one year is over you can't delay the sakai suppose if you're calculating for the full month of ramadan if you calculate the first of ramadan whatever is due you should pay immediately you can't help it later on if you have paid in advance no problem then the balance you can pay immediately so if you say once you calculate then immediately within a few days or a couple of weeks you can't delay too long that okay finally after a few months that's wrong so we'll answer the question"
