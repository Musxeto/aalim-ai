  "title": "Rahul Asks Dr Zakir, “How can God be Jealous?” - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "you said yesterday you quoted the line that uh one of the commandments was said you shall not make any resemblance of anything that is in the heaven above or in on earth or in the water beneath because i your lord your god is a jealous god now um do you do you really think that don't i mean don't you feel that it's a bit petty for god to think uh jealously or be jealous of the these things i thought in my mind that these feelings are limited only to human beings and god and egoism and jealousy i don't think are things which which can be a very good question and i agree with you totally why should god be jealous that is what is mentioned in the bible so i'm not saying yeah i didn't read the bible neither do i agree that everything in the bible is the word of god okay but we do but we do believe that uh we should not associate anything to god that's right that part why that word god get annoyed if you ask a question please after finishing the question let me give a reply yeah sorry if there is a debate we can have a debate no problem fine yeah no no no give it to the different things the question for time you ask a question wait for the reply if i reply and you keep on interjecting not that i don't mind but that becomes an individual dialogue which you can do some other time i'm sorry fine you ask a question you ask a second question i give you time but then if we keep on talking it will be like a yeah you can do it there also even in debate we have time 15 minutes 50 minutes you called a very good question that i quoted a verse that's saying that thou shalt not have any given image of anything in the heaven above in the earth beneath and water beneath the earth thou shalt not bow down to them now serve them for i thy lord thy god is a jealous god it was a quotation from the book of exodus from the old testament chapter number 20 verse number three to five and the book of deuteronomy chapter number five verse number seven to nine so this is a quotation of the bible i don't consider the bible completely with the word of god so the first part of that verse agree is correct because god cannot have images but the second part that god is jealous i don't agree with that that particular portion so that's the reason that you have to ask the christian not to me i'm not here to support everything of the bible what matches with the quran i will support what doesn't match i will not support therefore i do agree with you that it is unlike god to be jealous on that thing hope that answers the question but we do we do say that we should not associate anything to god yeah and god this is a biggest sin which will never be forgiven yesterday that was clarified yesterday that associating partner is the biggest sin [Applause]"
