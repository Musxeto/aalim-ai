  "title": "Why Should there be Only One God? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "some people may say that why they should be only one God why can't there be many gods if there would have been many gods surely these Gods would have fought among themselves and we find this in the mythology of some of the religions one God fighting with the other God one God helping the other God to fight the third God can you believe in such a God who can be defeated who can be killed and some people say that why can't they be different God one God for son man got for cloud one God for wind now imagine if there was one God for each each one having power over his own little thing it's logical to have one God who has power of all things rather than each different different God fighting among themselves it's illogical that's the reason the Quran says chapter number 21 verse number 22 that if they would have been Gods besides Allah surely there have been confusion in the universe if they were God besides Allah on the other surely there would have been infighting amongst them therefore we see in the mythology the best and the most logical is only one God one and only all-powerful having power over all things that's the reason if you read the scriptures of the major world religions all the scriptures of the major world religions they say that almighty God is one they've got no images he's not begotten he's one and only absolutely Eternal nothing like him and by the passage of time many of the scriptures almost all besides the Quran these scriptures have changed Allah says in the Quran in foreign foreign so here it's mentioned in the Quran that people write the scripture with their own hands and then say this is from Allah so by the passage of time all the scriptures that came before the Quran they have been changed and since they were not the last and final Revelation almighty God did not think it fit to be preserved because those were the previous Revelations but in spite of this corruption in spite of the manipulation in spite of the change yet in the remnants of all the major world religions in their scriptures you will find the mention of monotheism the Oneness of almighty God that he has got no images he is not begotten he is one and only and nothing like him so if you believe in the concept of God it should be according to your scriptures there are some religions which are agnostic you may not call them religions like Buddhism they don't comment on God they are silent as far as God is concerned and many ethical systems which I mentioned earlier like Confucianism taoism there are more of ethical systems than having a concept of God and as far as the people or atheists like journalism Etc to those who agnostic and atheists they can refer to my video cassette is the Quran God's word and I gave that earlier also as well as recently in Bombay a couple of months back on the 24th of November on the second day of the peace exhibition in Mumbai the solution Humanity is the Quran God's word if they see this cassette or the top inshallah if the human being is unbashed with the help of the Quran have proved the existence of Allah"
