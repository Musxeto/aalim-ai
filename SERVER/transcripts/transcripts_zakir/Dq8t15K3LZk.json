  "transcript": "would you uh now tell the viewers some authentic duas which are good for them they can make in this month of Mercy there are hundreds of Dua which authentic and if you can refer to the book fortification of Muslim through the supplications from the Quran and authentic Hadith it's a book published which has more than 100 to us I think 129 to be precise I'll just mention a couple of them from the Quran and hadithians request is that the most General Dua which is there in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 201 is oh my Lord give us the good in this world and the Hereafter and save us from the torment of Hell Fire this is the general Dua which is general and the best given in the Quran and The Duel of the Quran the best because this is the word of Allah himself which means oh Lord let not our hearts David after thou has guided us and grant us Mercy from the Bounty for thou art the grantor of bounties they are the Dua which I always make in the starting of any lecture which is asking for helpful which you can do in the beginning speech or when you know doing something which is very difficult then go and give the message to Faron so it's mentioned in Surah chapter number 20 verse number 25 to 28.3 which means oh my Lord expand my breast for me and make my task easy for me and remove the impediment which is in my speech so that they will understand me and you know Musa you're the stammerer and as many people are aware that even I during my childhood have the stamina or sometimes summer so that's the reason I read this Dua at the beginning of every talk so Muslim asked Allah to remove the impediment from a speech and furthermore so that they will understand me and there is a barrier many a time between you and the person whom you are giving the message so he prayed Allah made that Barry be removed therefore before every talk I supplicate so that the audience if there's a barrier between the audience and myself it is removed these are just few duas from the Quran there are several authentic duas even from the Hadith I as well as the prophet said that anyone who says which means glory be to Allah and praise be to Allah will plant a dead tree for that person in Paradise they are the hadees which is there mentioned in say Muslim Hadith number 6509 where the Beloved person said that anyone who says glory be to Allah and praise be to him if you mention hundred times there's nothing more excellent for him on the day of judgment on the day of Resurrection nothing better than that except someone with a similar words or someone would say something better a similar Hadith is mentioned in say bukhari volume number eight Hadith number six four zero five where the Beloved said that anyone who says glory be to Allah and praise be to Allah a hundred times his sins will be forgiven even if his sins are equal to the form of the sea It also says in say Muslim Hadith number 749 that when you hear the call of the modern then you have to pray and say that I testify that there's no one worthy of worship except Allah and he has got no partners and Prophet Muslim is the slave and messenger of Allah and I'm pleased with my Lord anyone who says this his sins will be forgiven for example after obligated prayers we say subhanallah is it 100 times then your sins will be forgiven there are other Hadith like after the obligated prayer we say Allah and in traveling when we board any vehicle any plane any car Etc Dua which a prophet has said that subhanallah so these were just a few samples of the authentic duas from the Quran and they say Hadith"
