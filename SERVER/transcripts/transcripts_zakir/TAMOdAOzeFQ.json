  "transcript": "my name is ahmad this question just come to my mind about unity in the muslim ummah i'm referring it to a on a wider and global scale before that i'd like to mention that uh excuse me sir can you just move a little further from the mic yes that's good uh i would like to mention for more than 1000 years the muslim ummah were united under one nation and one leadership one nation is the daola islamia until 1924. 1934 was the time when the year when the last muslim omaha came down that was the daola osmania after 1924 the muslim community separated and divided into more than 40 40 small and weak countries with more than 100 more than 40 leaders so my question is is it time for the muslim community now to work towards [Music] i mean building one nation for example from morocco to indonesia under one leadership to get the real unity the question that the khilafah the last khilafah we had for islam and turkey which was by the enemies of islam they got together and they had abolished and they were protests throughout the muslim ummah in 1924 and you forgot to mention there was a pact there was a pact by the minis of islam which made with ataturk that for 100 years they cannot claim and that hundred years is going to end in the next five years i think it's 1923 it's not 1924. so 2023 or 2024 after five years this pact between the enemies of islam and of turkey is going to end and we have one bold muslim leader the erdogan who's fighting with the odds and alhamdulillah we pray to allah that may allah support him and the full world is against him they tried a coup to remove him allah helped him alhamdulillah and he's fighting against the western world being in europe that there is any change from the prime ministership to presidential ship and he won that and we leave it in the hands of allah subhanahu wa we pray for him inshallah life the muslim is again united in one banner but the problem is most of the muslim countries would not want to be under one man the problem is a muslim if all the muslims today two billion muslims unite under one they will start thinking if he becomes the leader where will my seed go so i don't think so unfortunately the muslim countries will agree but if they agree and are coming they can come and discuss common not that anyone wants to take away your your power even if they take away your power and give you jannah in in return that's a very good bargain but the problem is how many muslim politicians in the world they care for jannah how many i don't know maybe you can count on your fingertips very few so i pray to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that the enemies of islam are joining together and many of our muslims are helping the enemies to attack the muslims what more do you want what can you do this is the state our beloved prophet had predicted he prayed we at least number one what you should do is see to it that you i should see that i myself am i following the quran sunnah allah will not question me on the khalafa way and i am not responsible for it first allah will question me am i following or not yes if i am someone who can really make a difference allah will question but first i should see that am i doing my ferraris or not my salah my zakat my son my dawah my good deeds am i honest or not i should not be corrupt i should not be dishonest i should be loving all these things if everyone takes care about that inshallah though become better but the problem is we don't read the quran in sunnah with understanding and anyone who follows quran and sunnah you say the person is backward who is more forward than our beloved prophet muhammad i don't know anyone who's more modern than the beloved prophet muhammad so we pray to allah subscribe the times of of akhara the signs of there are minus signs there are major signs minor signs many have come the last final messenger came then insha'allah salaam will come then media salaam will come the prophet has given bashar that those people who support mainland they will be given hash level in jannah and then there will be a fight then there will be a war then again khilafat will be restated inshallah i feel whether we live or not we don't know it will come what we should do presently is we should see to it that we do our duty with what allah and his rasoolallah told us that is number one your personal then your society then the higher level and inshallah inshallah as long as we stick to quran in sunnah we keep on following it we keep on propagating it inshallah inshallah allah doesn't require you and me or any politician to make his deen privilege allah doesn't require anyone allah doesn't require to make his deen prevail i mean the rubbish that we are allah is going to make his deen prevail and it will happen the quran has said that we only pray to allah that may he make us instrumental so that we can jannah easily hope to answer the question"
