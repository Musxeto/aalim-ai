  "title": "Is Fasting Compulsory during Quarantine for COVID 19? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Muhammad Sharif I am an Indian from Sharjah we have five people who stay together in a room one of my roommates has been tested positive for Corvette 19. he has changed his room already hence before a living in current time is it compulsory for us to fast in such a scenario if you're in quarantine because somebody else had covid-19 current time means you seclude yourself so that you don't infect others that doesn't mean that you're sick it's as a precaution so if you are in quarantine fasting is yet first for you even if you are sick because people who are covet positive also many of them are symptomless and 85 percent have mild symptoms and this will not prevent you from fasting so if you are sick and that sickness doesn't prevent you from fasting or does not obstruct you from keeping the father you should fast if you are sick and that sickness prevents you for fasting or you have difficulty in fasting then as Quran says in Surah bakra chapter 2 was 184 that those who are sick they can fast later on after Ramadan they can compensate for it but in this case you are not sick you are only in quarantine fasting is the first for you if you happen to get sick and if that sickness prevents you from fasting or makes it difficult for you to fast in this condition yes you can fast later on you can compensate for the first fast or from none later on"
