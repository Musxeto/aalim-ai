  "title": "If Vedas are Most Authentic Hindu Scriptures, then why did you quote Kalki Purana for the Prophecy..",
  "transcript": "i am rama goda from bangalore i'm an engineer but publishing a magazine called sudra shakti i do agree with dr jackie nayek as far as his thoughts are concerned as far as one god is concerned but we shall said the reformers of hinduism have given stress on believing vedas not on puranas if that is so can we agree with kalki as an avatara and second question i will come i will come with another two questions if kalki purana and your version of kalki could bring peace with the two religions in india all right give lot of publicity to it and try to win over the people second thing is you said the hindu is you quoted in vedas and a friend of mine also posed a question the in vedas are not allowed to be read by all is the fact among hindus there are four varanas except brahmins the other three varanas are not allowed to read only the kshatriyas and vaishas can hear but sudras are never allowed to read with us they had no access to vedas so what is hinduism therefore can you can you call can you say that shudras are also please ask one question at a time the brother asked questions i do agree with the second question i didn't answer not because i did not know the answer i gave the first answer ask one question at a time you can ask the second question no problem i'm here my flight is 4 30 in the morning one question at a time man i'll be my pleasure if i don't know i will tell you i don't know the brother asked two questions and i gave the first answer and when i sat down i realized no i forgot i'm a human being i'm not a computer so the second question after i sat down i realized i didn't answer thank you for reminding your main question first question you said that the hindu reformers said don't follow puranas only follow vedas so why have i quoted kalki purana if i leave it out what will happen brother towards the end of my talk i told you very clearly that i have quoted vedas as well as the other hindu scriptures even if you remove from my talk all the quotation of all the other scriptures besides the veda my talk would be the same i am talking about the last and final messenger not only from the puranas not only from kalki purana i gave so many references from vedas i think you didn't do if you want i can repeat it do you want me to repeat right book number one number thirteen verse number three right book number one him number eighteen verse number nine rig ways book number one hymn number 142 tens and hundreds of quotation only from veda talking about prophet muhammad allah i told you in my talk that even if you remove kalki purana remove yet there is narashansa there is kaurama there is all four prophecies i mentioned my talk only few limited time you understand whether so even if you remove kalki purana yet there will be peace by only following with us this believes in ta'ala come to common terms i have been asking you i know many hindus respect the bhagavad-gita respect purana therefore i quoted quran and bhagavad-gita even if you remove quran and bhagavad-gita there is jihad even in rigveda there's jihad in rigveda and there are many things so even if you quote ved my talk would be majority would be the same hope that's the question now coming to your with the other brother post that why in hinduism only certain people are allowed to read the scripture others aren't and you're right that brahmans are allowed to read and shut they are allowed to listen and shudras are not ashudra hindus according to vedas almighty god he created from his head the brahmins the learned class from his chest the shattered warrior cast from his thighs or stomach he created the vaisyas the business class from the feet he created the shudras so this is the caste system which is then hinduism which i don't agree with even the reformers raja ram monroy he disagrees with justice rana he disagrees humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided into nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other not that you shall despise each other and the most honor on the sight of allah is the person who has taqwa the criteria for judgment is not caste it's not color it's not wealth it's not sex but it is taqwa it is god consciousness it is righteousness it is piety allah says in the quran in surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 17 we have honored all the children of adam whether you're born in a hindu family or christian family or muslim family if you're a bani adam if you're a human being you have been honored in islam all human beings are equal the only way you can be superior is by taqwa it's by god consciousness it's by piety it's by righteousness so i disagree with this concept what i believe and there are many scholars who say this has been cooperated so that the higher class the brahmins could rule what they came in the philosophy you sudra you if you serve me better in the next life you'll become a good person but this life you serve me so this i believe is not the word of almighty god that's the reason reformers of hinduism they spoke against this caste system against brahmanism shatterism so according to me if you analyze this caste system is wrong and the religious scripture should be read by anyone whether rich or poor whether businessman whether warrior whether king because this is a book of the creator almighty god and everyone should know what our creator wants us to do hope to answer the [Applause] question you"
