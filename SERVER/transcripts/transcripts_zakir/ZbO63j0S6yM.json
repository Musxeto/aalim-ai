  "title": "Can a Muslim Donate Blood while Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I'm sure that you drew on your uh knowledge as a medical doctor as well as a doctor of the human soul then it's very useful indeed not a dissimilar question in a way but um this time it's regarding whether a person can donate something from his body donate blood in this case is that loud during the fast when a person donates blood it's somewhat like cupping cupping means removing blood from the body to the surface either by sucking or by cupping it is somewhat similar as far as this is concerned there is difference opinion among the scholars can you donate blood or is cupping Allowed by fasting or can a person come this is Hadith which is mentioned in Sunnah without worry number two in the book of fasting Hadith number two three six four where a beloved Prophet Muslim said anyone who cups and gets cupped they break the fast is the person who cups and a person who gets cupped breaks the fast but there's also another Hadith volume number three in the book of fasting fight number 1938 where it's mentioned that Muhammad sallam was cupped while fasting but because of these two hadees the difference opinion in the scholars there's one group of Scholars who say that because that the person who gets cupped and the person who cups he breaks the fast cupping is prohibited blood donation is privated is an action the first Hadith is a commandment so when a commandment in action if it touches the Commandment has got more value So based on this there is a group of Scholars that say that blood donation is Haram amongst these Scholars we have him we have Sheikh binbas who says that cupping and blood donation is Haram foreign that if a person donates blood it's like cupping therefore but if it does it to save somebody's life it is permissible but yet it breaks the fast and he has to make up for that fast later on you know there's another group of Scholars he says that the earlier hadees of Abu dawood it has been abrogated by the Hadith of Sai buhari therefore cupping is allowed and donating blood to the Lord so the second group of Scholars would say donating blood is allowed and cupping in the loud oil fasting and does not break the fast so there's another group of Scholars who say that blood donating does not break the fast So based on this there are some Scholars who say it's makharu some Scholars say that if there's such a large difference of opinion so if has to be done avoid it and do it after Sunset so we have a difference opinion as far as blood donation is concerned but I filed the other things are concerned for example if there's a small bleeding due to any injury that does not break the fast there's no difference opinions or if you take blood only for testing a few mL of blood is removed from the body for testing it does not break the fast or an injury and a cut the blood comes out doesn't break the fast or if it's a nosebleed or building of nose it doesn't break the fast or if it's a minor surgery very little blood flows out it doesn't break the fast if excessive blood flows out in the blood surgery which is equivalent to blood donation then it breaks the fast so as far as the second part is concerned about blood taking or for testing nosebleed or minor bleeding there is no difference opinion all of them aggregate this does not break the fast"
