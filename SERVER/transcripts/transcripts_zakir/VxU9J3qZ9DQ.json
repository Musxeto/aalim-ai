  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum my name is ludovic bonilla i am french non-muslim and i am traveling eight months in india i am 18 years old i compiled my 12 in june and so inshallah if you agree i will meet you in private but now i just would like to ask you about the jews maybe if i am not wrong you said that it is written the quran that jews and parents are the strength strong enemies of believers muslim believers muslim and i would like to know how this verse can favorize peace in a human kind when we see the troubles between palestine and israel how some muslim and some jews can cannot be cannot misunderstand this verse because maybe it can provoke it can provoke some misinterpretation if it's little early that jews and muslim have to be enemies brothers are a good question that he said i said in my speech and according to the verse of the quran of surah maidah chapter 5 verse 32 it says that strongest in enmity to the muslims would be the jews and the pagans and the closest in love would be the christians so if they wanted to create enmity when they say that the jews and the muslims should fight the quran doesn't say jews and the muslims should fight the quran says strongest enmity to the muslims to the believers will be choose it does not say that muslims should fight with the jews it doesn't say that but it says that the jews by nature as a whole they'll be against muslims and i told in my lecture there are many jews who accept islam there are many jews of good to muslims but as a whole as a whole if you take jews as a whole and the christian as a whole the christians are closer than the jews as a whole this is a fact for example the quran says that the jews are intelligent also so that's a fact if the intelligence is intelligent that doesn't mean that it hides the fact and the quran also says that they will be as a whole a staunchest enemy so this is one of the fortification test that today if you want to prove the quran wrong if the jews the jews get together all of them and they decide let's put the quran wrong at least for three four years we will be better than the christians let's stop the war of palestine you know the palestinians the jews were kicked out by hitler hitler instincted six million jews he kicked them out of germany the arabs the palestinians they do ellen was island come with open arms after a few years they are kicked out of the home imagine someone gives a traveler his home to live and the traveler kicks him out of his home and he's shouting that he has taken my house and you're calling them terrorists so what they have to do is let's get together and solve this problem one of the problem is not forever few years four five years only and the problem is so we aren't telling that the muslims should fight with the jews in fact the quran says even if your enemy wants me several places even if they come to fight you it's mentioned sorry and fall in the battle if they want peace give it to them so quran is always for peace quran is always encouraging but if a person does not want peace to prevail what can we do islam is a religion of peace it wants peace but he will mention facts that means we have to be careful of the jews not that you have to fight them unless they come and fight with you that's a different thing imagine what's happening palestine what's happening in other parts of the world so brother for peace to prevail you have to follow the guidance of the quran and live harmoniously rather than be enemies the quran doesn't say the jews should be enemies but they will be saying hope they answer the question"
