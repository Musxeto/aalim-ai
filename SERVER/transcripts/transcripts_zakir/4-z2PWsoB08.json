  "title": "I asked Dr Zakir Naik this Question before accepting Islam (I Didn't Expect This)",
  "transcript": "amazing opportunity to be here in the first place I know so to be asking this question directly live with Dr zakarnai my role model so it says to start with well I I have been ruminating on this question for a very long time now I've been studying Islam for over a year now really deeply both from the philosophical angle and also from the theological reasons because I have a background on that as a former seminarian in Hungary um it was really a handling one for me but I think uh some of your videos changed some of the ways I deceived both Christianity and Islam and today I want to ask I think my final question and that's the reason why I have to fly all the way to be able to see you and ask this question [Applause] how do we reconcile the idea that Jesus Christ has a divine nature and the idea that he is just a prophet because one he was born without human intervention and two he somewhat uh behaved as if he was uh he was a god somehow the Bible he read all the part of the Bible you will notice this sort of divine kind of stuff you know recording the Bible that just like you pointed out the Bible has some very great Downs in them like for example in it sorry I personally recorded about 300 contradictions in the Bible alone 300 contradictions from the Bible and that was the first time I ever did so currency of obviously your teachings you know so I also read about the history of the Bible and discovered that for the first 300 years of Christianity there was nothing like the Bible the Bible as we have it today it's a compilation of over of 300 different books or latest with different people and Adventure decided to choose about self-discipline for us because of a conflict and decided executive about Pope Damascus the two the second that this book today is remarkable so those who died 300 years before that's canonization of the scriptures ever knew awarded by divorce that is quite evidence because it's like it's looking at where they do not believe in the 77 books so I wanted to address that particular thought for me right because I have I could reconcile the acting of Jesus Christ as a God and he's prophethood thank you [Applause] Brother Joseph he had done a lot of research on Islam for the last for the last one year and he gave a packet on about how he read about the Bible and how it was the compilation and the control of me she's talking about the G25 uh see but the basic question was that how do you reconcile the concept of Jesus be upon him that he is divine and is a prophet at the same time that means how can a person be called and man at the same time as far as logically speaking logically self-secondologic and then we come to Jesus logically they are two opposites can we have a tall short man English [Laughter] it is meaningless you can have a man can you a fat human either fat man either middle man you can't affect him so the qualities of God and human beings are opposite God is Immortal human being is a person is Immortal and Mortal at the same time so can you have a person who has no beginning at the same time can you yes or no no no at the same time it is meaningless it is meaningless so God man a person having qualities of God and man is meaningless because God is Immortal human me is mortal God requires no sleep you will need require sleep and rest God doesn't require to eat human beings required to eat so if you analyze anyone any logical person will not agree God man you can say godly man yes a man who follows the teaching of God no problem God will remain possible that who is Messenger of God that God man impossible so anyone who says government a man having qualities of God it's impossible it's meaningless and if someone says that almighty God became a human being even if you agree become a human being if he can then you and I will become God right so if you say God became human being hypothetically aggravity was sake of argument can the women possible if he becomes completely human being how can you become God through something called as anthropomorphism foreign almighty God becoming a human being anthropomorphism and somewhat anthropomorphism is a philosophy that God became human being in some religion once some 12 some 20 some moons and in tourism 350 million times 350 million times 33 crores so number one God can never God will never become a human being if you become the human being he cannot become God so liturgically it's not possible at all is that clear it's not coming to your concept how can we reconcile that the quality of Jesus Christ peace be upon him some quality The Godly some are like a human being let us analyze which qualities of God the Christians assume to be divine and one you rightly said that he was born without any better Dimension so one of the reasons that Christians say that Jesus kept his God is because he had no father so they replied to this question is given in the Quran in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse number 49 Allah says that the similitude of Adam is same as that of Jesus the symmetry of Jesus is same like that of Adam he would create some dust and said beard it was that means if you say Jesus is God because he has no father then according to the Bible Adam peace be upon him and no mother and no father he becomes ahead of God correct if you say a person has no father becomes God then Adam please be upon him and my father the Quran says that let me say that so that means you have to say Adam is a bigger word and the Christian will say yeah that means both were not God these were miracles of god without further the example is of God messenger of God means almighty God Jesus and man amongst men and communicates with him on a higher level which we call as prophets of God oh I believe this one God a new villages yes I do believe now that Jesus is not God foreign not mining time will be done so everywhere in the Bible is very clear it is the Christian missionaries and the church which manipulate them say oh he's very humbled through God is the greatest with this yesterday so let us understand that Jesus Christ people who was very unequipped that he was not taught he was very uncloged that he was not God but he was a messenger of God not mine will but time will be done so everywhere in the Bible is very clear but the church manipulates and tries to mislead the followers so that they get an ulterior benefit so it's very clear that in my reading of the Bible and if you read Bible with the open mind that no weight of Jesus Christ peace before includivity but that does not mean that we disagree with Jesus we believe a Heroes so Christians are together only thing what we say he never can be ready"
