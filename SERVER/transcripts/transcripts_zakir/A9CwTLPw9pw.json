  "transcript": "i have always been a man of peace and that's what the quran stands for it has been my mission to spread peace throughout the world unfortunately i face detectives who prevent me from carrying out my mission about 10 days ago after my successful lecture tour to clan tan in which in the last day on 9th of august i gave a talk on islamophobia in the sultan mohammed for stadium at karabarrow in which more than 100 000 people attended the talk this success could not be digested by the detectors since the last few days i've been accused of causing racial discord in the country and my detractors have been quoting selective sentence of mind out of context and adding strange fabrications to it i have clarified my stance today to the police it however sirens me that this complete episode has caused many non-muslims to think that i am a racist it has worried me that those who were hurt have not heard my speech and have relied and based the impression on out of context quotes of mine it is a further concern for me that this creates a bad image for islam and it may drive many people away from islam racism is an evil i am staunchly against as is the quran and it is exactly opposite of what i stand for as an islamic preacher our beloved prophet muslim said in his favorite pilgrimage no arab is superior to a non-arab neither is a non-arab superior to an arab a white person is not superior to a black neither is a black person superior to a white and allah says in the glorious quran in surah chapter number 49 verse number 13 o humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of allah is the person who has taqwa that is called consciousness that is righteousness that is piety even though i have clarified myself i feel i owe an apology to everyone who's feeling your hurt because of this misunderstanding i do not want anyone to harbor ill feelings for me it was never my intention to upset any individual or any community it is against the basic tenants of islam and i would like to convey my heartful apologies for this misunderstanding at the same time it's my humble appeal to all of you especially the non-muslims please take out time to hear my speeches in the entirety my lectures are available on the youtube the beach tv as well as the peace tv mobile app last but not the least i was deeply touched by the hundreds of thousands of people who stood in my support i would like to express my earnest gratitude to all of you may allah reward you with the best"
