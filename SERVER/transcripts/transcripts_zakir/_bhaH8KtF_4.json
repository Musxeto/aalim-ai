  "transcript": "dr zakir is it permissible for one who is unable to fast to feed one person for 30 days or 30 people in one day as far as fidya for a person who can't fast or is unable to fast the quran says chapter number 2 verse number 184 that if a person finds it difficult to keep the fast or find fasting with hardship then again either fast or he can feed one individual person for every fast that he has missed so if a person who misses the full month of ramadan for example and if you have to give fidya he has both the options open he either calls 30 people and feeds them together so that compensates or gives fidhya for all the 30 days that the person has missed or he can even give one person fidya for 30 days and each person should be given one sa of the staple food of the state of that country one side equal to one and a half kilograms approximately and both rulings are there as it's mentioned in the ruling of ibn abbas in stay buhari number six number 4505 in commentary of this verse of the quran chapter 2 verse 184 it says that those people who find it difficult to fulfill the fast to complete the fast they either complete it or feed one indigent person and it says that these type of people described are very old men and women or those people who have permanent disability or they have a disease which makes them difficult to fast and both tips for fast as is given in the hadith of one of the sabbah's by the name of and has been malik my life pleased with him when he was old the hadith says that he cooked some food and called 30 people and fed them together the full food there for the full month of ramadan so here it shows that you can either get cooked food cook food for them and feed them well whether it be breakfast whether it be dinner whatever it is or the other option is as is also agreed upon by imam humble imam shafi as well as some of the malikis that you can also give uncooked food to one person for 30 days one person only gave him uncooked food for 30 days so that that competencies are give the feed there for the full month this is also great so the choice is always either feed one person for 30 days or 30 people for one day okay fine thank you"
