  "transcript": "and there is another misconception as far as the word jihad is concerned most of the people think muslim non-muslim alike that jihad can only be done by muslims in fact there are verses in the quran in which almighty god says that even the non-muslims they did jihad the quran says in israel chapter 31 verse number 14 that we have enjoined on the human beings to be kind to the parents in travail upon travail did the motherboard them and in years twain was the weaning the next verse surah luqman chapter 31 verse number 15 says that but if they strive but if your parents strive to force you to worship someone else besides me besides almighty god of which you have no knowledge then do not obey them here the quran says that if your parents strive they struggle they do jihad to make you worship somebody else besides almighty god do not obey them so the quran says that the non-muslim to jihad the same message repeated in surah an kabut chapter number 29 verse number 8 that we have enjoined on the human being to be kind to the parents but if they strive to do jihad and force you to worship anyone besides me besides almighty god of which you have no knowledge then do not obey them but live with them in compassion and love so here we come to know from the quran that even the non-muslim did jihad further mention the quran in foreign chapter number 4 verse number 76 that the believers they fight in the way of allah and the unbelievers they fight in the way of the satan so strive against the brothers of the satan here again it speaks that the evil people even they do jihad so jihad is an arabic word which merely means to strive to struggle in context they strive in the way of allah it is called as jihad fisabilillah and the evil people they strive in the way of the satan it is called as jihadism shaytan so jihad is of two type good jihad and bad jihad also striving for the good cause striving for an evil cause but in the islamic context if it is not specified it is taken for granted that the jihad is for a good cause it is jihad in the way of allah subhana wa unless specified it's taken for granted that whenever jihad is mentioned it means jihadis of allah"
