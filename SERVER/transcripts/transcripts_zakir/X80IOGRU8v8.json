  "title": "Is not God Unfair to one who dies Earlier as compared to the one who dies Later as he gets less time",
  "transcript": "question from yunus e from Holland I have washed almost all your videos and debates I am a big fan of you and inshallah one day I will become like you inshallah inshallah someone dies at the age of 20 and while some at the age of 60. is it not unfair for the one who died at 20 because the one who died at 60 had more time to receive hasanath it's a good question brother that if there are two people one person dies at the age of 21 percent dies at the age of 60 isn't it unfair for the person who died at the age of 20 that he had less chances of doing good deeds and getting hasanath the same thing can be posed in another way that isn't it unfair for the person at the age of 60 that he died after so many years he were distracted by the devil for a longer time by the shaytan and at more time of doing evil as compared to the person who died at the age of 20. brother depends upon the perspective how you're looking at it whether that age of 20 or 60 I do agree with you there are chances of the Good Deeds if you live longer but there's a chance of being bad did also you may not know that the person that they did he was very good on the straight path later on the devots and at the age of 60. he started doing things again so it is not depending upon how long you live it is how well you live is important when you have an examination you study for the full year some papers are only for one hour and the full Year's test is taken by the teacher in one hour some examination paper are for three hours some examination paper or two parts part one three years part two three hours irrespective of that depending upon the type of question asked the judgment is given for the full year similarly whether you live for 20 years or 60 years Allah again he had knowledge of the future for him to test the person he can test even in one minute what you cannot test in maybe 80 years he can test in one minute for Life very easy so according to me it doesn't make a difference whether the test was for 20 years or for 60 years and it is not the advantage neither disadvantage it is one type of a test So based on what you have how well you lead is important rather than the time so it is not unfair at all it is not unjust at all it is pros and cons depends upon it and Allah is the best to judge he's the most wise he knows how to judge and on the day of judgment no human being will ever complain to Allah they'll only say that please forgive us Allah will say it's too late so the justice of Allah is so accurate Allah says in the Quran Surah chapter 4 40 Allah is not unjust in the least degree hope that's the question"
