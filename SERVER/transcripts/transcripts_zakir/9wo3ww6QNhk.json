  "title": "Why speak about similarities and not Differences between Religions? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "came from nagpur I want to ask you one question about Vedas because I believe Vedas are main scripture of Hinduism so I want to know if you are telling or putting a common point which is similar to other scripture why you do not put different points in front of non-muslim people which are contradictable or which are opposite to each other because I believe in common Point as a being a Hindu girl it is very important to know which are the common point and which are the different points in Hinduism scriptures question she said that I quoted The Vedas I did point out similarities why don't I speak about differences and she wants to know the similarities as a difference a sister if I can give a talk on similarities between Islam and Hinduism for a few hours I can give a bigger talk and a longer talk on differences between Islam and Hinduism but the reason I chose to speak about similarities because that is the advice given by my create Allah in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter 3 verse number 64 which says come to Common terms has been us and you which is the first term Allah that we worship none but Allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and Peters other than Allah foreign this verse of the Quran shows as a way how to speak with different kinds of people come to come in terms as in us and you which is the first term the most important term is Allah that we worship none but one almighty God regarding differences sister I can give a talk for us together about differences not that I can't but it will bring animosity maybe it will hurt the feelings of someone that we may be forced to do during a debate when they're the debate for example I had a debate with the person by the name of Dr William Campbell did you heard the talk sister yeah I have seen your videos so that talk was talking about differences between Christianity and Islam why he wrote a book saying there are 30 scientific errors in the Quran and for eight years no muslim replied in USA it became a hot seller so the students of us they called me and we had a dialogue the topic was Quran and Bible in the light of science whatever allegations they had against the Quran I replied to all I posed 38 points from the Bible which is again science he could not reply to any so in a debate I may have to do that if I have a debate with Hindus scholar who says that Vedas are completely with science so then I can talk about the unscientific things but if I talk about differences maybe you may feel offended so if you want to go on a higher level you can ask queries at irf will give you all the things but in public I personally don't want to talk about contradiction unless someone forces me not that we aren't aware but if you know the similarity what I'm telling you let us agree to follow what is common so what I tell the people what is common in The Vedas in the Bible in the Quran let everyone agree that at least one book is the word of God Hindus will say whether the word of God Christians will say Bible is the word of God Muslim will say the Quran is the word of God I tell them a thing which everyone wouldn't mind agreeing let us agree to follow what is common so when you follow the commonalities in The Vedas in the Bible in the Jewish scriptures talmud in the Quran we find all the scriptures say there's one God all the scripture says the last and final Messengers Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so I am asking you sister why don't you believe in one God I want to ask you the question the sister do you believe there's one God I believe in one God do you believe and do you believe sister that the last and final Messengers prophet Muhammed peace be upon him just because I am asking you the question because it is very difficult to understand uh Quran and Vedas and I am so much confused which uh scripture is more important for me to achieve to the God I mean to worship have you heard my lecture on similarities between Islam and Hinduism or Mumbai in the Hindu scriptures have you heard that yeah I have heard do you know that your scriptures say that the last and find Messengers prophet Muhammed peace be upon him yeah do you know that yeah so do you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God yeah definitely do you believe yeah so if you believe there's one God and you believe that idol worship is prohibited and if you believe that Prophet Muhammad is the last messenger in Arabic we call you as a Muslim sister do you believe in one God yeah I believe in one God do you believe that no idle worship do you believe that almighty God has got no images yeah you believe that yeah and you also believe that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God so what you have entered you may not have gone very high but by saying this there is no God but Allah and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger you indirectly become a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits civil to God so do you submit her but I am indirectly Muslim no if Vedas telling the same thing and Quran telling the same thing so which if you're indirect also no problem indirect also most welcome whether you come direct or indirect we welcome you sister now you know what is coming now if your Veda says that the last and final Messengers Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and you have to follow him so by following Prophet Muhammad you're indirectly following The Vedas also then you have to find out what did Prophet Muhammad say then you have to read the hadees but slowly slowly so now your Nursery then Junior kg then Senior kg then first standard then you'll reached under 10. but have you taken admission I want to know that do you agree that you're a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits his or her will to God why it is important that the person who are believing in one God he is called or she is called a Muslim yeah Muslim means a person who submits civil to God and the first important Creed to submit your will to God is believe there's one God believe there is no idle worship and belief Prophet Muhammad is the messenger if you say this that means you have agreed to submit and then it takes time then you go to standard one then slowly you may know what is required about fasting about charity not to Rob not to still all this comes there but do you agree to submit your will is important and do you agree to follow the teachings of prophet Muhammad is important to ask your sister yeah I agree so would you like to say the Shada Shada would you like to say in Arabic that there is no God but one God and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger foreign [Applause] you know what you have said is the same thing but I want to ask you sister is anyone forcing you to say this no no one is there not putting pressure no it is completely out of a free will yeah okay say in Arabic just repeat it a shadow Allah Allah I bear Witness I bear Witness I bear witness that there is no God that there is no God but Allah but Allah and Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him peace be upon Him is the servant is the servant and messenger of Allah and messenger of Allah masha'allah thank you I congratulate you sister now we have entered the fall of Islam and inshallah for getting more knowledge for going to first standard second standard third standard be in touch with the sisters of the Islamic Research Foundation and it will be a pleasure to guide you and if you have any queries regarding Quran regarding Islam you're most welcome to ask if you have any queries even regarding Hinduism yeah Etc most welcome sister and I pray to Allah that may gun to jannah's sister [Applause]"
