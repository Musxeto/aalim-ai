  "transcript": "next point if you like regarding the situation of a disabled person why is it a disabled person has to pay a ransom due to the fact they haven't fasted Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 184 that if it is difficult for a person to fast he can either fast or pay Ransom that is feeding of an indent person or a poor person the reason is that if a person is disabled or if he sick permanently and there are no signs that he will become healthy where he can observe fast so the question of him compensating or the question for him to keep the fast later on doesn't Arise at all so that's the reason for him there is a ransom that he has to pay something that is equivalent to feeding an Indigent person or feed indent person for every fast that he has missed"
