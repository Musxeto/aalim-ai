  "title": "Does Islam Permit Donating Organs after Death? What Islam says about Atheists? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is ramakrishnan i'm a software engineer i have two questions for you the first is what does islam say about donating organs after death is it okay or is it prohibited second question is what does islam say about atheists that's it the brother has two questions i think non-muslims asking too no problem the first question is what does islam say about donating organs second question is about atheist as far as the first question is concerned what does islam say or donating organs there is no direct verse in the quran or any say hadith which says whether organs can be donated or not but the various conferences that are held in saudi arabia and malaysia and various different parts of the world and the scholars have come to common consensus that if three things are fulfilled then organs can be donated number one the person who requires an organ but natural it should be a major benefit to his health he can receive organ as long as it's obvious the benefit or saves his life point number two the person donating the organ after he donates organ it should not be a major loss to his health for example if i donate my heart i will die so i can't do it my heart but the doctors say that out of two kidneys present a person can even survive with one kidney so if my mother has a kidney failure both the kidneys have failed i can very well donate my one kidney to my mother even she lives when i live but naturally after a person dies if he wants to donate any other organ that is permissible but if he's alive he should not donate any part of the body which will cause a major damage to his health or a loss of life and the third criteria is it should not be for money no one should sell organ if all these three conditions are fulfilled then organ donation very well can be done as far as the second question is concerned what does islam have to say about atheists as far as i'm concerned whenever i meet an atheist are you an atheist brother he said no whenever i meet an atheist the first thing i do is i congratulate that atheist people may wonder that why is zakir congratulations the reason i'm congratulating atheists is because most of the human beings they usually do blind belief he's a hindu her father is hindu he's a christian father is a christian many muslims are muslim because father is muslim now this atheist he's thinking he may be coming from a religious background his father may be pious but he does not believe that how can they be a god who requires to eat a god who can die a god who can lie so the reason i conquered the atheist is because he has said the first part of the islamic shahada islamic creed that there is no god the only thing i have to do is which i shall do inshallah so half my job is done to a non-muslim who believes in some other god first i have to prove to him that the god is worshiping is wrong and after i prove to him that the god is worshiping is wrong then i have to prove to him about the correct god here the atheist half my job is done he already agrees in the first part of the islamic shahada there is no god the only thing i have to do is allah which i shall do inshallah the first question asked to the atheists that what is the definition of god if anyone says there's no god to say there is no god he should know the definition of god if he does not know the definition of god he cannot say there is no god for example if i say this is a pen is this a pen no it's a book to say this is not a pen you should know the definition of pen some people say no luck i know this is the book so i can't say it's not a pen i said no if you know the definition of pen i will say is this a kitab you say no it is not akita because in the definition of kitab to say it's not a kitab you should know the definition of kitab because kitab and book is the same so to say it is not a pen you have to know the definition of pen you may or may not know the definition of a book correct so similarly to say there is no god you should know the definition of god so now this person is atheist he's believing so that god he requires to eat he can lie he fights and he loses he does not believe in a god so i say when i don't believe in such a god then i tell to him the correct concept of god and the correct concept of god is mentioned surah class chapter 112 verses one to four which i shall discuss in the last day of the conference inshallah that is on 20th of january so what he's doing he is rejecting the false god then i asked the question to the atheist that if suppose there is equipment which is brought in front of you who no one in the world has ever seen no one knows about it and if i ask the question that who will be the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of their equipment the atheists will tell the first person who will tell the mechanism of this equipment who no one in the world is seen it is the creator some may say the manufacturer some may say the inventor some will say the person who has made it maker he may say creator maker inventor manufacturer whatever he says it will be somewhat similar don't grapple with the words what he says accept it then ask him then repeat the lecture which i gave which i don't interview that how did the universe come into existence so he will tell about the big bang then i'll tell him that when did you come to know he will tell you in 1973 yesterday in science 30 years back 40 years back i will say what you are talking about the big bang you came to know 30 years back is mentioned in the quran 1400 years ago who could have mentioned it even say maybe it's a flock don't argue with him continue what's the shape of the earth he will tell you previously people thought it's flat now we know it's spherical when you come to know he will tell you 1577 when it's a francis drake sailed around the earth men 300 years back 400 years back 450 years back the quran mentions 14 years ago who could have mentioned it he will say oh maybe a prophet muhammad peace be upon him he was intelligent man don't argue continue light of the moon is its own reflected light he will tell you previously we thought light of the moon was its own light recently we have come to know a couple of hundred years back it's reflected light it's mentioned in the quran surah khan chapter 25 verse 61 light of the moon is reflected 14 years back who could have mentioned it now we'll pause don't wait for the answer continue in school i was taught that the sun was stationary it did not rotate about its axis either mention the quran i said no that's what i learned in school but the quran says the sun and the moon rotate which we have come to recently in school 25 years back i was told the sun did not rotate the quran says 14 years back that the sun rotates which signs are discovered today who could have mentioned that there will be a pause don't wait for that i continue so all the scientific things i mentioned in my talk after each scientific fact asked him who could have mentioned it before and finally he will tell the creator the manufacturer the inventor the maker this creator this manufacturer this producer this inventor we in islam call as allah that's the reason today science is not eliminating god it is eliminating models of god in allah therefore francis bacon a very famous philosopher he said that little knowledge of science makes you an atheist in-depth knowledge of science makes you believe in god so with this help of this lecture quran modern science you can prove the existence of god scientifically hope that answers the question"
