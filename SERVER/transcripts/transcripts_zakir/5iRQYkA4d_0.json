  "transcript": "amit i am a hindu from india how old is islam and what was before islam if only islam is the truth then how come there are hindu evidences four to seven thousand years old brother amit i know that most of the non-muslims have a misconception and some of the muslims also that islam came into existence after the birth of prophet muhammad and islam is about 1400 years old this is a misconception islam is there since time immemorial and the first prophet of islam was not prophet muhammad peace be upon him it was prophet adam peace be upon him and prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the last and final messenger and quran is not the first revelation of islam it is the last and final revelation of islam so question when how old is islam islam is there since time immemorial since time immemorial since man set foot on the earth the first human being was adam peace be upon him since that time islam is there so a second part of the question how come there is evidence of hinduism four to seven thousand years before i agree there are some evidences of hindu scriptures and there are some evidences but that doesn't mean that hinduism is older than islam islam is much older anyhow a religion becoming old does not give more authenticity the authenticity is on the scripture itself it is not based on if it's new it is more authentic if it's old it's more authentic now since it is depending upon the truth so if you analyze the quran as as quran says there were several revelations sent on the face of the earth by name only four are mentioned the torah the sabor the indeed and the quran and there were 124 000 messengers sent on the face of the earth by name only 25 are mentioned in the quran adam noah abraham moses jesus muhammad peace be upon them all so what we have to realize that if you study the scripture and you do comparative study which you can see my talks on it similarity with islam and christianity similarity islam and hinduism and if you put the test of time when we put the test of time that quran is a miracle of miracles previously it was the age of miracles and quran is the miracle of miracle then came the age of literature and poetry when the quran was revealed it was the age of literature and poetry and arabic was at its pinnacle what are the best and when the arabs when they heard the quran being recited when they read the quran they said this cannot be a human handiwork no human being can write such beautiful arabic and many accepted islam so arab quran is the best arabic literature on the face of the earth so that time was the age of rich and poetry quran prove itself today if a religious book says in a very poetic fashion the world is flat will a modern man believe in it and the answer is no today is the age of science and technology so today if you put the test of science to the religious scriptures available only al hamdulillah quran passes the test if you put the test of science to quran i've given a talk on quran and modern science compatible or incompatible and there you come to know that there is not a single verse in the glorious quran which is against established science and there are more than 6000 verses in the quran out of which more than a thousand speak about sans so if you put this test you will come to know that quran is the most authentic scripture and if you do analysis then you come to know which religion is most authentic all the other scriptures that were sent before the quran by the passage of time they changed since they were not to be fought to be followed till eternity all the messengers that came before prophet muhammad peace be upon him they were sent only for their people and that time all the scriptures that were revealed before the quran were only meant for those people at that time that's the reason allah subhanahu wa allah didn't feel it a requirement to preserve it in authentic form but the quran is the last and final revelation and allah says in the quran chapter number 15 verse number nine that we have revealed the quran and we shall guard it from corruption"
