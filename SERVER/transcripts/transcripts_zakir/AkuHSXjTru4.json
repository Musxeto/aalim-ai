  "title": "A Christian Lady Asking about Sin as a Universal Problem - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "okay my name is testimony sorry my name is testimony testimony yes sir okay so this question particularly is directed to Dr shik faric Knack during his lecture he made mention of the solutions that Islam provides to the world so now my question is sin is the particular problem that Humanity has and it is generalized the same problem that a Nigerian has which is SE same problem that someone in Finland has which is also seen But then if someone is poor it's not everyone that is poor so that's that's not the only problem but in regards to God the problem that we have is sin but in in in in life in humanity we have so many others but particularly this lecture is regarding man and God so I want us to be particular about the scene where regarding which is seen and then Sir you made you made a statement earlier that if someone can show you from the scripture um if and where God where Jesus was referred to as God you he didn't say I said that sir he didn't say that I said that no you you yes I made I made mention of you sir I beg your pardon so you said that if some if anyone here can show you from the Bible where Jesus was referenced as God you will receive me half I said anyone can show me a single and equivocal statement okay a single unambiguous statement from anywhere in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says I am God or where he says worship me I ready to accept Christianity now go me full don't go me half so sorry if you vot me half then no so sorry sir I get you yes in full I was about to I was really intending to mention everything you just said in full so now my my my my my my give now is that Jesus was not um referenced as God he's not referenced as God he's not God he's not referenced as God referenced as Son of God Son of God he's refered as the Son of God and then sir from Matthew chapter one sh please silence silence yes sir from Matthew 1 verse 21 it's it's stated there that and she shall give birth to a child and thou shall call Matthew 1 vers 21 21 sir yeah what does it say yes it says that and she shall give birth to a son and thou shall call his name Jesus for he shall save his people from their sin okay sir and again we have seen from John 3:1 15 16 17 18 He said I'm trying to paraphrase now he said that um for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish so now the first criteria is to believe in his son for salvation okay another reference I'm I'm I'm sorry sir you only G three referen you to reply that first I'll reply to those three then you can give the next one please okay sir you have given three references I'll come to my son and afterward you said that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he's not God he's Son of God yes sir sister Bible has got sons of gods by the tong Adam was Son of God Aphra was Son of God Israel was Son of God Book of Romans chapter number 8 verse number 34 all those who are led by the spirit of God they are sons of God very true so Bible says anyone who follows God is Son of God even I'm Son of God even you're daughter of God so no so what's the problem okay you are saying the Son of God came to take you away from sin every messenger of God is a Son of God I have no problem Moses was Son of God in that context Adam was Son of God Prophet Muhammad was meaning Godly person meaning taking him to the message of God even Moses peace be upon him give the message of God the the Bible says that even Prophet Muhammad gave the message of God so what is the difference I'm coming to it so I quoted the first one son of God I finish that your third one is Gospel of John and the reference is 3 vers 15 16 17 18 not it only Gospel of John chapter 3 verse number 16 only 16 no sir the explanation is in context can just pick one and then you only quoted 16 you never went to 17 okay hear me Gospel of John chapter number 3 verse number 16 said for God so I'm giving verim now verim from King James version yes verb you know you know what the meaning of verim yes I know sir what two word from which version from King James because there are thousand versions in the Bible new international New World Translation Pentecostal American Standard Version I'm quoting from King James version which is more than 50% of the Christians follow so Gospel of John chapter number 3 verse number 16 say for God so the world because the Christian say no no no no no Jesus is a normal son and they quote Gospel of John chapter number three verse number 16 for God so of the world that he gave his only begotten son begotten not made so that God so of the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not die but everlasting life now what is the meaning of the word begotten sister do you know the translation of the English word begotten got it from somebody what is the word meaning of the English word begotten you said the word I'm asking you the meaning it means Goten from something begotten your English is very good begotten means it's a lower animal function of sex beting is an animal act you open Ox for dictionary beting is an animal [Music] act that means you have sex and then you beget a son you you open English you know English open for dictionary okay sorry sir that's the reason we object we object to this ver begotten given to God so what to do so if you read the revised standard version of the king Jam version revised by th2 Scholars of the highest Eminence backed by 50 ction they say this word begotten is a interpolation is a fabrication is a concoction and they threw it out of the Bible you don't know this who threw it not Muslim Scholars not Hindu Scholars Christian Scholars 32 Christian Scholars of the highest Eminence backed by 50 different cooperating denomination you read the RSV the revised Standard Version they say this word begotten is a interpolation it's a fabrication it is not then the original manuscript so the word she's clinging to so much has been thrown out of the Bible okay sir if okay so what okay so I have another the Bible that can explain what I just said I don't I'm talking about the scholars of Christianity doctors of divinity not about you are you better than the doctors of divinity these are top Scholars of the world of the Bible so we go back to the original Romans chapter number 8 verse number 38 that whosoever is led by the spirit of God he's the son of God so if you say Jesus is son of God of course the Son of God he's a messenger of God we have no objection in that but don't say the begotten Son of God you cannot give this function to Allah subhana tala you can't give function to almighty God you cannot say that he's like an animal begetting having sex so that's the reason these Scholars who God gave them knowledge they did research and they found out this was in the side footnotes and it came into the text so they threw it out of the Bible as a concoction as a fabrication as a interpolation so if you read the revised version of the Bible it's not there okay it's been thrown out so one word you're clinging too okay sir um for God soul of the world is thrown out anyway this verse doesn't say that Jesus claimed Divinity it doesn't it doesn't qualify my challenge unequivocal statement from the bible where jesus christ peace be upon himself said I am God say worship me you haven't taken the challenge yet I after have to yet answer the first question of my son okay sir you're asking three four question you have to ask one question at a time oh I beg your sir you just firing question question question you listen to the answer so first you have to agree that what verses you quoted now is a fabrication of the Bible so you should agree this cannot prove he's God you have to agree okay so one first do you agree or not if you don't agree it's a waste of my time I'm banging my head against a a brick wall if you can't understand English it is 32 Christian Scholars you say Okay doctor I will go and do research okay no problem say that at least be like a good woman a truthful lady don't be like don't be like a person who wants to I'm quoting you from my god-given computer correct so say Dr Zak okay I will go and verify your claim no problem be at least be at least truthful in saying that rather than hiding behind something coming to your first question coming to your first question you told about my son yes sir solution to the problems of humanity sin is a universal problem your sister said I told you sin is not Universal again you're repeating according to as every child is sinless because in the scripture that for all man he gave the solution to sin also you problem of humanity the solution to sin is following the Quran not the solution to the sin is following the Quran if you did not listen to the talk what can I do therefore I told you you go on the YouTube Google shik faric Nik is Islam the solution let me complete the answer you are telling something yes okay it's okay we have taken much from you we have taken much from you I think he has first question is sin is there yes but everyone is not sinless everyone is not sinful there are many people who are sinless it's a big problem we agree what is the solution follow the Quran it is the devil it is the devil which inspires you to kill any other human being that's how terrorism come it's the devil which inspires you to Rob all these are parts of sin if you haven't heard his lecture what can I do these are types of different sins okay and the solution is following the Quran you only want to say sin is you know sin is Adam made the apple and Eve the Apple we are born in sin you are misquoting the Quran sorry the Bible you're misquoting the Bible you don't know this is the teaching of the church I'm here to talk about the Bible not about the church if the church is misguiding you and if you get misguided you to blame not me I beg your pardon sir sir I beg your pardon but that's just the reality I'm so convinced about it and I have a lot of proof so many scriptures over 20 I can you convinced with wrong not my problem you convin with things which are wrong it is your problem I don't want get convinced with wrong thing that's the difference between you and me okay so there's a statement you made earlier you said that um you're more Christian than we the Christians and you're misquoting me again if Christian means following the teachings of Jesus there's a it you know what's a caviat there is a rule if Christian means following the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him then we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves complete don't give half the quotation please if you can't remember say sorry okay I'm so sorry sir so sir it's okay it's okay sister we are taking much from thank you thank you thank thank you than you thank you please put up the mic it's okay it's okay he has had you more and then he has taken much okay fine s the last question let's give her a chance she's already had three questions we are very generous we want to even last question we don't want to ask one last question if you if I'm more Christian than the Christian then yes thank you so much sir sir welcome so sir you said also that I pray I don't misquote you this time around you said that you believe in Jesus you believe that he was sent by God and all okay but the problem is that that is not all it takes for salvation that is not all it takes for Redemption it takes believing the full gospel of Christ which is gotten from First Corinthians 15 I can't hear you slowly slowly okay you said that you believe in Jesus and you believe that he was sent by God I follow the teach true teachings of Jesus okay sir so now I'm saying that that is not a criteria for someone to be a Christian or to become a more Christian that we are already Believers following the true teachings of Jesus is not the criteria this is the basic criteria Christian means a person who follows Christ the basic number one criteria if I say Muslim I submit my will to God if I say Christian I'm following the teachings of Jesus if this is not the main criteria then I'm sorry I'm happy being Christian doesn't mean following the so do you want to follow the teachings of the devil no sir I have I'm not done sir I'm not why you saying that following the teaching of Jesus is not the main criteria that's what you said and I'm trying to prove that that is not is not correct that is correct because to be to be a follower of God to be a believer is to believe in the Full Gospel According to 1 Corinthians 15:1-4 is talk about according to I can't listen 1 Corinthians 15 verse 1-4 it talks about the gospel of Christ and what's the gospel of is the First Corinthians the words of Jesus Christ peace no the word of Paul Corinthian is not the teachings of Jesus were the word of Paul we are talking about word of Jesus peace be upon him do you know Corinthians was not written by Jesus Christ peace be on him Corinthians were written by St Paul so are you talking about Paul or are you talking about Jesus do you know your Bible very well yes I do know my Bible who's the author who's the author of Corinthians sir from who is the author of Corinthians Sir Paul is the author of Corinthians it's not Jesus sir and Paul was not even a disciple of Jesus CH PA is a self-appointed disciple he not even the disciple of Jesus Christ I your pardon let me explain sir I have expl I don't want to explain I know my I know the Bible very well I don't learn from you I know can you have the next question please thank you can we have the next question"
