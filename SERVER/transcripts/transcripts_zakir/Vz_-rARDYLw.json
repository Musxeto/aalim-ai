  "title": "Reading Unauthentic Duâ€™a on Breaking the Fast - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the fourth common error in this category is that many Muslims they read unauthentic Dua during the most authentic Dua as far Asar is concerned is inshallah which means that my thirst is quenched the veins are moistened and the a is near inshallah God willing the reward is near God willing and some people when they read this Dua for breaking the fast they say it before breaking the fast before they put their date in the mouth they say this and it's contrary to the meaning the meaning says that my thirst has been quenched my thirst has been quenched and the veins have been moistened your thirst cannot be quenched before breaking the fast so normally it should be said after you eat the k after you have water and you're satisfied maybe after some minutes after you break the fast then you can read this Dua inshallah which means my thirst has been quenched the wains have been moistened the reward is near inshallah God willing"
