  "title": "Why did Allah Create this Universe? Who Created Allah? What is the Meaning of Allah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is ramakrishna I'm a physiotherapist student my question is what is the need of Allah to create Adam and Eve and this total Universe what he will get from this and my second question is everything is created by someone so even God must have been created by someone what is the meaning of Allah Brothers asked three questions the first question why did God create Adam and Eve and what was his reason to create all this world and humankind upon them both so that the humankind could come there was a great great grandparents Allah says in Surah chapter number 49 verse number 13. oh humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into Nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of almighty God is the person the criteria to judge any human being it is not wealth it's not color it's not cast it's not Creed it is taqwa it is God Consciousness it is righteousness it is party so Adam and Eve peace be upon them both they were our great great grandparents of yours also and of mine also all humankind therefore I call you a brother we are brothers in humanity Allah says yeah you are Nas or humankind and Allah says in Surah chapter number 17 verse number 17 almighty God has honored all the children of Adam whether they are born in India USA UK born in the Hindu family or a Muslim family or a Christian family Allah says he has honored all the bani Adam if you are a human being Allah has honored you whether your name is now come into the question why has almighty God created the human beings Allah has killed the human beings because Allah says this is one of his best creation all the other creation of Allah they obey him we have the Angels whatever almighty God says the Angels obey him directly they have no free will the human being that the creation of Allah which has a free will we can either obey him or disobey him so Allah has created such a creation we are one of his best Christian in the best of forms but we have a choice of either obeying God or disobeying God if you be God we will go to Jannah we'll go to work we'll go to heaven if you disobey him we'll go to hell we'll go nark so this is a test for the Hereafter Allah says in Surah chapter number 67 verse number two it is Allah was created that a life to test which of you is good indeeds so this life is a test for the year after so Allah has created the human beings and Allah says chapter number 51 verse number 56 that we have created the Jinn and the men not but to worship him so we supposed to worship obey the Commandment of Allah so this is a different creation of Allah which had the Free Will of even going against Allah all the other things the Stars the trees the mountains the Quran says they do such that Allah they prostrate to him they obey him we have a free will now when Allah given a free will with the free will if you obey him we become higher than the angels with the Free Will if we disobey him we become the partners of the devil so he's created us for the test for the Hereafter coming to your second question everything has a Creator who created God if anyone says everything as the Creator it is a wrong statement every created thing as a creator the definition of God is he is uncreated the moment you say who created God he's not God the definition of God is he's uncreated suppose a person comes and asks you that brother my friend John he was admitted in the hospital he gave birth to a child can you guess was it a girl or a boy can you guess try it out this can't guess why can you own the microphone can you guess was it a girl or a boy huh see brother John he was admitted in the hospital he gave birth to a child was it a girl or a boy can you guess a 50 50 chance girl or boy people are laughing why can you guess can't guess why even if you guess can you get the answer right can you guess I'll give you two chances was it a girl or a boy try hand out girl brother can a man give birth to a child ah there you made a mistake same way you made a mistake by asking who created God a man cannot give birth to a child so where's the question of it being girl or a boy see now you understood ah now that's good brother so it was a man cannot give birth to a child so where's the question of a girl or a boy so when you're asking who created God God by definition Allah by definition is uncreated the moment you say who created Allah he's not Allah they're nothing like him coming to your last part of the question who is Allah who is Allah the best definition he can give you is chapter number 112 verse number one to four it's mentioned in the Quran says there's nothing like him this is a four line definition of Allah any human being any person says so and so candidate is God if that candidate fits in this four land definition we Muslims have got no objection in accepting that candidate as God for land definition this is the litmus test for theology for the study of God first is Allah and only Allah Allah the absolutely he begets not noise begotten than nothing like him if you go to the Hindu scriptures the same is mentioned in Hindu scriptures is mentioned chapter number six section number two verse number one God is only one without a second he has got no parents almighty God has got no father he has got no mother of that God there is no pratima there is no Idol there is no image there is no photograph there is no sculpture who says chapter number 32 verse number three same as so any person saying so and so candidate is God if that candidate fits in the four line definition we Muslims have got no objection in accepting that candidate as God for example some people say bhagava and rajnish is almighty God while doing question answer time Hindu told me we don't believe God and never said that the Hindus believe God I said some people believe bhagavadas needs to be God let us put this rajnish to test first test is only was he the only man who claimed Divinity there are hundreds of them and in this country we have thousands of men who have claimed Divinity he's not the only one let's go to the next test Allah Allah the absolute Eternal was rajneesh absolutely we know from his biography from his autobiography he was suffering from asthma from diabetes from chronic backache imagine all Monday God suffering from asthama diabetes chronic backache third test he begins not noise begotten he had a father and mother in 1981 he goes to America USA and it takes thousands of Americans for a ride in the state of Oregon he starts his Center and calls it as rajnishpuram his village later on the American government arrests him and put him behind Bar rajni says the American government slow poisoned me imagine almighty God being slow poisoned in 1985 the American government kick him out of the country he comes back to India in the same city Puna and he goes back to his Center which is now called as Osho commune and if you go to the samadhi of rajnish it is mentioned there on the samadhi bhagavan oh sure never born never died but visited the Earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990. never born never died but visited the Earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990. they forgot to mention samadhi he was not given visas to 21 countries of the world almighty God coming in this world to visit the world and requires visas to go to different countries and the arc Bishop of Greece said if you don't remove rajneesh out of this country we'll burn his house and the house of her disciples and the last test is so stringent that no one besides the true almighty God can pass the moment you can compare God to anything he is not God we know like the human beings had appeared one nose two eyes two ears two hands the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God if someone says almighty God is thousand times stronger than Andres Schwarzenegger but I've heard the name of Andrew Schwarzenegger have you heard Arnold Schwarzenegger the person who got the title Mr World Mr Universe the strongest man in the world the strongest man in the universe the moment you can compare God to anyone whether it be Arnold Schwarzenegger whether it be dhara Singh whether it be King Kong whether it be a thousand times a million times the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he is not God there's nothing like him so this is a four land definition of Allah given in the Quran whichever God you're worshiping brother put that God to the test of Surah class if that God passes that is the true God otherwise it's a fake God [Applause]"
