  "transcript": "let's discuss the prophecy of prophet muhammad peace be upon him in the buddhist scriptures almost all the buddhist scriptures they speak about a mertree to come it's also mentioned in chicago d hundred and eleven seventy six it says that another buddha will come by the name of maitri the holy one the supreme one the enlightened one endowed with wisdom and conduct auspicious having knowledge of the universe whatever he will get from supernatural knowledge he will preach to the whole world he will preach a religion which would be glorious at the beginning glory is at the climax and glorious at the end he will preach a way of life which will be truthful and wholly perfect he will have several thousands of monks as i have several hundreds of monks this prophecy is also repeated in the sacred books of the east volume 35 page number 225 that a main three will come which such and such criteria and qualities and further it says that he will be a leader of thousands of people as i'm a leader of hundreds of people it's further mentioned in the gospel of buddha page number 217-18 that ananda he asks buddha that o blessed one after you have gone who will guide us so the blessed one buddha he replied that i am not the first buddha in this world neither am i the last there will be another buddha who will come the holy one the supreme one the enlightened one endowed with wisdom and conduct the auspicious having knowledge of the universe he will preach a good religion he will preach a religion which should be glorious at the beginning glorious at the climax and glorious at the end he will teach a religion which will based on truth and will be a perfect way of life and he will have many thousands of disciples as i have only hundreds of disciples the ananda asks buddha the blessed one how will we know him so buddha replies he will be called as maitri maitri means the merciful loving kind compassionate one equivalent arabic word is rahma and allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 21 verse number 107 we have sent thee not but as a mercy to all the world as a mercy to all the creatures as the mercy of the whole of humanity this word rahma mercy and its derivatives aren't mentioned in the quran no less than 409 times and every chapter of the quran except for surah chapter number nine begins with the beautiful formula bismillah rahman rahim in the name of allah most gracious most merciful so the buddhist scriptures almost all of them prophesies about the mighty that is muhammad sallallahu salaam to come mohammad sallallahu is further prophesied in the buddhist scriptures which is mentioned in the sacred books of the east volume number 11 page number 36 chapter number two verse number 32 it says that as for the buddha there are no exoteric or esoteric teachers and oh ananda that means the teachers have nothing like a closed fist we cannot keep the knowledge to ourselves it should be proclaimed and we know muhammad sallallahu sallam whatever he received as a wahi from allah he proclaimed to the whole of humanity and he told his disciples that never keep it away from humankind proclaim it and spread it that's what's mentioned in the prophecy there's nothing like esoteric or exoteric everything should be told to humankind it's further mentioned in the buddhist scriptures in the sacred books of the east volume number 11 page number 97 mahaprabhu chapter number 5 verse number 36 it says that as buddha had a servito by the name of ananda so shall the maithri have a servato and we know from history from the seeds of muslim that he says that my parents gave me to the prophet at the age of eight and his mother told the prophet o messenger of allah take this to be your servant and anas malloy pleased with him he said that the prophet referred to him as his son or the little beloved one and we know how that anasma allah be pleased with him he always stood by the prophet in times of peace and in times of war in times of safety in times of danger he can very well be compared to ananda we know when the mad elephant rushes at buddha ananda stood by buddha similarly we know how that anasma allah be pleased with him in the battle of ud at the age of 11 even when the enemies were close to prophet muhammed anas may allah be pleased with them stood by the prophet even in the battle of hunain at the age of 16 when the enemies who were archers surrounded the prophet yet hazardous man pleads with him he stood by the prophet he can very well be compared like ananda when the mad elephant rushes at buddha and ananda stays by buddha so this is the fulfillment of the prophecy that the maithri will have a servato it is further mentioned in the gospel of buddha page number 214 but that this my three to come this other buddha to come will have six qualities the first is he will get enlightenment at night number two he will become bright when he gets enlightened number three he will die a natural death number four he will die at night number five when he dies he'll become bright and number six once he dies he will never be seen in the bodily form in the south again these six qualities and criteria befit no one but the last and final messenger prophet muslim we know that the first wahi he got was at night time as i mentioned earlier the quran says in surah dukhan chapter 44 verse number two and three and surikar chapter 97 verse number one that the quran was revealed in the night of power it further says he will be lit up and we know muhammad sallam had become bright he was enlightened it further says he will die a natural death and you know muhammad sallam had a natural death point number four he will die at night and we know from the hadith of us that i shall be pleased with her that she did not have oil in the lamp so she borrowed the oil from the neighbor indicating it was night when prophet muhammed it further says that he will become bright at the time of death and halathanas malla appears with him says that part of masala sun looked bright when he died and the last point is that when he dies he will never be seen in the bodily form on this earth i know masala sallam when he died in the bodily form he's buried in madina and he was never seen bodily form again all these criteria mentioned in the buddhist scriptures befit no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammad it's further mentioned in the buddhist scriptures in the sacred books of the east volume number 10 page number 68 it says that the tattagatas they are only preachers that means the buddha has to come they can only preach and allah says in the quran industry russia chapter number 88 verse number 21 allah says to the prophet your job is to deliver the message giving hidayah is in the hand of allah it's further mentioned in sacred books of the east volume number 10 page number 67 that to go to paradise even your good deeds are responsible your good deeds are responsible for you to go to paradise and allah says in sir chap number 103 verse number one two three walk us which means by the token of time man is we're in a state of loss except those who have faith those who have righteous deed those who exhort people to truth and those who exhort people to patients and perseverance one of the criteria to go to jannah is amelia righteous deed which is mentioned with the scriptures and further it's mentioned 151 it gives the criteria of the buddha the final my three to come it says that he will be a mercy to humankind he will be gentle he'd been example to humankind he says he'll be kind and he will be truthful so all these criteria befit no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammed this was in brief regarding muhammad sallallahu sallam in the buddhist scriptures"
