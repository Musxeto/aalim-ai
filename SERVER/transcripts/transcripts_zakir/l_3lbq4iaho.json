  "title": "How People of Gaza Demonstrated a High Level of Tawheed - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "recently in the last 112 days what we noticed and when I say 112 days it is starting from 7th of October 2023 most of us know about the attack of Israel on Palestine on Gaza and we know that for the last 112 days more than 25,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed out of of which more than 2/3 were women and children more than 2/3 more than 67% were women and children inocent people but it the first time in the history of the world there is a genocide going on and that genocide is being telecast live on the social media there are many genocides done before many we know it but this is the first time in the history of humankind the people that on whom genocide is being done they are telecasting it live because today the world has become a global village you see on the WhatsApp on the Facebook on the Instagram on Twitter live telecast of innocent women children men being killed more than 25,000 in the last 112 days from 7th October to the 27th October 2023 to the 27th of January 2024 and when we see the statements and we he the statement a heart Christ and they are an example today that imagine a child who is more injured than the father that child is telling the father father don't worry Allah is with us imagine that child who is more injured than the father is telling father don't worry Allah is with us the mother who is there after two or three children have been mared she's thanking Allah that good you have martyred my children have become martys why didn't you take me also see the tawa you find on these live telecast the Palestinians of Gaza the way they're thanking Allah it is not imaginable for person who does not know that's the reason when thousands and millions of non-muslim when they're watching this they're asking what type of faith is this the house is being destroyed they're thanking Allah the limb is being cut they're thanking Allah they're on the death bed they're thanking Allah people are being martyred being killed their relatives are thanking Allah what type of belief is this what type of Iman is this most of the human will complain to Allah they are thanking Allah only reason is because of they know that this life is a test for the Hereafter Allah says in the Quran in chapter number 67 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good inde deeds so when death approaches They're Not Afraid only person who cannot be afraid of death is the person who's afraid of Allah subhana tala if a person who is afraid of Allah subhana wa ta'ala he will not be afraid of anything else if may Allah have mercy on him he said if a person who fears Allah he will not fear anything else a person who does not fear Allah he will fear anything and everything if you don't fear Allah you may fear of poverty you may fear of life you may fear of death you may fear of this you may fear of anything and everything but if you fear Allah alone alone is important if you fear Allah and something else then it is partnership sh so if you fear Allah alone you will not fear anything it's not Haram to fear of flood or earthquake it's not Haram but if you fear Allah alone all these calamities you will never be afraid of you'll only say alhamdulillah a true moment if some Prophet takes his business he says alhamdulillah if some loss takes place he says alhamdulillah Prophet thanking Allah loss thank Allah only 10% loss it could be more so when you see these Palestinians the people of Gaza they fill our heart with tears and believe me in this test Allah is testing the full Muslim umah the Palestinians especially of Gaza they are doing they are protecting the third holiest site in Islam M they are doing if they would not have been there it would have been to go there do doing and the most powerful country in the world USA is supporting them with the best fighters and iron everything and yet they are fearlessly fighting them why why they have money they have power they have Allah this is the implication of life example we heard in the stories you know sahab Etc yes alhamd highest level but now Allah is giving us an example in the people of Gaza the Muslims of Gaza most of them almost all if not everyone they are giving us an example of what is what is its implication we are living in air condition mashallah if the condition goes off then we start sweating and we start complaining the houses have been destroyed 1 million people have been displaced what is the result someone asked me a question I have a session every fortnite ask Dr Zakir that why is Allah not not helping the Palestinian to win the war against Israel the answer is long I'll just give a short for Allah to make them win easy Allah is testing them these Palestinian more almost all of them are pling with flying colors Allah is testing us what are we doing what are we doing it's a shame on the Muslim umah when they're killing innocent people breaking all International laws of war crime nothing little protest here and there that's it will we pass the test you have to answer yourself on the day of judgment and Allah will ask you what have you done what have I done the Palestinians of Gaza they have passed the test with flying colors what about us it's the introspection so the higher level ofed you have oh if I support Palestinian my Facebook will be stopped my YouTube will be stopped and there are according to me if 25,000 Palestinians have died more than 25,000 non-muslims all over the world have accepted Islam only because of watching the Clips of Palestine of Gaza those Western non-muslim they are thinking what is the IM they have I want to have that Faith what type of religion they following who is this Allah which book are they following they starting in the Quran in less than 3 months more than 25 I'm saying more than 25,000 for safety because I'm a man of figures it may be much higher much higher according to the president of the European Council only in France alone in the first two months 20,000 accepted Islam I'm not quoting him because I cannot verify statement so I don't quote it but I know being a man of media and if more than a million people have been displaced in Gaza more than 2 million lives have been affected in Gaza do you know tens of millions of non-muslims have started supporting Palestine have come closer to Islam because of the Palestinians never in the history of humanity has it happened that millions of non-muslims in Western countries in America and Europe all over the world non-muslims coming out in protest supporting Palestine the Palestinians Allah's plan so this is the implication of toed if you have faith in Allah if you believe ined whatever come you say alhamdulillah a person oned can never be disappointed happiness is a state of mind he's always happy always thankful"
