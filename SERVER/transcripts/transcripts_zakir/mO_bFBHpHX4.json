  "transcript": "let us first discuss prophet muhammad peace be upon him in the hindu scriptures the hindu scriptures can be broadly divided into two categories the shrutis and the smritis shruti means that which is revealed which is understood which is heard the shruti according to the hindu scholars is considered to be the word of god and they are divided into two parts the veda and the upanishads the sanskrit word wade is derived from the word vid which means knowledge power excellence and there are four types of vedas rigveda yajiroveda samwit and atharvaveda though exactly when did these weight come into existence is not known but according to swami dan and saraswati who is the founder of the arya samaj he says that the veda are 1310 million years old but the majority of the hindu scholars they say that the veda are approximately 4 000 years old in which part of the world did it first come is not known who was the person to whom it was first given is not known in spite of all these ambiguities it is yet considered to be the word of god and it is the most authentic and the most high scriptures amongst all the hindu scriptures the next authority ad upanishads derived from the sanskrit word upa which means near knee matlab down shut mother sit sitting down near when the pupils and students sat next to the teacher to acquire knowledge it's called upanishad which means knowledge which removes ignorance there are more than 200 upanishads but the indian culture gives a figure of 108 out of which some are picked up as the principal upanishads some have picked up 10 some 12. sriradha krishna has picked up 18 and written a book the principal upanishads the next type of scriptures are the smoothies smoothie means that which is remembered it means memory the hindu scholars say smriti's are scriptures written by human beings by rishis and they are next after the shruti the shrutis are higher than the smithies they also called as dharmashastra because they tell how our life should be led by an individual by the community and by the society one of the most important smithi is the purana purana means ancient it talks about the stories of deities about the creation of the universe about literature and maharishi vyas has compiled the puranas into 18 voluminous parts one of the most important puranas is called as the bhavishya purana bhavishya means future this purana speaks about the future and it's mentioned in bhavishya purana parvati country adhered three shlokas five to eight a malaysia will come along with his companions from the desert and his name shall be muhammad peace be upon him and raja bhoj will give this mahadev arab a bath in the punch curve and will welcome him with honor and address him with reverence and say oh pride of humankind you have created a great force to fight against evil people this prophecy of bhavishya purana parvatha 3hand 3 adhered 3 shlokas 5 to 8 it says that a malaysia will come malaysia in sanskrit means a foreigner he will come along with his companions talking about the sahabas from a marusthal marustal in sanskrit means a sandy track or a desert his name shall be muhammad peace be upon him raja bhoja will address this mahadeva arab with reverence and say o pride of humankind we know that muhammad sallallahu sallam is the pride of humankind as allah says in the quran in surah kalam chapter number 68 verse number four verily how are standards on the highest standard of character allah says in surah azab chapter number 33 verse number 21 verily in the prophet muhammad peace be upon him you will find a very beautiful pattern of conduct he further says that he will collect a great force to fight against the evil people and we know that was done by prophet muhammad this prophecy refers to no one but prophet muhammad peace be upon him some people may say that the raja bhoj mentioned in this prophecy was present in the 11th century 500 years after prophet muhammad peace be upon him and was the descendant of the 10th generation of raja shilla these people they failed to realize that like the monarchs of egypt they were given the title pharaohs there were many pharaohs there was not one pharaoh like the kings of rome were called as caesars there was not one caesar there were many caesars similarly the kings of india were given the title bhoj so there was not one raja bhoja there were many raja bhuja so this rajaboj is not the one they are talking about in the 11th century it is much earlier before the 11th century further it's mentioned in bhavishya purana parvati khan three adhered three shlokas 10-27 the land of the malaysias have been spoiled there was the enemy who was killed earlier now he's been sent by a more powerful enemy i will send a man by the name muhammad peace be upon him to guide these people to the straight path oh raja bhoj you need not go to the land of the pishachas because i through my kindness will purify you where you are then a man with an injury disposition comes to raja and tells him that arya dharma will prevail in this world i have been sent by ishvar paramatma my follower shall be circumcised who doesn't have a tail on the head who will grow a beard who will create a revolution who will give the call for prayer he will eat all lawful things he will eat all sorts of animals but will not eat the flesh of swine he will not be purified by herbs and shrubs but will be purified by warfare he will be called as musalman this prophecy refers to no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammad it says that my follower shall be a person who circumcised and we know the muslims are circumcised he will not have a tail on the head that's a shandy or a chuti he will grow a beard he will create a revolution he will give the call for prayer that is talking about the aadhaan like muslims give he will eat all lawful things he will eat all sorts of animal but will not eat the flesh of swine and allah says in the quran in no less than four different places in surah baqarah chapter number two verse number 173 surah maidah chapter number five verse number three surya anam chapter number six verse number one forty five and surah nahin chapter number 16 verse number 115 um that meat blood the flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides allah's name is taken so because the quran says in no less than four different places that flesh of swine is prohibited we muslims don't eat poke the prophecy further says they will not be purified by herbs and shrubs but will be purified by waffe and they will be called as musalman this prophecy clearly indicates about the coming of the last and final messenger prophet muhammad it's further mentioned in bhavishya purana parvati khan one advertise 21-23 it says that the seven sacred cities of kashi have been filled with corruption and rakshas in the land of the militia the followers of the malay chadham are good people all good qualities are found in them and in this country we find all sorts of vices orishi glorify the name of the lord here too it is talking about prophet muhammad sallallahu sallam and his followers you"
