  "title": "Why Did not God Create Only One Religion? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is krishna rao i am working as a general manager abroad luckily today one of my fortunately with i've come here with one of my friend who has brought me here today in fact dr zakir i have seen him on tv and always i had i mean this is a great opportunity that has god has given me to see him personally and ask a question which always i had a doubt in my life that why god didn't create one religion or he didn't make one religion for everybody so that peace would have been prevailed on this earth he knew it or he never knew about it that these are the problems which are going to be faced brothers asked a very good question very important question why did not god create only one religion why did he create all the different religions so there would be no confusion no fighting and i agree with him it's a very good question and if you read the quran allah says in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 verses 19. in nadine islam the only religion acceptable in the side of allah is islam islam means submitting a will to almighty god so if you read all the religions almighty god only sent messengers to preach one religion all the messengers that came right from adam peace be upon him write down noah moses jesus muhammad peace be upon them all all the prophets and a beloved prophet said they have a hundred and twenty-four thousand messengers sent on the face of the earth and it's mentioned in the quran in surah chapter 35 verse 24 um there is not a nation or a tribe whom we have not sent a one or a guide allah says in surah chapter number thirteen verse number seven well he could be common heart and to every people have you sent up honor now all the messengers that came brother they taught nothing but submitting the will to almighty god and the basic message that all these messengers taught oneness of god he did not beget he has got no mother he has got no father he is only one there's nothing like him but due to passage of time all what the messengers preached it got corrupted and if you heard my talk i mentioned that most of the scriptures that came before the quran they got changed and allah says in the quran in several places if he wanted he could have made everyone submit his will to god everyone muslim say muslim brother don't take another religion the real meaning of islam is it's a deen it's a way of life submitting your will to god and muslim doesn't mean a person who has the name zakir abdullah sultan muslim means a person who submits evil to god if you submit your will to god in arabic i will call you as a muslim so don't go on the labels given sultan abdullah muslim in arabic means a person who submits his will to god anyone who submits a will to god he is called as a muslim so all the messengers that came they taught that we have to submit a will to god all of them taught monotheism all taught tahit but by the passage of time all these scriptures kept on changing and that's the reason almighty god he sent the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him and the last and final revelation glorious quran now all the messengers that came before prophet muhammad peace be upon him all the revelation that came before the quran they were only meant for those people and for that time by name four are mentioned in the quran torah zaboor injeel and the quran torah is the vahi the revelation was given to moses peace be upon him zaboor is the vahi the revelation given to david peace be upon him injeel is the revelation given to jesus christ peace be upon him and quran is the last and final revelation given to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him but quran also says in surah chapter number 13 verse number 38 it says the kulli is in every age have we sent a revelation there were several revelations and now but all the revelation that came before the quran and all the messengers that came before prophet muhammad they were sent only for those people and for that time that's the reason almighty god did nothing be fit to preserve it but since quran is the last and final revelation not only sent for the muslims or the arabs it is sent for the whole of humanity and prophet muhammad he is not sent only for the muslim of the arabs he has been sent for the whole of humanity that is the reason he has been prophesied in all the major world religious scriptures and this book the quran allah says in surah chapter number 15 verse number 9 we have revealed the quran and we shall guard it from corruption so what we realize that almighty god sent messengers to preach only one religion that is submitting your will to almighty god in arabic i say islam jesus christ never came to preach christianity the word christianity doesn't exist in the bible do you know that in the full bible the word christianity is not there he didn't preach christianity the word christian was the nickname given to the followers of jesus as antioch mentioned in the book of acts nickname so jesus christ preached islam it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter 5 verse 30 jesus christ please said that not my will but my father's will god's will in arabic he preached nothing but islam similarly if you bhagavad-gita shri krishna said that you have to submit a will to god he found in arabic he says that you have to accept islam so what do we realize that all the messengers taught nothing but submitting a will to god that's the reason the quran says in sula and imran chapter 3 verse 19 in nadine in the islam the only way of life accepted in the sight of god is submitting a will to almighty god so what we have to go back to the original scriptures go back to the commandment of almighty god and submit your will the commandment of god and then you will be following the straight path hope to answer the question"
