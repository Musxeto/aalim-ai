  "title": "Is it Permissible to Pray Taraweeh and Tahajjud both in Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is samya from bogura Bangladesh my question is is it permissible to perform taravi and tahajud both in namdan as I mentioned earlier the more appropriate word is means to stand Lal means night Cam will meet standing in Salah at night so anytime you pray Salah if it's prayed during Ramadan because people stop and pray the word used was taravi so taravi is one of the type of kayamul is another Arabic would use meaning you sleep and you wake up so when you sleep and then you pray the qayam it is called as tahajud so tarav is also can you pray both yes you can pay both you can pray both together as one fella or you can pay both separately for example in Ramadan if after your iftar you do a year and after Isha you do about that and you sleep and you get up and then you pray your eight rakat stopping so when you get up and you pray it's called because they're stopping and praying it's called taravi so praying two in one it can also be that you're going to the mosque like what I normally do I go to the mosque and most of the mosque after is I pray there and I prefer going to a mosque which does one use a day it's not compressory I prefer going to a must which completes the full Quran and I also play my normal tajud so normally in the whole of Ramadan I pray taravi and in the last one third again pray tajut okay too because the prophet did not District in the mosque and then I paid even in the last one third and even in the hermene the last 10 days normally even in the Haram they have tarawi and death they have immediately after Nisha and in the last one third night before the time for Fajr Salah a couple of hours before separate both the camouflage it is afzal it is preferable if you can pray both alhamdulillah separately you're praying after Isha you're praying in the last one third you can double as much as you pray it is better for you especially in the last 10 nights of Ramadan where you are seeking follow together"
