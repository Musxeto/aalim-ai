  "title": "Islamic Goal Setting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "even planning is important even goal setting is important and we find when we read the books of management gurus there are various goal settings that have been given by them but for me the best planning the best goal setting is islamic i s l a m i c i is for islamic your goal should be according to the teachings of allah subhana wa tala and the beloved prophet muhammad your goal should be based on the teachings of quran and the teachings of say hadith of the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him it should be islamic number one yes your goal should be specific it should be focused your goal can't be vague let me give an example once there was a teacher who was teaching rcd to students and he tells the students who are learning bow and arrow aim at that bird who is sitting on the treetop all of them take him he said don't release until i give you command so he asked the first student have you take your name he said yes what do you see he says i see the forest i see the trees and i also see the bird he has the second student what do you see he says sir i see the tree i see the branch of the tree and i see the bird he has the third student what do you see the third one replies i only see the branch of the tree and the bird and the eye of the bird he asked the fourth student what do you see the fourth student replies sir i only see the eye of the bird and nothing else the teacher says let the arrow go and the arrow hits the eye of the bird your goal should be specific it should be focused it should not be like the traveler who wants to go norway not like the dog who's running after car without purpose number three l l is for lucrative it should be profitable number one it should be profitable in the year after akhra and if possible simultaneously it can even be profitable in this world but more important is akhara allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 201. give us the good in this world and the hereafter and save us from the torment of hellfire so it should be lucrative it should be profitable number one in the year after and then secondly in this world but more important is the year after and then the world let not your prophet of this world take you away from the prophet of the hereafter fourth is a a it should be apt it should be appropriate it should be suitable your goal should be apt and appropriate m m is for measurable your goal should be measurable and for a goal to be measurable first it should be specific after it is specific it should also be miserable for example suppose a builder says i want to build the tallest building in the world the goal is specific but to make it measurable he does a survey which is the tallest building in the world and he comes to know that it is 828 meters tall specific so now his goal is he has to build a building which is more than 828 meters tall it's specific and measurable if it's measurable it can be monitored how much are you reaching how much are you coming closer to your goal i it's for intention a beloved person said it's mentioned say buhari volume number one chapter number one book of faith hadith number one first your deeds will be judged on your intentions and you'll be rewarded for intentions your intention should be to please allah your intention should not be to become famous to become popular if that's your intention then your goal is not correct if your intention is to please allah your creator and his messenger surely you will be rewarded in the hereafter and inshallah allah will reward you even in this world it should be consistent till the time you achieve the goal if the goal is time bound if it is not time-bound it should be consistent forever for example if your goal is i want to read quran at least once in the month of ramadan so then you have a target i will read one jews every day then you are consistent every day in the month of ramadan you read one jews of the quran at the end of ramadan you will finish the quran at least once if your goal is not time bound maybe you want to say i want to read the quran daily then you set up a target i will read quran every day half jews or maybe one jews and then you start the moment you achieve reading half to the 1 years a day keep on being consistent till the end of your life and a beloved prophet muhammad said it's mentioned in say muslim word number one book of salah chapter number 272 hadith number one seven double one he said that once a person as the prophet which is the best of deeds which is love by allah so the prophet said allah loves those deeds which are done consistently even if they are small it is far better than bigger deeds which are done only once so deeds which are done consistently are far superior than deeds which are done once in a while even if they're greater so the goal should be islamic eye for islamic s for specific focused l for lucrative profitable a for appropriate m for measurable which can be monitored i for intention should be to please allah and see it should be consistent let me give an example some of us may be aware of the history of wilmar rudolph wilma rudolph was a girl who was born and she had polio since childhood and the doctors they put braces on her legs and they said this girl will never set foot on the earth her mother she encouraged the child and she told wilma what you want to do you will be able to do and the mother encouraged her daughter wilma at the age of nine she removed the braces and she wanted to be the fastest woman on the earth that was the desire that was the goal after removing the braces at the age of nine at the age of 13 for the first time in her life she takes part in a race and she loses she comes out last but yet she's consistent she keeps on striving she loses again she strives a day comes when she qualifies for the olympics and this is a true story it's not an anecdote it's not a fairy tale once she qualifies for the olympics in 1960 olympics she comes out first in 100 meters amongst the women she gets the gold medal she also gets the gold medal in 200 meter sprint amongst the women she also wins the gold medal for the 400 meter relay 100 into four amongst the women she gets three gold medals in the 1960 olympics and she creates history a paralyzed a paralytic woman who at polio she becomes the fastest woman on the face of the earth in the year 1960. now when we analyze the goal setting done by vilma and if you have read books of the management gurus she fulfills all the criteria those who have read about the smart goals i don't want to go into detail but let us verify how much she fulfills off the main target of the creator islamic number one was the goal islamic was the goal according to quran and sunnah i don't know her personal life but i knew that she was not a muslim i don't know whether she did for the creator or not number two was the ghost specific yes it was specific she wanted to be the fastest woman on the face of the earth was it lucrative was it profitable yes for this one it was profitable she gets fame she gets honor but for the hereafter allah i doubt when the year after this olympic gold medal will bring a profit unless she dedicates the gold medal towards allah a was it apt and appropriate yes it was m was it measurable yes she could measure who is the fastest woman on the face of the earth maybe the timing is somewhere close to 9 seconds or 10 seconds or 11 seconds measurable and she practiced she achieved a goal i what was the intention if intention was same surely she got it was the intention to please allah i doubt see was it consistent yes it was consistent she consistently practiced even though she lost till she won and became the fastest woman on the earth let me give you another example to compare and show the difference between goal setting i would like to give example of the man of the person who had very small means but reached the heights in his field the man the person who changed my life and converted me from a doctor of a body to doctor of soul and i'm sure you know the name of that man he's none other than sheikh ahmad let us compare his goal setting sheikh ahmed and if you know the life history of shaykh he acquired education only till standard 6 because both his ends could not meet he was forced to leave his education after passing standard six he was forced to leave his education a man with small means he was forced to leave the country india where he was born then he goes to south africa he does a job of a salesman he works in a furniture shop he does the job of driving etc and while he was in south africa he used to constantly be harassed by the christian missionaries who is to tell islam is a useless religion it is merciless this to attack islam and because it is to get harassed a desire came in his heart that i want to reply all the allegations against islam made by these christian missionaries i want to give a fitting reply to these christian missionaries imagine a man only study to standard sixth but naturally he had faith in allah he strived he stumbled across a book books which were lying in a room which had dust on it he stumbles across a book by the name of isar al-haqqa that's revealed by maranath and he gets the direction for his goal that's how he started and he strived for 40 years till the time he challenged the stalwarts of christianity imagine a sixth standard pass man strike for 40 years and challenge the standards of the world so much so that in 1986 he was about to debate reverend jimmy's bhagat and at that time in 1980s jimmy swaggart was the number one most powerful most famous christian televangelist just a few weeks before his debate one of the fans of sheikh dida told him let's shake ahmadidad i'm your fan but i want to give you an advice this man jimmy swagat i know him i studied him please don't debate him he will chew you and he will spit you out imagine a fan of this giving advice to this you don't debate this jimmy's forget you don't know him i know him he will chew you and he will spit you out the person was the most famous televangelist who owns television channels whose budget was more than a million dollar a day to keep his head above water with allah on his side he goes to usa in the hometown of that christian missionary in the country very famous he goes and he has the debate and alhamdulillah summa hamdulillah with allah's help he turns the tables over imagine a man of small means not even past school live aside being a graduate challenges the star wars of christianity so much so that he became the biggest stumbling block for the christianity of the world for the christian missionaries one man alone sheikh ahmed with the help of allah he challenged the whole of christianity [Applause] let's analyze this goal setting number one the islamic i was it islamic was it according to quran and say hadith was it for allah in his rasool but natural it was that's the reason he was able to achieve his goal number two was it specific yes his goal was specific i want to reply to the allegations against islam specific i want to give a fitting reply remove the misconceptions about islam that is there in the minds of the non-muslim number three was it lucrative was it profitable he wanted prophet in achara and inshallah inshallah allah will grant him jannah inshallah but besides being profitable in the akhirah it even profited him here you know a number six standard past man in 1986 he gets the biggest award in the muslim world he is awarded the king faisal award for service in humanity a six-standard man [Applause] he didn't do for the award maybe he got two hundred thousand dollars he didn't do it for that maybe for the gold king faisal or hindu for that he did it for allah and his rasool allah profits him in akira and even in this world lucrative a was it up was it appropriate very apt at the right time his style everything at that time when the christian missionaries were hammering the muslims our morale was at the lowest this man sheikh ahmed he inspired thousands of youngsters including myself we could at least raise our head and stand apt m was it measurable yes what did he do he collected the books of christianity the christian missionaries who wrote against islam you know john gilchrist all these books jimmy swaggart and started replying when they attacked the quran and islam he replied and he studied their scripture bible used the verse of the quran and implemented on them and he found results measurable i what was his intention his intention wasn't to become famous his intention wasn't to win the king faisal award his intention was to please allah in his rasool see was he consistent yes he was imagine he struggled and strived for 40 years and if you know his history his office was a small dungy place and he tells us that even to print a black and white pamphlet a thousand quantity they used to have a meeting let's have a meeting can we print thousand quantity of a black and white pamphlet mashallah consistent kept on striving till he reached his goal the difference that we find in wilmar rodolf and sheikh ahmadidah is that the goal of wilmar rudolph it was short-sighted it was more for this world but the goal of sheikh hamas did it was fast sighted and it was for the akhirah and insha allah will give him reward in akhirah and even gave him reward in this world"
