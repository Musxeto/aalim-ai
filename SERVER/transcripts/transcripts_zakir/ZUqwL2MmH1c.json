  "title": "Persons who are Ill are Exempted from Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "regarding a person who is a bit incapacitated due to illness headache or stomachache um they also exempt it from fasting the people who are ill they exempted allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 2 verse number 185 that if a person is ill and traveling he can make up his prescribed periods of day of fasting later on but that does not mean if a person is suffering from a headache or a stomachache or a cough he should not fast if a person can fast if he's sick it becomes compulsory for him too fast the only time he's exempted is if fasting becomes difficult due to his illness or if he fast his illness would be increased or his health would deteriorate or it's compulsory for him to take some medicine due to his then it becomes prohibited otherwise for small issues or for small reasons like cough like cold like headache like stomach ache fasting is compulsory and the reason allah tala has exempted those people who are ill so that allah does not want to put a burden allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse 195 that do not make your own hands the cause of your own destruction if i'm ill and if i know that fasting is going to cause a loss for me will deteriorate my health it's likely myself so unless it is prohibited so if i know fasting will deteriorate my health then it becomes prohibited similarly allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 29 that kill not yourselves for allah is the most merciful so causing a loss or a damage to your own health yourself is prohibited in islam so this exemption is mainly for those people for whom it is difficult or it will deteriorate the health not for small ailments okay we should be very careful to make sure our illness is reasonably severe then"
