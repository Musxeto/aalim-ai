  "transcript": "the next question posed by nadir Ahmed from Bangladesh sir I am 20 years old and really inspired by you in the field of dawa when I try to convey the message of Allah to the Hindus using the references of chandogya andish and that God is only one he has got no Idols no images Etc some Hindus counter me by saying that they believe God is one but but God has come to Earth in different forms and different ways from age to age like Shiva Brahma Vishnu Etc but we worship all his forms how can I reply to them logically the brother ask the question that when he tries to convince the Hindus about the Oneness of Allah subhana wa tala regarding monotheism they agree that God is one but they say that God has come in different forms like in the form of Shiva Brahma Vishnu how do I reply to them what they are referring to is AAR Hindus believe that almighty God has come down on the face of the Earth in the form of AAR what is the meaning of the word AAR AAR is coming from Sanskrit word and meaning to descend down and here according to Sanskrit grammar it means that some position of Allah is descending down some thing possessed by God is descending it cannot be God himself so anyone who says that AAR means God himself coming down is totally wrong it's against the rules of Sanskrit it means Allah has sent down someone so in the real context what they're talking is about Messengers and that's what we believe that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has sent 124,000 prophets on the face of the Earth by name 25 are mention in the Quran Adam Noah ibraim Moses Jesus Muhammad may peace be upon them all but our beloved Prophet malli wasallam said that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has sent down 124,000 prophets on the face of the Earth maybe these people Ram Krishna they were prophets of God maybe though the name is not mentioned so I cannot say Ram Alam but maybe they're prophets but even if they were prophets of God they were sent only for those people in that time because all the messengers and Prophet that came before the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him they were sent only for those people and for that time Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him because he was the last and final messenger he was sent for the whole of humanity so what we have to understand that the AAR they're talking about is the same concept as The Messengers as prophets what we Muslim believe so we have no no objection that maybe Rah was a prophet maybe Krishna was a prophet maybe Brahma was a prophet we have no problem but there were prophets of God and they were not God themselves because the V clearly mentioned that in the chapter number 32 verse number three and chapter number four verse number 29 that of that God there is no pratima pratima in Sanskrit means animage a photograph a painting a sculpture a statue and Idol so of that God there is no pratima there is no painting there is no photograph there is no idle there's no sculpture there is no image so we have no problem in believing that these were Messengers but surely they are almighty God so if you explain the concept of AAR inshallah you would be able to get them closer to Islam"
