  "transcript": "the question you ask beard if he decides to keep a beard alhamdulillah I congratulate you that decided to keep a beard alhamdulillah the brother said that what should the length of my beard be and some people say it should be like a fist what is the real thing brother it's a commandment of the Beloved Prophet that do the opposite of what the pagans do mush do keep the beard and trim the mustach sh the Commandment of the Prophet is keep a beard it's a f to keep a beard F now if you have more ta and want to do more in research you can go on higher level that offering five times Salah is a with your Salah you can offer alhamdulillah if you ask me what is minimum minimum is offering Salah five times along with it if you offer alhamdulillah if you offer alhamdulillah alhamdulillah with alhamdulillah alhamdulillah so the Commandment of the Prophet is keep a beard now when a prophet gives a commandment if you look in his lifestyle and the Lifest of the sahabas you get more details of that commandment so minimum commandment is keeper beard alhamdulillah so first I only to stress on keeping up beard but if you want to have higher level of tawa that I want to go in more details besides the Commandment I also want to follow the lifestyle of the sahabas and the prophet alhamdulillah the I quoted ofari the volume number seven in the book of bre chapter 64 Hadith number 78 says that na narrated M be pleas with him that Omar the son of Omar with him he said that the prophet said do the opposite of what the pagans do keep the beard and trim the mustaches cut the mustaches short and the Hadith continues and Omar may Allah be pleased with him the son of Omar after H and umra he got the beard with his fist and trimmed what was below his hold whatever was below his hold he trimmed it now keeping a beard is the Commandment of the prophet now the sahabas are the best people to know what the prophet meant so if you follow the lifestyle of the sahabas it is much better so if you ask me keeping a beard most of the scholars say that since the prophet command it's a now if you want to have a high level of what is must what should be the length of the beard I quoted the Hadith which says that how did he him his beard held the beard with his fist and you know there is hair below whatever is below you can see my beard is very Spar you can't demonstrate very well with my beard but you know alhamdulillah it is one MTI so you trim it below that there are more than 10 Hadith which tell that the sahabas they C it this way there are sever of the had for example the next of bukari volume number seven in the book of dress chapter number 65 Hadith number 781 Omar Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet said cut your mustach short and leave the beard best is first keeper beard if you're on high level of tawa you can keep the size of one fist but minimum at least first keep a beard and then inshallah if Allah give more that and if you have more ta and if you say I want to follow more of the SAS because if you want to analyze any the best way to analyze is to see how the sahabas understood the Hadith they are the best people they were the compan of the Prophet so if you see their lifestyle how do they trim the mustaches trim the mustaches means you can't have long mustaches when you drink tea some tea also gets stuck on the mustaches unhygienic unhygienic so tripping the mustaches if you go to the Lifest of the S the it says that how did the sahabas trim the mustach also mentioned they trimmed it in such a way that the skin of the upper lip was seen higher level of tawa but if you want to go more into detail the saas STM the mustach in such a way that the skin below the mustaches was seen so if you have more TAA you want to keep the mustaches in a more better way then this is a style but first at least keep the beard trim the mustaches then insh Allah gives you you can follow the level which you feel is the best for you hope that answer the question"
