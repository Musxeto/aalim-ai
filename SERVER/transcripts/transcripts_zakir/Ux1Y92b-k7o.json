  "transcript": "next question relates to anger Dr Zaki regarding Anger Management in the month of Ramadan people are fasting during the month of Ramadan they're getting angry is there any excuse for a person getting angry in the month of Ramadan is it a valid excuse indeed for them to say we are fasting we're entitled to get angry in fact it is opposite that a person while fasting you should not get angry that fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people looking before you so that you may learn self-restraint it says learn self-control so in fact if you're fasting all the more reason you should not get angry it is opposite it can't be a valid excuse that because I'm hungry because I am tired I can get angry it is the opposite said just mentioned the say Hadith of say buhari worm number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1904 a beloved Prophet said that fasting is a shield and you should not speak obsidely you should not yell at anyone else and if someone abuses you or someone tries to provoke you or someone tries to make you angry you should say I am fasting I am fasting and the same message is repeated also in say bukhari word number three in the book of fasting Hadith number one eight nine four my beloved Prophet said that someone provoked you or makes you angry say I'm fasting I'm fasting it further repeated over inside Muslim several places said it's mentioned inside bukhari word number eight in the book of manners Hadith number six one one four a blood Prophet said that the strong person is not one who defeats another person with the strength the stronger person is not one who overcomes another with his strength but the stronger person is one who when someone makes him angry he forgives him he does not get angry so actually fasting shows us a way how to control ourselves and as you rightly said it's somewhat like Management on how to control your anger subhanallah well if we can control our anger whilst we're fasting we can do it anytime Insha'Allah"
