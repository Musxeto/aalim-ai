  "transcript": "most of the orientalist they translate the word Jihad as holy war and unfortunately many of the so-called Muslim Scholars inverted Commerce even they translate holy war holy boy if you translate into Arabic Isa if you read the Quran nowhere in the Quran is the word mentioned and there is no Hamas Allah mentioned this word holy war was first coined to describe the Crusades done by the Christians if you read history several centuries ago the Christian Crusaders they forced and killed tens of thousands of human beings in the name of Christianity if you read history the maximum number of human beings killed in the name of any religion it is Christianity and this they called it as the holy war and today they use it for the Arabic word Jihad fundamentalist was first going to describe the Christians today it is used for the Muslims so Jihad does not mean holy war Jihad means to strive to struggle"
