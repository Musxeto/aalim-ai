  "transcript": "where should a woman pray taraweeh i think we've answered partly onto this question at home or in the masjid if she prays at home can she lead the congregation or a congregation of women it's mentioned in saitar hadith number 336 where the beloved prophet said that the best mosque for a woman is her innermost room i know missed chamber and the best place for a woman to pray is her inner room that's the best and in another hadith of muslim mountain number six hadith number 27202 which also mentioned in s335 once a lady asked the prophet i would love to pray with you the lady said and the prophet replied i know you'd love to pray with me but your prayer in your inner room would be better than praying in your house the prayer in your house would be better than praying in the courtyard your praying in your courtyard would be better than praying in the mosque where you live around your people you're praying in the mosque where you live around with people is better than praying in my mosque that means for a woman the best prayer is the inner room and the way that praying in your room is better than house house better than the courtyard courtyard than the mosque in your area then mosquito better than the mosque of the prophet so the prophet said it's mentioned say muslim verb number two hadith number three to one zero that praying in my mosque is equivalent to a thousand prayers that means all if you pray in the mohammed sallam it's equal to praying a thousand times in any other mosque but this hadith is mainly referring to the men because no two say had been contradicted so these are the main refers to the men for the woman the best place in the house especially her inner room and there's hadith in dhabi number one book of salah number 591 umarka may love you please with her mommy she comes to the prophet and says that i would like to have more than in my house and the prophet gave a permission the next hadith sunan abu dhabi number one book of salah number 592 it says that given to a house after appointing the mountain and he asks her to lead the prayer in congregation and the woman in the house they joined her and the narrator says that he saw the more then he was the old person it's further mentioned in [Music] who's the wife of the prophet she says that she led the congregation of the woman she was the imam but she stood in the middle of the road and another hadith number 4953 who was also the wife of the prophet muhammad even she said that she led she was the imam of a congregational woman and she was standing in the center of the first row so here it indicates that the woman they can't pray but it is better for them to pray in the inner room better than going in the mosque but they are permitted to go in the mosque as we discussed yeah earlier yesterday that praying in the mosque is permitted but for them the inner room is better than the house the house is better than courtyard courtyard better than the mosque close to them then the mosque of the prophet but they can pray they can go to the mosque if they pray at home they can have a congregation there's no problem at all and a woman can lead the congregation according to the vehicle"
