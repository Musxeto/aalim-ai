  "title": "Ways to Calculate Zakaat - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question really relates to um the general issue of calculation of zakat could you explain to the viewers in a nutshell how that is done there are two methods of the cut can be calculated because zakat is payable when you have it for one year so you can keep a daily record of what is your wealth above the nissan level you can keep a weekly record or monthly record so then whenever the nissan level is above then have no down the date on first of january what was the nishab you had second of january what you have so what you had in the first of january say first of january so first of january 2008 it will label for zakah then what you had on 2nd of january calculated in 3rd of january or on weekly basis on monthly basis but to keep a record of all this is very difficult then you'll be spending half the day in keeping the record which will be difficult so it's not practical at all the easier method and the safe method where mistake inshallah would be avoided is picking one particular day in the full year and calculate it exactly one year after that most of the people prefer because it is the month of charity and we get more blessings and more rewards but ramnan is not the only month that you have to pick up you can pick up any day of the year but it should be calculated according to the hijri calendar not according to the solar calendar so first of january 2007 1st of january 2008 is wrong it should be first shaban or first of hajj but since i'm done is the most past month first of ramadan you can take away any india from that if you take first off from then calculate all the assets that you have and next year if it's first of ramadan 1420 hijri then first of all 14 21st century you should see what amount you have now if you calculate only on one day and see exactly one history or later one lunar later it is the safest method there can never be any possibility that you will give less zakat they can be high chances you may give more zakat but nevertheless why if you keep on calculating daily then the level keeps on going up and down but if you calculate one particular day of the year which do you pick up and if that happens to be the lowest collection the lowest saving in the full year yet you are paying the minimum amount of zakat say on the 1st of ramadan you have hundred thousand rupees as saving a hundred thousand dollars saving and that happens to be the lowest saving in the full year yet since is the lowest you have to pay zakat on what you possess for one full year so you have to pay two and a half thousand rupees or two and a thousand dollars on that amount it's safe but it may be that it is the highest saving of the full year so yourself you may be paying a little bit more zakat but you won't be paying less but some people may think oh it is the highest saving that means you know i'm paying unnecessary more amount there are chances you may pay more but then no chance you'll pay less because even if it is the highest and if you think that you will try and catch the lowest point the lowest point may keep on changing it may be the month of shaban it may be in the month of rajab maybe in the month of hajj and then if you try and catch that point next it will again change so if you try and catch that point there are high chances will be less zakat so best is to pick up one point one day in the full injury calendar and keep on sticking that every year and you'll be less assured that you will never pill has the card you may pay more because if the wealth keeps on fluctuating up and down you have to pay on what amount you possess for the full year yeah but the lowest point once maybe shaban the other may be ramadan the third may be hajj maybe any month the safest is to pick up anyone keep on sticking to that year and inshallah you'll never pay less you may pay more sometimes ten percent more twenty percent more thirty percent more will never be less inshallah so this is the safest method and it's the best method and on this day whichever day you pick up you have to calculate all the savings you have whether in cash is the bank balance what is the gold you possess whether in the form of jewelry whatever stock you possess whether in shares whatever investment all this you put together all your business the stock trade of your business all put together if you're due to receive some amount from someone even that has to be calculated because he has given a bit late but it's your property or if you have given some loan to someone that should be calculated but if you have to give some money to someone that has to be directed from your amount for example you have taken a loan of 100 000 100 000 rupees and a total amount of 500 000 rupees that you have in your home cash in hand cash in bank stock everything so you have to minus from five hundred thousand hundred thousand so you have to pay that rather than four hundred thousand but if you put the fine a thousand and you have given loan of two and thousand dollars to somebody else and you have to receive hundred thousand dollars because goodly have sold so 500 plus 200 000 plus hundred thousand you have to pay the cost on eight hundred thousand dollars so in all you have to calculate on one particular day of the year and then you have to pay zakat two and a half percent on them"
