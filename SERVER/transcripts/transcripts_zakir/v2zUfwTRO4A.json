  "transcript": "in the english translation the one that i recommend best is amongst all the translations i've read i feel this is the most comprehensive and he took approximately 40 years to write the translation and though his english is a bit archaic mr biblical e the tao but is more closer to arabic in normal english when you say you it's the same in arabic you know for you for female is different for male is different singular is different duel is different plural is different six types you know in english one you whether it's a male single or female single male dual or female dual male multiple or female model all six is same you shortcut so this archaic english is more closer but it may be difficult for the modern people to understand but there are other people who have made it easy probably feel overall i feel the commentary that he has given and the footnotes and the index topic wise i recommend for a non-muslim as well as for muslim this is one of the good english translations available the other one is the international which has been translated a few years back by three american reward sisters and the english is more simple and it is more modern the other translation is the noble quran hillary and the dr mohsen khan but this i would not recommend it to be given to non-muslims muslims fine because they're too many brackets in the footnotes they have many hadith you know bukhari muslim which is good for the muslims but there's so many brackets that you fail to realize who is saying that allah or the person who's translated it so you give footnotes no problem but you give too many blackheads you fail to realize is this message from the translator or from allah so that's the reason it is good for references bukhari muslim say hadith but for non-muslim i personally don't advise you to give that the other fourth translation which is good is by mawlana abdullah it's good for comparative religion he give references from the bible you've referenced it from the hindu scriptures it's ever been four volumes the other one is muhammad muhammad muhammadu you know the britisher even that translation is good but it doesn't have any commentary the other one good is by muhammad assad muhammad said this translation is good he quotes very often zamakshiri and he gives root words of arabic but you have to be careful because zamakshari is a logical tough seed but sometimes it deviates from this hadith you have to be careful i normally prefer translations which are directly done from arabic into that language so english translation translated directly from arabic to english are the best there are other translations which are translated from arabic to urdu and then english like mawlana mudi the author of quran by spirit they are good but the chances of error is more because someone transform arabic to urdu then from urdu to english and that's what happened with maura module this translation and the second edition the second translation done by farisha kansai is far better so this was just a few translations which i named the other by tb irvin tbring the translation more of american english and there are several other translations"
