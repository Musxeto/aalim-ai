Adam in arafa and it says that he took a covenant from the loins of the children of Adam from The Descendant and took a covenant and he bought them from the loins and Scattered them like ants on the fields of arafa and then is quoted the verse of the Quran of Surah chapter number 7 verse number 172 where it says that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala took a covant from the loin of children of Adam from The Descendants and asked them am I not your lord and they replied yes we testify you are a Lord and Allah continues lest on the day of judgment you will say that you were not mindful that means Allah

the Quran in Surah AR chapter number 7 verse number 172 that means on y Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala took a covenant from all the human beings Point number three is that Y is the day when our Dean was completed and Allah has fulfilled his favor on the human beings it's mentioned in s bukari Point number one Hadith number 45 that Omar he narrates that a Jew came to him and asked him oh chief of the Believers there is a verse in your Quran which if it was mentioned in our book we would have celebrated it as e so Omar asked which is the verse and the Jews said it's mentioned in the Quran and he quotes Sur MAA 5 verse number three where Allah says on this day I have perfected your religion for you and have completed my favor on you and have chosen for Islam Omar replies we know this was it was revealed on a Friday on the day of arfa that means it was the day of arafa when Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala he perfected the religion of Islam and completed his favor on the human beings and has chosen Islam for us this is the third virtue of ARA the fourth virtue of araa is that arafa is also a day of Eid and it's mentioned in number three Hadith number 2419 that the prophet said the the nth of that is the 10th of and these are the three days following Eid the 11th 12th and 13th of zaj these are the days of Eid these are the days of Celebration these are the days of eating and drinking so Y for the people ofaa in araa it's an eat day for them the fifth virtue of arafa is that it is the day where Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala forgives and frees the maximum slaves it is called the day of forgiveness and it's a mentioned in number three Hadith number 36 AA the wife of the Prophet said that the prophet narrated that on no day does Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala forgive his servants and free his slaves whether the male or female then on the day of arafa and he comes close to the angels and he boasts to them about them and says what do they want that means this day of arafa is also called the day of forgiveness and on this day Allah subhana wa taala frees the maximum slaves ever in the full year on this day of araa from the Hellfire the sixth virtue of arfa is that it's mentioned in ji verm number three Hadith number 3585 that the Beloved Prophet said on the day of Allah subhana wa ta'ala hears the supplication the maximum and I and the earlier prophets they recited that there is no one worthy of worship except Allah and he has got no Partners to him belong all the domain and all pra are du to him alone and he has power all things this is the best Dua that anyone can do on y that was recommended by the prophet it is called the day of Supplication and the seventh virtue of arafa is that our beloved Prophet said as I mentioned earlier in say Muslim volume number three Hadith number 2747 the prophet said that fasting on the day of arafa expiates your sins of the previous year and the coming year and the same information is repeated in MA Vol number two Hadith number 1 1730 where the Prophet said that anyone who fast on y his sins of the previous year and the next year are exper so these were the Seven Virtues Of y the day of ARA now we'll discuss the last and the fourth point that is that is the Eid or the day of sacrifice the Eid of sacrifice or the day of sacrifice and we know that Allah subhana wa ta'ala had asked Prophet ibraim that what do you love the most in this world but natur after Allah subhana tala he said my son Isam and Allah tests ibraim Alam that can you sacrifice him for me and ibam goes and tells his son is am and he said don't worry father you will find me steadfast and on the instruction of Allah subh when he's about to sacrifice his son Allah replaces him with the sacrifice of animal and this is what we remember every year in that we should be able to sacrifice anything in this world for the sake of Allah subhana tala and during day of sacrifice of sacrifice if we have the means we sacrifice an animal for one person it is a goat or if you want a big animal like a cow or a camel it can be for seven people and it's mentioned in Surah Haj chapter number 22 verse number 37 it is not their meat or blood that reaches Allah subhana tala but it is a party with reach Allah tala so we don't sacrifice so that the blood and the meat to Allah tala but we do it for our tawa our pety should reach Allah subhana tala and what do we do with the sacrifice sacrifice the animal we distribute it amongst the poor people amongst the friends amongst the relatives and keep some for ourselves normally it is recommended that minimum one3 should be given to the poor people oneir to the family and friends and the maximum you can keep yourself is one3 this is a practice"
