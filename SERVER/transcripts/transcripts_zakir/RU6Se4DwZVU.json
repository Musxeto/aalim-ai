  "transcript": "today we have in the international media there is a very common statement which is repeatedly bombarded especially in the western media and that statement is all muslims are not terrorists but all terrorists are muslims and this statement was even imported to india especially after the 11th of july the serial trained bombers that took place in bombay especially to bombay and we find that even in india especially in bombay people kept on repeating the statement that all muslims are not terrorists but all terrorists are muslims let us analyze today what do the historical records tell us and what does the data on terrorist attack that is available in word district what do they tell us when we look at the records in 19th century we can hardly find any terrorist attacks have been done by muslims time does not permit them to speak about the details of the attacks taking place in 19th century i'll just mention a couple of them we know that in 1881 star alexander ii of russia he was assassinated he was traveling in a bulletproof carriage in saint petersburg street there was a bomb that kills innocent 21 bystanders he comes out of the bulletproof carriage another bomb comes and he's killed he was not killed by a muslim he was killed by ignis he was a pole from barbus he was a non-muslim he was anarchist we know in 1886 there was a bomb blast that took place in the hay market in chicago during the labor rally and 12 innocent people were killed one amongst them was a policeman by the name of dejin later on seven police men were injured and they died in the hospital the people responsible for this act they were not muslims there were eight anarchists all of them non-muslims when we analyze the record of the terrorist attacks that have taken place in the 20th century we know from the historical records that on the 6th of september 1901 the then president of usa william mckinley he was assassinated by an anarchist by the name of leon he was shot twice by leon he was a non-muslim on the 1st of october 1910 there was a bomb blast that took place in the los angeles times newspaper building in which 21 innocent people were killed the people responsible for this bomb blast there were two christians by the name of james and joseph they were union leaders they were non-muslims we know that on the 28th of june 1914 in sarawak friends the arc duke of austria along with his wife they were assassinated which precipitated the world war one the people responsible for this assassination they were called the young bosnia most of them they were serbs they were not muslims from historical record we come to know that on the 16th of april 925 there was a bomb blast that took place in saint nadalia church in sophia the capital of bulgaria in which more than 150 innocent people were killed and more than 500 injured it was the biggest attack that has taken place on the side of bulgaria it was conducted by the bulgarian communist party they were not muslims we know from historical records that on the 9th of october 1934 king alexander one of yugoslavia he was assassinated by a gunman by the name of lada georgif he was a non-muslim the first u.s plane to be hijacked it was not by a muslim it was by a non-muslim by the name of artist he hijacked the u.s airliner to cuba and he later on got their asylum when we go to the records of terrorist attacks done we come to know that in the year 1968 the ambassador to got mala he was assassinated by non-muslim in 1969 the ambassador to japan he was knifed by japanese non-muslim the ambassador to brazil 1969 he was kidnapped by a non-muslim the famous attack the oklahoma bombing which took place on 19th of april 1995 where there was a truck loaded with a bomb which rammed into the federal building in oklahoma which killed 166 innocent human beings and hundreds other were injured initially it came in the press middle east conspiracy for days together later on they came to know it were two right-wing activists christians by the name of timothy and terry who were responsible for the bombing of the federal building in oklahoma but when this news comes it comes for a couple of days and then it vanishes but before for several days middle east conspiracy middle east conspiracy after world war ii from 1941 to 1948 in a span of eight years 259 terrorist attacks were conducted by jewish terrorists by many organizations ignoon stern gang hagana and we know of the famous bombing of king david hotel which took place on the 22nd of july 1946 they were conducted by the leadership of manikin begin in which 91 innocent people were killed out of which 28 were british 41 were arabs 17 jews and five others the ignorant group they dressed up as arabs to show as though muslims did the bombing and the person responsible was mannequin begin and it was the biggest terrorist attack against the history of british mandate in which 91 people were killed and at that time manny can begin he was called as terrorist number one by the british government later on after a few years he becomes the prime minister of israel and later on after a few years he gets the nobel prize for peace imagine a person who has killed it a person who has killed hundreds and thousands of innocent human beings becomes the prime minister of israel and later on gets the nobel prize for peace and most of the groups that were fighting like stern gang ignorant haganah all of these jewish groups and the leaders like yeti tax ribbon mannequin begin aerial sharon later on became prime ministers and high holding ranks in the state of israel and all of them they were fighting for a jewish state if you see the world map before 1945 israel did not exist israel didn't exist these jewish groups they were called as terrorists by the britishers they fought for a jewish state later on with power they grabbed the land and they kick the palestinians out and now the same people are calling the same palestinians who are fighting for a more just cause for getting the land back and they are labeled today as terrorists by the israelis imagine hitler insulated six million jews he kicks the jewish community out why should they come to palestine the palestinians they welcome the cousins with open hands if they should take a land they should go back to germany they should go back to europe imagine the palestinians welcome the cousins imagine suppose a visitor comes to your house being a stranger you welcome in your house after a few days he kicks you out of the house and when you cry at the doorstep i want my house back people call you a terrorist this is exactly what has happened today the palestinians they are called as terrorists for what they only want the land back and so-called people most of these powerful first world countries they are agreeing with this unjust cause we know that in germany from historical records from 1968 to 1992 the butterburn of gang they killed several innocent human beings in italy we come to know from records about the red brigades which has killed several innocent human beings they were also responsible for kidnapping the prime minister of italy aldo moro and after 55 days they killed him further when we come a similar gang a similar terrorist outfit we know was also in japan the japanese dead army they was with this cult om shirito they put this cult and they tried to kill thousands of people in the tokyo subway by the nerve gas but unfortunately they weren't very successful they were only able to kill 12 people but more than 5 700 innocent human beings they were injured and wounded because of this nerve gas they will put this in uk for about 100 years the ira irish republican army they are conducting attacks against uk they are catholics but they are never called as catholic terrorists they are called as ira and we know they have conducted several terrorist attacks only in 1972 three bomb blasts were done in the first one seven people were killed and the second one 11 were killed and third one nine were killed in 1974 there were two bomb blasts in the pub they killed five erosion people and injured 44 people in the birmingham pub 21 innocent people were killed by the bomb blast and 182 were injured time doesn't permit to speak about all the activities they did i'm just mentioning a few just at random in 1996 they did a bomb blast in london where two people were killed and more than 100 were injured further 1996 a bomb blast was done in the shopping area of manchester where 206 people were injured in 1998 bambridge bomb blast where 500 pounds of bomb was loaded in a car in which 35 innocent people were injured in the same year we know from records about the omaha blast where a 500 pound of bomb was put in a car and 29 innocent people were killed and 330 were injured all these records are from non-muslim sources they have not been written by muslims all from non-muslim sources from amnesty report from bbc if you go on the internet you can cross check but many a times when the number is big there may be a difference like today we know how many people killed 296 one report says 294 one says 293 so i played safe and say more than 290. the report if it's a large number may differ by few here and there if it's a small number it's precise all these by non-muslim sources in 2001 the bbc was born by ira but these people they are not called as catholic terrorists today the uk government is more afraid of muslim terrorists i don't know from the records of the uk government how many confirmed muslim terrorists have done bomb blast in uk even the london bombing of 7th of july there is no confirmed report they are suspected to be muslims it's not confirmed in which more than 50 people were killed one report says 50 to 1 report says 56. therefore i said more than 50 people were killed even if you agree for sake of argument that they were muslims who did the 7th july bomb blast in their 2005. yet they come nowhere close to ira ira puts these bomb blasts to shame they have killed hundreds and thousands of people yet today the uk government is more afraid ira is doing since more than 100 years but because of the advice of george bush tony blair is more afraid of the muslim terrorists rather than the problem which is there for more than 100 years we know from historical records that in spain and france the terrorist organization is eta they have conducted 36 attacks and in africa there are so many organizations the list is exhaustive but the one which is worth noting and one of the most notorious is called as the lord's salvation army it's a christian terrorist organization they train young children to commit terrorist attacks when we come to sri lanka we know of the ltte tamil tigers they are supposed to be one of the most notorious most violent of all the terrorist organizations in the world they are the people who are experts in suicide bombing and they even take help of children they train them and they let them take part in suicide bombing normally people are known that the palestinians who said bombing iraqis who said bombing if you're historical record the people who have populists who said bombing are the ltte tamil tigers who are they they're hindus but the indian report doesn't say hindu terrorists they say ltte when we come to india many a times most of the terrorist attacks that we are of majority of them they talk about kashmiri militants whether the attacks are right or wrong we can discuss some other time but how many times do we hear and what justice hospital said he named many of the terrorist attacks taking place in india i wonder how many of the people in the audience have heard of them in the newspapers how many those people are involved like honorable people like justice albert saresh and those in the field aware of it but the general masters we aren't aware of it minimum terrorist attacks are talked about most often they talked about muslim terrorists why in india there are terrorist organizations belonging to almost all different religions almost all we know of the sikh terrorist organization brindinwala group in punjab we know that the indian government on the 5th of june 1984 they took over the golden temple in which 100 human beings were killed in retaliation a few months later on 31st of october 1984 the then prime minister shrimad indira gandhi she was assassinated by one of a security guard who was sick if you go to the south asian terrorism hotel site not run by muslims run by non-muslims and you see the list of terrorist attacks done by all the people the muslims are in a minority but that's never highlighted in the media if you go to northeast of india if we go to tripura the christian terrorist organization exists like attf all tripura tiger force nlft national liberation in front of tripura the christians they have killed several hindus reports if you go on the site four hindus killed eight hindus killed on 2nd october 2004 44 hindus were killed and several were injured by this group there were christians in assam ulfah ulfah alone in a span of the past 16 years from 1990 to 2006 they have conducted successfully 749 terrorist attacks they will put the kashmir militants to shame 749 confirmed terrorist attacks but when we read in the newspaper we only know about the kashmiri attacks and i remember a couple of years back i am called alhamdulillah by god's grace by several parts of india for several parts of the world i had many invitations from kashmir but is it the right time to go yes or no finally in september 2003 i decided to go to kashmir and there i gave a talk in srinagar and they told me the organizers that in the past 14 years first time the government gave permission for a public talk and they organized my talk in polar grounds in kashmir in which hundred thousand people attended in all this turmoil and the government gave me security i was wondering why are these people with machine gun with me i went off to the various sides gold mark telegram gave talks etc fine i didn't think it was required later on i happen to go to assam to give talks and the moment i land on the airport i find security guards around me i said why and there i thanked god alhamdulillah if they would not have been there i wouldn't have come back here i did not know i did not know that so many terrorists are there the ulfa are trained only to target the muslims they're hindus how many times does the press the media report about them because it's not tantalizing these reports may come in the news brief it does appear news briefs how many people note it never in the headlines in news briefs amongst the organizations terrorist organizations the naxalites we know of the moist the moore's communist number one terrorist attacks that have been done in india maximum are by the moist only in nepal in the past seven years they have conducted nine trans attacks and out of the 600 districts in india according to the indian government according to the site on terrorism they say that they are present in 150 districts of india they have done terrorist attacks in one third parts of india number one if you compare the people they have killed the attacks they have done compared to the kashmir militants it's nowhere comparable the maoists are a bigger danger for india but yet we find that the government is more afraid of the muslim terrorists why the reason is george bush just a couple of days back on the 9th of september an article came in times offender not on the front page inside but quite a big article that 875 rockets a hall of ammunition 875 rockets which was supposed to be supplied to the moorist they were intercepted and they were confiscated and 30 rocket launchers imagine it is the biggest hall in the history of india that any terrorist organization that the government has caught 875 rockets they can wage a war against indian army and the djp of andhra pradesh in hyderabad he was shocked he said that with these rocket launchers they can attack any police station any tanks of the indian government from a distance of 600 meters from more than half a kilometer away they can attack the indian tanks the indian police station and you can't do anything rocket launchers yet we see people are more afraid of people who have a beard people are wearing a cap people have trousers above the ankle are they more dangerous than rocket launchers"
