  "transcript": "before we discuss the concept of God in Christianity I would like to clarify a few points Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest Messengers almighty God we believe he was the Messiah transcended Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christians who did not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God permission we believe he healed those born blind and lepers with God's permission the Christians and the Muslims we are going together one may ask then where is The Parting of faith The Parting of ways is that many Christians believe or most of the Christians believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he claimed Divinity they believe that he was almighty God in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement there is not a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God always says worship me in fact he freed the Bible it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon you said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devils with the spirit of God Gospel of you chapter number 11 verse number 20. I with the Finger of God cast out Devil's Gospel of John chapter number five verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God he's a Muslim as I mentioned Muslim means a person who submits civil to God and Jesus Christ peace be upon him said not my will but the will of almighty God so in Arabic we say is Muslim therefore we say Jesus Christ peace be upon him was one of the mightiest Messengers almighty God and he further clarified in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 24 he said that the words that you hear are not mine but my father's were sent to me it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number three Jesus Christ peace be upon him said this is life eternal so that you may know one true God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 it says amen of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and your witness to it a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by Manuel and when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was asked that which is the first of The Commandments he repeated Verbatim what was said by Moses peace be upon him earlier it's mentioned in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said which means hero Israel the Lord our God is one Lord so if you read the Bible you shall understand the concept of God in Christianity and understand Christianity in the right perspective"
