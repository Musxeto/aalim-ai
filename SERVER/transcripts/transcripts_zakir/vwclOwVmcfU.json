  "title": "I convey to Hindus from Upanishad and Yajurveda that God is only one and has no ldols or Images.",
  "transcript": "the next question posed by nadir ahmad from bangladesh sir i am 20 years old and really inspired by you in the field of dawah when i try to convey the message of allah to the hindus using the references of chandogya and swatha sathar upanishad and yajurveda that god is only one he has got no idols no images etc some hindus counter me by saying that they believe god is one but god has come to earth in different forms and different ways from age to age like shiva brahma vishnu etc but we worship all his forms how can i reply to them logically the brother has the question that when he tries to convince the hindus about the oneness of allah regarding monotheism they agree that god is one but they say that god has come in different forms like in the form of shiva brahma vishnu how do i reply to them what they are referring to is authar hindus believe that almighty god has come down on the face of the earth in the form of atar now what is the meaning of the word atar is coming from sanskrit word meaning to descend down and here according to sansa's grammar it means that some possession of allah is descending down some thing possessed by god is descending it cannot be god himself so anyone who says that author means god himself coming down is totally wrong it's against the rules of sanskrit it means allah has sent down someone so in the real context what they're talking is about messengers and that's what we believe that allah subhanahu wa has sent 124 thousand prophets on the face of the earth by name twenty-five are mission in the quran adam noah abraham moses jesus muhammad may peace be upon them all but a beloved prophet muslim said that allah subhanahu wa allah has sent down 124 000 prophets on the face of the earth maybe these people ram krishna they were prophets of god maybe though the name is not mentioned so i cannot say rama salam but maybe they are prophets but even if they were prophets of god they were sent only for those people at that time because all the messengers and prophets that came before the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him they were sent only for those people and for that time prophet muhammad peace be upon him because he was the last and final messenger he was sent for the whole of humanity so what we have to understand that the author they are talking about is the same concept as the messengers as prophets what we muslim believe so we have no objection that maybe ram was a prophet maybe krishna was the prophet maybe brahma the prophet we have no problem but there were prophets of god and they were not god themselves because the vedas clearly mentioned that in fatima in sanskrit means an image a photograph a painting a sculpture a statue an idol so natasha patimasti of that god there is no prathima there is no painting there is no photograph there is no idea there is no sculpture there is no image so we have no problem in believing that these were messengers but surely they wanted almighty god so if you explain the concept of that inshallah you will be able to get them closer to islam"
