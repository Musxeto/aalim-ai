  "transcript": "my name is Jack Elphinstone and when I'm engineer in your talk earlier you mentioned that one of the reasons you shouldn't visit Mecca in your life is because that was the first place that Allah was worshiped but we know that Allah was worshipped long before we're in Adam Noah and Moses and many prophets worship teller but that wasn't in Mecca so explain for me it clarify was Mecca the first place that Allah was worshipped or before that's very good question that it's mentioned in the Bible and also mentioned in the Quran Bible says blessed are those people who wizard the valley of baka that's Mecca and the Quran says in surah al-e-imran chapter 3 was 96 the first place of worship was Makkah but better that's the question that there were many prophets who came before Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him you know Moses Jesus Abraham Adam peace be upon them so how can make her be the first place brother Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him he was not the first messenger he was the last and final messenger and Mecca was there much before it was not the sacred place after Prophet Muhammad was born peace be upon him it was earlier Makkah was a sacred place of worship much before it's mentioned in the Quran that Abraham peace be upon him he rebelled along with the son smile they rebuilt the kaaba and the hadeeth mentioned it was even they at the realm of Adam peace be upon him so it's coming right down the ages so it was they right before they for the Quran says the first place of worship is Makkah and later on when the Qibla was towards Mazda doxa then later on it was bought to Makkah but the first earlier place of worship was Makkah then it came back to Makkah hope the answer the question [Applause]"
