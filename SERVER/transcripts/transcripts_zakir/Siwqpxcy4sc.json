  "transcript": "regarding the situation uh of a traveler is it forbidden or optional uh for a traveler to fast Allah says in the Quran inah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 that if you are ill or on a journey the prescribed number of days for fasting can be made later on so this is a concession given that means if you want to fast you can fast if you want to exempt yourself exempt but later on you have to make up the period Allah subhana tala here has compared The Traveler and kept him or her in the same category as the person who because the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said it's mentioned inkari number three Hadith number 1804 our beloved Prophet said that traveling is a punishment or when a person goes on a journey it's like a punishment that means it's difficult he has to undergo many hardships and it is mentioned in s bukari Vol number three book of fasting Hadith number 1943 there was a Hamza pleased with him and he used to always fast even on a journey so he asked the prophet that should he fast on a journey or not so the prophet said if you wish to fast you can fast if you don't to fast you don't fast that means it was optional if a person wanted to fast he could fast if he didn't want he need not fast for example example if a person who used to traveling and he does not find any hardship and if he fast there's no problem it's good for him or if a person feels hardship and doesn't want to fast then he need not fast and this you come to know from the Hadith of anas M be pleased with him he said it's mentioned in s bukari number three Hadith number 19 1947 where anas pleas with him he says then when we used to travel with the prophet some of the companions they fasted some of them did not fast but those who kept the fast did not criticize those who did not keep the fast and those who did not fast they did not criticize those who fasted so basically it's optional those who can take the strain and want to fast they can those who don't want it's up to them logically from there we we can deduce that uh it's an optional that's right fast but if a person decides to opt to fast whilst traveling they in a situation where they get more reward from Allah Allah subh says in the previous verse in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 184 that those who are ill or on a journey they can make up their fast later on or for a person for whom fasting is difficult he can either fast or he can give a ransom feeding of indigent person but let them know that fasting is better so this proes that fasting is better though they Exempted if they want there's no sin on them they can keep it up later on but it is better and we find in several Hadith if you read the Hadith of the Beloved Prophet wasallam it's mentioned in say Muslim volume number two book of fasting Hadith number 2492 that there was a time when the sahabas they traveled with the prophet and because it was very hot none of them fasted except the prophet m s wasallam and one sahaba Abdullah Bin AB there another Hadith several other Hadith in s Muslim m 2 book of fasting had number 2472 and 2473 that the companion is a tell with the prophet and some of the companion fasted some didn't fast and when the prophet when he came to know that it was becoming difficult for the companions to fast he broke the fast in another Hadith say Muslim volume number two book of fasting Hadith number 2 472 once when the prophet in the year of the victory of Makkah he goes to a place along with the sahabas and he realizes that some of the sahabas who were fasting they were finding difficult to fast so the prophet at the ass prayer time he took a goblet of water and he drank he broke the fast so that it become easier for the other but from all these Hadith we come to know that the prophet preferred to fast unless it was difficult and he broke the fast why because the other companions they found it difficult he did not want to put them in a critical situation therefore he broke the fast but from here we come to know that fasting is better if you can if you cannot then there's no problem you may not fast and you can make up the fast later on further we come to know that it is preferable to fast why because if a person delays his fasting if he's traveling and God forbid if his life comes to an end and whatever it is then that would yet be a thing which is left for him to do a so if a person can fast while traveling it's preferable that he fast and furthermore when you're traveling in the month of Ramadan even the people around you they fast so it's easier in that sense when you come back home and the month of Ramadan is over and if you individually want to fast and no one else is fasting it becomes many of times difficult so that's one of the reasons also that if you can do it with the hardship and fast while traveling it's better and even Saab is more"
