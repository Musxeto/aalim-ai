  "transcript": "the second place where the Quran refers to the first St of is in Surah alhaj chapter number 22 verse number 28 Allah says that they witness the benefits which have been provided and they celebrate the name of Allah subhah wa ta'ala through the days appointed here these days are referring to the first 10 days of the and ha alalani may Allah have mercy on him he writes in that these first 10 days of zulah are the only 10 days in the full year where any Muslim can simultaneously perform all the Five Pillars all the five far of Islam if he wants to yes he can Implement on the he can offer Salah Su together in the first 10 days he can give zakat if he hasn't given give obligatory charity or give extra charity he can fast and he can also perform Hajj these are the only days in the full year where a person can simultaneously perform all the five pill of Islam it is mentioned in s bukari volume number two Hadith number 969 Abbas may Allah be peace with him he said that the Beloved prophet wasam said there are no good deeds done on any other days better then done during the first 10 days of D done during these days and the sahabas the companions they asked not even Jihad and the prophet replied not even Jihad unless a person puts in danger his life life and wealth in the way of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and does not return with any that means he goes for Jihad and he's mared in the way of Allah subhana tala that means our beloved Prophet Mall wasallam said the Good Deeds Done during the first 10 days of Z better than any deed done on any other days of the year including Jihad unless if the person is mared and he loses his wealth and life during Jihad that's the only one good deed which cannot be better other the deeds done on the first 10 days of Z are better than any deed done on any other day of the year it is so important and unfortunately this Sunnah of doing good deeds during the first tenders of is forgotten it's further mentioned in sah Muslim Point number three Hadith number 2747 when the prophet was asked regarding fasting on y the prophet said it expiates the sins of the previous year and the coming year that means the most important fast after the F fast of Ramadan is fasting on y it expiates your sins of the previous year as well as the coming year there are some Scholars who say that the fasting of Ashura the 10th of muham is the most important because there's a Hadith that the most important fast after the F fast is the fasting on y but the differ opinion but the correct opinion is that y fasting is far superior because it expiates the sins of the previous year and the following year whereas fasting on Ashura expiates only the sins of the previous year but there's unanimous agreement that these two fast of Y and fasting on Ashura are the two most important fast after the fasting of the month of Ramadan it's mentioned in Sun AB da Vol number three Hadith number 2437 that one of the Vives of the Prophet said that the messenger of Allah fasted during the first nine days of D and during ashur and three days every month the first Monday and two Thursdays so from this Hadith we come to know that the prophet fasted the first nine days of the that means it is highly recommended to fast on all the first nine days of the one may ask why not fast all the 10 days of the answer is given in sari number three Hadith number 1991 where the Beloved Prophet said that he forbid fasting on and these are the two eids of celebration of eating and drinking so it is prohibited to fast on the two and that's the reason we don't have to fast the first 10 days of though the first 10 days are the most important days of the year we only fast during the first nine days of it further mentioned in say Muslim number three Hadith number 2 6 79 the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that no one shall enter Paradise except a Believer and the days of mina are the days of eating and drinking that means a Muslim should not even fast on the three days following the that is the 11th 12th and 13th of Z because these are the days of eating and drinking and feasting so besides the Eid day a Muslim should not even fast on the that is 11th 12th and 13th of Z"
