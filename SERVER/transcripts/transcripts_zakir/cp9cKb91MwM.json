  "transcript": "what is the Islamic dress code for men and women Islam quite a long question as far as the Islamic dress code is concerned there are few guidelines given in the Quran as well as the Hadith Allah first speaks about the hijab for the male then for the female in the Quran Allah says in the Quran in Sur chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his G and guard his modesty that means whenever a man looks at a woman any breathing thought comes he should lower his gaze once there was a person Muslim staring at a girl for a long time I brother what are you doing it's Haram in Islam so he said our beloved Prophet said the first glance is Forgiven the second is prohibited I have not completed half my glance that does not mean you can look at a girl for 10 minutes without blinking and saying I have not completed my glance later on comes the dress code the next ver speaks about the hijab for the woman it's mentioned Sur n chapter number 24 verse number 31 say to the believing woman that she should lower the Gaze and guard her modesty and display not a beauty except what appears ordinally off and to draw a head covering over the bosom and dis spend of beauty except to her husband her son and a big list of mam the close El who she can't marry is given basically there are six criteria for the hijab for the man and woman the first is the extent which for the man is from the NV to the knee for the woman the complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and the hands up to the wrist there are some Scholars who say that even this should be covered the remaining five criteria are the same for the man and the woman the second is the clothes they we it should not be tight so that it reveals the figure third it should not be transparent or translucent so that you can see through number four it should not be So Glamorous so that it attacks the opposite sex number five it should not resemble that of the unbeliever and there's a Hadith in s Muslim volume number three in the book of dress Hadith number 5173 where once a person was wearing a saffron colored clothes so the prophet said that remove this color this color resembles that of the unbeliever saff is the color of the unbeliever so you should not wear clothes that resemble that of the unbeliever and especially that with the signs of unbeliever like wearing a cross the sign of Christianity putting a vermillon or TK of Hinduism so you should not wear those which are signs of the unbeliever and the sixth criteria is you should not wear clothes that of the opposite sex there's a Hadith in s bukari volume number seven the book of dress Hadith number 5885 where the Prophet said the men should not behave like the woman and should not wear clothes like that of the woman and the women should not behave like men should not have manners like men and should not wear clothes Etc so these are the basic basically six criteria of hijab but this one talks about the clothes besides this for the complete hijab it even includes the way a person talks the way a person walks the way a person thinks the way a person carries him or herself all this put together is a hijab and Allah further says in the Quran in Surah aab chapter number 33 verse number 59 oh Prophet tell the believing women that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak so that they shall be recognized and it prevent them from being molested and I always give an example that if the two twin sisters were very beautiful equally beautiful if they're walking down the streets of maybe London the city where you stay and if one of the sisters is wearing the complete hijab complete body covered except the face and hand up to the wrist and the other twin sister who equ beautiful she's wearing the Western cloths mini skirts are sh and around the corner there is a holigan who waiting for a catch I want to ask you the question which girl will it tease will it tease the girl wearing the the Min skirt or will it tease the girl wearing the hijab which girl will it tease definitely the one with the Min skirt that's right so Quran rightly says that hijab has been prescribed for the woman so that it will prevent them from being molested so these are the basic six criteria of hijab and furthermore there are other rulings about clothes Etc as far as the G clothes are concerned for the men our beloved Prophet said that gold and silk are prohibited it's mentioned n book of zenat chapter number 40 Hadith number 5147 where the Beloved Prophet said two things gold and silk are forbidden for the males of my um but they're permissible for the females furthermore you get guidance from the Hadith that the to of the lower garment should be above the ankle it should not be below the ankle and it's mentioned in the Hadith of s bukari volume number 7 book of dress Hadith number 5787 the Beloved Prophet said that the isar the that hangs below the ankle that will be in fire as we discussed in the previous episode wearing trousers and lower garment below the ankle is prohibited further we get guidance that wearing dress of Fame and those which make you outstanding as compared to the other people around you like those that the Kings we and the leaders proving that they are superior it is prohibited it's mentioned in Sunan Abu daud Hadith number number 4018 and 4019 that the person who wears the clothes for fame and for glamour Allah subhanahu wa taal will clothe him with that on the day of resurrection and the other version says that Allah will clothe him with disgrace on the day of judgment on the day of Resurrection there are further guidelines given that it's preferable that you wear white clothes and a prophet said is mentioned in Sun Abu da in the book of dress volume number three Hadith number 4050 the prophet said that wear white garments because they are the best of your garments and Shout the dead person in white and further I beloved Prophet M wasallam said it's mentioned in Abu da volume number three in the book of dress Hadith number 4129 the prophet said that whenever you wear a garment or do wo you start with the right hand so this is also Sunnah that when you're wearing a garment start with the right hand so these are the few rulings which we get in the Quran and the Hadith regarding the hijab the desk code and regarding what you can follow of the Sunnah as far as when the this is concerned"
