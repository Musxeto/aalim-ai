  "transcript": "whenever you have any equipment along with equipment comes an instruction manual the more complicated the equipment the more requirement of an instruction manual so that you know how to use the equipment if you allow me to call the human being a machine I would say it is the most complicated machine in the world it is more complicated than the highest computer in the world don't think we require an instruction manual the human being which is the most complicated machine if you allow me to call it a machine more than the most advanced computer in the world don't you think it requires an instruction manual the instruction manual for the human being it is the Glorious Quran the Glorious Quran is the last and final instruction manual revealed by the creator of the human being that is Allah subhana wa taala Allah says in the Glorious Quran in Surah M chapter number 67 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in Deeds as I told you earlier that Allah is testing us for Allah it's very easy for Allah to make the Palestinians win over Israel is Allah is testing us are they struggling and striving for the cause of Allah Allah is testing ing all the human beings in the world are you standing for the truth so this life according to the Glorious Quran is a test for the yearafter if we pass this test we go to Jenna Paradise if we fail we go to hell we go to Janam Allah says in the Quran inah darat chapter number 51 verse number 56 that I've created the and the human beings not but to worship me what is the purpose of our life why are we here have we ever thought what are we doing here Allah gives the answer in Surah Darter 51 verse 56 that Allah has created the Jin and the men not but to worship him so we are in this world for the test for the Hereafter our role our purpose is to worship Allah subhana tala and I've given a talk and you should see this lecture of mine what is the purpose of a life when we obey the Commandments of Allah subhana tala we are doing I we are worshiping him if we follow his Commandments we are worshiping him if we stay away from things he has prohibited we are worshiping him I means following Allah subhana wa ta'ala first we have to understand the concept of Allah subhana wa tala and I'll be dealing in detail in my talk on Friday in Elin the concept of God in major world religion but the best reply that any Muslim can give you regarding the definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala is surlas chapter number 112 verse number 1 to4 where Allah says say he's Allah one and only Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not know he begotten there's nothing like him this is a four-line definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala mentioned in the Quran in Surah chapter number 112 verse number 1 to 4 if any person says so and so entity is God if he fits in this four-line definition of Sur class we Muslims have no objection in accepting that entity as Allah as God the first is say Allah one and only number two Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not noise he begotten there nothing like him this Sur class is the Touchstone of theology theom is God logim is study theology study of God and Touchstone you know when you go to buy and sell gold jewelry you go to a Goldsmith and you want to verify how pure is the gold so the gold smith takes the gold and rubs it against the touch tone and depending upon the color he tells you whether this gold is 24 karat gold whether 22 karat gold whether 18 karat gold or it may not be gold at all because All That Glitters Is Not Gold so surlas is the Touchstone of theology the God you are worshiping you put him into the test of surlas if the God you are worshiping passes the test of surlas he's a true God if he fails the test he's a false god"
