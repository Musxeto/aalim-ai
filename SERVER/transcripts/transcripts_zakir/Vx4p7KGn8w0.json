  "title": "Prabhakaran Asks Dr Zakir, \"Will Non Muslims go to Heaven or Hell?\" - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I'm working as a supervisor firstly I would like to know there is a common saying in most of the religions that whoever follows God's sayings religiously will go to heaven and if not will go to hell taking this into consideration I would like to know what will be the status of non-muslims on the day of judgment secondly I would like to know the importance of the holy month of Ramadan for the benefit of non-muslims who have come here and finally I would like to say from the little experience I have gained in my life I can strongly say Islam is the only religion which has clear-cut sound theoretical knowledge supported with logical examples with reasoning asked three questions or three statements he had made the first question was that all the religions say that if you don't believe in the Commandments of God you will go to hell what will happen to non-muslim on the day of judgment brother as I mentioned earlier the Quran says in Surah chapter 48 answers chapter 416 they may forgive anything but the sin of shirk associating partner with forgive so if a person died as a non-muslim any Associates partner with others he believes in false gods he does idle worship he shall never go to heaven compulsory will go to hell to go to heaven you have to believe in one God worship him alone and follow his Commandments regarding a second question what is the benefit of the month of Ramadan to the non-muslims Quran says chapter 2 verse number 83 fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-restraint the reason we fast is because we increase our taqwa Our God Consciousness our party Ramadan was the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide to the whole of humanity as the criteria to judge right from wrong Ramadan is this month in which the Glorious Quran the last and final Revelation was revealed to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and the Quran says this Quran is a guidance for Humanity not only for Muslims but for the Arabs for the whole of humanity and it is a criteria to just right from wrong so this month of Ramadan how does it benefit the non-muslims Quran was revealed in it as a guidance for whole of humanity Muslims and non-muslims furthermore beloved Prophet Muhammad in the month in which the satans they are imprisoned the Gates of Heaven open and the gates of hell are closed that means there are more chances you'll be good deeds a person does more good deeds in Ramadan the chances of women in bad Deeds is less as far as non-muslims The Message of Islam may go very well in the hearts of the non-muslims because the devil the Satan the imprisonment so more chances of the non-muslims accepting Islam more chances he'll come closer to Islam regarding a third statement you believe that Islam has got theoretical points in it and it is backed up with reason and logic so when you agree that Islam then rules and regulations which are backed up with reason and logic my question to you in this month of Ramadan then why don't you accept Islam it is not a question of accepting Islam for the matter of fact I do accept all the religions all the good things every religion is saying so I don't have any uh whether you say you believe in all the good things and all the religions that means there are some bad things in some religions correct I do agree strongly agree you're fine I want to ask you a simple question what do you think is bad in Islam practically I have not come across anything bad in Islam but maybe in practice people have even Islam don't talk about Muslim Muslim may be bad I'm not talking about Muslims okay talk about Islam you take good things of all the religions you also said you know there are bad things in other religions and you also said you don't know of anything bad in Islam so now in the other religions you are good and bad in this religion only good suppose I give you two glass of water one is pure water pure water and one drop of urine so which water will you drink so this is a pure religion absolutely pure without adulteration now when I realize it is pure when you are thirsty you'll drink the pure water no no I believe it is before but I won't drink it it doesn't make sense if I want to get admission in a university I do my survey this university is the best why don't you take admission no I'll think about it hi if you don't have the money to pay your fees fine University is very good but too expensive I can't afford the fee Islam is free if you agreed the best you have to accept it or maybe it's a hypocrisy see if I agreed the best I have to accept it if you know there are no Faults that means God will question you on the day of judgment if you agree God gave you the message in your heart it is the best religion why don't you accept it see if you agreed is the best it's illogical it's illogical not to accept it if you think there's something bad I will clarify a misconception now if you agree it's the best religion if you agree the most logical unless you are illogical if you are logical you have to agree the most logical religion unless you consider yourself to be logical brother you know sometimes with the emotions what will my mother say what would my father say what will Society the Muslim so these things may prevent you from accepting I agree it's difficult it's not easy brother but if you are logical if you are scientific you have to accept what is best therefore I say if someone proves to me any religion better than Islam I will accept it if someone proves to me today anytime there's any religion better than Islam I am ready to accept Hinduism I am not just talking I have discussions with the doctors of divinity with the top Christian I'm not call I'm a student I consider myself to be a student of comparative religion but I have dialogues and discussions and debates with the top scorers of Hinduism you know the most popular Hindu speaker is have you heard of him very much yes he agreed with the Quran I'm a big fan of him in fact you're a fan of him Masha Allah have you seen my debate with oh no I'm not saying so you should see the debate with your hero yeah I'm the student of Empire religion inshallah if I get an opportunity definitely and since you agree even he agreed that God has got no images he agreed in the truthfulness of the Quran unfortunately he didn't accept it you know why if you accept he will lose all the following I agree you agree do you have a following do you have a following Brother no I don't have any followers very good so what will you lose maybe some friendship maybe some relatives it's difficult it's difficult but if you know the truth you should accept it there's nothing wrong about it actually so far so far as of now I have not thought of about this because this is a very toughest and hardest thing in life to me I think today in the month of Ramadan you ask me how does it benefit non-muslims it benefits the non-muslims in opening the heart towards the truth so I request you to think it over if not today yet you have another three weeks another two three weeks you have till the month of Ramadan if not today except in the month of Ramadan it will benefit you and inshallah inshallah I can tell you that inshallah if accept Islam all your previous sins will be forgiven hundred percent so today if you accept Islam if suppose you die today I can tell for sure you will go to Jannah I am not sure about myself but about yourself I can tell you because the moment a person accepts Islam all these previous sins are forgiven if you accept Islam and if something happens to you today thank you very much foreign foreign thank you"
