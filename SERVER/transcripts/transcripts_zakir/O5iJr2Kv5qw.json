  "title": "If Food Particles stuck between the Teeth are Swallowed while Fasting, does this Invalidate ...",
  "transcript": "so Dr Zakia first question from the audience is in the case that after suhor a person has inadvertently has some food lodged in their teeth yes and as a result of swallowing and the normal processes of saliva around the mouth the food then is goes down the esophagus into the stomach okay they imbibe it they take it on does this situation mean they have invalidated their fast and furthermore just as a sort of addendum what's the situation when a person swallows phlegm or mucus as far as if a person has some food particles that have got stuck in between the teeth maybe after suhur and the fast starts if there are some food particles which are stuck between the teeth and if the person doesn't realize it and then if he follows it without realizing then the file doesn't break what if the food particles are big enough which a person can feel it then you have to spread out and unintentionally if that food particle after feeling goes in inside his throat then Allah will forgive you then the fast one invalidated but if you can feel it intentionally if he follows then the fast breaks unintentionally if you solve the does not break so if there is a particle which is big enough which can be spat outside you should spread outside and furthermore if suppose the gums bleed maybe after using the sewak or after brushing the teeth while fasting so the blood also should be spattered unintentionally certain blood goes down the throat into the stomach Allah will forgive you but intentionally you should not swallow any part as far as the second part of the question is concerned that is about mucus if it comes from the head maybe the pan is the sinus or from the nose or flim which comes while killing the truth if it comes into the throat and goes into the stomach without coming into the mouth it is quite natural it happens with many people the phlegm the mucus it comes gets stuck under the throat you clear the throat it goes down into your stomach it's perfectly fine it does not invite the fat because that's a natural process but if it comes into the mouth it should be spat out if the mucus of phlegm comes into your mouth you spread out unintentionally if it comes in the mouth and then you swallow it all I'll forgive you but intentionally it should not be followed"
