  "transcript": "I may not be able to complete all my points but a very important Point as far as implication the implications of toed in human life is concerned we always look forward for a profession and today the world thinks the best profession is a doctor next maybe engineer or it Etc and my mother wanted me to be a heart specialist I was inspired by she most of you know about it I chose to become a doctor because it was the best profession but after I realized that the best profession is not a doctor the best profession is that of calling people to Allah subhana tala Allah says in the Quran in 41 verse number 33 who is better in speech than one who invites to the way of thy law walks righteousness and says that I'm a Muslim so the best profession is a what was the profession of mamm sah wasallam doctor engineer it he was a d messenger of Allah and after the messengers of Allah have gone they will not come it is the Dies who get the people call people to Allah Allah says in Sur Iman CH 3 ver 104 that let their eyes out of your band of people that invite people to the truth and prevent them from doing what is wrong one of the main important implications of in human life is Da and Allah gives the master key for da Iman 3:64 Allah says oh people of the book come to come in terms as between us and you which is the first term that you worship but Allah that weo part that we erect not among ourselves Lords and P other than Allah and if they turn back we bear witness that we are Muslims bowing to Allah subhana tala this verse of the Quran according to me is the master key for dawa come to Common terms so when you're doing dawa with the non-muslim you should come to Common terms and the most important is that we worship none but Allah I tell to all my D students while doing dawa you can start with science and with history no problem but your main focus should be if you cannot remove the shik from the life of the non-muslim your dawa is useless you may convince him alcohol is Haram you may convince pooke is Haram he may stop his adultery he may stop it R but he does not stop sh your dawa is useless he will not go to Jenna so as a d your main aim should be you can start with commonalities science no problem but your main aim should be toed if you do not instill and remove the shik from the non-muslim of Da is useless and the most important Surah the concept of isah chapter number 112 verse number 1 to4 which says say Allah one and only Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begs not nor he begotten there nothing like him this is a four-line definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala which is given in the Glorious Quran any person saying so and so candidate is God if that candidate fits in this forline definition we Muslims have got no objection and accepting that candidate as God number one say is Allah one and only number two Allah Allah the absolute Eternal he begs not know as he begotten this is the Touchstone of theology surlas is the Lous Stone of theology in identifying Allah this is the litus test it is the touch Stone of Theology and doing dawa is a f in Islam Surah according to IM Shafi if this Surah alone was revealed it would have been sufficient for Allah says in Sur chapter number3 verse number 1 to3 I would like to end my talk with the Surah by the token of time man is weily in a state of loss except those who have faith those who have righteous deed those who exalt people to truth and those who exalt people to patience and perseverance there are minimum four criteria for any human being to go to Jenna number one IM number two righteous deed number three that is and is and number four inviting people to patience and perance you may be a very good Muslim you may be offering five times Salah you may be giving zakat you may be fasting in the month of Ramadan you may have gone for H but if you don't do da according to you shall not enter Jenna if Allah wants to forgive you and put you in Jenna that's Allah Progressive Allah's Progressive but under normal circumstances if you don't do dawa you will not enter jna you have to be minimum part-time D but the best is a full-time D I'd like to end my talk the implication of in human life the best profession Allah says in chapter 41 verse number 33 and my talk who is better in speech than one who invites to the way of thy Lord walks righteousness and says that I am a Muslim"
