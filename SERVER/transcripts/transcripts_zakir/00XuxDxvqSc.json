  "transcript": "good evening sir i'm ta anuragani i'm a final law student the i believe that terrorism could be stopped by uh at least could be reduced when people are taught about tolerance does islam preach about tolerance and if if it does do people who are in charge of imparting islam i mean i believe there are a lot of i don't know the exact term terminology there are gurus like in hinduism who teach islam to the other muslims so in that case do they do they impart preach tolerance the sister asks a good question and shiriti says that terrorism can be curbed by teaching tolerance and does islamic tolerance him do the religious studies of islam do they teach tolerance sister i said in my talk which i said a bit fast i didn't pay emphasis on it one of the criterias for any human being to go to jannah to go to heaven to go to paradise is tolerance allah says in the quran in surah al-assar chapter 103 verse number 123 what was by the token of time man is verily in a state of loss except those who have faith those who have righteous deed those who exhort people to truth that is and those who exhort people to patients and perseverance tolerance is one of the criteria to go to jannah if you are not tolerant according to surya sir you shall not go to jannah not only should you be tolerant you should even exhort people towards tolerance but tolerance by definition it has got various meanings and if you ask experts the tolerance also has a limit what do you mean by tolerance fine someone does something wrong to you you do not retaliate it's good till how long so tolerance also has a limit and in islam salim is a person who does means you could say that a person who causes harm the two types of one is the person who does harm to the others and another person who does harm to himself the two types of solemn and both are referred as solid one who does zoom on others another type who does on himself our beloved prophet muhammad said it's measure hadith of muslim if you see anything which is wrong going on if you can you should stop it with your hand if you cannot stop with the hand stop it with your mouth with your tongue if you cannot stop it with the tongue at least curse in your heart that the act is wrong and if you do that you are the lowest level of believer the lowest level so what we have to do that we have to be tolerant teach tolerance as allah says in the quran in surah chapter 253 but while doing sabha we should see to it that does not go beyond limit supper also has a limitation tolerance has a limitation so before it goes over limit if you see that a woman is being raped you can't tell the woman tolerate it no problem [Music] if god has given me strength if i see a man raping a woman i should stop it with my hand if i cannot do with man it will tell her by soft please don't rape in bombay an article a young girl 13 years girl she was raped by a man and there were five passengers only one person objected and he was kept quiet five people could opera that man was drunkard was drunk and they did not do anything what's happened to the humanity what has happened to humanity five young people cannot take care of one drunkard raping a girl in a train will you call this tolerance i would call it cowardice therefore i say that if these five people were terrorist terrorists in the sense terrorizing the anti-social element that person would have the quest to do it so what sister we have to encourage and sit with that tolerance level of every human being is increased at the same time they should not become cowards they should see to it that the anti-social element in the society they are reduced and we should collectively gather together and see to it that these people of anti-social people they are about to task hope they answer the question you"
