  "title": "How Can I Invite a Non-Muslim Friend to Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my question is how can I invite a non-muslim friend towards Islam the brother asked the question that how can I invite my non-muslim friend to islamesh mythologies are given in the Quran and I started this question after session by quoting verse of the Quran from Surah chapter number 16 verse number 25 he says which means invite all the way of their Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways their best and most gracious here Allah tells us that we have to call all different types of people to Allah and argue with them and reason with them in the ways their best most gracious so we have to realize that we have to call of non-muslim friends towards Islam towards Allah now as far as wisdom is concerned it may change depending upon the situation it is not thumb rule that this is the best way yes best way foreign but the best way keeps on changing Dependable situation for example if a patient comes to a doctor he gives the drugs depending upon the disease the person has or depending upon his sickness so the best way of Dava is to understand your non-muslim friend and after analyzing depending in which field of which category he falls that we have to do that can only come with experience that is the best so that is so some people would be speaking soft some people it may be speaking a bit loudly some people you may speak about science about history keeps on changing but this is the best way doing them as compulsory doing the best way is not compulsory it should be within the purview of the Islamic Sharia so it may change for a person who knew in the field you should at least make a beginning he should not wait till he becomes an expert because the Beloved Prophet mama said it's mentioned inside propagate even if you know one verse so even if you know one verse of Islam you at least propagate so whatever you know about Islam at least make a beginning don't wait till you become and then start doing dawa so whatever limited knowledge you have as long as you know it is correct you start start with it then inshallah as time goes on by the passage of time by experience you will learn a lot and one of the master keys different to me which is giving the Quran is the verse of the Quran from Imran chapter number three verse number 64. this I call as the master key for dawa it says come to Common terms as we us and you which is the first term that we worship them but Allah that we associate new partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and patent other than Allah so this is one of the good techniques which Allah recommends that come to Common terms has been assign you so if you know what are the common terms between you and your friend you can do dawa in a better way but this is later on if you want to start at least say something about Islam give him a booklet give me more videoke said talk to him and if you see our cassettes there are various different ways of your lava for example to a Hindu you can refer to my video cassette similarities between Hinduism and Islam if you want to dawa to a Christian then you can refer to my video because I said similarities Christianity then is the Quran God's word depending at least if you can frame out in which category he falls you can refer to the video cassette and try and reproduce at least something a best is give a book and then you can start talking and inshallah when you attend more of the talks and hear more of the cassettes will be in a better way in a position to convey the message we also conduct Dava training programs we train people how to do dawa and if you go on our website rf.net there is a dtp training program dawa training program which if you go through it you may get some knowledge inshallah hope that's the question"
