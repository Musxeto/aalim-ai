  "title": "Is Offering 'Taraweeh' In Congregation A Bid'ah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "actually there's another issue which has come up in my own research and it relates to the fact that many people consider it a bid to go into congregation and pray the and this started in Theif of Omar may Allah be pleased with him could you comment on this people have misconception that Omar may Allah be pleased with him he was the one who started this congregation Salah during Ramadan it's a misconception but in fact it is he who revived the sunah of the Prophet as I mentioned earlier in the Hadith ofari number three in the book of Hadith number 20112 that the prophet was the person who offered people joined him in congregation and he allowed it then later on next night the whole mosque was filled and third night it was overflowing and fourth night didn't come out purposely from this Hadith we come to know that it was the prophet who started this and sunah of the Prophet but at the time of Abu Bakr prayed with him there were hardly any people who prayed that even in the starting of the caliph of it was the same thing may Allah please with him it further mentioned theth ofari number three in the book of Hadith number 20110 the sahaba says that he was walking along withar one of the M Life with him and he finds that people were praying individually and some people were praying in a small group soar with him he gathered all the people and he said let's make one jam and he appointed may Allah pleas with him to lead the Salah and everyone prayed behind him and later on when he comes back after a few nights he finds that people are praying in one congregation and then he comments it is preferable to pray when the people are sleeping than what they're praying now because you know they pray immediately after is Salah as I mentioned earlier so praying the in Ramadan what people call as it's preferable to pray in the last onethird of night but if you pray early also it's no problem now coming back to the question when he said that it's an excellent B people misunderstand the statement and they say oh that means the B can be good B is normally in the Sharia means an innovation in the religion but here with him he never used it as a B in the religion there nothing like B which is good you know because it's mentioned in the Hadith of say Muslim number one Hadith number 1885 that all Innovations in the religion are wrong and they lead to error and other Hadith says that all Innovations reach to Hellfire so all Innovations are wrong now based on this Hadith when Omar said that it's an excellent B so people normally say the b can be good and can be bad good B is allowed so what he really meant here was bidah in the linguistic term not b in the religion because in linguistic term bah means something which is new so at that time people did not pray in one congregation so he reminded them of the Sunnah of the Prophet M wasallam so it was going back to the Sunnah of the Prophet but for that time it was B linguistically it was something new so it doesn't mean that with him he know something in religion he took the people back to the sun of the Prophet for example if I go to a city where people are wearing the to below the ankle and if I say that you know wearing above the ankle is the sun of the Prophet but it's a B for that time because people it's new for them they don't know about it so it's B for that time but it's going back to the Sunnah of the Prophet wearing the T up of the ankle so people misunderstand the statement of talking about new for that time and for that place and for the people but actually is going back to the prophet so it is not what Omar with him heated it he told the people that this is what the prophet did and there are several such examples many Muslims you know temporary marriage then by some groups of Muslims the prophet prohibited that om with him he knew about it so during the seventh h of he said it is wrong so people think he imposed it but he knew the prophet said it was Haram the temporary marriage you know it's called as mut so just because he implemented the Sunnah which very few people knew at that time and he was there when the prophet said that M temporary marriage is Haram people think that he bought it into the de it's going back the Sunnah of the Prophet hope that clarifies oh just"
