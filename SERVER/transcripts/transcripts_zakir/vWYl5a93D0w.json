  "title": "Why do Muslims have Non-Vegetarian food? Can a person be a Vegetarian and yet be a Muslim?",
  "transcript": "foreign and I am by qualification MBA and work for Thomas Cook at Fort my question is regarding non-vegetarian Foods it is allowed in Islam animals all living beings so don't you think that it is violence and my second question is that is it compulsory in Islam to have non-veg food and can a pure vegetarian person can follow Islam asked a very good question he said that in Islam you'll have non-veg food you all kill animals why does Islam give permission to kill living creatures and Muslim be a pure vegetarian brother before answer the question I like to tell you a Muslim can be a very good Muslim even by being a pure vegetarian it did not compile say in Islam that you should have non-veg food it's not compulsory but it says that eat of the four-footed animals which have been made lawful for you 16 verse number five that you can eat the meat of the cattle it's mentioned for a moment chapter 23 verse number 21 that in the cattle we give you a drink which is good for the humankind and of the meat you can eat so when almighty God gives you permission to eat the meat of the lawful animals then why should we not have now come into the logical reason why Islam permits you to have non-rich food if you analyze non-veg food it's rich in protein the human body it requires 23 amino acids out of which eight are not made in the human body it should be given by external diet which are known as essential amino acids now these all eight essential amino acids are present in no kind of vegetable food together it's only present in flesh food so the non-veg flesh food is more nutritious as compared to vegetables furthermore if you analyze if you see the set of teeth of the herbivorous animals the cow the goat the Sheep they have got flat set of teeth the only vegetables they don't have flesh food if we analyze a set of teeth of the carnivorous animals the tiger the leopard the lion they have got pointed set of teeth they have canine set of teeth they only have flesh they don't touch vegetables if you analyze the set of teeth of the human beings if you go in the mirror and see we human beings we have got flat teeth as well as pointed teeth if almighty God wanted us to have only vegetables why did he give us this canine teeth why did he give us this pointed teeth for what food to have the flesh food furthermore if we analyze the diocese system of the human being if you compare it to the herbivorous animals cow go cheap they can only digest vegetables the diocese system of the carnivorous animals tiger leopard lion they can only digest flesh food they cannot digest vegetables the diocese system of the human beings can digest both it does not understand big intestine it can digest vegetables as well as flesh food it can digest both so I have almighty God wanted us to have only vegetables why did he give her the diocese system when he can digest both I thought if you unlife many of the Hindus think that Hinduism privates the eating of Flesh food in fact if you read it's mentioned Manu smithi chapter number five verse number 30 almighty God has created some animals to eat and some to be eaten if you eat the animal that have been created to be eaten then it's not a sin Manas smithi chapter number five verse number 31 says that almighty God created some animals for sacrifice killing them is not a sin manuscript chapter 5 verse number 40 says that killing sacrificial animals for sacrifice is permitted it is the law of the god so in Hindu scriptures it's permitted to have non-veg food if you read The Vedas and the other scriptures sages and Sons they ate non-wish food they even eat beef if you read Mahabharata anushasan chapter number 88 men the pandas together judicial who the eldest brother of the pandav he asks bhishma that what food should we give in yagna in Puja in sacrifice so that our ancestors will be satisfied so bhishma replies that if you give herbs and shrubs and vegetables our ancestors will be satisfied for one month if you give them fish for two months if you give them meat for three months if you give them hair for four months if you give them goat for five months if you give them bacon for six months if you give them birds for seven months if you give them deer for eight months and the menu continues big menus there it says if you give Buffalo for 11 months if you give the Flesh of cow our ancestors will be satisfied for one full year and if you give red meat of goat or meat of rhinoceros they'll be satisfied and exhaustibly so according to Hindu scriptures eating non-veg is not a sin it is because many of the Hindus were being influenced by the ahimsa philosophy of not killing any living creature they started accepting it but even this philosophy of aimsa as you said that killing living creature is a sin brother do you know that even plants have got life do you know that brother so if you say killing living creatures and killing a plant is also a sin so why do we have plants I agree agreed very good furthermore there are some people who say okay okay I agree that plants have got life but the plants can't feel pain therefore killing a plant is a lesser sin as compared to killing animal the point to be noted is that today science has advanced and we have come to know even the plants can feel pain but the Cry of the plant cannot be heard by the human being because human beings hear the frequency that they hear is from 20 cycles per second to 20 000 cycles per second anything below and above this range you cannot hear so there's a farmer in America who converted the car of the plant into the human frequency and you could come to know when the plants were crying when they wanted water that plants have got life plants can feel pain but the plants have got about two senses less as compared to the animals therefore killing a plant is a lesser thin as compared to killing animal I'm asking the question whether suppose your brother your elder brother he is born deaf and dumb after he grows up and someone comes and kills him so will you go and tell the judge me Lord give the murderer less punishment because my brother had two senses less he could not hear he could not speak will you say that in fact you'll say give the murderer double punishment he could not yeah he could not speak my brother was masum he was innocent so in Islam it does not work like that two senses or three senses the Quran says chapter number two verse number 168 eat of the good things they have provided to you as long as the food is halal it's say up for you you can have it and furthermore I personally have got no problem if the non-muslim don't have non-veg I've got no problem only if they tell me eating non-veg is a sin it's a crime that's the time I give the reply otherwise if the non-muslims in India they don't have non-verse it's beneficial for me if all the non-muslims in India start diving non-veg then the prices of mutton and beef will rise it'll be more expensive for me to have it no problem hope that satisfies your question brother yeah definitely sir so now if you want you can yet be a good vegetarian if you want you can eat non-veg also eating non veg will keep you more healthy you can have but even if you want to be a pure vegetarian it's not a sin hope to answer the question brother [Applause]"
