  "title": "Since All Religions Preach Good Things Can a Person Follow Any Religion? â€” Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question i think is something connected one brother prabhu is asking all the religions basically preach good things thus a person can follow any one of the religion it is one and the same the question pose is that all the religions basically teach good things so you can follow any religion it's one of the same and i do agree with him in the first part of the question that all religions do basically preach good things for example all religions say you should not rob you should not molest a woman you should not rape her hinduism says that christianity says that islam says that but the difference between islam and the other religions is that islam besides speaking of good things it shows you a way how to implement those good things like all religions speak about brotherhood but islam practically shows you it demonstrates how to practice it in your day-to-day life salah etc so islam besides speaking theoretically it shows you a way how to practice it in your life for example hinduism says you should not rob christianity says we should not rob islam says it should not rob so what's the difference between islam and the other religions islam shows your way how to achieve that state in which people will not rob islam has a system of zakah that is every rich person who has a saving of more than the nissab level 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5 of that excess wealth in charity every lunar year if every rich human being gives charity poverty will be eradicated from this world there will not be a single human being who will die of hunger after this the glorious quran says in surah chapter number 5 verse number 38 ask to the thief beat a man or a woman chop off his or her hand as a punishment from allah some people may say chopping off the hands in this age of 20th century islam is a barbaric religion it's a ruthless law and i do know that there are thousands of people who rob so if you chop off all the people then many people lose their hands but the law is so strict that the moment you implement it and if a person comes to know that his hands will be chopped off if he robs immediately the thought of robbing will go away from his mind do you know today america which happens to be one of the most advanced country in the world unfortunately it also has one of the highest rates of crime highest rate of robbery and theft i'm asking a question if you implement the islamic sharia in america that is every rich person gives zakat 2.5 percent of his excess wealth in charity and after that if any man or woman drops chop off his or her hand i'm asking a question will the rate of robbery and theft in america will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease it will decrease it's a practical law you implement the sharia and you get results let me give you an example that most of the major religions say that we should not molest a woman that should not rape a woman hinduism says that christianity says that islam says the same but islam shows your way how to achieve that state in which people will not men will not molest or rape a woman islam has a system of hijab people normally talk about hijab for the woman but allah subhanahu wa'tala in the glorious quran first speaks about the hijab for the man and then for the woman the glorious quran says in foreign number 24 verse number 30 that said to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and guard his modesty whenever a man looks at a woman and any brazen thought comes in his mind any unashamed thought comes in his mind he should lower his gaze that was once a friend of mine who was a muslim friend who was staring at a girl for a long time so i told him brother what are you doing it's prohibited in islam to stare at a girl so he told me our beloved prophet said that the first glance is allowed the second is prohibited i have not yet completed half my glance what did the prophet mean by saying the first glance is allowed the second is prohibited he didn't mean that you can look at a woman and stay a continuous letter for 20 minutes without blinking what the prophet meant that if you look at a woman unintentionally intentionally don't look at her again don't feast on her that's what the prophet meant the next verse speaks about the hijab for the women surah nur chapter 24 verse 31 says that say to the believing woman that she should lower the gaze and guard a modesty and display not her beauty except what appears ordinarily off and to draw a head covering over the boson and display not a beauty except in front of a husband her father her son etc and a big list of mehram the close relatives who she can't marry is given and there are basically six criterias for hijab the first is the extent we differ between the man and the woman for the man the extent is from the navel to the knee for the woman the complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and the hands of your wrist some scholars say even this should be covered the remaining five criteria are the same the second is the clothes they weigh it should not be so tight that it reveals the figure third it should not be transparent so that you can see through fourth it should not be so glamorous that it attracts opposite sex fifth it should not resemble that of the unbeliever sixth it should not resemble that of the opposite sex these are basically six criterias for hijab mention the quran and the say hadith and the quran says in surah azab chapter 33 verse number 59 giving the reason for hijab it says o prophet tell your wives and the believing woman that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested quran says hijab has been prescribed for the woman so that it will prevent him from being molested and the islamic sharia says if anyone rapes any woman he gets capital punishment people with a capital punishment in this 20th century islam is a barbaric religion it's a ruthless law it's a barbaric religion do you know america which happens to be the country which is supposed to be most advanced it has one of the highest rate of rape according to the statistic it says that on average every day more than 1 900 females are being raped every day every 1.3 minute one female is raped since the time i am in this auditorium it's more than two and a half hours how many reps may have taken place how many more than a hundred in america i'm asking a question if you implement the islamic sharia in america that is every man when he looks at a woman he should lower his gaze the woman should be properly dressed up in hijab and after that if any man rapes capital punishment i am asking a question will the rate of rape increase will it remain the same or will it decrease it will decrease the practical law you implement the sharia and you get results and have asked this question to non-muslims that suppose someone rapes unfortunately your wife or your mother and if you are made the judge and if the rapist is put in front of you what punishment will you give and believe me all of them said will put into death some went to the extent of saying we will torture him to death so why do you have the double standards someone taped somebody else's wife capital punishment is barbaric law someone rapes your wife you want to give him capital punishment why these double standards and do you know in india according to the statistics of crime bureau it says that every 54 minute one case of rape is reported in india how many taking place every few minutes maybe one case and no wonder the home minister of india l k advani you know what he said it came in headlines of times of india headline what it says that advani advani puts a death wrap for rapes and recommends an amendment in the law headlines in times of india 28th of october 10 days back on tuesday one day before 27th of october 1998 he said that he wants death penalty for the rapist alhamdulillah what islam has said 14 years ago al-qaeda is saying that and i congratulate him for that i'm not here to promote any political party i'm not a politician but if someone speaks the truth i have to appreciate it and if you implement this surely the rate of rape will diminish maybe the next home minister may implement the islamic hijab here also so insha allah the rape will be completely abolished they are coming closer to islam i appreciate it come to common terms that has been us in you mr al-qaeda realized that rape is increasing in india and he rightly recommended that the law should be amended and death penalty should be put for the rapist and i am for it i am the first indian to support him so if you analyze islam besides speaking good things it shows you a way how to achieve that state of goodness therefore i say that islam unlike other religion we speak good things it shows you a way how to achieve goodness so therefore if i have to follow a religion i would follow a religion which speaks good things and shows you a way how to achieve that good things therefore it is rightly said in surah al-imran chapter 3 verse number 19 in nadine islam the only religion acceptable sight of allah is the person who submits will to allah"
