  "transcript": "amum my name is Sam I'm a sales executive in Electrical Company uh my question is normally the media is influenced by the state the media is controlled by the state and uh especially in a Muslim country I mean in the Middle East where the Arabs are there so how now what I have heard uh in the talk is generally it was for the uh general public but how the rulers of the state can improve the Muslim media in this level I said in my talk that the Muslims have got media not that they don't have but they are mainly concentrating on the Muslim themselves in India we have uddu media read only by the Muslims in Pakistan Udu media read by the Muslims we have here Arabic media Arabic channels are there many good and bad many but they're mainly focusing on the Arabs that is fine if the channel is good in Arabic it should continue I'm not saying it is wrong if it's a good channel on the lines of the Sharia like Maan Channel Etc the're good channels that is not sufficient what I'm telling you should have a media in the language which is the international language so that you can change the view of the international people you can change the view of the world only by telling that Muslims are good among the Arabs where most of them are Muslims it's not something great we should have a media in the language which is international language so my request is that fine you may be ruler of an Arab country but why don't you launch an English Islamic Channel which propagates the true teaching of Islam and it is shown throughout the world in America in Europe in Australia in Middle East in Asia why not so that we can change the view and at the same time convey The Message of Islam which is f on every [Applause] Muslim"
