  "transcript": "again a question on the YouTube t ask him how much knowledge should a person have to give dawa to other non-muslims even people who use Quran and had the question how much knowledge should a person have to do da to non-muslims I beloved Prophet wasam said it's propagate even if you know one verse of Islam so even if you know one verse of Islam as long as you know it correctly your job is to propagate it if you as a Muslim know there's one God you go and tell to your non-muslim friend there's one God they'll ask you prove it you don't know the answer man God you may not know able to prove what the prophet said propagate even if you know one verse so even if you know one verse about Islam that there's one Allah go and tell them they will ask you what proof you have you don't know you come and do your homework I've given the talk on is the Quran God you read that now you know the answer you go and tell him then you tell him that Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger they'll ask what proved we have you don't know tell that you may come if you don't know the answer what do you do you come back into your homework I've given a talk on Muhammad sallam in the various World scriptures mhamad sallam in the Bible mham Hindu scripture you memorize It Go go and tell him now you're master of two answerers then three then four so there is nothing like you should have a degree to propagate as far as propagation of the de is concerned no degree is required yes but don't answer questions on F until you're qualified or so while doing dawa there's one God you don't have to be a fak you don't have to be a scholar you don't have to be a student of knowledge there's one God as you keep on doing more and more dawa you start getting more knowledge then you become a student of knowledge and you get a higher level but please don't indulge in giving answers on F because that's not unless you have done something of f you have done Bachelor or you have done a course on F and you can and if you're a student of knowledge what you can do even if it there you read what the scholars have said and you can repeat it like whatever I am saying I don't consider myself to be a scholar I consider myself to be a d yes I've done ghost Etc but I don't consider myself as a yes but what I do I read the fatwas of the scholars and I repeat it with reference and this is permissible as long as you have under umbrella a scholar and you're quoting a scholar how I took the name of binas and the LA Scholars and what they say so if if because according to Islam if a scholar says something if he's right he gets two Saab if it's wrong he get one Saab so since I'm quoting a scholar and my Nia is good I'm quoting authentic Scholars I am protected but I cannot give my own fatwas because I don't consider myself to be a I don't consider myself to be a SCH I'm a yes I after hearing the scholar I may add some logical point to make it more palatable because I'm a d to make it more acceptable to the um that's a different thing for example when those who expert on riba on Islamic economy they'll give a lecture but they may not be able to convince a man or a common Muslim why it is Haram they may tell the reason but they may not be able to convince so we being D we hear from the scholars of Islamic economy and we use our logic and we able to convince thousands of people alhamdulillah but for a normal Muslim through dawa even if he knows one worth He should do it and more he start doing dawa you find that Allah subh gives you more more knowledge I was involved I've done my in terms of Education I finished my mbbs while I was doing my medical studies I met sh Ahmed I was inspired by him I started doing da only to the Christians first then to other non-muslims then got specialized first in Christianity in Judaism then on atheism then on Hindu then slowly slowly my knowledge kept on increasing I was a stammerer I never thought I'd give a speech in front of the public when one day I went and it clicked and that's how we started so it's Allah's help and then of course we met with various Scholars studied with them for days for months and we acquired knowledge but yet we are students of knowledge I consider myself to be but every Muslim he has no excuse even if he know one ver about Islam he should start and propagate it and it's his duty because Allah says in the Quran in IM 3 110 oh Muslims are the best of people evolved for mankind enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah Allah is calling us the best of people because we're supposed to enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong if we do not enjoy what is good and if you do not forbid what is wrong we un fit to be called as Muslims so every Muslim should enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong hope that answerers the question"
