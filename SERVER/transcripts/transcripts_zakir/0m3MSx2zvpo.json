  "title": "Is it Permissible to Marry in Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "question is from an engineer by profession and would like to know whether it's permissible or can he says can I marry in Ramadan as far as marrying in the month of Ramadan is concerned there's no text in the Quran or any say Hadith foreign a person can marry in any month of the year but since Ramadan he has to abstain beside abstaining from food and drink as to abstain from sexual intercourse so it depends upon him that when he marries in the month of Ramadan the lady marries his new wife so will he be able to suppress his feeling during the daytime from the beginning of dawn to Sunset that he will be able to abstain that is a test if he can abstain from any section intercourse then he can marry but since a person marries in the month of Ramadan it's a new wife he has to spend time so therefore if he has doubts it's advisable that he delays his marriage after the month of Ramadan and he spends time in zika and remembers of Allah but per se Manning in the month of Ramadan is not Haram"
