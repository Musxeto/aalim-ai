  "title": "What Makes Islam Unique Since All Religions Believe in One God and Lead to the same Path? - Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "any brothers if you have any questions yes brother recently I had I had spoken to one person from this chinmaya mission and he was uh talking to me and he was telling me that all religions believe in one God so basically everything is same all religions lead to One path uh so how do I explain to him that Islam is different from the rest mission one of the groups of Hinduism and they agreed that God is one so how can we differentiate Islam from the other religions and the difference in Islam and their religion is that as I have mentioned in several of my talks that all the major religions they speak about monotheism Islam speaks of it too but Islam believes in tahit tahid is different than monotheism it's not merely monotheism it's not merely believing in one God and the Ayah quoted earlier from Imran chapter number three verse number 64 says come to Common terms which is the first term that we worship them but Allah it's not that we believe in one but Allah only believing in one God is not sufficient besides believing we should worship him alone and no one else which if you and letting the other scripture also this is the basic but the unfortunate part is that the following of the religion they have deviated from worshiping only that one God and that deviated also in believing in one God so what we have to do that we have to get them closer to Islam by coming to Common terms and initially if we analyze that when we come to Common terms we have to prove to them that even your scriptures they believe in one God even your scriptures say worship only one God what we are trying to say at least let us come to Common terms on this aspect the difference between Islam and the religion is that Islam shows you a way how to actually worship this one God which may not be found in other religions the basic is the same but as I've mentioned in my other talks that most of the major religions they speak about good things but Islam besides speaking good things it shows you a way how to achieve the state of goodness while talking about worshiping one God the other religious to speak about one God and worshiping one God but Islam shows you a way how to practically follow it and I'd like to give you other easy examples that all the religions say that it should not drop Hinduism says that Christianity says that Islam says the same but the difference between Islam and the other religions is is how to practice and that is every rich person who has the saving of more than the sub level 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5 percent of that saving every lion charity if every Rich human being gives charity gives zakat poverty will be eradicated from this world there will not be a single human being will die of hunger and after this Allah says chapter 5 38 that if anyone drops beat a man or a woman chop of his or her hand as a punishment from Allah people will say chopping off the hands in this age of Science and Technology Islam is a barbaric religion it's a ruthless law but I tell them that do you know that America which happens to be one of the most advanced country in the world do you know it has one of the highest rate of robbery and theft in the world I am asking a simple question that if you implement the Islamic Sharia in America that every rich person by the saving of more than 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5 percent of that saving every Luna young charity after that if anyone drops beat a man or a woman chop off his or her hand I am asking the question will the rate of robbery and theft in America will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease what will happen it will decrease it's a practical law you implement the Sharia and we get results that is the reason I say that Islam besides speaking good things it shows you a way how to achieve the state of goodness when we are talking about commonalities about the other religions that does not mean there is no differences we are saying that at least agreed to follow this commonalities and the moment they agreed to follow these commonalities then we're going to talk about the differences that doesn't mean that all the religions are the same it's not at all Allah clearly says in the Quran Imran chapter number three verse number 19. the only religion acceptable in the sight of Allah is to submitable to Allah that is Islam Islam in Arabic means submitting over to almighty God so what is commonalities between the other religions we talk about it first trying to get them closer because if we think about commonalities a person is there to listen more then talk about differences the same way after they talk about one God talk about worship then talk about when stages you can go so if we say fine I believe in Islam he said to the Hinduism say that believe in the last and fine Messengers you believe It also says following instruction that means follow Quran sallam he speaks scriptures scriptures say not to human beings so if your scripture says you should follow the last and final messenger you have to follow him that means you have to follow the Quran and the Hadith simple but coming stages directly talk about sallam they may not like it it is Islam therefore Allah says first is talking about God and then come to Allah then you can talk about the other aspects if they have to believe the teaching the last and final messenger it means nothing will do God if you're submitting into your will to God it goes down the throat if you use the word Islam let me take a step behind so therefore who you're speaking to and how you conveyed whether you have to sometimes in Arabic sometime in English sometime in Hindi so you have to say it in a way which will convince them hope to answer the question"
