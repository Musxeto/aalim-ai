  "title": "Mary Challenges Dr Zakir that Bible mentions Jesus (pbuh) is God in Gospel of John 3:16",
  "transcript": "good evening Dr Zucker Nike this is Mary I'm a Christian and a banker by profession my question for you is based on your statement that nowhere in the Bible it's mentioned that Jesus Christ is the Son of God and based on my knowledge and understanding of Bible I have picked up two verses to quote and I would like only your clarification in the light of Islam the first one is Matthew chapter 3 verse number 17 and blow a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased the second is John chapter 3 verse number 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son so whosoever shall believe in him shall not die but have everlasting life that's right sister just to correct your statement you made a question saying that I said that nowhere in the Bible it says that Jesus Son of God and never said that nowhere in the Bible is it mentioned that Jesus is son of God I said there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible there is not a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God always a worship me I never said the Bible does not say Jesus is son of God what I said there is not a single unambiguous statement not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God always say worship me if you point out any such two statements I am late except Christianity if your question assumes that Son of God means Jesus Is God very well I'll reply to your question many Christians think that just by the statement Son of God means Jesus is god sister do you know in the Bible Adam is Son of God Ephraim is Son of God Israel is Son of God God has got Sons by the tons in the Bible that means you haven't at your Bible sister so do you mean to say all of them are Gods is Adam God is a frame God is Israel God no Son of God sister is a statement used if you read Romans chapter number eight verse number 14 all those there led by the spirit of God they are sons of God means if you follow the Commandment of God if I follow the Commandment of God I am a Son of God In This Way undoubtedly Jesus Christ peace be upon him verily is the most beloved Son of God meaning he is following the Commandment of God I have got no problem at all if you say son of God means person who follows the Commandments of God like it's mentioned in Romans all those are led by the spirit of God they are sons of God if I follow the Commandment of God you follow the Commandment we are all children of God very innocent statement no problem so as far as your Matthew is concerned 317 I've clarified now coming to your second quotation of Gospel of John chapter 3 verse number 16 but what the Christian Mission is say no no no do this Christ peace be upon Him is not a normal son he is the begotten Son of God and the quote Gospel of John chapter number three verse number 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not die but have everlasting life sister simple question what is the meaning of the word begotten he has given it no what is the meaning of begotten he has given his son to the people no no sister begotten doesn't mean he's given a son you know English I know English to English is mashallah very good begotten doesn't mean he's giveness if I say you have begotten a son sorry sorry to interrupt don't give metaphorical meaning English is very good I'm a Layman person if I say you have begotten the son what does it mean that means you have had sexual relationship with your husband and you've begotten son begetting is a function of lower animals of sex how can I attribute this function to almighty God who did God have sex with who that's the reason the scholars of Christianity if you read the revised standard edition revised Standard Version of the Bible revised by 32 Scholars Christian Scholars of the highest Eminence backed by 50 different government denominations they say this word begotten in Gospel of John chapter number 3 verse number 16 is an interpolation is a fabrication it's a concoction and they're thrown out of the Bible so if you read the Bible if you read the revised Standard Version it is the best seller in the world revised Standard Version revised by not Muslims not Hindus 32 Christian Scholars of the highest Eminence backed by 50 different government denominations they say this word begotten is not present in the original manuscript of Gospel of John chapter 3 verse 16. what they say it's an interpolation it's a fabrication it's a concoction it's an adulteration so so Jesus is just like a son like a Adam ocean of God a frame a Son of God is there a Son of God he's a prophet of God so I've got no problem in accepting that verily Jesus Christ peace be upon him was a prophet and a messenger of God but he was not God hope to answer the question sister so now sister thank you very much sister can we reverse the role now yes I said I was ready to accept Christianity if you proved this was God would you accept Islam now would you agree that Jesus is the prophet of God I have still few more things to clear you're most welcome sister why why do Muslims refrain from the statement Son of God why yes if answer the question will you accept Islam I think we have a huge population of Muslims in the world we we need Believers we do not need only Muslims by name yeah so we want Muslim by deed so we want to become Muslim by deed not by name sister okay coming to your question that why do Muslims refrain from using Son of God as a very good question and that's the reason sister if you read the Quran Quran has got 99 attributes to Allah most gracious most merciful most wise but in his last and final Revelation if there's something like Old Testament New Testament Quran in the last Testament in his last Testament he has not used the word AB in Arabic means father why he has used the more difficult word is more difficult to pronounce than up which means the Lord the cherisher the sustainer he has used Rabbi that tribute but not up why because in the previous Revelations previous Revolution which was changed Bible is the change form of the Angel people have misunderstood the meaning of Son of God they started thinking to be begotten son for example if I tell no young son better tonight you have asked a very good question if Hassan asked a question of the age of 10. Sonia asked me a good question but if I say you begotten son you have asked a very good question you may punch me he'll notice he may punch me that means I'm abusing his mother if I say my begotten son he'll get angry I am insinuating that I had sex with his mother so sun is innocent word begotten son Is Not Innocent same way the sun is a very good word but people started misunderstanding so to remove this confusion that's the reason the Quran does not use the word father as a attribute almighty God that's why it's a good word so same way we refrain from using Son of God because people start thinking that he's God no Christian ever comes and tells me Adam is Son of God a famous Son of God why Bible says Israel is another word why don't you come and tell me because they are programmed no Christian has come and told me that the Bible says they frame a Son of God no why because they're programmed to believe that Jesus Christ is almighty God he never said he's almighty God and I told you earlier in my earlier answer he never claimed Divinity that means you're insulting almighty God that means the insulting Jesus Christ peace be upon him that's what I say if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves you know why because if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him it's mentioned the Gospel of John he was circumcised on the eighth day we Muslims that circumcised Christians uncircumcised peace be upon him he said that you have to follow each and every law of the Bible each and every commandment Gospel of Matthew chapter 5 verse number 17 to 20. if you break one law or gentle from the Commandment you shall not run the Kingdom of Heaven if you go to the Old Testament clearly says in the Book of Leviticus chapter number 11 verse number seven to eight in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number eight in the book of Isaiah chapter 65 verse number two to five that you shall not have Pope Muslims don't deaf poke but Christians have spoke so if Christian meets a person who follow the teaching of Jesus Christ peace be upon him we Muslim democr Christian and the Christian themselves the Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter number five verse number 18 that thou shall not have wine it's mentioned the Book of Proverbs Chapter number 20 verse number one mine is the makah you should not have wine Muslims don't have alcohol but the Christians have alcohol further if you and life there are various references I can give you so if Christian means one who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him I say that I am more Christian than the Christian themselves if you become a more better practicing Christian then the so-called names say Christian dear sister can I ask something sure yeah yeah the most welcome sister I would not like to cross question or criticize your statement Mr you're most welcome to cross the film me you are most welcome to criticize me I love it unless a person doesn't cross-examine see suppose I want to prove something if I say this is the best I want to check it out with this best or not go ahead I will definitely not intend to do something like this the object of questioning more is to know more so that I know what I follow is right that's all thank you very much sister can ask any question no problem you're most welcome whether intention your intention is very good but I went to the extent of saying even intention is bad no problem but intention is very good sister you can ask any questions and you don't have to accept Islam no one can force you Quran says there's no compulsion religion truth stands out clear foreign on the day of judgment only give the evidence that I gave you the answer yes sister any questions thank you very much you said that we Muslims are better Christians than the actual Christians so from brief statement I made if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves their sister your question but this is uh this is not a Layman statement do not have a specialized knowledge of Islam and as well as Christianity and you can ask the doctors of dignity there were them saying is right or wrong yes sister thank you very much so what are the question that that was my question that why did you mention that we Muslims are when I said that why did I say I think this is beyond my thinking that's why would a Muslim call himself a Christian no correct bye because we love Jesus Christ peace be upon we love him more than you we love him we respect him we reveal him but we don't worship Him but even I said this because I love Jesus Christ peace be upon him I respect him I Revere him but I don't worship him because he never told me to worship him if he would have told me to worship him I'd have worshiped him so that's the reason I say if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him I am no Christian than the Christian themselves because I love Jesus Christ peace be upon him I respect him I Revere him but I don't worship him so they answer the question thank"
