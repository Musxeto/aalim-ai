  "transcript": "she has the question that th is a symbol of a cross symbol of Christian then why have I being a Muslim wear the tie and I do know that many Muslims consider the tie to be a symbol of a cross but I'm a student of comparative religion nowhere in any Christian scripture is it mentioned that TI is a sign of across and if it is the Hadith clearly says that you cannot wear that which resembl is that of an unbeliever if it's a specific symbol of a non-muslim you cannot wear that label it is Haram nowhere will you find a single statement in any verse of the Bible where it says that TI is a sign of a cross I'm aware that many Muslims they are against the Western culture and I don't blame them what I say if you find something against If You observe something with the Western ns are doing wrong you have to object to it but what things they do good there's no harm in agreeing with it what things are neutral there's no harm not that you have to object to that also many Muslims are so much against the Western culture that they object on each and everything Tai is not at all the symbol of Christianity and this question is posed to me in various parts of the world and I challenge and I tell the audience that if any Muslim can prove to me any time with authentic proof that Tai is a sign of of a cross of a Christian I will be the first person to remove it and I will tell all the people not to wear it tie is not a sign of Christianity at all it's not a sign of a cross at all it's a cultural dress and researches have been done by Scholars not from here say from Scholars how did it originate some Scholars say in the cold countries people b a tie to tie the garments which were heavy you know in the cold countri you know Woolen clothes Etc it's a cultural dress it's not a dress of the Christian you go throughout the world the Christian we he wear the tie alham know about it the Muslim wears it the Hindu wears it it is not specifically a sign of Christianity it's a cultural death and a Muslim is allowed to adopt any culture as long as it doesn't go against the Islamic Sharia if that culture goes against the Islamic Sharia like wearing shorts it's a culture of the westerners we Muslim can't adopt it because for a man the hijab the a is from the N to the knee he can't wear shots it's not allowed traveling in a car the car was Ved by the Christian the westerners can I say the Christian invented therefore I can't sit in a car I not have an airplane can I say that no whatever is against the Sharia you should not do th is not a sign of Krishna at all this TI people say it looks like a cross you open and you stretch the circle it becomes a cross I tell the C that you wear you put like that it resembles more like a cross so you can't invent your own thinking oh ca looks like a cross therefore stop wearing CA can I tell that can I ever tell that see the prophet said anything which is a symbol of a particular religion don't wear those symbol tie is not a symbol of Christianity it's a cultural dress it's not a f you should wear a tie I'm not saying that don't do alhamdulillah I'm with you but when I go to the Western Country it helps dealing certain barriers and if Islam doesn't object to that I don't mind using it if Islam objects to that I should not use anything which Islam prohibits even if it benefits me but since this thing alhamdulillah is allowed in Islam there's no problem at all if a person wears a tie hope the answers the question sister"
