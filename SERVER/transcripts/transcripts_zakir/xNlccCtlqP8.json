  "transcript": "very good question I said the Quran mentions inam 6:54 that that when those come to thee when those come to thee who believe in our sence wish them assalam the quranic ver says when those come to thee when they approach thee then Salam becomes a now when you go in the marketplace I as a man go even if they don't come to me I wish them for Salam because the prophet said whoever wish Salam better to spread Salam but you as a Muslim a Muslim woman you have to even maintain your hijab and for hijab there are various verses given in the Quran as well as if you read chapter number 33 verse number 32 it says that a special verse has been revealed to the wives of the Prophet saying that be not too complacent in your voice lest in the opposite person in whose heart is a disease they misunderstand you means for the wi of the Prophet they could not be too complacent you know Oham alayum you have to maintain your hijab hijab is also of the wife so as a general little sister you as being opposite sex you need not wish every Muslim that you see on the road who does not approach you when I go to the market if I see a Muslim a Muslim woman and just passing by I will not wisham if she approaches me and there are certain problems she requires help ET I maintain my hijab I lower my Gaz Etc and follow but normally if they don't approach it's not compulsory for the same sex for letting peace spread in the world alhamdulillah I will try and wish to even a person who doesn't approach me so you sister to the opposite sex it's not a requirement that you should wish to every Muslim brother young old that you meet if you know if he is a mam your father or your son or your husband then it's preferable if anyone approaches you you should meet now regarding the question if suppose a person if a Muslim wishes you assalamu alaykum how should you respond as a Muslim first you should realize that if there is a requirement for the Muslim man who's a n of yours to talk to you then can the discussion proceed if you think it's not a requirement you need not proceed with the discussion you need not proceed if you know that this particular boy is from your college and unnecessarily he wants to talk to you then you have to maintain your hijab you did not talk to him also because his intentions aren't good but if you know that the intention is good and suppose opposite sex approaches you give the reply but not too complacent don't say oh it's not a requirement you have to maintain your hijab wum Salam be firm so that if there's a disease in the heart of the opposite person it will not be increased that is the guidance of the Quran so sister where namam gent is concerned for a woman and where a namam woman is concern for a gent you should maintain the Islamic hijab and as the bister said earlier that there are some men who look at the women who don't do hijab the Quran first speaks about the hijab for the man and then for the woman the Quran says in Surah n CH 24 verse number 30 before it speaks about the hijab for the woman it says say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and God is Modesty that means whenever a man whenever a man looks at a woman any Brazen thought any anashim thought comes in his mind he should lower his Gaz this is the hijab for the Muslim so if a Muslim man looks at a woman irrespective whether she's a Muslim or non-muslim he cannot Feast on her so sister said there are Muslim boys who look at non-muslim and get married to them they aren't following the Quran they aren fit to be called as Muslims once the a friend of mine who was a Muslim who was staring at a girl for a long time so I told him brother what are you doing why are you staring at a girl for the long time so he told me our beloved Prophet said that the first glance is allowed the second is prohibited I have not yet completed half my glance what did the prophet mean when he said that the first glance is allowed the second is prohibited it doesn't mean that you can look at a woman stare at her for a long time without blinking for 10 minutes and say that I'm following the prophet what the prophet men that unintentionally look at a woman don't intentionally look at her to Feast on her so similarly sister it's not a requirement that you greet every n Muslim man that you meet but if they approach you depending upon the situation you have to give the reply based on Quran and say had hope that answer the question"
