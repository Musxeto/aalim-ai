  "title": "Rulings pertaining to Polygamous and Inter-religious Marriages in Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "i've got two questions to ask the first one is that why can't a muslin girl get married to a non-muslim guy and still follow islam and i've got one more question as it is acceptable in islam for a man that he can marry four times do we have to inform the first wife about the second marriage or he can be like he can marry without informing the first wife this is the other question she has asked the first question she posed is that in islam is it compulsory that it should take the permission of the first fire before marrying the second wife and the first question of us was that in islam why can a man marry a non-muslim girl as far as the first question i'm sorry it's like if a girl is born in a muslim family why she cannot marry a non-muslim kai and still follow islam why can't a girl was born in a muslim family marry a non-muslim man and yet follow islam the reason is because it goes against the teaching of our creator allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 221 that do not marry a mushrik until he believes do not marry a idol worshiper do not marry a non-believer until he believes even a believer even if he is a slave man even if he is a bondsman he is far better than a non-believer than a mushrik man that a non-muslim man even if he allows you means even if he may be the most handsome man in the world he may be the richest man and if he's a non-muslim a muslim man who may be dark who may be ugly who may be a slave is far superior similarly the verse continues that for a man he should not marry unbelieving woman until she believes a believing woman who is a slave woman is far superior than unbelieving women even if she allows you the logical reason sister is that in a car or in a vehicle if one tire is off a bicycle and the other tire is off a truck so will the vehicle run but natural no all the four tires should be equal and furthermore you ask the question that can she be a good muslim by marrying or non-muslim the reason is that in islam we want our spouse our life partner also to go to jannah now she has found the way to jannah she has found the way to paradise that her paradise is in following islam she should follow the quran and they say hadith now imagine when she knows that she is going to go to paradise and a husband who's doing idol worship who doesn't believe in islam who's going to go to hell this life sister is a small portion as compared to next life this life maybe you stay with husband for 20 years 30 years 40 years 50 years how long 60 years the next life is eternal life that means she's selfish a good muslim or a good muslim a good muslim man or woman would also want that their spouse the husband or wife should also go to jannah so that's the reason it's important that both the husband and wife are muslims as far as the second question is concerned is it compulsory for the muslim man to take the permission of the first wife before he marries the second wife it is not compulsory unless it is mentioned in the nicarama if it is mentioned in the nika nama in the marathon contract if the wife has said you should not take a second wife as long as i live then it becomes compulsory if it's not mentioned in economic it is not compulsory but at least he should inform her why only if he informs her one of the criteria to marry more than one wife as the quran says in surah nisa chapter number four verse number three is marry woman of a choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one so one of the criteria to marry more than one wife is you should be just between your eyes so if you do not inform your wife how will you do justice between your wife maybe you'll tell lies that i'm going for office work i'm going out of bombay you may not go so therefore if you marry a second wife taking permission is not a must it's not compulsory but at least informal so that you can do justice between both your wives hope to answer the question sister thank you [Applause]"
