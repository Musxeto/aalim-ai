  "title": "15 Point Action Plan for the Muslim Ummah when Someone Insults Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) - Part 6",
  "transcript": "number 11 is that if such an act like what has happened recently takes place the muslim countries should call the ambassador of that country which has done this act and convey the message of condemnation or give them a warning and alhamdulillah this has been done very well in many of the muslim countries not all many is wrong it should be few alhamdulillah when president macron gave the statement against islam there were some muslim countries who called the ambassador we know that it happened in turkey it happened in malaysia mashallah it happened also in pakistan but it didn't happen in all the muslim countries all the muslim countries should at least call the ambassador of that country which had done this act and convey our condemnation of this act that we disagree with this blasphemy we disagree that a prophet has been insulted imagine if the head of that country was insulted by any other foreign country will the foreign minister keep quiet and the answer is no imagine if some caricature of the prime minister or the president or the king of that country is made in a foreign country and put up on buildings immediately the same day there will be a protest so imagine when the head of state if someone pokes fun at him you want to make a protest why don't you do it when someone makes fun of the prophet knows bella if you don't protest when someone makes fun of the head of state it's accepted yet you're a muslim but how can you agree that a prophet is being insulted and you're keeping quiet our beloved prophet muhammad said it is mentioned in say bihari point number one hadith number 15 that the prophet said that a person is not a believer until he loves me more than his father and more than his children and more than whole human kind the prophet said a person is not a believer a person is not a muslim unless he loves the prophet more than the father more than his children more than whole of humankind our beloved prophet said it's mentioned inside buhari point number one hadith number 16 that the three qualities of a person have he will taste the sweetness of faith number one is love allah and his messenger more than anything else in the world number two if a person loves a person for the sake of allah and he loves him for the sake of allah number three is that he wouldn't like to go in disbelief like he wouldn't like to go into the hellfire if anyone has these three criteria he has tasted the sweetness of faith that means it is compulsory for every muslim every moment to love allah and his messenger more than anything else in this world so how can we not take objection when someone insults a prophet when someone does any islamic blasphemy depending upon the seriousness all these points i'm mentioning is that sometimes someone writes a small article then maybe the first three points are sufficient you may not have to go to the fourth point or the fifth point depending upon the blasphemy depending upon the seriousness of an act you have to do only first two points sometimes three points sometime five sometimes eight sometimes more the twelfth action that can be taken is that we can stop trade the muslim country can stop trade with that country which has done this blasphemy depending upon if the head of state or if that country promotes this blasphemy or condones this blasphemy then such action should be taken if the individual in the country doing some bless for me and if the country doesn't condone it then you need not go to these levels but like what happened in france the president of france he is condoning it and he goes out of the way to put the caricatures on tall government buildings printed in the mainstream media these blasphemous acts in the name of freedom of expression the 12th action that can be taken is that we can stop trade with that country and we know that alhamdulillah allah has given the muslim country some important products and number one it is the oil it is a petrol we know that most of the petrol most of the oil in the world alhamdulillah comes from the muslim countries if these countries make a pact or group the countries that supply petrol all over the world whether it be saudi arabia whether it be abu dhabi kuwait whether it be malaysia nigeria these countries which have a large export of petrol and if they combine and block and see to it that those countries which are indulging in insulting the prophet or involving an islamic blasphemy if they put a trade sanction on them alhamdulillah we see that america if they want to bully anyone they can put trade sanctions why can't we muslims and we muslims are a big economy as i said that today more than 25 percent of the world population are muslims imagine the amount of products that we use the amount of products that we produce both so if we have a trade sanction on a higher level if the blasphemy is very high or if they don't listen the 12th action that can be taken is a trade sanction we know in such time there may be certain loss if there's a trade sanction then there may be certain countries which are using a product if we muslims see to it that all the muslim countries support each other like as i mentioned when it came to petrol these countries hold the major portion of the world's petrol whether it be saudi arabia abu dhabi kuwait malaysia nigeria where it comes to natural gas number one is qatar when it comes to palm oil majority is indonesia and malaysia 45 percent of the world export of palm oil it is from indonesia and 30 percent of malaysia both put together in these two countries 81 percent of the export of the palm oil imagine if they work together these two muslim countries and if any country tries to twist the arm they get together can very well get an impact fine if certain countries don't purchase from you you may go in lost little bit but imagine the impact that you have and if you cannot do this for allah and his rasool then how can you call yourself muslims and the 13th action that can be taken is complete boycott and breaking of relationship with the country and their example is like israel what israel did to the muslims in palestine there were many muslim countries mashal even till today they have boycotted relationship with israel many of the arab countries unfortunately unfortunately in the last few months there are some arab countries who have again started the relationship if we muslims are together as allah says in the glorious quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 2 that help each other in bir and in righteousness and in good work we muslims should help each other in righteousness and in good work in piety if we are together and block we can be affordable force depending upon the act we know that what israel has done against the muslims is one of the maximum many countries are done against that is the reason we have gone to the level number 13. we have broken all foreign relationship many countries mashallah and it has had a great impact so we should see to it that we support our muslim brothers in different parts of the world"
