  "title": "The Best Definition of the True God - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "first we have to understand the concept of Allah subhana tala and I'll be dealing in detail in my talk on Friday in Elin the concept of God in major world religion but the best reply that any Muslim can give you regarding the definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala is surlas chapter 112 verse number 1 to4 where Allah says say he's Allah one and only Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not know he the begotten there nothing like him this is a four-line definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala mentioned in the Quran in Surah chapter number2 verse number 1 to 4 if any person says so and so entity is God if he fits in this four line definition of surlas we Muslims have no objection in accepting that entity as Allah as God the first is say he's Allah one and only number two Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not noise he begotten there nothing like him this Sur is the Touchstone of theology Theo is God logic is study theology study of God and Touchstone you know when you go to buy and sell gold jewelry you go to a gold smith and you want to verify how pure is the gold so the Goldsmith takes the gold and rubs it against the touch tone and depending upon the color he tells you whether this gold is 24 karat gold whether 22 karat gold whether 18 karat gold or it may not be gold at all because All That Glitters Is Not Gold so surlas is the Touchstone of theology the God you are worshiping you put him to the test of surlas if the God you are worshiping passes the test of surlas he's a true God if he fails the test he's a false god you know there are some people some human beings who claim bhagan rash need to be God some people I didn't say Hindus Hinduism doesn't say that bhagan rashish is God but there are some human beings many of them who claim bhagan rashish to be God let us put bhagan rash to the test of test number one say is Allah one and only is bhagan rajish one there are thousands of men who have claimed to be God especially the country where I come from India there are thousands of men who say they are God is he the only one the second test Allah Allah the absolute and eternal we know from the biography of rajnish that bhagan rajnish he was suffering from Asama from diabetes malius from chronic backache imagine almighty God suffering from asema from diabetes malius from chronic backache the third test he begs not know he begotten and we know that bhagan rashes he was born and he had a mother and father who later on became his own disciple he was born in jabalpur in India and his parents became his own disciple in May 1981 bhagan dasn goes to USA and in the state of Oregon he starts his own Center called as rajnish puram and thousands of Americans and Europeans gather there later on the American government arrests him and puts him in prison bhagan dnis claims that the American government gave me slow poisoning in spirit in the prison the American government gave me slow poisoning imagine almighty God being slow poisoned and later on in 198 5 he's kicked out of America and he comes back to India and in the city of Puna in the state of Maharashtra where I live he starts the center rashish neas and later on he calls it as Oso commun if you go to his Cent Oso commune he has thousands of Europeans and westerners from all over the world when you go to his Oso commune in his samadi you know when the Hindus die they put the ashes and they make a Sam on a samadi is mentioned oh rajnish never born never died but visited the Earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990 never born never died but visited the Earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990 they forgot to mention in his samadi that he was not given visas to 22 different countries of the world almighty God coming to visit the world and he requires visas to go to different countries and the AR Bishop of Greece said if you don't take out rajnish and his followers from this country we'll burn his house and the house of his disciple and the last test the fourth test is so stringent that no one beside true Allah subhana tala can pass there's nothing like him the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God we know rajnish like the normal human beings he had two hands two legs one nose two eyes a long beard the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God suppose someone says that God is thousand times stronger than aner you heard the name aner the person who got the title Mr Universe strongest man in the world if someone says almighty God is thousand times stronger than an swasher the moment you can compare God to anyone whether it be an swasher whether it be King Kong whether it be daring the moment whether it is thousand times or million times the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God there nothing like him this is a four line definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala to find whether he true God or not so I request all the people check up the God you're worshiping if it passes the test of Surah the true God otherwise it's a fake God and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 4 verse number 48 that Allah forgiveth not associating partners with him anything else if he pleases he may forgive for anyone who associate partners with Allah he has created a grave H your sin Allah repeats the message in N 4 vers number 116 Allah subhah waaa does not forgive anyone joining Gods with him any other sin if he pleases May forgive for anyone who joins god with Allah he has strayed away far so shik is the biggest sin in Islam it is the biggest SIN number one major sin and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Haj chapter number 22 verse number 73 all those who you call upon besides Allah if they gather together listen to this Parable that all those who you worship besides Allah if you call them and if all of them gather together besides Allah to create a fly they will not be able to do it and if the fly snatches away something they will not be able to get it back feea those who petition and fee are those to whom they petition Allah is telling in the Quran that all the false god that you worship you know according to Hindu scriptures in Hinduism alone there are 33 Crow gods that means 330 million Gods if all the religions put together there are hundreds of millions of God Allah is telling here in this verse of the Quran if all these people who you worship besides Allah these hundreds of millions of gods false gods that you worship besides Allah if they gather together to create a fly they will not be able to do it and the verse continues if the fly snatches something away they won't even able to get it back leave aside create a fly they cannot even get back if the fly snatches something from them feeble weak are those people who pray to them and weak are those people to whom they pray"
