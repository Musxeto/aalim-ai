  "title": "If Stones are not God, Why do you Face the Ka'bah in Your Prayer - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yes brother my friend is Hindu and uh God is not there in Stones trees in Suns then they ask this why you both to only Caba why not in other directions well as the question that in short if idol worship is prohibited in Islam worshipping stones and Idols Etc then how come you bow down to the Caba are you worshiping the Caba and why only in that direction is it that you worship the Caba the reply to this question and it's very common question is that no muslim ever worships theaba Thea is our it is our Direction and we Muslims we believe in unity and if we have to offer Salah the Glorious Quran says in Surah bakar chapter number two verse number 144 that wherever you are bow in the direction of the Caba that is our for example if you want to offer Salah here in this Hall some may say let's face North some will say South some will say East some say West so for unity all the Muslims throughout the world we bow on to the same direction that is the towards theaba so if we in the north we bow towards the South if we in the South we bow towards the north if you're in the west towards the east if you're in the East towards the west and if we analyze the first person who drew the world map of geography he was a Muslim his name was Ali in 11:54 previously the Muslims and we drew we drew South Pole on top and north pole down Caba was in the center later on the western cartographers came and they turned the map upside down North Pole on top and South Pole down yet the Caba is in the center alhamdulillah and further when we go for Hajj or umra when we go to Makkah we do ta we do circum ambulation on the Caba the reason is because it is a commandment from Allah subhana tala and our beloved Prophet MMI wasallam but if we have to think logically what I can think is that every Circle has got only one Center so when we circum ambul around the ca we are testifying that there is one Allah subhana tala there's only one God and the statement of the second khif of islamar may Allah be pleased with him it's mentioned in s bukari volume number two in the book of Haj chapter number 56 Hadith number 675 he said that I'm kissing this black stone only because I saw the prophet guessing it otherwise this black stone can neither benefit me neither can cause me any harm so this statement that the black stone can neither benefit me can neither cause me harm is sufficient to prove that no muslim ever worshiped the Caba and furthermore as a last logical reason that I give is that during the time of the Prophet his companions there were several sahabas who stood on the Caba and gave the Adan gave the call for prayers now which Idol worshipper will ever stand on the idol he or she worships so this is sufficient proof that we Muslims don't worship the Caba it is only for Unity for Direction when we offer Salah hope the answer the question"
