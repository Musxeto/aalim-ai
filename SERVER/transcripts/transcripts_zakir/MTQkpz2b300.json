  "transcript": "the next question is from the YouTube what is the time duration for completion of the courses if you're asking that should it be done simultaneously can it be done later on duration once you enroll in the course you can do part of it today part of it tomorrow part of it after a few days no problem this would be saved in your personal history on the AL platform when you're doing any course the duration of the course per se there are two types of courses the short courses and the long courses the short courses the videos normally are for approximately 2 and a half hours the short courses some are even for one and a half hour some are even for 1 hour some short courses the video is for less than 1 hour some short courses the video is for 3 hours 4 hours average is 2 and half hours but it can extend to four or 5 hours the long courses the videos are more than 6 hours can extend up to 300 hours along with the video there's a transcript reading the transcript can take you less than the duration of the video assessment normally takes if the short course takes about 20 minutes to half an hour if it is a long course depending upon the length of the course it may take longer may take few hours so the full course watching the full video and not reading the full script partly or doing the assessment the duration ranges for a short course for about 3 to five hours maybe less maybe more for the long course it's normally more than 78 hours going to 10 hours to 15 hours maybe much more can go to 100 hours also depends upon the course if you are saying that can you do partly yes all the courses short course or long course you can do 25% 10% 5% you can stop it it remains in the memory of your personal history it says 10% of the course completed 20% of the course completed 50% completed you can resume from where you have left similarly with the script the courses are divided into lessons in the short courses you have normally six lessons some have two lessons some have three some have four some have 10 some have 15 but normally most of the short courses have six lessons each of about 25 minutes and this can be done at one go together can be done in two three settings depending upon you this is your option and this facility is there on the Ala platform"
