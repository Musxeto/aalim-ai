  "title": "The Secret behind Dr Zakir Naikâ€™s Memory - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the respected dr zakir naik sir i am mozar hussain city of rampur west bengal india do you have any trick for memorizing from different verses of the quran or books of the same thing a similar question as brother fahim from kashmir from pakistan do you have a photographic memory what is the reason behind your phenomenal memory and again the answer is the same what i gave earlier that first is allah's help second is struggling and striving and third is technique there are various techniques for memory which you get when you do mba courses which is called as mapping and all the others and believe me all these techniques have good limitations the best is help of allah certain things are there that when you memorize something after about 20 minutes again rehearse it again you have said after two hours again after few hours the more you rehearse it and revise it the more chances it will be part of you then next day the more you use it the more it becomes part of memory and once it goes into your permanent memory then even if you don't revise it will be in your memory for example surah fatiha almost all the muslims all the muslims know sarifatya even you get a form of sleep and they ask you to decide you can decide because that has gone in the permanent memory so the more you revise the more you practice it becomes part of memory i don't consider myself that i've got photogenic memory what i do is i strive i have to keep on revising i know that if this lecture has about 150 quotations from quran and hadith if i don't devise maybe i may say 90 percent if i revise i may be able to say 99 so before every lecture i try and revise as much as possible so that it is closer to the accuracy so more you strive the more you struggle the more you have faith in allah inshallah you'll be more successful"
