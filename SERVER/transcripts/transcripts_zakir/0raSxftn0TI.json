  "title": "How to pray Salaah with Complete Concentration and thinking about Allah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is abdulrahman razik assalamu alaikum my question is how to pray asala with full concentration and thinking about Allah Allah says in the Glorious Quran in Surah chapter number 23 verse number 1 and 2. verily the Believers they are successful those who they are in their prayer humbly submissive so you need to have hushu in your prayer and it is common that our mind wanders during the prayer many people their mind wanders during the prayer if you are a businessman you will think about your business how much profit you've made during the prayer if you are a student you'll think about your studies if you have appeared for an examination you will start reviewing the examination paper during the Salah for question two I should have written so and so answer question three I made a mistake in the answer so it is common that our mind wanders during the prayer how do we prevent our mind from wandering during the prayer the first thing that we need to do is to focus on the meaning of what we are deciding if you know Arabic as a language this is the best if you do not know Arabic as a language then we should recollect the meaning we need to memorize the meaning of what we are reciting for example when we recite Surah Fatiha alhamdulillah in our mind we should recollect the meaning all priesthood Allah the lord of the worlds the most gracious the most merciful we should recollect the meaning but after a few days after a few weeks even this will become mechanical so after recollecting the meaning we should Ponder upon the meaning of what we are reciting and if we do so inshallah our mind may not wander share with you an incident once the people they were offering Salah and the Imam and the muktadi the people who are following the Imam after they completed their prayer they were confused did we offer turaka or do we offer three raka in the Maghrib prayer so one person he says that I am sure that we have offered only to raka in the Maghrib prayer the people they ask him how do you know how can you be so sure how can you be 100 sure so he says I am 100 sure that we have offered to raka instead of offering three raka in the Maghrib prayer because whenever I offer the Maghrib prayer in each raka I do calculation of the profit that I have made in my shop I have three shops in each raka I do calculation of one shop so in three raka I do calculation of three shops but in this Salah I did calculation only of two shops I did not do calculation of three shops so that's the reason I am sure that we have offered only two raka so it is common that people their mind wanders during the prayer and the reason our mind wonders is because our mind is not occupied and empty mind is a devil's workshop he mentions in his book Alpha White on page number 200 that every individual stands in front of his Lord on two different occasions the first is while he's offering Salah and the second is on the day of judgment when he meets his Lord he said these two different occasions that an individual a believer stands in front of his Lord but if you do not offer Salah correctly then your accountability on the day of judgment it will not go with ease now let's discuss a few ways in which we can attain hushu and concentration in our prayer the first is bearing in mind who you're standing in front of knowing the greatness of Allah knowing how great Allah is if you know how great Allah is inshallah you will have and concentration in your prayer the second is knowing that Allah he is keeping an eye on you and he is watching you the third is offering your Salah with the intention of gaining complete reward from Allah the fourth and as I mentioned earlier it is a very important point that recollecting and concentrating upon the meaning of what you are reciting you should concentrate on the worst of the Glorious Quran and also you should concentrate on the other card that you say during the prayer so this is very important besides this you should also see to that your mind does not wander during the prayer we should also see to it that there are no objects around you that could distract you for example images people making some noises there may be music people causing disturbance when you offer Salah you should pray in such a place where there is no disturbance and I would like to share with you a small personal tip concentrate and focus only about the Salah and make your mind set in such a way that you are going to face your lord and then start your prayer inshallah you will have and concentration in your prayer and a blood Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him said that Allah turns towards a slave as long as he does not look around in his prayer so do not look around in your prayer so we should not look around in our prayer and we should also remember death we should offer asala as though it is our last prayer and if you offer usala in this way inshallah we'll offer it correctly with chapter number 29 verse number 45 for worldly prayer prevents from shameful and unjustickets Salah prayer prevents from shameful and unjust Deeds if we offer usala correctly with khushu with concentration we will have a righteous life and Salah will prevent us from shameful and immoral States the first thing among the Deeds that will be questioned to us on the day of judgment it is our prayer if it is done correctly the remaining Deeds it will follow that may he accept all asala all our prayer and may He help us to get ultimate hushu and concentration during a prayer"
