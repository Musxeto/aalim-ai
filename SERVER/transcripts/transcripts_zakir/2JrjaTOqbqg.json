  "transcript": "what are the special Elements which go together to make a sincere repentance there are four things required number one a person should realize the power of Allah subhana wa tala his power and his greatness that if he wants to punish you he can punish you immediately so this will make person repent and we should not look at the minuteness of our sin we should look at the greatness forgiveness of Allah subh tala as Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 71 verse number 13 and 14 Allah says that what has happened to you don't you have hope in the kindness and forgiveness of Allah subhana tala that he created you in different stages so if you know the mightiness of Allah subhana tala and he going to forgive you inshallah you'll repent number two everyone should realize that one day is going to die and he going to go to the Grave Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 Every Soul shall have a taste of death and on the day of judgment shall be the full recompense that means everyone has to die and the final the final recompense will be on the day of judgment and Allah says in the Quran in Sur L chapter number 31 verse 34 Allah says that no one knows what will earn tomorrow and no one knows in which land will he die so we have to realize that everyone has to die and we don't know when will that time come so that will help us in repenting as soon as possible we don't know when is our last hour the third point is that all the rewards for this world and is based on your Deeds for what you're going to do for your the Deeds for will actually reward you in this world and the that's very important and Allah says in the Quran in Surah F 35 ver number 5 that the promise of Allah is true and let not this present World deceive you and let not the chief deceiver deceive you against Allah subhana wa ta'ala that means we have to be careful that all our acts and deeds should basically Target about the about the Hereafter and there's a Hadith mentioned in Hadith number 2320 where the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that this world for Allah subhana wa ta'ala is equivalent to the wing of life and Allah subhana tala would not allow a disbeliever even to have a handful of water from it this world in comparison herea is like a wing of life and you would not allow a disb even to have a handful of water a similar message is given in say Muslim volum number four in the book of paradise Hadith number 6483 where the Beloved Prophet said that in the sight of Allah subhana tala this world as compared to the Hereafter is like a person putting his finger that the four finger into the ocean and when he gets it out whatever is stuck to the forefinger is like the present world the present world just hardly some little water that get stuck to the forefinger that's equivalent as compared to the mighty ocean that the here after so so little is the significance of this world as compared to the Hereafter so therefore we should realize that this life is a test for the Hereafter as Allah says in the Quran in Surah mul chapter number 16 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of his Good Deeds the fourth point is that human being should realize that the punishment can be expedient in this world and whatever punishment they get it is because of the sin whatever Calamity takes place in this it is basically for the sin as Allah says in Z Chapter number 43 Verse number 76 that no wise shall we be unjust to them but it is they who have being unjust to themselves so these four points are very important to be remembered soan Allah thank you Dr Zak once again for the answer Dr Zak if we could just U now clarify what is the the best time in one's life to seek repentance is there a Best Time indeed Allah says in the Quran inaha chapter number 4 verse number 17 that Allah accepts the repentance of the person who have done sin in ignorance and he asked for forgiveness quickly Allah subhana wa ta'ala is most merciful and is the most knowledgeable and wise now here based on the commentary of this verse of the Quran according to mujah Allah have mercy on him he said that the sin in ignorance means that any sin done knowingly or unknowingly unless the person does not come away from the sin it is ignorantly that means all the sins Allah forgive as long as a person repents quickly as far as quickly is concerned according to Hassan basri may Allah have mercy on him he said quickly here means before death and abas pleas with him he said quickly here means that before a person has a sickness which is mentioned in the Hadith of a beloved Prophet Muhammad wasallam Hadi of book of applications Hadith number 3537 that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will accept the repentance of his servant till his death rattle begins that means till the time he goes on his death bed unless he is in the last stage of life when he's on death bed that is the only time Allah will not accept the repentance any time before that he will accept so that means all the SC unanimously agree that quickly here in this quranic verse Sur CH 4: 17 means that we should ask forgiveness before that Allah says in Surah AUM 39 verse 54 to 58 it says that turn to your lord in Repentance before the penalty comes before it's too late unless your soul says that I have done a wrong deed and I mocked or the soul may say that please give me one more chance but it will be too late Allah says in Sur M 23 verse 1900 that when the time is over when the time when the de Bar has come and then you say that oh Allah subhana tala give me one more chance and Allah said that it's too late there cannot be another chance given so the time for repentance should be that if any sin is done in ignorance you should repent as soon as possible and Allah subhana tala from his Mercy from his Bounty he will forgive you Dr Zak for answering the question"
