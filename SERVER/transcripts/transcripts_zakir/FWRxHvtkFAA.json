  "title": "Eating and Drinking Intentionally and Deliberately while Fasting is a Major Sin - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "something which seems on the surface of it to be very very simple but maybe not does eating and drinking past fasting is it considered to be a major sin eating and drinking while fasting intentionally deliberately is a major sin if anyone eats intentionally while fasting it is a magician foreign and this food whether it enters through the mouth nourishment it makes the fast or if any liquid enters to the nose that too breaks the fast according to the Hadith which is mentioned in volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2360 where the Prophet said that when you're doing wudu you snuff the water in your nose excessively except while fasting this gives the indication that the water enters the nose and it enters the throat and goes into the stomach that breaks the fast so but naturally any drink any liquid that enters the nose then goes into the stomach through the throat that too invariates the fast but if someone eats or drinks unintentionally out of forgetfulness then the father does not break and this happens many times the first few days of Ramadan people are so used to getting up and eating you know and drinking water going to the kitchen so the first few days it does happen with some people that they forget and they have the water or they eat not knowing that the fasting so if a person unintentionally or out of forgetfulness drinks or eats the fast has to be completed it's not invalidated this is again according to the Hadith which is mentioned in say buhari verb number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1933 where the Beloved Prophet said that if a person eats or drinks unintentionally should complete his fast and what he has eaten and drunk it is from Allah said it's mentioned in word number three Hadith number 2043 as well as two zero four five a beloved Prophet said that Allah has excused from forgetfulness from mistakes and if something is forced on them if something isn't out of mistake out of forgetfulness out of compulsion Allah excuses you so only intentional eating and drinking break the fast and some rejection thank goodness for the mercy of Allah"
