  "title": "Since you sleep only for 3 to 3.5 hours in a day, do you feel lightheaded, drowsy & dizzy? â€“Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "from Bashara was seen by from Kashmir India he bexif assalamu alaykum zakat fur you said in Mumbai that you sleep only for three to three-and-a-half us I'm also sleeping as less as possible three to four hours a day but the problem is that all the day I feel light-headed I feel lousy and I see so my question is that do you also feel drowsy dizzy and lightheaded during the day and if you also feel the same then how do you o come that lots of love from Kashmir thank you the question is that yes I do when I was in Bombay has to sleep on average of three to three-and-a-half hours sometimes even two hours to an hour for some time for us for an hour on average three to three and a fast when I shifted to Malaysia when I did Hira to the beautiful country of Malaysia and increased my sleep by about half Anna now I sleep about three and a half hours to four hours sometimes two hours two and half are sometimes I hours on average three enough to four hours the question is that the person says that he feels dizzy he feels lightheaded if you drowsy and do I feel the same and how do i oh come on hamdulillah most of the time I do not really once in a blue moon maybe once in several months I may feel you know maybe drowsy but most of the time alhamdulillah I am fresh but let me tell you as a medical doctor the normal ass of sleep required for an average adult human being is eight hours an average min being should sleep at least seven to eight hours if he sleeps more than nine hours it is excessive if we sleep a less than seven hours it is less so therefore you should sleep between seven to nine hours the best is between seven to eight hours sleep and Santa very first say that anyone sleeps less than six hours a day cannot function normally and I agree with that so let me tell you that I request all the brother/sister that you sleep at least six to seven hours a day this is the best and it is good that issue sleep and Allah so Allah says that he had made the night for you to sleep but let me tell you one more thing also that most of the people who were successful in whichever field whether good bad ugly all of them were celebrities good bad ugly whether they are film stars or whether they're businessman whether they are the richest billionaires or whether there are good social workers or whether they are good Islamic speakers or real just because all of them most of them almost all they are very hardworking and the sleepless but this is a very small percent big point zero zero zero zero one percent though there is nothing mentioned in the fear of a beloved performance also lose the best example about how many are still asleep but when you see is routine you can make a judgement that the Prophet it is not possible for the Prophet to have slept for more than four and a half hours or five hours so according to my study he may have slept most of the time between three to four and a half five hours to sleep more than four enough as difficult because it favors Prophet Brit the OD paid camel l for one third of the night so if you can create all these things and then even if he sleeps early immediately after having food the time of sleeper calculated depending upon the season can maximum stretch to about four to five and a half hours and minimum can be lesser than that so I assume that the Prophet slept between three to four and afar but please let me tell you there is no serie that mentioned this it is my own research prophet slept left because you know my wife always tells me that the Quran says that the night has been made for you to sleep so it is fun now to sleep initially but then I quote the verse of the Quran that blessed are those people and those who attain Felicity in the genoise those who sacrifice their bed for the sake of Allah for it is both of course sleeping is better but if Allah has given you that capacity as far as I am concerned it is nothing that I'm unique it is a last man out on who has blessed me and has blessed all the human beings where the Muslim or non-muslim to make them function normally even if they sleepless for five hours of for are the three and half hours it is a blessing from Allah subhana Allah and most of the top scholars and the focal and you know we know from the history that they slept well in Italy and I also sleep less it is the blessing from last mana with Allah but if you feel headache please do not it does more damage to your health than good you may stay awake in the night and sleep less the productivity of those are that you're aware is 50 percent or 25 percent better sleep well and do better productivity is four times more than normal way laughing sleepy or twice my request to is please don't try and sleepless it's better than you sleep what's the requirement of our lives giving you the capacity like what Allah has given to me and then you do it's no problem"
