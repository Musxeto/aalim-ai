the youtube the instagram and twitter i welcome all the viewers with the islamic greetings assalamu alaikum may peace mercy and blessings of allah subhana wa tala of almighty god be on all of you i welcome you to this program ask dr zakir season 1 session 6. here you're most welcome to ask any question on islam and comparative religion or any question which a non-muslim may have posed to you or an atheist may have posed you and you are unable to reply even though non-muslims are welcome to ask any questions on islam and comparative religion or any question that you might have found in the media whether on the satellite channels whether in the newspapers attacking islam or criticizing islam any questions regarding islam this is the opportunity any questions on reason logic and science regarding islam this is your opportunity you can ask your question on any of my four social media platforms but the best would be to ask as a text message on the whatsapp by mentioning the question in brief along with your name your profession the city and country of origin to the whatsapp number plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five i repeat plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five the first question we have is from shoukat aziz kashmir india why can't we believe in reincarnation or rebirth which the hindus believe we believe in the life hereafter which is quite tough as compared to rebirth that is samsara scientifically there's a similar question asked on the same topic by sanjeev a businessman from india what will we do in jannah forever till eternity will we not get bored with unlimited time given in hand the rebirth concept seems more logical than that given in the quran maybe the concept of eternity is misunderstood by the muslim ummah and instead rebirth theory holds its place am i correct or not the two question posed by a muslim brother the first that isn't the concept of samsara the cycle of birth and rebirth more scientific and the second question posed by the non-muslim brother that sanjeev who says that what will you do in jannah would you get bored and isn't the concept of hinduism or free birth much better than the concept of hereafter in islam when we study hindu scriptures we come to know about the concept what is mentioned in hinduism but what the common hindu believes is in the concept of the cycle of birth death rebirth called as samsara by the hindu scholars or it's also called as the cycle of reincarnation and when we read the hindu scriptures we come to know it's mentioned in bhagavad-gita chapter number two verse number 22 that like a person wears new garments and new clothes and throws away the old clothes similarly the soul puts on a new body and gives up the whole body based on this they have the concept of samsara but when we read the vedas the vedas are the most authentic and the highest amongst all the hindu scriptures it is highest in authority when we read the vedas it talks about the punarjanam puner in sanskrit means next jana means birth so punarjanam means next birth no way does the vedas speak about birth then death then rebirth then death then rebut no way this is the concept given by the hindu scholars and pandits but the vedas which in the highest scriptures amongst all the hindu scriptures speak about punar janam means next life they misunderstand and they say it means that birth death but it's nowhere mentioned in fact it is similar to what is mentioned in the quran that we are born in this world then we die then we are resurrected in the next life the muslims believe in the concept of hereafter next life exactly the same what is mentioned in the vedas now let us try to understand why do the hindu scholars speak about the samsara that is the cycle of birth death rebirth or the cycle of reincarnation because they could not justify or could not logically prove that why are some human beings in the world they are upon some handicap born healthy some human beings are born with congenital defects some are born rich some are born poor so how can god be unjust so to justify this concept that how can god be unjust by making some people born in a rich family some in a poor family some healthy some with congenital defects they came with the concept that if a person does sin in the next life he will be born with the defects he may be born poor he may be born with congenital defects he may be born handicapped so this is how they justify as far as the islamic concept is concerned regarding why some people are born rich or poor handicapped or healthy we'll discuss that later on but first let us try to understand that is this concept of samsara the theory of reincarnation or the cycle of birth death and rebirth is scientific or not what the hindu scholars they say that the living creatures keep on being born in different types and the highest is the human being and if you do a sin in the next life you're born with a lesser category and with a lesser degree you'll be born handicapped you may be born poor my basic question is that if we compare life what was 200 years back or 100 years back as compared to today is the sin in the world increasing or decreasing are the criminal activities increasing or decreasing and any logical person will tell you that sin in the world is increasing the criminal activities are increasing the illegality is increasing so if the sin is increasing logically the human beings in the world should decrease but when we check the population of the world every year the world population is increasing previously it was a few thousand human beings then became hundred thousand then became million then became billion today it is 7.75 billion so if the sin is increasing and if they agree that if you do sin you are born with a lesser category or you are demoted so human beings logically they should keep on decreasing in population so scientifically this concept doesn't hold water again if you change the scriptures it talks about swarg and narc talks about paradise and hell so if a person does good deeds his karma are good he goes to swerve if he does bad deeds he goes to nerf now the reason he goes to swar gives it is a reward given by almighty god to him and the reason he goes to nerf hell it is a punishment so imagine almighty god puts a human being into sword because he wants to reward him for his good deeds then he puts him into nerf because he wants to give punishment so once a reward is given or a punishment is given when the human being comes back to the earth when he's reborn why is he born as handicapped why is he born poor if the punishment is already given to him in hell it is illogical for god to make him reborn in this world with a congenital defect make him reborn as a poor person why so the concept of heaven and hell together with the cycle of birth rebirth doesn't match logically at all you cannot have both you there are one of them if you believe that if he's done some bad deeds in life he'll be born inferior or with congenital defect or in poverty then where is the concept of heaven and hell so saying that the hindu philosophy that is explained by the pundits is totally unscientific and illogical but what is spoken in the way that is correct the veda speaks about punar janam the next life same as what the quran says and what he says so logically and scientifically the vedas are correct but the explanation of the hindu scholars of samsara is against the vedas is against the quran the concept of the vedas matches with the concept of the quran and regarding what will the people do in heaven the question posed by our non-muslim brother sanjiv they'll get bored in the heaven but natural what you want you'll get it will be bliss it will be peace salam salam peace but the highest level in the jannah in paradise is seeing the verge of allah is seeing the face of almighty god and that is what people would yearn for besides having all the other the peace the serenity no problem it will be only tranquility seeing the face of allah subhanahu wa people will learn so of course there'll be something to look forward in the jannah so the brother because he doesn't know about the islamic concept he is not verbal say the hadith of the prophet muslim the highest level is seeing the face of allah and will not always see the face of allah only those who have reached the higher level will see and therefore sometime when allah wants to show it to the human beings now coming to the basic question how can we logically prove that why are some human beings born handicapped some are unhealthy some are born in poverty some are born rich allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 67 verse number two it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds this life is a test for the hereafter and based on this test allah will check who is good in deeds and if you pass this test you go to paradise you go to jannah you go to swarg if you fail you go to hell you go to narak so this life is the test for the hereafter and allah test different human beings in different ways when you have the examination every year the examination paper keeps on changing you don't expect the teacher to give the same paper the teacher to ask the same question is the same question as then where is the test so similarly allah subhanahu wa allah test different people in different ways and depending upon the test allah has given you he will judge you accordingly for example those people who are rich are born in rich family or who allah has given wealth for them one of the pillars of islam the third pillar of islam is zakat that is every rich muslim adult muslim who has a saving of more than the nisab level more than 85 grams of gold he or she every lunar year should give 2.5 percent of that excess wealth in charity this is called a zakat if every human being gives zakat poverty would eradicate from this world there will not be a single human being who die of hunger now many people would say that the poor man oh how sad it is such a pity that he is born in poverty but for the poor man in the test of zakat he gets 100 out of 100 100 marks because he doesn't have to give the cut he doesn't have a saving of more than 85 grams of gold for the rich man he has to give minimum 2.5 percent if he does not give he'll get less marks if he gives he'll get full marks or he may get fifty percent he may get zero percent but for the poor man he already gets hundred out of hundred in zakat because he's poor for him the test is different every muslim should do hijab for the rich man who has an apartment of many bedrooms and when guests come etc for him to maintain the hijab is much more easier because he's wealthy has got many rooms for a poor man who may be living in just a small studio apartment or maybe living in a hut for him to maintain hijab is difficult so each one has a different test accordingly we think with our logic oh the man is poor how sad and a beloved prophet said it is easier for a poor man to go to jannah than a rich man so we think poor person actually for him it is easier he has a different set of rules a different test but it is easier for him to go to jannah than a rich person now someone may ask me that why is a baby born with congenital heart disease why some human beings are born handicapped every human being according to a beloved prophet is born as a muslim he is born in fitra on the innate nature he is muslim be sinless it is not because he did a sin in the previous life that is one handicap this concept is totally illogical but it is a test it may not be a test for young child it's a test for the parents allah wants to test the parents that do the parents yet have faith in allah at all or not the parents may be good muslims they may be pray five times a day they may be fasting in the month of ramadan they may have given the zakat then they have a child which is born handicapped so allah subhana wa tala wants to give a higher level of test to the parents that after they have done all these good deeds and after i have rewarded them now when i give them a child who's born handicapped do they yet have faith in allah or not a good muslim will say this is from allah we accept it and they will yet continue thanking allah and doing the duties more difficult to test reward for example if you appear for a bachelor's in arts the chances of passing are very high but chances of passing bachelors in science is a little bit more difficult if you appear for a medical examination the chances are much less so higher or more difficult is the test higher is reward but when you pass a bachelor's in ads in front of a name your name will yet have mr in front of you but when you pass the examination of medicine bachelor's in medicine in front of your name there will be a dr doctor because it's more difficult to pass the honor is more you start being called as a doctor so higher the test higher is the reward so allah test different human being in different ways that's the reason there is different levels of richness and poverty health and wealth this is a logical concept nowhere does the quran say that if you're born poor you'll go to hell or if you're born handicapped will go to hell all the children all the human beings are muslim when they're born depending upon the test and how well you pass it will you get a reward in the hereafter so the concept of islam of hereafter and heaven and hell jannah and dosak is the same as what is mentioned in the highest hindu scriptures that is the veda talking about punar janam just because the hindu scholars could not justify these inequalities the human means they came with the philosophy which is against the vedas but if you read the hindu scriptures it is the same concept as that in islam hope that answers the question the next question from hassan from oman if someone does not do anything forbidden but the only thing is that he does not pray is it possible for him to enter paradise the question posed by brother hassan from oman that if a person doesn't do anything forbidden but the only thing he does he does not pray so can he go to jannah it is like somebody asking me that i want to have a very good healthy body i do exercise i go to the gym i daily go to work i do cycling only thing i don't do is i do not eat anything the full day do you think the person will be healthy by going to the gym cycling going for the morning walk jogging very good fresh air but does not eat anything full day like it is known to us for a healthy body you should have three meals a day similarly for a spiritual soul it's compulsory that minimum you should pray five times a day praying five times a day is further islam regarding the question that can i go to jannah if i don't do anything haram and maybe do all the other good deeds but do not offer prayer our beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned in muslim point number one hadith number 246 that between the man and shirk and kufar stands the offering of salah missala praying salah is the differentiation between a man and shirk and kuffar that's what the prophet said that's the reason the scholars many scholars say that if a person who does not pray at all it is he becomes a kafir some scholars are more lenient to say that if a person doesn't pray but believe praying is a fur then he cannot be called as a kafir the difference of being amongst the deeds that is the most important a beloved apostle said it's mentioned in sunnah volume number five hadith number 3996 that the prophet said that the first deed that allah will ask on their judgment is regarding offering of salah so the most important deed amongst all that it is allah as we discussed in the last session the biggest sin is the sin of shirk the thing which is haram is shirk then would be murder black magic etc similarly amongst the deeds that is the most important it is salah it is prayer and if you don't do that that is like your hundred dollars in deeds like how i said in sin tahith is 100 is the worst similarly in deeds number one is if you don't offer salah can you go to jannah allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 48 and surah chapter number 4 verse 916 if allah pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of shirk he will never forgive yes if after committing shirk if you repent ask for forgiveness and stop it inshallah forgive that also but if you die as a mushrik without asking for forgiveness without leaving shirk you are destined for hellfire there is no forgiveness the most important deed to be done is allah if you don't offer salah the chances of you going to jannah is bare minimal very negligible if allah wishes to forgive you because they have not done shirk allah may forgive you possibility is there probability is not there possibility yes but very low 0.0001 because that's the most important deed if you do something else and if allah is pleased with you and allah wants to forgive you there is too much of sin but the person cannot take the risk we are undergoing the final examination this is the test for the hereafter you cannot take that chance and if you analyze if i ask you a simple question there is a human being who everyone is saying who is so grateful he's such a good human being and he is looking after other people he is going and helping the poor and he's loving everyone else and when you closely go and analyze you realize that he had a mother and father who were very loving who took care of him who looked after him and educated him gave him good clothes and then he became rich but later on he doesn't take care of his parents at all he's not even going and meeting them for years together he's not thanking them so how will you call him a good human being just because helping the poor but the main people maintain human beings his parents mother and father who took care of him gave him the education and bought him up because of that why today he's got a good job and he neglects them doesn't meet them doesn't care for them doesn't go and even say how are you for years together how can you call him a good even me no compare to parents and allah allah is our creator in salah we are thanking allah and besides saying allah we are getting guidance from him how should we lead our life i have given the talk on salah the programming towards righteousness that not only do we pray and thank allah we also get guidance from him and if we offer salah in the right way we are being guided to good deeds so the chances if you offer salah correctly you will be on the straight path is very high and if you are in trouble the best solution is allah if you are in trouble and if you have a problem you cannot say that you have tried everything to solve the problem until you pray in the last one third of the night and ask for the problem to be solved in tajin besides the five couples in salah there are many other salah salah is the programming to righteousness it is your main soul the best deed salah and while i was doing my little research on the life of the prophet i realized that the prophet on average so the seerah doesn't mention exactly how many hours he slept in a day on average according to my study he might have slept between three to four hours a day because hadith says that you should pray for one third of the night you have to pray sure then surimaran that's more than two jews the nearly two jews both put together four jews so but naturally to take us so based on this depending upon whether summer or winter the nights keep on getting short and long the maximum that the profit could accept was maybe three to four hours not more than that and if we analyze the time used to spend praying every day if you just calculate logically it would be more than five six hours so according to me according to my research the prophet prayed more number of hours than the number of hours he slept anyway let me be very clear there is no hadith or no quranic was telling that you should spend more time in praying than sleeping not at all but this was the practice of the prophet i'm just telling you something about the prophet practice not that every human being should do it it's difficult but as a normal human being requires about seven hours of sleep minimum seven to eight hours minimum is six hours so it's difficult that's the reason if you heard my answer when i gave last month in the month of ramadan about my daily routine i said when i was in bombay i used to sleep for about three hours and i have to pray also approximately for three hours when i came to malaysia i started praying for about four hours 15 minutes and my sleep increased to three and a half hours this was what i said in ramadan but after ramadan for the last one month alhamdulillah i've increased my time for prayers i started praying tajiris for minimum one and a half hour every day alhamdulillah after ramadan half juice in a slow recitation takes about one and a half hour previously massaging this to vary from 20 minutes 30 minutes sometime one hour but average was about 30 minutes now it has increased to one and a half more than one hour so now my average time i spent counting the time from the azan when i do wudu walk to the mosque come back total all the five salah and the salah the doha and tajiw approximately five hours 15 minutes if i remove the time of wudhu and the time of going and coming and the time of dua yet it will be more than four hours alhamdulillah and my time of sleep is about three and a half hours so when i'm alhamdulillah trying that let my hours of salah be more than hours of my sleep anyway this is not compulsory at all for the muslims it is just my research and i'm trying to follow what i can and allah has blessed me that i can do my work throughout the day even if sleeping less it's a nyama from allah so prayer is the most important deed regarding the answer that if you don't pray and do all the other good deeds and stay away from the bad deeds the chances of you going to jannah is very very bare minimal if allah wants to forgive you and put you in jannah that's allah's prerogative but the chances are very less so my request to brother that see to it that you pay attention on your salah your full life should revolve around salah if a person is a good practicing muslim all these activities in the day it revolves around salah the timing needs is based on salah before salah after salah the time he sleeps is based on salah the appointment he gives to anyone is based on salah so those people are practicing muslim and see to it that they offer salah five times a day in jamaat in the mosque their whole daily routine revolves around salah it is the most important factor it builds a discipline in you and it is the most important deed i request you that you should always pray alhamdulillah five times a day in the mosque in jamaat that's the best hope to answer the question the next question from shameem alam sarkar from assam india will christians go to jannah if they worship allah alone without partners follow jesus christ peace be upon him but do not accept prophet muhammad peace be upon him as the messenger of god regarding a christian who believes in one god worship only one god allah allah follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him but does not believe in prophet muhammad peace be upon him to follow the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him and not believe in prophet muhammad peace be upon him is not possible at all it is like saying that i know english well but i don't know abcd because it is clearly mentioned in the bible in the gospel of john chapter number 12 verse number 11 to 14 jesus christ peace be upon him says i have many things to send to you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself all that he shall speak he shall glorify me here in this prophecy prophet jesus peace be upon him is talking about the coming of the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him there are various prophecies in the old testament and the new testament about the coming of the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him so for a person to say that he believes in the bible or he follows the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him and he does not believe in prophet muhammed is illogical the quran is very clear-cut and the quran says in surah chapter number 61 verse number 6 that jesus christ peace be upon him said origin of israel i have been sent as the messenger of allah to you confirming the scriptures that came before me and giving glad tidings of a messenger to come whose name shall be ahmad sallallahu ahmad is the other name of prophet muhammad peace be upon him so even the quran clearly mentions that jesus christ peace be upon him told to his followers you have an israel or children of israel i give you glad tidings of a messenger to come prophet muhammad peace be upon him so for any christian to go to jannah besides believing there's one god not doing shirk besides believing jesus christ peace be upon him he should also believe in the last and final messenger that is the prophet muhammad if he does not believe then he will not be following the teams of jesus christ peace be upon him and he will not go to jannah hope that answers the question the next question from tanweed alam from new york usa should the fasting of three days a month to be done on ayam will be 13 14th and 15th or any three days of the month the question posed by tanveed alam from new york usa is that the three days that i have to fast every month should be done only on the yam will be the 13th 14th and 15th of the month or it can be done any three days of the month what is the meaning of ayam will be i am is the plural of yom dave bid means white so ayam will be means the white days these days refer to the days when the moon is at the brightest when it is a full moon so in the lunar calendar the 13th 14th and 15th the day of the lunar calendar when the moon is the brightest then the moon is a full moon it is called as ayam will be the white days or the days when the night is the brightest or the moon is the brightest so ayam will be the day the 13th 14th and 15th of the lunar calendar the various hadith in which the prophet has recommended that the muslims should fast on three days then the hadith mentioned in say bihari and say muslim in lake that abu hurairah allah be pleased with him he said that my close friend referring to prophet muslim has asked me to do three things every day till then of my life and i keep on doing it till the end of my life and those are fasting three days every month praying the salat and sleeping after with her so based on this we come to know the prophet muhammad recommended him that you should fast three days every month there are other hadith mentioned in say muslim that when one lady companion assad aisham allah be pleased with her that did the prophet fast three days every month she said yes which of the days did he fast she said it did not matter which day it was there's one more this is hershey says that sometimes the profit fasted in the beginning of the month sometime in the middle of the month sometime towards the end of the month there's another hadith which is mentioned in say target it's a say hadith by nasa dalmani that the prophet said that anyone who fasts three days every month of his life it is as though he has fasted for his full lifetime and ayam will be the 13th 14th and 15th of the month there is one more hadith in say turkey where a buddha may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet told him that if we have to fast any days in a month fast on the 13th 14th and 15th of the month based on this we come to know that the prophet recommended it's that a muslim should fast three days every month and the best it is mustab that you fast on the ayam will be the 13th 14th and 15th so the best the most recommended is that fast three days every month and fast on the 13th 14th and 15th but if you cannot fast on the 13th 14th or 15th maybe because the ladies may be having the menstrual cycle or a person may be traveling or you may be having a guest if we fast any other days also it is acceptable because there are other hadith we say that you can fast on any of the three days so the better of the options is fast on the three days but for any reason you cannot fast on these three days the 13th 14th the 15th if you fast any other days no problem whether you fast consecutively all three together or you fast with a break both accepted as long as you fast three days but the abseil the best is on ayam repeat and what did the prophet mean when he said if you fast three days in a month as though you fasted for a full lifetime because a prophet says that every good deed is multiplied by ten so if you fast three days in a month you're actually fasting 30 days in a month that's the full month and if you fast three days every month of your life it is as though you have fasted for the full lifetime so this is the multiplication of the factor by 10. that's what it meant so if you fast three days in the yaml beat that is the best regarding ayam will be because most of us follow the solo calendar we are not aware of the lunar calendar and the lunar calendar is followed in few countries among the muslim countries mainly the gulf countries so there you follow the calendar no problem but the question can be asked that do we have to see the moon normally people are more particular about seeing the moon themselves with the eyes during ramazan and during hajj because there are two feather and either other so for ramban and hajj people are more particular but even the calendar that you have normally that the muslim countries follow it is scientifically and quite accurate but because it's a sharia requirement for these two occasions for ramadan starting of ramadan ending of ramadan and for the starting of hajj that you should see it with your eyes it's a sharia requirement otherwise even following foreign will be the normal calendar that you have ayam will be this is not the same throughout the world depending upon the moon so it may vary by one day or two in different parts of the world like today it's already 13th of the lunar month in the gulf countries but in malaysia it is not malaysia it is 12th so i'll be fasting from tomorrow inshallah but those who are staying in the gulf countries and those who fast nayam will be today is the 13th for people living in malaysia other parts of the world it is tomorrow sometimes it may even differ by two days so it's a sunnah mahada preferable to fast on the 13th and 15th if there's a difficulty even any other days would do hope that answers the question there is a question posed by tufail fayyas from kashmir it's on the whatsapp just came which comes first humanity or religion regarding the question which comes first humanity or religion it depends upon which religion are you talking about some religions it may come later as far as islam is concerned a muslim is not a good muslim unless he's a good human being first so in islam all the aspects of humanity are covered so if you ask the question which will come first humanity or islam i would say islam because islam encompasses humanity it's like asking would you like to pass school or would you like to pass graduation when you pass graduation is understood that a passing school also without passing school you cannot pass graduation so islam is far superior it includes all the aspects of humanity there is not a single teaching of islam which is against humanity people may think it is but the moment you realize the logical reason why that rule has been prescribed in islam there is not a single teaching of islam which is against humanity as a whole so i would say between the two between humanity and islam of course islam is number one that is the reason it's clearly mentioned in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 19. in nadine islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah is islam there's another question that came on the facebook just now from sheikh for khan why prophet muhammad peace be upon him did not do miracles like the previous prophets to say that prophet muhammad peace be upon him did not do miracles is totally wrong there are various miracles that the prophet did for example the prophet he split the moon it is mentioned in the quran and even scientifically today if you do research you come to know that the moon has got fissure they don't know what the reason is but since the quran says about shaktar khamr that the prophet split the moon there's a book written which talks about the miracles of the prophet and there are a couple of hundred miracles mentioned in that that the prophet spoke to animals the tree came and shaded the prophet when you're going for the call of nature there are various miracles but but we muslims don't boast of these miracles the reason we muslims do not boast of this miracle is because at the time when the quran was revealed it was not the age of miracles previously was the age of americans at the time of muslim at the time of islam and the remarry miracles which are mentioned in the quran even the prophetic miracles but all the miracles that were done by the earlier prophets you cannot prove it now for example musa islam is pretty the sea it's mentioned in the quran muslims believe in it can we prove it logically scientifically did musa split the sea we cannot isa al-salaam gave life to the dead it's mentioned the bible is mentioned in the quran can i prove it today he gave life to the dead without doubt no prophet split the moon can i prove 100 scientifically no i can give okay there are indications that there is a fissure in the moon it may be because but no so the miracles are things which science cannot justify at that time so what was the miracle that time may not be a miracle today what we have to analyze today the miracle of the miracle given to the prophet muhammad was the glorious quran quran is the miracle of miracles which can prove itself at that time can even prove today and if we analyze quran has proved itself with the word of god in all the ages when it was revealed it was the age of literature and poetry previously age of miracles quran is a miracle of americans when the quran was revealed it was not the age of america it was the age of literature and poetry the non-muslim the pagan arabs at that time arabic was at its pinnacle the moment they heard the verses of the quran they realized this cannot be from any human being the way it is the words it has to be from god and they accepted islam today is not the age of literature and poetry if i say in a very poetic fashion the world is flat will a modern men believe the answer is no today's age of science and technology today if we test the quran with science and technology you can easily be satisfied that there is not a single verse in the quran which is against established science and though the quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c it's the book of signs s-i-g-n-s it's a book of ayats and there are more than six thousand signs six thousand ayaats in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about sans and i've given a talk on quran and modern science compatible or incompatible if you put the test of science to the quran quran is the only religious book on the face of this who passes the test all the other scriptures they will fail the test and later on there may be another age we don't know what age it will be so alhamdulillah almighty allah gave the miracle of miracles to prophet muhammad and allah says in the quran in surah and kabut chapter 29 verse number 48 that we gave the book to a person who's unlettered the prophet was unlettered he could not read or write so that even the blabbers of vanity would not object that means this quran no one can say that the prophet is the author he sought to it that the last and final messenger was unlettered so that no one could lay an allegation the prophet wrote the quran knows bella even the most intelligent man cannot write but even the smallest excuse hardly big enough to hang a fly allah did not give them so that is the reason alhamdulillah the greatest miracle actually was given to the prophet that is the quran which cannot only be proved that time it can be proof today and will be able to be proved to be the word of god to eternity inshallah we have on the facebook sima sagar sp sharif pradhan missed rahima shariah kabir all these people on the facebook assalamu alaikum he wants the number given by zakir naik for live session anyone would like to ask a question they're most welcome to ask on any of the social media platforms but the best would be to ask on the whatsapp as a text message you can send your question in brief don't let it be too long in brief mentioning your name your profession city and country of origin to the whatsapp number plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five i repeat plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five the next question is from akil hussain from lahore pakistan is quote marriage legal or illegal according to the islamic point of view is court marriage legal or illegal account islamic point of view depending upon which court you're talking about if it is an islamic court it's legal if it's not islamic court it did not legal islamic syria that is the reason it's very important that most of the muslims are not aware about the court marriages if you're living in islamic country which is ruled or governed by the islamic syria then no problem in marrying in the court of that country for example it may be malaysia it has sharia law you can follow it or it can be saudi arabia or it can be any of the gulf countries where islam is followed no problem at all there are three types of countries one in which islam is the state religion and they follow the sharia like the countries i mentioned second can be a non-muslim country but that non-muslim country gives you a permission to follow the personal law of each particular citizen for example india in india every citizen of india can follow his or her law as far as religion is concerned as far as religious laws are concerned talking about civil law the criminal law is common india is a secular country it's a democratic country the citizen of india respected whether he is muslim or a christian or a hindu he can follow his personal law it's called as the personal law as far as civil rights are concerned in the criminal law you have common then you have a third type of country like most of the western countries usa canada uk there an individual citizen is not allowed to follow the personal law based on the religion he has to follow the common civil law as i mentioned earlier if islamic country following the islamic sharia doing a court marriage is permissible it follows the islamic sharia no problem at all or you do nikah at home and you register as per the laws of the country in countries like india where an individual citizen is allowed to follow his own personal law as far as religion is concerned like in india we have a muslim personal law in this case it is very important that a muslim should not do court marriage if you do court marriage in india the rule of the indian government common law will apply not the islamic law so in india a muslim should do nikah as per the sharia and then register his nikah with the indian government saying that these two people man and woman their husband and wife but if you go and do a marriage in the civil court of india then the law of indian court will apply then that person cannot have more than one wife if the person dies the inheritance would be according to the indian law not according to the law of the sharia everything marriage divorce inheritance all the personal law would be according to the court to the indian government so for a muslim in a non-muslim country to do a court marriage in haram islam especially if you are living in a country like india which permits you to have a personal law in this case if you go out of the way and do a court marriage it's totally haram it's as good as kofi because you're rejecting the law of islam which the country has given you permission to follow the law of quran and they say hadith and you're following the law of that country in civil matters it's totally wrong as far as living in the country where the personal law is not allowed to be followed that place also is better you do nikah even though the islamic sharia law you will not be able to follow better do anika as per the islamic sharia and then you can may be registered or tell to the government that your husband and wife that is sufficient so in islamic country islamic laws followed marrying in court is permissible but in a non-muslim country court marriage is prohibited hope that answers the question the next question is asked by abdullah ammar from afghanistan i have recently got admission at the university and as it's a co-educational system i have developed relationships and started talking with some of my female classmates through whatsapp and messenger even though we consider each other as brother and sister relationship but i found that this is leading me astray from the straight path like i cannot pray at times right now and i cannot concentrate in my salah and many more things can you please tell me if it's permissible what i'm doing is right and if it's not permissible please give me an advice how can i get myself out of this situation it's not only me who is going through these situations but there are many muslims whose fate is same as mine then another question on the same topic asked by assad nadeem on the youtube can people of opposite gender be friends the question posed by abdullah ahmad from afghanistan is a very common question and it's common today that people go to co-educational schools co-educational universities and it's very common that when they go there they have friends of opposite sex as the question posed that can you have friends of the opposite gender and they get involved and it leads them away from the teachings of islam as far as having friends of the opposite gender is concerned what do you mean by the word friend is important if you're talking about acquaintances having of opposite gender no problem having acquaintances as long as you do not break any of the teachings of the quran and say hadith as long as you do not break any of the ruling of the sharia you can have acquaintances of opposite sex and we'll come to it inshallah shortly regarding saying that i consider them to be my sister and brother you have to understand what do you mean by brother and sister if you're talking about brother and sister and humanity no problem if you're talking about brother and sister in faith no problem but this brethren sister is not the same as brother and sister of blood this is totally nonsense you know like we have in india a girl ties the rakhi to the boy she is my rocky sister there's no rocky sister in islam sister in humanity okay like i say sisters asked a good question sister in faith no problem but all these sisters of humanity and faith you have to do full and total hijab with them only with your blood sister where your parents are common whether both parents are one parent then the hijab is relaxed even with your cousin you have to maintain your full hijab the problem is that we see in the western countries it's very common that this intermingling of sexes and many of the muslim countries this is becoming common in them too where you have co-education schools you have co-educational universities and there you have friends and you keep on chatting and you keep on speaking things which are not required if you speak with an opposite sex things which are required as an emergency no problem but you cannot do chatting like how you do with the same sex like a boy has a boyfriend no problem you can chat you can laugh you can joke but you cannot do the same thing with an opposite sex who is an amerum it's not permitted in islam what we find and it's very clearly mentioned as far as the hijab is concerned before talking about the hijab for the woman hijab for the woman is given in the quran that a muslim should be properly covered and i discussed that in my previous session then also in my lectures that complete body should be covered the only part can be seen are the face and hands up with the wrist etc but this is only the hijab of the clothes the complete hijab besides the hijab of the clothes is the hijab of way a lady walks the way a lady talks the way a lady thinks the way a lady sees before talking about the hijab of the female the woman in the quran allah talks about the hijab of the men in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 30 where allah says say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and guard his modesty that means whenever a male looks at a female any brazen thought coming in his mind he should lower his case there was once a boy staring at a girl for a long time so tell me brother what are you doing it's not allowed in islam he told me that a prophet said the first glance is forgiven the second is prohibited i have not completed half my glance what did the prophet mean when he said that the first glance is forgiven the second is prohibited what it means that if you accidentally look at a woman do not look at her again to feast on a beauty that does not mean you can look at a woman for 10 minutes without blinking and saying that i have not completed my glance so maintaining the hijab is very important therefore it is not advisable for taking education in a co-educational university and if you have to take education if there is no other option then you have to maintain your hijab when you're speaking with the opposite sex you should lower your game you cannot stare at the woman or look into your eyes and talk in the western country if you do not look into the eyes and speak it's also like an insult so what we find that even the muslim when they go to western countries they do not follow this hijab when i visited islamic organizations in western countries i find that muslim ladies and gents sisters and brothers they are freely intermingling they're freely talking they may be wearing the hijab they may be covered their hair is covered but that is the physical injury only of the clothes they're laughing they're choking in some of the western countries i found a man and a woman sitting alone in a small room and chatting a muslim woman doing the hour to a non-muslim boy in a closing it's not allowed our beloved prophet muslim said that if two name alone in a room the third person is a devil it's not allowed that you can be in a closed room a man and a woman and some organization have gone and seen that head of the organization has the lady secretary how can you have a lady secretary do you think all the muslim men in that country are not capable or aren't they qualified i cannot understand that how can a practicing muslim have a lady secretary how can they maintain the hijab if the secretary comes in the room in your room and no one else is there it's not permitted it is very common unfortunate they are preaching islam and not practicing islam so if you break the hijab there are high chances what the brother has asked amar will happen your focus will go away from education you will start thinking other things as though your brother sister for name sake but then love affair starts and you deviate from the sharia and you start doing un-islamic things therefore best is to educate yourself in a single sex university and there's a survey done in uk that the schools which were single sex had better performance and single sex universities as compared to universities which were quite and that's the same thing in india also if it's a single sex education the performance is better because many a time in a co-education each sex is trying to impress the other sex so if a teacher is teaching the boy is trying to impress the girl in his class rather than paying attention on the subject this is very common so single sex education is better if there's no other opportunity then if you're doing higher education if you have to go to a quiet education see to maintain your hijab i'm not talking only about universities even if you go in office places your hijab should be maintained it is not that you are prohibited to speak with opposite sex no but when you speak you have to be careful there's a verse revealed in the quran in surah azza chapter number 33 verse number 32 which is addressed to the wife of the prophet um it says that o wise of the prophet be not too complacent in your voice lest in whose heart is a disease he will have desires imagine the wives of the prophet they are called as um it is not permitted for anyone else to marry the wives of the prophet even after the prophet has died the quran is revealing a verse for the wives of the prophet be not too complacent in your voice lest in whose heart is a disease he may have some desires imagine the sahabas who are the highest level among the muslim ummah the prophet said the best generation was the sabbath there is no human being today on the face of the earth which is anywhere close to the sabbath there is no woman who is anywhere close to the moment yet allah says to the moment do not be complacent in your voice why so that in whose heart is the disease can the sabbath have a disease in the heart you cannot think of it yet for safety as a precaution allah revealed this verse and today we find the woman in the offices in muslim organizations in muslim companies they are talking to each other they are laughing leave aside complacent they are joking what they think only wearing the scar hijab is done they are totally wrong and unfortunately this western culture is even populating into the muslim countries nowadays we find muslim countries also muslim men and women they freely talk they're freely mixed if you required if there's a requirement you have to talk then you can talk but when you talk don't look iron to eye lower your gaze how many muslims do you find today in the world when they speak to a namiram lady that they lower the gates very few in the western country hardly you will be counted like a joker but believe me alhamdulillah a strong muslim will follow this and if this is done all these things will not happen as the question was asked my mind is diverting i cannot offer salah but natural and today we find the dressing also is not as for the sharia you have non-muslim ladies not dressing up properly when the muslim ladies they may be muslim they may not be releasing properly more of the body is exposed than covered so all these things you have to maintain the hijab if you maintain the hijab the men maintaining their hijab that whenever they look at a woman they should lower the gaze and see to it that they also not too friendly only talk when is required when there is a requirement not unnecessary joking etc can't be done with the same sex but not with the opposite sex hope that answers the question the next question this question is asked by ansar from assam india but the father ansar is asking a question i am basically a student preparing for my engineering exam i am actually facing some psychological issue in my recent observation i feel that whenever i try to increase the intensity of god consciousness or my iman then i cannot focus on my academic performance and if i try to focus on my academics then my intensity of god consciousness weakens why am i not able to carry out both with perfection this is a very important question brother father said that when he concentrates too much on his education he cannot concentrate on his iman his taqwa goes down if he pays attention to his religiosity to his iman and to stakwa his concentration education goes down why is this and how can he solve the problem many a time this happens by the wasa of the shaitan the shaitaan whispers and tells you now don't offer salah because tomorrow is the examination so imagine if you're going to pray full day you will be spending one one and a half hour and you will not will do well so you prepare one hour more for examination you'll do well these are the wasmasa that comes but you have to know your priorities whenever two things which are important clash always the one which is more important should be done first for example if to a doctor a patient of heart attack ischemic heart disease comes to him and a person of common cold comes to him who will attend to first but person who has a heart attack if he doesn't attend to him he will die the person in the common cold yes has a chance similarly where it comes between your taqwa and your iman and between your education both are important without doubt but the taqwa and the iman and salah is far more important a million times more important than your education because this life is the test for the hereafter and as i mentioned my previous answer that the beloved prophet muslim said it is mentioned inside muslim void number one hadith number 246 that the prophet said that between a man and kuf and shirk so if you think that if you become more religious if you pray and if your iman increases then your concentration of your education will go down this is the vasa of the shaitaan in fact if you pray properly the amount of serenity you get the amount of peace of mind you get that you study better i am a medical doctor doing my medical studies but natural i used to attention during the final exam most of the human beings have but the moment you pray your whole tension goes down the serenity the calmness that you get your mind becomes more fresh it is regenerating and these things are very important these things are a must every day of your life so my request to you is that between the two is more important your iman is more important your salah is more important that does not mean that you neglect your education and your study this was fasah will surely go away in your salah you pray to allah please let me concentrate and the moment you pray to allah please let me do well in the examination please let me concentrate inshallah you will prepare for the examination better and you will fare also better and when these thoughts come in your mind you have to read very important and the moment you say this inshallah mind will come back into the track but always remember number it is nowhere close to any other thing and inshallah if your high if your iman is high if your salah is in place inshallah you'll do well even in your examination hypothetically even if you don't do well in the examination you will not do good in this examination of the world but this life is an examination for the hereafter as allah says in the quran in surabul chapter number 67 verse number 2 it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds inshallah you will pass in the examination of the hereafter and when we do dua give me the good in this world and the hereafter and save me from the torment of hellfire and we pray to allah increase me in knowledge and give me beneficial knowledge so inshallah life is proper inshallah your education also be better and you will come closer to allah it will benefit you in the hereafter as well as in this world question from younus from holland i have watched almost all your videos and debates i am a big fan of you and inshallah one day i will become like you inshallah inshallah better than me someone dies at the age of 20 and while some at the age of 60 is it not unfair for the one who died at 20 because the one who died at 60 had more time to receive hassanath it's a good question brother that if there are two people one person dies at the age of 20 one person died at the age of 60 isn't it unfair for the person who died at the age of 20 that he had less chances of doing good deeds and getting the same thing can be posed in another way that isn't it unfair for the person at the age of 60 that he died after so many years he was distracted by the devil for a longer time by the shaitan and had more time of doing evil as compared to the person who died at the age of 20. brother depends upon the perspective how you're looking at it whether that the age of 20 or 60 i do agree with you there are chances of doing good deeds if you live longer but there are chances of doing bad needs also you may not know that the person at the age of 20 was very good on the straight path later on in divorce and at the age of 60 he started doing things which against the sharia started losing and goes to january so it is not depending upon how long you live it is how well you live is important when you have an examination you study for the full year some papers are only for one hour and the full year's test is taken by the teacher in one hour some examination paper are for three hours some examination before two parts part one three of four two three hours irrespective of that depending upon the type of question asked the judgment is given for the full year similarly whether you live for 20 years or 60 years allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has ill again he has knowledge of the future for him to test a person he can test even in one minute what you cannot test in maybe 80 years he can test in one minute well that's very easy so according to me it doesn't make a difference whether the test was for 20 years or for 60 years and it does not advantage need the disadvantage it is one type of a test so based on what you have how well you need is important rather than the time so it is not unfair at all it is not unjust at all it is pros and cons depends upon it and allah is the best to judge he's the most wise he knows how to judge and on the day of judgment no human being will ever complain to allah that you unjust they'll only say that please forgive us allah will say it's too late so the justice of allah's mantra is so accurate allah says in the quran surah nisa chapter 4 40 allah is not unjust in the least degree hope that answers the question muhammad nadeem from pakistan the quran says none can touch it except those who are pure however we see that any non-muslim can type the quran does it not go against the verse of the quran quoted that none can touch it except those are pure i do agree with the brother that if you go at the supervision meaning of the quran what is referring to is the verse of the quran from srivakya chapter number 56 verse number 77-79 which says this is the quran most honorable a book well-guarded who none can touch except those of you if you go supervision meaning yes i do agree that non-muslim who's unpure can easily come and type the quran and the quran has proved wrong if you see the newsrule of quran when were these verses revealed it was revealed when there were allegations made by the pagan arabs against the prophet that what the prophet is getting the quranic revelation it is actually it is from the devil from the shaitaan knows bella so then this verse was revealed that this is a book most honorable a book well guarded who none can touch except those are pure so this verse is not referring to the normal musa of the quran that we have it is referring to the quran in lohan mafus in the heaven that none can touch it except those who are pure indicating it's not talking about the bodily purity that if you're in vudu you can touch you know it doesn't refer to that it's referring to not only purity in body but purity of mind purity of sense total purity talking about the angels referring that no one shall be able to touch that quran the original tablet in the heavens not even the shayati not even the jinn except the angels and cross reference it says in surah burj chapter 85 verse number 21 22 that this is the quran in a tablet well preserved so this verse of the quran is talking about the quran in the law mephos in the tablet well preserved no satan can go close to it like the allegation led that the prophet is getting these all these revelation from the satan knows bella none can touch except those who are pure totally pure talking about the angels this verse is not at all talking about the musa the copy of the quran that we have this quran of course a muslim can touch it with vudu can touch without also this verse is not referring to udu is talking about total purity a non-muslim can very well take the quran even a muslim it is mustaf for the muslim to be in vudu even without wudu a muslim can't take the quran it is not a father that a person should be in vudu though there's a misconception of among some of the muslims that you should be in the quran it's not a first it is abseil it is mustapha it is preferable but this verse is talking about the quran in loheme foos the original copy it's not talking about the musaf the copy of the quran that we have today there's a question from sanjid bangladesh how is farik naik we are waiting for his new lectures a question or similar topic is asked by soheil khan from karachi pakistan where is your son
