  "transcript": "the question which when i studied shakespeare management random jannah that when we talk about quran and say hadith we don't have all the say hadith compiled the maximum i could do i stayed with him in the year 1997. we could say okay takes his sahi but that doesn't have all the say hadith it contains it only muslim and the other four books so alhamdulillah after sheikh zayar iman asked me he retired there are many scholars in the last 1400 years who tried to compile all the say hadith together in one volume but all those who tried they never completed the project alhamdulillah sheikh zaraman asked me after he retired he took about 17 to 18 years to complete this project and he compiled all the sahara together and he compiled in the book called as jamaica al hadees the full name is al-hadees short form it's called ajami kamen and about four years ago he compiled it and the first edition was published and after it was published the revision was done about two years before and it was printed just in this year and alhamdulillah after the second edition was printed and published and shakes me he checked it up and you're happy that at least the reviled edition was out though he wrote the manuscript in 20 volumes it was printed the first edition in 12 volumes the second edition because the print was larger it came in 18 volumes he also made a mukta jamaica in five volumes in the original jamaica mill as text me said there were more than a million hadith out of the million hadith there are many duplicates like in say book hire if you remove the duplicates there are 2 220 hadith so if you compile all the one million hadith and remove the duplicates according to sheikh zaraman as mean there were about sixty thousand hadith from the sixty thousand hadith he collected only the say hadith removing the duplicates and in his jammeh kamil there are 16 546 hadith so according to sheikh zayaram and as mean after removing the duplicates the say hadith today in the world are sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six and we can safely say if not hundred percent at least this compilation of his at least minimum contains ninety-five percent of the say hadith in this compilation he has given the huja he has his own criteria he compiled all the hadees which are saying and remove the duplicates he gave a reason that if this hadith was sahih and according to him it was if he even mentioned that outside is jama kamel so there are additional 3000 hadith which other scholars say it is sahih but he says it is life and he gives away his life and he mentions it so that people don't think he has forgotten then he has even added in that three thousand of these the very common hadith famous hadith but they are they famous which are modu for example the very common and famous hadith that external officer it is the modu hadid there's another mode that as far as you go to acquire knowledge no problem even if you go to china china was never the seat of knowledge at the time of the prophet the hadith is modu so he mentioned this famous hadith but it did not say hadith it is the mouth when giving his reason so totally jamaica mill contained sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six hundred plus approximately three thousand of these which other more this in asset psi and he says it is if or the other famous hadith which is if and modu so people don't think he has missed out and in this the big volume which is printed 12 volume in the first edition in the second edition this has given the details why they say why it is if and all the reasoning and if the hadith is that he gives the references there in say bukhari hadith number so and so including say muslim hadees number so and so including buddha number so and so so after the end of every hadith has it is available in three books of hadith or i will five books of hadith or two books of only one book of hadith the details are given so that you come to know from where it comes in the mukta sir jamai kamil which is in five volumes the research has been removed so that it's easy for a layman to read so the complete jammeh camel is mainly for scholars and for the most they seen for a layman the mukta said sufficient the mukta sir we have started translating it into english it was a three years project we started it about four years back but unfortunately when the translation was complete i wasn't happy with the english language so we are revising it so now we have completed one third of the revision inshallah next year by the end of next day it will be out so we will inshallah translate the mukta services then five volumes and it will be easy for people who don't know arabic to read it and to understand it we're translating also into urdu and other languages we pray to allah this work is a phenomenal work so when we say quran and say hadith all that is the muslim all the sahadis which is there in the quran in abu dhabi in sunnah messiah in sunnah in ibn there are other books of sahih the other books of sahih that we know that buhari and muslim are only two books which are 100 authentic and scholars even say that imam mohta malik also so for a lay man if he wants to know he cannot do research if that is a bukhari or muslim or imam safely he can say otherwise he has to check whether they say or not"
