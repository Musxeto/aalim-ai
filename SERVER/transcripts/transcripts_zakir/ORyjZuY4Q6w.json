  "transcript": "assalamualaikum my name is gohar i'm an accountant uh just very quickly it's a pleasure to hear dr zakir naik soon the first time i heard him it was one of my ambitions to come and see you mashallah you gave a lovely talk my question is there's a famous hadith saying by the prophet peace be upon him that we should seek knowledge unto china now i've talked to a lot of brothers about this and my perspective on it even though i haven't researched it is that this knowledge does not talk about religious knowledge because the religious knowledge at the time was in saudi arabia where the prophet peace be upon him was and people all over the world were coming to see him at that time for religious knowledge but what is the question brother what is this my question is this hadith does it relate to religious knowledge or knowledge of the dunya science maths etc but there's a question that the prophet said that seek knowledge even if you have to go to china it's because religious knowledge was in south area but it was worldly knowledge so does it mean you can go to china for early knowledge point number one brother according to the money this hadith hadith it's a fake hadith it's not a correct hadith because the center of education even at that time that i was in china this hadith is a fake hadith but that doesn't mean your question is not valid you have to use other hadith to prove your question the first guidance given by allah to the whole of humanity was not to pray was not to give zakat it was ikra in surya chapter 96 verse number one iqra and our beloved prophet muhammad sallallahu salaam said it's mentioned by haki it is obligated on every muslim man or woman to acquire knowledge so aquaman knowledge is father in islam it's compulsory it includes the more obligatory is the deen knowledge but that does not mean you cannot go and travel even for worldly knowledge you can as long as you fulfill the criteria even for worldly knowledge you can as long as it benefits you it gets you closer to allah hope that answers the question"
