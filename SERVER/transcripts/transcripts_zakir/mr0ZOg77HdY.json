  "title": "Does Jesus (pbuh's) 'Unnatural Birth' make him Greater than Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good evening everyone my name is Ryan Moses a Christian by faith and I am a student of engineering my question sir is according to Islam both Jesus and Muhammad were prophets but Prophet Isa besides his miracles had an unnatural birth and never died according to Islam besides he has a prominent role to play in the day of judgment against the Jal don't you think this special preference given to him by Allah makes him more than just a prophet has asked every good questions he said that Islam believes that Jesus Christ peace be upon him and Muhammad peace be upon him both of them are prophets of God but when you compare their life we realize that Jesus Christ peace be upon Islam and unnatural birth meaning that he was born miraculously without an email intervention and he did not die so don't these two qualities make him Superior to Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him before I replied your question I would like to make it very clear that Islam is the only non-Christian faith which makes an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of Allah we believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any intervention we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers is God's permission the Christian the Muslims we are going together but there is partnering of ways the partying always is that many of the Christians claim and they think that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he claimed Divinity and he was almighty God first I'll reply two of these queries that if Prophet Jesus peace be upon him was born miraculously he had a mother but had no father so doesn't they make him Superior to Prophet Muhammad indicating that doesn't mean he's God if you say that Jesus is Superior or you claim him to be God because he was born miraculously he had no father Allah says in the Quran in surul Imran chapter 3 verse number 59 Allah says the similitude of Jesus peace be upon him in front of Allah is the same as Adam peace be upon him he was made from dust and Allah said bien he was if you say that Jesus is God because he had no father in that context according to the Quran and according to your Bible Adam peace be upon him and no mother and father that makes him a greater God no way does the bible no way does Allah say in the Quran that because the person has no father he becomes almighty God Allah is the best to create he wanted to show people his power normally a human being is born with a father and mother he had an example of Adam who was born without a father and mother you have the example of even Allah be pleased with her who was born without any female the last example pending was a person being born without a father which is fulfilled in the birth of Jesus Christ peace be upon him come into your second query that we Muslims believe and even the Bible says that Jesus Christ peace before him did not die crucified but Allah raised him up unto himself so the question is that if Jesus did not die he's alive is India greater Prophet than Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the reply brother is that is Jesus Christ peace be upon him was the only messenger of Allah whose followers mistook him that he claimed Divinity there is not a single prophet of Allah of almighty God whose followers mistook the declaimed Divinity because he was the only Prophet whose followers mistook that he claimed he was God Allah so that in his second coming he could testify to these people that he never claimed Divinity that's what Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 516 that any second coming he will tell his Allah that you be my witness I never told them to worship me but told them worship Allah who's my Lord and your lord the same thing is mentioned in the gospel of Matthew that in his second coming when people will say o Master o Master did we not do wonders and miracles in your name he will say evil men I don't even know you to depart from here so Allah almighty God has raised up Jesus Christ peace be upon alive because any second coming he will not give any new message because Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the last and final messenger which is mentioned in the Quran chapter 33 verse number 40 after him and after the Quran was revealed nothing new can be added or subtracted from the religion of Islam he will come as Allah he will come not to give any new teaching just to testify to the followers that he never claimed Divinity and he is the messenger of Allah so the major difference between the Muslims and the Christians is that most of the Christians think that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him claim Divinity in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God away if you worship me if any Christian can point out a single verse in the Bible a single unique statement where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says a single unambiguous statement where Jesus Christ peace before himself says that I am God always says worship me I am ready to accept Christianity just now I am not speaking on behalf of my other Muslim Brothers I am putting mad on the guillotine in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself said it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20. I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number five verse number 30. I can off my own self do nothing [Applause] and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I speak not my will but the will of almighty God is a Muslim so Bible says Jesus Christ peace be upon him as a Muslim he never claimed Divinity and it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 even of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and your witness to it a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you witness to it so Jesus Christ peace be upon him never claim Divinity but he was one of the mightiest messengers of Allah so brother are you convinced that Jesus is not God I did not say Jesus is God I did not I said what is this position according to Islam I never said that you said Jesus was God I am asking you a question are you convinced that Jesus is not God yes I am convinced of that but I am want to clarify his position in Islam whether before I answered didn't I tell you he believed that he was one of the mightiest messengers of God no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him a Muslim cannot be a Muslim if he doesn't believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messenger of God but he was not God so do you believe Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is not God do you believe Prophet Muslim is the messenger of God I believe that Jesus Christ being a prophet was more than a prophet that doesn't make him God but his position is unknown what is his exact position he's more than a prophet but not God but what is his position he is a prophet of God he's a messenger but he doesn't qualify to be a prophet because he has done like unnatural birth unnatural death and again day of judgment coming brother did you hear my answer if you claim that he is somewhere more than a prophet because he was unnatural born he was born without a father then Adam peace be upon Him becomes a bigger than Jesus Adam had a death natural death but Adam there was no misconception among the followers of Adam peace be upon him that he claimed Divinity there's a misconception amongst the followers of Christians that they claim that he was God that's the reason Allah kept him alive look and Jesus Christ peace be upon him said it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14. I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for even the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself all the dear shall he speak he shall glorify me now this prophecy refers to no one but Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so if you are a good Christian if you are a person who believes in Jesus Christ peace be upon him if you believe in his teachings then you also have to believe that there's someone else to come who shall guide you and that is Prophet Mama's peace be upon him so that's the reason I'm saying that if you are a True Believer in Jesus Christ peace be upon him you have to believe in Prophet Muhammad sallam otherwise you're not a True Believer so are you a believer in Prophet Jesus yes do you believe in Gospel of John chapter 16 verse number 12 to 14. yes I do he's talking about Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him to come so do you believe in Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I can't comment right now so I'd request you to do more research okay I will on your Bible and you can see my video cassette similarities between Islam and Christianity yes thank you"
