  "title": "What Really Attracts People to Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh very good evening doctor my name is Reva and I'm a psychology student as well the 9/11 question was from my sister but I'm not talking about 9/11 I have a separate question and I'm having a sore throat so I'll make the question quick before I run out of my voice well I actually I went to a Christian School and there I'm surrounded by a very good number of narrow-minded people and they are they narrow people's beliefs are anything except for Christianity is devil worship so according to them everything is devil worship and for them Islam is as well as devil worship but I don't see it that way because if this is devil worship it won't be the number one religion in the world so clearly there's something in Islam that Christianity doesn't have which is why it's such a achieving and very a lot of people are in it so my question is I want to know what that something [Applause] is s asked the question that she went to Christian School she was surrounded by Christians who she calls narrow-minded here you're surrounded with broad-minded people mashah so she said that Christianity says everything besides Christianity is devil worship but she says that Islam is the fastest growing religion maximum followers so what is it the in thing that people are inspired towards sister I've been in this field for dawa for more than 20 years more than 20 years I've been in this field of dawa and I've met many people who have reverted to Islam from Christianity from Hinduism from Buddhism from Sikhism and each one is inspired by different things but the most common factor among the people who accept Islam in my survey is the belief in Oneness of God the other people theoretically say a iswar paramatma but practically they don't follow it Christianity says believe in one God but they say father Holy Spirit and the son they talk about one but they practically believe in Trinity so Islam is the only religion which speaks and practices to monotheism so this inspires a person about the one true God unity and unlike other religion where you can see that you know God's fighting among themselves one God is taking the help of another God and the devil can defeat the God all these things a normal person thinks is illogical how can God be defeated how can God die in some religion God dies also so if God dies then who rules the world so when you see all these things logically people normally blindly follow these blind beliefs are not there in Islam therefore Quran says that do you not they understand this is for men of understanding even in my talk I said that God Almighty made the heavens and the Earth and made in colors and languages verily it's a sign for those who understand Quran is a book which convinces the logic in spite the media today being against Islam you can imagine the power that the amount of billions and trillions of they pumping against Islam to degrade it yet it is the fastest going religion so that's a miracle Allah says in the Quran in Imran 3: 54 they planned and plotted Allah to plan Allah is the best of planners so in this way the major factor is that Islam is the most logical religion there may be certain things they may feel oh it's bad it's like that but when they come close to it like today today Islam is malign one thing is Terrorism second is that there are no women's rights if there are no women's rights in Islam Today out of the Americans accepting Islam two3 of women so why are the American women accepting Islam out of the Europeans accepting Islam two3 of women if Islam is a religion when does not give rights to the women then who's forcing the European and American women to accept Islam because they find the security they have been and seen the world and lived talking about liberalization and modernization they realize the real spirit is then the religion of Islam so when they really practice some people may really get inspired okay because there's hijab to accept Islam some people only hear the aan and they accept Islam so people have different thing but the main thing the core factor is theed so whatever they inspired by once they come toed the Oneness of God he is our creator he's our sustainer he's our cherisher which was the core factor of my talk today then and these people who accept Islam they become more practicing than those people who are born in a Muslim Family Sister do you believe there's one God yeah I do believe there's one God do you believe idol worship is wrong excuse me do you believe idol worship is wrong yes do you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God I want to so why don't you because I'm not inspired yet I want to be inspired nothing like inspiration if you say you want to if someone is stopping you from myself I I want to be inspired I want to know that that is the truth and that's right so maybe you coming to the lecture is not enough inspiration you coming to the microphone to ask this question is enough inspiration for you since you believe there's one God since you believe I worship is wrong and if you believe in Quran have you read the Quran no I would request you to read the Quran and if you read the Quran you'll understand more about Islam and I had given a talk yesterday Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam in the various World religious scriptures and I give quotations of prophet Muhammad mentioned in the Hindu scriptures in the Christian scriptures in the Jewish scriptures in the Buddhist scriptures only if you read since your background is Hinduism I believe Christianity Christianity if your background is Christianity have you read the Bible yes it was a subject in my school fine I'll just give you the references Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him has been prophesized in the oldest and the New Testament in the Old Testament he's been prophesized in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 19 in the book of Isaiah chapter number 29 verse number 12 in the Song of Solomon Chapter number 5 verse number 16 for details we can refer to my video cassette he's also prophesied in the New Testament in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 in the Gospel of John chapter number 15 verse number 26 in the Gospel of John chap 16 ver number 7 as well as Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12- 14 I'll just give you one prophecy to make it short Jesus Christ peace be upon him said in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12-4 he said I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that he he shall he speak he shall glorify me so this prophecy of Jesus Christ peace be upon him I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you onto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak he shall glorify me this refers to no one but Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him because it says he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak and you know the history of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him that almighty God gave the Revelation to Prophet Muhammad most of it through Archangel Gabriel whatever he got he repeat the verb at him and he shall glorify me if you see there is no messenger of God no person who claimed to be a messenger has has ever glorified Prophet Jesus except Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so it's mentioned in the Bible that this man to come he will glorify me and all the other references I gave you it is pointing out to the coming of the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and even the Quran says it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah saf chapter number 61 verse number 6 that Jesus CH peace be upon him was sent as a messenger to the bani Israel to children of Israel to the Jews and he said I give you Glad Tidings of a messenger to come whose name shall be Ahmed and Ahmed is the second name of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him Prophet Muhammad's peace be upon Him is not prophesized only in the Bible Old and New Testament he's even prophesized in The Vedas in the puranas in the Hindu scriptures in the Pari scriptures in the Buddhist scriptures as I was saying earlier that even though the scriptures have been changed even if the scriptures have been manipulated yet there are remnants in the verses of that scripture about about the Oneness of God that's toed and about Prophet Muhammad being the last and final messenger uh now doctor since that I've never actually read the Quran may I humbly request that can I have a translated version of the Holy Quran sure I request my i' request my wife to hand over a translation of the Quran she will inshah hand over the translation and I request you that please read the translation and inshallah if you have any question you can either asked to a local D organization or you can ask to Islamic Information Services or you can write to us email it's a global village you can send the email to Islam at.net IR f.net it's the short form for the organization Islamic Research Foundation and inshallah we'll try our best to clarify our doubts hope the answer question thank you do welcome"
