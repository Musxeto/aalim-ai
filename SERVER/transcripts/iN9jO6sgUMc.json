  "transcript": "so Abu Yussef question is regarding the Adhan of jihad at the time of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam at the time of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him and with Omar there was only one add-on for zoom:1 and this was not necessarily given at the time of lahore because as narrated by jabber and abdullah may allah be pleased with him and with his father and other companions the hadith in sahih muslim and elsewhere that the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam used to call for the jihad on give the sermon and pray the Juma prayer and the people would go out of the Masjid and it's not still time for the horn and this is why she has been bassinet Amin may Allah have mercy on their souls say that it is permissible to pray and offer Juma sermon and prayer half an hour to an hour before the her time though the vast majority of scholars say no we have to stick with war the hadith authentic beyond doubt stated that the Prophet used to maybe prayed earlier than the whole time this is for German only so the Prophet had only one eye than this I then proceeded or actually followed when he entered the message and said assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and sat down then calls the Adhan of jihad now at the time of earth man may allah be pleased with him and he is a rightly guided caliphs and the Prophet told us as salam that abide by my sunnah and the sunnah of the rightly guided caliphs who are the for Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali may Allah be pleased with them all earth man notice that Medina had expanded a lot and for that advant to call one and then as it used to be at the time of the Prophet as salaam by the time people came to the Masjid the Salah was over so he suggested that we introduced a second event as in the case of fetcher for example we know that fed your prayer has to advance one which is done by Bilal and it's about an hour before the break of dawn and it is it has no significance except that it wakes those who are asleep so that they perform whitter before the break of dawn and alerts those who are praying if they want to fast so that they can eat the pre-dawn meal that's it the second advantage whole event of fetcher done by ebony only Maktoum the blind man may Allah be pleased with him so Othman suggested that Friday we do the same the first event is only for the mere reminding of the people that Juma is due in within an hour so come quickly so he introduced this and all the Companions approved it and it kept on being practiced without anyone opposing it or objecting to it which gives it the consensus of all Muslims now the way it is practiced it differs according to the Imam or to the Muslim rulers opinion so some messages called add on one hour before the actual Friday sermon the first set up in the haramein because everybody in Mecca and Medina are headed towards the Masjid since 10 o'clock a.m. so they thought that there's no need to call it an event an hour earlier is sufficient just to give like 10 minutes 5 minutes before the first event and we're keeping the Sunnah of Earthmen may Allah be pleased with him alive by doing it though maybe they don't think that it is necessary and if they dropped it it wouldn't have been a mistake because his sister loved the Prophet SM so either way is a win-win situation this is why they're doing it and allah so Jill knows best"
