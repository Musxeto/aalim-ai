warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to hadith number 121 and it is a great hadith where the prophet alayhi salat was saddam instructed us to read before concluding our prayer so we went to tisha hood then we went to a solid algebra he Mia before offering Saddam the prophet taught us to supplicate and he also opened the floor for us to ask Allah whatever we want therefore this supplication some scholars went to say that it is mandatory and the majority believe that it is soon recommended but it is not mandatory and if you look into the hadith you will find that the Prophet arrest awesome is instructing us he says that when you conclude your prayer do this so this is an order and that is why it is most likely that those who said it is mandatory they have the most authentic opinion of all the hadith is Abu Hurairah hadith may allah be pleased with him and who will read it for us abu huraira narrated the messenger of allah sallallahu ala was seldom used to supplicate oh allah i seek refuge in you from the torment of the grave the torment of the fire the trial of life and death and from the trial of the mercy at the gel the Antichrist in an attenuation of Muslim when any one of you uh ters the Shah hood in prayer he must seek refuge with Allah from for and should thus say o Allah I seek refuge with you from the torment of the hell from the torment of the grave from the trial of life and death and from the evil of the trial of Messiah Dajjal Antichrist ok now these are the things that the prophet alayhi salaatu I'm instructed us ordered us he must say the Prophet said he must say which is an order now what are these things first of all there are a number of narrations want to say i seek refuge in you from the torment of hell and the other one started with i seek refuge in you from the torment of the grave so let us begin with the grave what is the torment of the grave and do muslims get torment of the grave it is the consensus of scholars that people are tormented in their graves at the beginning the prophet alayhi salatu salam said that no those who are being tormented are only the Jews not the Muslims the origin of this is when the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam entered his house and found an old shoe woman and aisha said o prophet of allah this old woman because i did something good for us she said may Allah protect you from the torment of the grave and the Prophet of Islam got angry and he said no only the Jews are tormented in their graves and few days later Allah revealed it to him and then he addressed the people and saying o people seek refuge in Allah from the torment of the grave because I was told that the Muslims get tormented in the grave and we know that among the things that caused the torment of the grave is not protecting yourself when you urinate as in the case where the prophetess m passed by the two graves you remember we took this and also if you spread gossip and nima between the people so that you would make feud and hatred between them this is also one of the reasons and there are a number of reasons for torment in the grave believers muslims they will be punished in their grave and this would be a prelude this would be like the starters before going on the day of judgement however sometimes our sins are so little that we may only face our punishment in our graves so that when we come to a large double gel we would not have any punishment at all yet the punishment of the grave is so severe and it's so dangerous that Earthmen may allah be pleased with him whenever he stood by a grave he used to weep until his beard was full of tears and his companions would say earth man may allah be pleased with you we mentioned hell and we mentioned fire and you don't cry as much but when you stand by a grave this what happens to you he says the grave is the first step to the hereafter if it's good then whatever is after it is better and if it's bad then whatever is after it is worse and the prophet taught asali his solo to salam what to do in order that Allah would protect us from a double cover from the torment of the grave and that is to recite and memorize surah al-mulk the prophet said allahís allatra salam there are 30 verses in the quran if a person memorizes them if these 30 verses were in a leather container meaning the body of a believer Allah would not punish in the grave that is tabarak led by a dhill mulk wahoo ala kulli shayin 'dear this chapter the surah surah al-mulk known as tabarak but the name is sure oh and mold so the torment in the grave is severe we know that the grave is either a whole of hellfire or it is a garden of paradise may Allah make our graves a garden of paradise the Prophet then said that is salatu salam and i seek refuge in you or Allah from determined of hellfire and the torment of hell fire is extreme we know that the Prophet told us erase a lot some the list of those who will be punished in hell their punishment would be a stone of fire made or put in their sandals from its heat their brains boil only a stone of fire this is the least person to be punished so if Allah forgave your fornication forgave consuming intoxication forgave you've missed a number of fuzzier prayers in the message forgave you watching something that is haram or listening to something that is haram but decided to punish you for a cigarette you smoke in a junt if Allah decided to forgive everything except you're smoking what would the punishment be a stone made of fire in hell that is put in your sandals your brain boils from it and you can imagine what happens to the rest of the body if the brain boils from the heat of the that stone then what about the rest of the body definitely is going to be heavily burnt and damaged and for what for smoking and you can convince yourself I should not watch Haram I should not listen to her on I should not say harem I should not eat harem because I know that the hell fire is extremely bad and painful to the extent that even the skin once it's burnt Allah changes it as mentioned in the Quran Kulemin wo de home but then now me to load and I raha Lee azucar light up and this is one of the scientific evidence is in the Quran that the cells of feeling are in the skin and whenever the skin is burned the body does not feel the pain and that is why Allah renews the skin on and on and on so that the feeling of pain is continuous may Allah protect us all and then the Prophet says allahís alot wassalam and I seek refuge in you from the trials of life and death fitna to Al Mejia one mama and what is the trials of life in death well scholars say that the trials of life is what you see in life that tempts you to sin so the part of the trials of life is money fame power knowledge children spouses all of these are trials of life why imagine your children are part of the trials of life your children your offspring the Prophet says in the authentic hadith sallallahu alaihi wasallam that the child is a cause of being stingy miser a cause of being a coward a cause of depression feeling sad why is that the prophecies al voila do mahalo tone merge benetton mahesana why is that because even if you have a child you want to spend in the cause of allah Shaitaan comes to you and says if you spend your money in the cause of Allah your child would probably starve you will not be able to buy a house you would not be able to secure his future so you stop spending for the cause of Allah and if your child is there and you want to fight for the cause of Allah you want to defend Islam Shaitaan says what happens if you die so you feel coward and you stay and if your child is a grown up and he gets sick you feel sad if he comes home late you're worried and sad because you're afraid maybe he had an accident maybe the police took him maybe he got into a fight so your child is always a mean or a cause of being sad so this is part of the trials of life your wife if she was a righteous good woman then you have the best of this life but if you were not so lucky then this is part of the trials of life when you have a nagging woman when you have a woman that does not wake up for fechar or does not wear the hijab when you have a woman who is always spending your money and asking for more so this is a big problem we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll continue discussing this beautiful hadith so don't go away assalamu alaikum and welcome back part of the trials of life is money money money money it changes people usually to the worse so many people who were poor who were adequately living used to pray five times a day in the Masjid used to observe fasting of mondays and thursdays used to also pray night prayer and visit each other and get along attend classes in the message attend lectures the minute Allah gives the money the minute they become rich the minute they have cash in their hands they become arrogant they miss fajr prayer the missus our prayer they don't attend any lectures anymore they don't think highly of their Imam out of their share they buy fancy clothes fancy cars and they feel that they are the cream of the society and they're better than anyone else these are part of the trials of this life and also poverty poverty is part of the trials of life once I was rich everything was made for me the minute I got poor I started complaining why me I used to pray five times a day in the message I used to do good things why me why not him why not her and I starts to complain an object to a las rulings in the creep this is part of the trials of life and you can go on and on about this life we're living in there are so many trials in them but the prophet saw allah's protection from the trials of life and death so what can be the trials of death the trials of death are the most frightening why because the Prophet sallallahu re who are you seldom said that deeds are judged by their conclusion in the Manimal bill hawa team so if you live for 60 or 70 years praying in the masjid doing well staying away from Haram and the last day in your life you did something awful you said what about if i give it a try i'd like to go to a nightclub I like to drink until I'm wasted I'd like to smoke pot or you know do something that I've never done before and you do it and you die doing it this is the last thing that you will be judged upon and that is why it is very scary the trials of death because you never know when death comes to you and that would be your final verdict also among the trials of death those who are prevented from saying the Shahada those who are prevented from saying the Kolyma so when they are on the dying bed so many reports in the books of scholars people come and say c'est la illaha illallah and the man instead of saying la la la la starts to sink the last song he heard before he got sick or the song that was dominating his thinking they went to someone who deals in usually in Reba and they told him say la la la la while he was on his dying bed he said 10 you paid them back 11 a hundred you pay them back 110 all what he's thinking of is his Reba he's usually what he was living for and at so the trials of death are very scary and we need extremely that we rectify our lives so that when our end comes it comes on something that Allah social is pleased with and the profit goes on to seek Allah's protection and seek Allah's refuge from the trials of al maseeh had the Jan the Antichrist and we know that the Prophet said that is awesome there is no trial on earth more severe and dangerous than the trial of and messy hydrojet every single Messenger of Allah warned his people from a messy hydrogen and the Prophet gave us a lot of description about him to the extent that we know exactly how it's going to be unfortunately nowadays we see a lot of people advertising that the jail has been recognized that the jail has been found or something like this and they claim that the jail is the Western media the Western influence there are some YouTube films like the arrival and they're all nonsense they're all rubbish some of the brothers told me about it and I had to spend like half an hour or an hour watching three or four of them and I thought a las forgiveness of the time that I've wasted on such nonsense that has no knowledge at all claiming that the domes of dubai and Riyadh and so on that these are signs calling the dajjal and that's if anticipating of him and these are the Freemasons and the servants all of this rubbish someone who had nothing to do just went on with a camera and took few shots here and there and made a script and distributed it among the people and the ignorant people say yes he's been identified he's here he's there we know that the job exists as a sorry Haley my Muslim we know that Jerry remodelers Bocelli saw him in an island and he reported this to the prophet ellis arab sturm we know that he's in Chains and we know that he will come but why will he come after the great battle that takes place between the Muslims and the Christians and before that battle they were joined forces against a joint enemy of theirs once they defeat that enemy then feud and fights happen between them and they are victorious once they're resting then that the gel comes out and the Prophet told us exactly what did the gel would be doing he would be spending 40 days only a day which is equivalent to a year a day equivalent to a month at the equivalent to a week so he would be spending one year and one month and one week and 37 days so you do the math it would be one year and two months and few days this is what he will be spending on earth but why is it so severe his trial the Prophet told the sorry salato certain people would come to him with full hearts of a man and they will believe and become kafir every believer would see on his forehead kaffir disbeliever whether he they are literate or illiterate illogical would make them see and recognize him he would first call himself God and then he would go a little bit down and the Prophet tells us that he is one eyed and he described to him to us exactly and all the hadith audience i am a muslim and he told us when you hear about him go as far as possible from him do not approach him and he told us that he cannot enter mecca Norma dena because angels are there waiting for him and the Prophet told us that he would be so fast he would cover the whole earth in that period and he would have control over the rain and he would call the rain to stop for the people who do not follow him and those who believe in him he would call the rain to fall down on them so much information we have about this Antichrist so-called Antichrist and he is not the Antichrist he's in messy had the gel we seek Allah's protection from these four things and we remind ourselves every single prayer before we conclude our prayer before we offer salam because the Prophet instructed us re so solemn and pointed out these four things not because they are there because of their danger and we always have to be alert when we deal with these things this is all the time we have until you meet next time fee amanillah or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
