  "title": "Can I write a Will, giving more percentage to one of my Sons (Heir)? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says can I give 50% after my death to my eldest son so there are two mistakes or two errors here the first one is that he wants to write a will of more than one-third and the Prophet as salam prohibited this so no one can donate after his death from his wealth more than 1/3 as in this hadith of sodom w cos may Allah be pleased with him where he said can i donate 2/3 of my wealth said no he said half he said no he said one-third the Prophet said 1/3 and 1/3 is a lot so even I passed may Allah be pleased with him used to say that I recommend that one writes off one-fourth there is a quarter of his wealth as a will if he is willing to do so so this is error number one 50% is not permissible second error is that he wants to write this percentage or he wants to give this amount to his son and the Prophet said that is a salam there was a ietter lawar off' which means that there is no well to someone whose inheriting so any person who is inheriting this is not permissible for you to give him an extra dime more than what allah azza wajal has allocated for him what does this mean I died and after my death I write one third of my wealth to my beloved wife so after my death they open and they allocate this much to the wife this much to the son the daughter the mother the father and then they open the will and they find that one third is for the wife in the first thing to be distributed after a person dies there are four things usually the scholars say first they are the acronym for it is tattoo in Arabic tah-dah Wow mean so the time is for preparing the deceased for the funeral washing him shrouding him the first thing we take from his wealth to prepare him and then to pay off his debts so we see what debts he has and we give them all what they are entitled to and the third thing we do is we look for a will that he left behind so he says yes I give 10% of my wealth to this place or to that place and the last thing is the inheritance and me Roth so the Economist Ted boom da Dada Wow mean four things so the first thing we do is look for a will and in the will it says one-third goes to the wife immediately this is invalidated we just tear it apart and throw it in the dustbin why our beloved father died and we have to honor it no you don't have to honor it because a prophet prohibited this as Salam Allah Himself is the one who distributed the inheritance and he told us each air has to have this or that the percentage and the wife gets one-eighth as long as there are offspring so she should not get a dime more or extra so by you giving 50% your son this is totally unfair and it is void after your death while your alive it is also unfair because you have to be equal for with all of them"
