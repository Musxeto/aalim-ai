  "title": "Why Do the Muslims and Christians not Unite on What is Common between the Two Faiths? - Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Dan Victor qu I'm from taba State I've listened to your teachings on YouTube it's a privilege to be here with you today my questions goes like this as a Christian I was raised as a Christian I was raised in an Interfaith family and I've closed friends who are Muslims I grew up surrounded by love from both Christians and Muslims it is so clear to me that there's goodness in both religion both Christian and Muslims my auntie I said it is so clear that there is goodness there is goodness in both religion Christian and Muslim I have an auntie one and only Auntie she's a Muslim my father is a Christian and um she so loving so much love has been showed to me by my Muslim friends to an extent that I told them I want to become a Muslim I was contemplating conversion then afterward I started going to the MOs with them listening to the teachings from there I be to I sat down and think one day okay the question is okay the question is if our faith do not oppose each other if our faith do not oppose each other if our guiding figures like Prophet Muhammad and Jesus if their guidance if their teachings did not oppose each other then why don't we Channel our energy into cultivating a common goal as I say if Jesus teaching and Muhammad teaching do not interfere each other why don't we now summon this energy into cultivating measur things that they teach about Jesus teach about love respect Harmony and likewise Muhammad mam teach about love respect Harmony togetherness so my question is why don't we now some of this energy together to teach each other about all these things that the B Prophet taught us instead of maybe having a debate why don't we have consider interfering initiative faith and focus on serving Humanity combating poverty disease Injustice corruption what do you think about this very good question the brother asked a very good question he's a Christian he says that if the teachings of prophet Muhammad and Jesus don't Collide if they agree why don't we channelize all our efforts together for harmony for peace rather than having debates that's what I'm asking the Christian missionaries why do the Christian missionaries go away from the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him according to me the teachings of Jesus and Prophet Muhammad are the same the Christian missionaries are not following the teachings of Jesus how very good question how Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of Allah subhana ta'ala we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christian today do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers with God's permission the Christians and the Muslims we're going together but where is The Parting of Faith The Parting of faith is that most of the Christians say that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he claimed Divinity he was God in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or where he says worship me if you can point out any unequivocal statement any unambiguous statement from any anywhere in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he says worship me I Dr zakin Nik I'm ready to accept Christianity now I'm not speaking on behalf of the other Muslims and brothers I'm a student of comparative religion I'm ready to put my head on the guillotin I have read the Bible they have not there is not a single Unocal statement and I repeat if any Christian can point out a single unequivocal statement a single unambiguous statement where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or he says worship me I'm ready to accept Christianity himself means it should be in red letter there is something like a Red Letter Bible you know Red Letter Bible Red Letter Bible means whatever Jesus Christ spoke himself it is put in Red so never will you find anywhere where Jesus Christ peace be himself say that I am God where say Worship in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ please be upon Him says in Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number 5 verse number 20 Gospel of God chapter number five verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but will of almighty God he's a Muslim so Jesus CH peace be upon to a Muslim he never claimed Divinity it's clearly mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 17-19 it says think not that I have come to destroy the law and the prophets now all this in that letter if you open the Bible all this is in red letter me Jesus CH himself himself said in Gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17 to 19 think not that I have come to destroy the law of the prophets I've come not to destroy but to fulfill and until the heavens and the Earth pass away not one jot or title shall pass away from the law until all be fulfilled unless you and if anyone shall break one of the least Commandments and teach me so do so will be called Le in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall keep the Commandments and teach the Sim we'll be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven unless your righteousness verse number 20 unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees in no way shall you enter Heaven this is verbatim from King James version of the Bible Gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 17 to 20 that's great unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scrib and the fares you shall not enter Jenna that means you have to follow all the teachings of Moses all earlier that God God is one he has got no image and he has got no Idols it further mentions the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 24 the words that you hear are not mine but my fathers who has sent me Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number three this is life eternal so that you should may know that there's one God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 19 verse number 16 and 17 when one of the scribes comes and tell Jesus Christ peace be upon him good Master what good things should I do so that I shall attain eternal life so Jesus CH replies why thou callest me good there's only one good and that is Father in heaven and if you want to enter eternal life keep the Commandments he didn't say that if you want to go to heaven you believe I'm God he never says that believe that died on the cross for your sin he said if you want to enter eternal life see the Commandment what is the Commandment God is one he has got no image don't make Idol it's cly mentioned in the book of now all this is saying of Jesus Christ this is not the saying of Jesus Christ but it's mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by Miracles and signs and wonders by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him and you are witness to it Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him amongst you and when Jesus Christ peace be last that which is the first of the Commandment he replied in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 2 in red letter he said the same thing what Moses said the Lord our God is one Lord so what you're suggesting I'm suggesting the same but your Christian missionaries are doing the opposite they are teaching wrong things about Jesus Christ to the audience we nowhere in the Bible Jesus clim Divinity why do they say Jesus is God why do they say Jesus is God so it is not matching it is not matching with the Quran it's not matching with the Bible they are deceiving the people Jesus never claimed Divinity so my argument is I agree with you what is matching with the Quran and the Bible we follow but the Quran never says Jesus Is God so why are they misguiding the people can you point out a single verse in the Bible unequivocal verse unambiguous verse where Jesus PE himself says he's God do you believe Jesus Is God I'm asking you brother okay now let's come to you forget about the other Christian forget about the other let's talk about you and me do you believe Jesus Is God or is he a messenger of God you know I'm asking you a simple question do you believe Jesus Is God yes or no I believe that Jesus is Lord and I also believe that Jesus is a messenger from God because it was God that came into the world through a body I see Jesus as I'm asking you one question I'm not asking explanation became flesh where did you mention no I said I believe that Jesus is God who came to the world through human flesh but actually I'm not where is this mentioned where is this mentioned in the Bible where it is mentioned are you are talking what you are talking you what you're talking is Gospel of John chapter number one I can give you where you're talking from this is not the words of Jesus we are talking that Jesus came as the word and the word became flesh correct you want me to give the reply what you say do you want me to give the reply what you're quoting what you're quoting first of all is not the words of Jesus what you're quoting is Gospel of John chapter number number one verse number one in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God correct right then down the line after a few verses the word became flesh you're right correct right who said this did J just said this I admired your knowledge ah you don't know I know I'm a student of compar religion this is not the words of Jesus this first verse in the beginning was the word the word was with God and and the word became God is the writing of a Jewish by the name of filow of Alexandria he wrote it before Jesus Christ was born and before John and he did not attribute any Divinity to it the person who wrote is not John also it's not Jesus it's a Jew by the name of filo of Alexandria you read history will tell you that okay now you are telling that the word became am God that mean Jesus Is God now let's analyze okay can't put the word as God if I agree with you for your argument in you're saying word is God Jesus Is God correct you said Jesus was the word it became flesh it is god so let's substitute word with God so in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God in the beginning was God yes God was with God I was Gods two Gods yes yes two Gods yes two two Gods from mistake mistake God is one How can there be two Gods I'm explaining to you your church will not explain to you I'm explaining to you you're a very good Christian that's why I love listening going deeper yes that's I'm explaining to you now so if you agree that Jesus was the word and became flesh let and he's God so let's substitute word with God so in the beginning was God God was with God God became God doesn't make sense anyway let me tell you now you know the Bible is written in Greek and Aramaic it's not in English the word for True God the word for God with a capital G is Hos Hos meaning the God and there's something like with the small g means a Godly person there's something like God the god with a capital G and a Godly person with a small G correct like how the Bible says Moses was sent as a God to Pharaoh God means a messenger small G for the true God the word used is hoos Greek word for the small G God it is tonos so in the beginning was the word the word was with God that God is hos real God in the beginning was the word the word was with God capital G and then beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the next God is tonos meaning a small God like Moses messenger of God do you understand so according to the Bible it says in the beginning was the word the word was the true God and the word became a messenger so Jesus is a messenger and that messenger became flesh no problem first of all it's not the saying of Jesus Christ it's not in red letter yet I entertained you because I'm a student of the Bible you are not a student of the Bible correct I'm quoting from my memory correct yes so according to the Bible also Jesus was a messenger of God so I ask you a simple question point out a single unequivocal statement single unambiguous statement from anywhere in the Bible where Jesus said I am God or worship me I'm ready to accept Christianity if you can't you should accept Islam accept Islam means believe Jesus as a messenger of God not God I don't really have problem with that mashallah no problem but I still have patient wait wait I'll answer so you don't have a problem in agreeing that Jesus is a messenger correct I don't have problem with that very now what's your question what's your question one more question the question I want to ask you is but before then I want you to know that I have deep admiration and respect for Islam and Christian Mah correct only varable respect doesn't carry weight verbal respect doesn't carry weight it should be practical verble respect only MTH said it should be with reality no no no yes it should be man continue however I have question about religious conversion I have question about someone converting from one religion to the another religion I have question about somebody converting from one religion to another and the question is the question is we we have instances where people are converting from Christian to Islam tomorrow you wake up you see one Christian convert to you see one I mean you have instance where someone will convert from Islam to Christian tomorrow you wake up you see a Christian converting to me I asked the brother to ask me directly so that I can hear and I can repeat where my microphone can be heard better the brother said he has a deep love for Islam and he respects Islam from bottom of his heart he was called by friend he's asking the question that someday one Muslim converts to Christianity sometimes the Christian converts to Islam why should we convert what is the reason correct your main question is why should you convert uh why should we consider one religion desirable better than the other is question now you go to one school which teaches 2+ 2 is equal to three the other school teaches 2 + 2 is equal to 4 the third School teaches 2 + 2 is equal to 5 now student of first school goes to school number two first school teaches 2 + 2 is equal to 3 second School teaches 2 + 2 is equal to 4 third School teaches 2+ 2 is equal to 5 brother which is correct first second or third I'm asking you you know mathematics which is correct first second or third correct the school that teaches 2 + 2 is equal to 4 is correct because you know maths as far as religion is concerned I know religion very well as far as maths is concerned you are very good so if a person goes from school one to school two is he doing correct or no if a person changes from school one to school two is he doing correct or no from school number one he goes to school number two the first school teaches 2 + 2 is equal to 3 the first school teaches 2+ 2 is equal to 3 he leaves that school and goes to the second school with teaches 2 plus 2al to four is he doing correct or not correct or no which school is correct you said School number two is correct yes because first school is teaching 2+ 2 is equal to three the second school is teaching 2+ 2 is equal to 4 so he leaves School number one and join School number two is is it good or not correct ah correct correct so School number two teaches 2+ 2 is equal to 4 so the student of school one leaves school one and join School two good student or not good student a student from school three which teaches 2 plus equal to five leave that school and join School two good or right right now one student changes from school two and goes to school one he leave the school teaching 2+ 2 is equal to 4 because he's misguided by someone and he joined the school that says 2+ 2 is equal to one is he right or wrong wrong correct so same way those who are leaving Islam and BEC a Christian they are wrong and those who leave Christianity and come to Islam is correct why Allah says in the Quran in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse number 19l the only religion acceptable in the sight of Allah is is Isam and all the prophets of God Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus Muhammad peace be upon him they Tau there is one God now if someone comes and teaches you wrong things no God is three in one God became flesh this is not part of the teachings of Allah it's not the part of the teachings even of the Bible it is the church which is teaching even though the Bible is changed it's not in the authentic form yet I can prove to you from the Bible that Jesus never claimed God and I gave you so many references so now you agreed that you have no problem in accepting that Jesus is a messenger very good I'm asking you the question do you believe that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger you believe very good but do you believe do you believe Prophet Muhammad to be a messenger of God very good so to enter the school of Islam you require two things number one believe there is God one God and believe that no one else is God not even Jesus number two you have to believe that Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Jesus both are messengers of God if you believe these two things you enter the fold of Islam practicing you all becomes later the minimum two requirement to enter the school of Islam is 2 things number one believe that there is one God and there is no other God besides the true God Allah Jesus is not God Muhammad is not God Moses is not God Adam is not God number one number two believe that Prophet Muhammad and Jesus is a messenger of God if you believe in these two things you can become admission into the school of Islam would you like to admit yourself in the school of Islam but ask you a question now don't look in the mobile don't look in the mobile ask you a question you believe that there one God you believe there's one God I believe in what you believe there is one God one God one God one God one God yes I believe there's one God and you believe Jesus is a messenger of God yes I believe that Jesus is a messenger of God I believe and then I do you believe that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God yes I believe Prophet Muhammad so if you believe in this according to me you're a Muslim so these are the minimum two things required for a person to become Muslim later on praying five times giving zakat fasting will come slowly but to enter Islam you have to believe these two things there's one God and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God so according to me you're a Muslim what do you like to say it in Arabic would you like to say that in a formal way in Arabic brother dalaj Victor he agrees that there is one God he agrees that Jesus is a messenger of God he also agrees that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God he wants to ask one question one question before he accept Islam he said you gave the example of 2+ 2 is equal to 4 2+ 2 is equal to 3 2+ equal to five leave that aside can you show me in the Quran where does it say that who qualifies to be a Christian and who qualifies ISL to be a Muslim very good very good now Quran says that the original followers of Jesus are Muslims Allah says in Surah Imran chter 3: 54 ver before that the helpers of Jesus and Jesus said I am Muslim so the True Believers of Jesus the Quran says a Muslim but Quran also says that those people who have been misguided for example I quoted the verse of the Quran but not full of Imran 3 verse 110 oh ye Muslims you are the best of people evolve for mankind enjoying what is good and forbiding what is wrong and believing in Allah and the verse continues if the people of the book had faith it would have been better for them if the Christians and Jews had faith it would have been better for them among them there are some few who are believers like you you but the majority are transgressors among them there are some who are believers Believers mean Muslims mean Muslims but majority are fasting are transgressors and Allah gives the example Allah is giving the example of those people who misguided who they say they are doing KU mean these misguided Christians they are blaspheming those who say Jesus is Allah but that CH but that of my Lord and your lord anyone who associate partners with Allah Allah will make for him and fire shall be dwelling place and he shall have no help in the here after you having examples of true Muslims among the Christians there are two groups the True Believers and the misguided Allah is saying they are doing they are blaspheming those who say Jesus is God but said Jesus CH peace be upon him oh B Israel oh children of Israel worship Allah my Lord don't worship me worship Allah who's my Lord and your lord any anyone who associate partners with God Allah make for and shall be dwelling place and he shall have no helpers in the Hereafter so this verse is talking about the Christian some who are believers like you who believe that Jesus is not God he's a messenger of God who also believe that God is one and who believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger but the majority they are misguided question ask I have a question to ask you you said one question there are other people in the queue brother brother brother you have to be yeah there are five people waiting we don't have so much time okay just a second do you there are too many people waiting they have to understand believe in teachings of Jesus Christ do you believe in did you believe in the teachings of Jesus I believe in the true teachings of Jesus not the false teachings does this have false and true teaching of course I told you I told you false and true people are claiming Jesus claimed Divinity he never did Divinity I'm a student of comparative religion I false teaching of Jesus two false teaching false the church says Jesus claim Divinity he never did that this is a false teaching of church so false teaching of church you start thinking it is correct correct so Jesus never claimed Divinity that's what the Quran says that's what the Bible says not my will but thy will be done but if you believe in the teachings of Jesus and I believe in the teachings of prophet Muhammad and both of us believe in the teachings of these two powerful messenger of God we have to believe in the true teachings of Jesus I told you a Muslim cannot be a Muslim unless he believes in Jesus CH peace be upon him but the true teaching not the teaching of the church so the biggest culprit here is the church the church is not following the Bible because if the church follows the Bible everyone will become Muslims the church doesn't want the people to follow the Bible you understand so they keep on telling wrong things about the Bible I'm a student of comparative religion I studied the Bible and I try and get the commonalities and tell the world so literally you've read the real Bible that was written in the original language yes no the Bible is there even though the Bible is changed even in the Chang and the corrupted form of the Bible what the church says is not there so church is misguiding people so that they get money you understand now they get popularity they get money you go and believe them so that I come here to tell the truth so now brother there are already four people waiting correct would you like to say it in Arabic what you said in English just one the last no no we cannot it be wrong it will be Haram I'll be doing a sin there are five people waiting you already ask five questions correct so I have to be you don't I have to be kind I've asked two question you told I have to be kind and just it will be wrong okay okay yes you can wait after the after the question answer is over I'll will join them and come back no no after the but would you like to say the sh in public now you said you will say twice I will say and then you didn't say I will say you didn't say are you trying to fool me no no no no no no no no okay so my question is do you want to say the Sha in Arabic I'm just trying to be rational about one thing by the recording is going on you're very rational no you told me one question I answered second question answered third question answered if you don't want to do don't do I'm not forcing you no no no I'm not forcing you the recording is there you were very kind down we don't allow a discussion yes just wa listen listen to me listen to me okay I'm not forcing you to accept Islam yes correct the recording is going on I answered your question you ask one more question answer the question you ask one more question you said okay agree that Jesus is a messenger okay answer this question then I say sh I came there okay answer now you're saying two more question I cannot misguide the people they're waiting there don't want to say don't say sh I'm not forcing you want to say say you'll be truthful you don't want to be truthful don't want to say sha don't say I cannot let them wait longer yeah it is you can deceive the people I cannot yeah it is actually embracing any religion is from their heart of course and for one before one will Embrace a certain religion he will be distracted by a lot of thought how he if you don't want to accept don't accept you told me one question you told thce I answered all three now you're asking two more you are trying to deceive me you should have told me there are 10 questions I'll say come afterwards no no no no problem if you're not convinced no problem The World Is Watching You the world is watching you going live telecast yes but there one thing that makes let's not waste time please other people are there you want to say the sh say don't want to say don't say yes no problem don't say I made a mistake sorry and go off no no no I didn't make say sorry and step down I'm sorry yes no problem"
