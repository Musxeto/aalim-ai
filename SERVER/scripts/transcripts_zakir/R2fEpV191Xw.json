  "title": "Did Jesus (pbuh) claim Divinity when he said: \"I am Alpha and Omega\"? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "hi my name is Sarah I'm a independent student I graduated in America I'm here studying independently um as you have stated Jesus never does claim Divinity in the Bible in Revelation chapter one I can't read the whole chapter because it would take a very long time but Jesus is speaking and he says do not be afraid I am the first and the last I am the living one I was dead and behold I am alive forever and ever I hold the keys of death and Hades he also says I am the Alpha and the Omega who is and who was and who is to come the almighty these are also names of God written in the Old and New Testament and I don't see how that does not show that Jesus is not genetically the Son of God but spiritually the son of God 's question she quoted Revelation chapter number one she didn't give the verses she's talking about the first 20 verses and I'm Alpha and Omega is verse number 11. Revelation chapter number one verse number 11 where Jesus Christ peace be up and says that I am Alpha and Omega so she says just because Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says I'm Alpha and Omega I'm first and the last according to you he is claiming divinity Mark me I had said there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace before himself says that I am God or where he says worship me he didn't say now you are saying that because Jesus said I am Alpha and Omega therefore is almighty God what do you mean Alpha and Omega I'm the first and the last in what do you mean Jesus Christ was first in this world no he was born in a stable before him was his mother there were many prophets that came before him so surely he's not the first neither is he the last in the Bible it says Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him he'll be coming it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14. I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide on to all truth he shall not speak of himself all that dear shall he speak he shall glorify me he shall show you things to come talking about Prophet Muhammad's peace be upon him so what does this word alpha and omega mean it does not mean that is first and the last actually literally because there were many people who came before him and the many people who came after him what does it mean that in the law of God whatever the messenger says the law of God is first and last at the time of Moses Moses was alpha and omega as far as the law of God was concerned whatever he taught had to be followed at the time of Jesus Jesus cast peace be upon him his teachings while fine Omega it had to be followed at the time of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him his teachings Alpha and Omega it is the first and the last it does not mean that he claimed divinity so therefore I said any unambiguous statement if you literally mean to your first and last if you read the Bible the Bible disagrees there were many people who came before Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was born in the womb of the mother and various people came after him also so surely sister therefore I said unambiguous unequivocal statement hope that answers the question [Applause]"
