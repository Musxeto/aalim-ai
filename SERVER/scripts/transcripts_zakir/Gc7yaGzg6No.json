  "title": "What is the Definition of Allah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "before posing my question uh i would like to thank the organizers for making such a brilliant and stupendous effort now coming to my question i have a lot of interaction with muslim because my early childhood and youth was spent among them but one question has always been not really understood by me the definition of allah because to my mind and the way it has been given to me by my muslim friends and acquaintances that their definition of allah basically is negation of other faith and also non-acceptance of their definition of god as such your scholarship is very profound i would like to be benefited by it it was a very good question very important question that he wants to know one thing which has been always in his mind what is the definition of allah in islam and the definition also includes many thing which is negation and it contradicts the definition of the other faiths in fact in islam the definition of allah says what allah is and also says what allah is not besides knowing what god is it is also important to know what god is not so that if someone falsely claims that so and so is god you can easily come to know this is a false claim as far as the reply to what is the refuge of allah the best reply that any muslim can give you is from the quran from surah class chapter number 112 verse number one to four which says there is nothing like him this is a four line definition of allah of almighty god given in the glorious quran this is the touchstone of theology it is the litmus test to identify any person says so and so candidate is god if that candidate fits in this foreign definition we muslims have got no objection in accepting that candidate to be god the first is say allah only allah allah the there is nothing like him for example i'll give you an example there are some human beings who say that bhagavan rajneesh is god during question at the time there was hindu brother who told me that if hindus don't consider him to be god and never said that the hindus called bhagavan nationally because there are many human beings who claim bhagavad-gita is god now i will give you a sample why do we use this negative also like say allah and only is positive eternal he begets not noisy begotten why do we use this now we put this bhagavad-gita to test the first test is say is allah and only was bhagavan rajneshwaran only was he the only man who has claimed divinity there are hundreds who have claimed divinity and in this country of india there are thousands of men who have came to it thousands of people have said that they are god he's not the only one but rashmi's bhakti will say no bhagavad right this is unique so let's go to the next test the allah and eternal was rajneesh absolutely eternal when we read this autobiography we read there that bhagwan rashnesh he was suffering from asthama from diabetes mellitus from chronic back ache imagine almighty god suffering from asthma from diabetes mellitus from chronic back ache the third test is he begets not noise begotten we know bhagavad-gita he was born in madhya pradesh and he had a mother and father and in 1981 he goes to america and takes thousands of americans for a ride and in the state of oregon he starts his new center known as rajnishpuram later on the american government arrest him and puts him behind bars rajneesh alleges that the american government gave me slow poisoning imagine almighty god be slow poisoned and 1985 the american government kicks me out of the country he comes back to india and goes back to the city of puna and there he goes and restarts his center which is today called as osho commune and if you visit osho commune today if you go to samadhi where his ashes have been kept after he died it is mentioned over there on a samadhi on a stone oh sho bhagwan rashnesh oh show never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990 never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990. they forgot to mention on samadhi that he was not given visas to 21 different countries of the world imagine almighty god coming on this earth to visit different countries and requires visas and the last test is so stringent that the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god we know bhagavan a white beard like the human being they had two eyes one nose one mouth two hands the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god well for example someone says that almighty god is a thousand times stronger than arnold schwarzenegger you may have heard the name of anish washington the person who got the title mr world strongest man in the world mr universe the strongest man in the universe the moment you can compare god to anything in this world whether it be anus washing dhara singh or king kong whether it be a thousand times a million times the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god so this brother is in short the concept of almighty god as far as the second part of the question is concerned that why does it contradict with the concept of god in other religions in fact it's a misconception that the concept of allah in the quran it contradicts with the other religions it contradicts against the practices of the other religion agree with you but does not contradict against the other religious scriptures because unfortunately the followers of most of the religions whether it be christianity hinduism etc they do not read their own scriptures so if we analyze the practices of the non-muslims it does contradict but if you go back to the scripture if you have to understand the concept of god in any religion the best is to try and find out what the scripture of that religion has to speak about god don't try and find out the concept of god by observing what the fall of the religions do for example if you want to know the concept of god's sikhism the best place you can go is guru granth sahib adi granth if you read the first volume first chapter first verse of guru granth sahib it is known as japuji what does it say correct known as japuji it says that god is one he is called the true he's called as eternal he is existent he is compassionate he is free from fear and want and if you know in sikhism sikhism believes in one god it does not believe in idol worship it does not believe in author and in the manifest form he is called as akumkara an unmanifest form he is called as omkara and if you read the scriptures of sikhism there are various attributes given to almighty god if you read the six scriptures almighty god he's called a satan it's called holy name he's called as karthar the creator he's called as rahim merciful he is called as kareem beneficent he's also called as wahi guru the one true god so if you go back to the scripture the concept of god in sikhism and islam is the same similarly if you go to hinduism in hinduism also if you go back to the hindu scriptures it's clearly mentioned in the upanishad chandoga panishad chapter number six section number two verse number one it come evident god is only one without a second it's mentioned in the sith chapter number six verse number nine of that god there are no parents he has got no superior he has got no lord it's mentioned chapter number four verse number 19 as well as chapter of that god there is no prathema prathima in sanskrit means it means an image a photograph a painting a picture a portrait an idol a statue a sculpture so it says of that god there is no image there is no painting there is no portrait there is no photograph no sculpture no idol no statue but unfortunately yet you find that hindus are doing idol worship who's to blame i'm quoting the vedas vedas is the highest authority amongst all the hindu scriptures but yet you find that hindu idol worship why because the scholars of hinduism they tell that see brothers are care you know at the lower level people don't understand so for concentration we require the ideal when we reach a higher level of consciousness then idol is not required so i tell this hindu pandit we muslims have already reached the higher level of consciousness it is the basis of hinduism basis of vedas but there are some sects in hinduism like arya samaj which completely denounced idol worship so similarly if you go to christianity if you read the christian scriptures christian scriptures against worship yet you find that the catholics they make an image of god and they say jesus christ peace be upon almighty god so what we realize that if you go to the christian scriptures the christianity and islam the teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him it is similar but most of the christians what they claim that jesus christ peace be upon him he claimed divinity in fact if you read the bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that i am god always to worship me if any christian can point out any unequivocal any unambiguous statement in the bible where jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that i am god always says worship me i am ready to accept christianity today in fact if you read the bible it's clearly mentioned it's mentioned gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 28 jesus christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than i gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 i cast out devils with the spirit of god gospel of luke chapter number 11 verse number 20. i with the finger of god cast out devils gospel of john chapter number 5 verse number 30. i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says i seek not my will the will of almighty god as a muslim so jesus christ peace be upon him he was a muslim he never claimed divinity and is clearly mentioned in the book of acts chapter number two verse number 22 amen of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles and signs which god did by him and your witness to it a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles and signs which god did by many witness to it so if you read the bible even in judaism and christianity they believe in one god who has got no images is clearly mentioned in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 5 verse number 7 9 it says that thou shalt have no other god besides me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image of anything of any likeness in the heaven above in the earth beneath in the water beneath the earth thou shalt not bow unto them nor serve them for i thy god thy lord is a jealous god for more details you can listen to the talk of my son tomorrow my son at 3 45 is going to be a detailed talk this was just highlights on the same topic concept of god in major world religions and you find out it is the same we believe in one god who has got no images and we worship him alone and no one else hope that answers the question thank you so much and you said it for me because the definition of god as it is tallies exactly with islam whatever we have in sikhism you know"
