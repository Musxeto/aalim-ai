  "transcript": "good evening dr zakir naik my name is naresh i've completed my become and i'm looking for a profession in film industry well my first question to you is about human evolution what does the quran say about the human evolution because a common man in a common sense thinks that adam and eve were the first person i mean the cause of human evolution so if you look into that sense now for adam and eve he is our great great great great father i can say so and we are like sons and daughters to him so how does relate for us individuals to marry our own brothers and sisters brother that's the question that what does quran speak about evolution that we came back from one common great great grandparents adam and eve what he's talking about is not evolution about creation well i'm a medical doctor i have passed my mbbs when you say evolution theory of evolution you start thinking of darwin's theory correct that we have been evolved from apes if that's the question you can refer to my video because that quran modern science i've given in detail that that theory has been proved to be wrong darwin said but the main question is that if we have common great great grandparents adam and eve how come we are marrying our own cousins that's the question correct it's not related with monkeys no it's not a relationship monkey's question you can refer to my quran modern science allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 49 verse number 13 oh humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of allah is the person who has taqwa who has got consciousness now coming to your question if we have got one common great great great grandparents so how come we are marrying our cousins today science tells us that if you marry your immediate blood brother and sister there are high chances of genetic problem therefore in islam and most of the religions marrying your immediate blood brother and sister it is prohibited or marrying your immediate blood relations as quran says in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 22 23 24 it says that you are not allowed to marry your mother you aren't allowed to marry your paternal auntie your maternal auntie not allowed to marry your sister and the whole list goes on the immediate blood relations this is prohibited in the quran and prohibited in most of the religions now as far as marrying second cousins or the first cousins islam does not prohibit third fourth fifth most of the religions don't prohibit but some religions prohibit the marrying of first cousins now as far as today science tells us that marrying your immediate blood relations brother sister or paternal anti-maternal auntie there are high chances of genetic problems which keeps on decreasing as you keep on even the first cousin the chances are negligible but there in third second cause and third cousin it is no problem at all if you marry unknown even a non-relative out of the blues yet they can be genetic problem that is unique but can take place so based on that in this verse of the quran that adam and eve our common great grandparents therefore we are called as brothers in humanity yeah you are nas that we are brothers in humanity as far as marrying brothers in humanity fine as long as they follow the criteria of marriage there is no problem though i agree with you all the human beings they may be your cousins maybe third fourth fifth tenth hundred thousand million whatever it is i agree with you we are one big family but there's no prohibition in marrying them and even scientifically it's permissible only marrying your immediate family members blood brother or paternal anti-maternal auntie there are high chances of genetic problems but the other relatives so i do agree with you we all human beings our brethren humanity there's no problem in marrying them islam does not prohibit it and even science does not prohibit that hope that answers the question [Applause]"
