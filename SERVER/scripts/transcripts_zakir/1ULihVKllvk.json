  "title": "Was Guru Nanak a Muslim? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is gagan Sethi I'm a job Seeker in My Religion as as you know that Guru nanak is the founder of our religion is he a Muslim that's my question brother asked the question our young brother who's a sick comes from India he says that he's a sick and the founder of his religion is Guru Nana he's asked me the question was Guru nanak Muslim or not brother Muslim is another big word which means a person who submits his will to almighty God anyone who submits civil to almighty God he's a Muslim now since I did not meet Guru nanak personally I cannot say definitely whether he's a Muslim or not but I have read the guru granth sahib that is the sacred scripture of the Sikh and Sikhism is a religion which believes in 10 gurus the first who's the founders Guru nanak said and the last is Guru Gobind side but after the question do I consider Guru nanak to be a Muslim if I read the guru gran sahib if I read the first verse first volume first verse is known as jabuji of Guru Gran sahib the first volume first verse is called as japuji it says that almighty God is true he is the creator he's free from fear and want self-existing he's eternal he's great and is compassionate now based on this it is somewhat similar to the verse of the Quran of Surah class chapter number 112 verse number 1 to 4 which says only japuji also says that he's not begotten say the love and only Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not noise begotten they're nothing like him again if you read and think of him think of him is a religion which is a monothetic religion and it caused almighty God as a komkara in unmanifest form and manifest form is called as omkara and there are various attributes he given to almighty God in the gurugan said in forgive him almighty God is also called as akal eternal he's called as Qatar the Creator he's called a sahib lord he's called as parvatikar the cherisher he's called as Rahim the beneficent he's called as Kareem the benevolent he's called as wahi Guru the one true God now based on these readings of Guru gran sahib based on these I think that Guru nanak was a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits civil to almighty God but what the scholars say that this Sikhism is religion that emerged in the latter part of the 15th century in the land of Punjab in the land of the firewall and the scholars say it's an amalgamation of Islam and Hinduism that's for scholarship that based on these verses Guru nanak believed in one God he believed that what was it begotten he had no images he was all powerful I personally have not read about Guru nanak where they believed in Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I don't know personally personally haven't met him but based on these teachings it seems to be that he is a Muslim seems to be whether he was Nor not I don't know but unfortunately as time passes there is corruption in it like if you asked me was Jesus Christ a Muslim undoubtedly Jesus why Quran says that Imran chapter number three verse number 52 that is Muslim but there's no verse in the Quran saying Guru nanak will be a Muslim but if I read the Bible if I read verses of the Bible what Jesus Christ said it proves that he's a Muslim but there are other interpolation in the Bible there are concoction in the Bible which undoubtedly cannot be the word of God so I cannot attribute this to Jesus Christ peace be upon him but if I check what is right whether what the Bible says because Quran says I believe Islam was a Muslim Abraham was a Muslim to the Imran chapter 3 verse 67 he was not a Jew or a Christian you are the Muslim so because the Quran clarified I've got no doubt as far as Guru nanak is concerned because Quran does not verify but seeing the verses I consider maybe he was a Muslim but what you have to realize later on as I said there was corruption in the Bible even hear what we find that people have started worshiping the guru grantha Guru nanak didn't have to worship the guru gansan they even have if you go to the Sikh temple other things which are deviations So based on these deviations I cannot say that they're Muslims but go back to your scripture if you go back to a scripture and believe in almighty God who is not begotten who's one who has got no images and worship him alone then you will go back to the original faith that is Islam hope that answers the question"
