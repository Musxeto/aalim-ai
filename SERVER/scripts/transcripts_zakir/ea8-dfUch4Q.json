  "title": "Can a Muslim Lady give a Public Talk if She Wears a Hijaab? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamualaikum again this is Haifa and I'm a business student my question is is it permissible for a Muslim lady to make public talks for dawa if she wears hijab if no what are the other options thank you so it starts the question that is permissible for a Muslim woman to give dhava in public talks with wearing hijab as far as giving public talks in front of ladies only no problem my wife mashallah hundreds and thousands of ladies in many parts of the world in Saudi Arabia I should have given talks in Dubai in USA and Canada in many countries so if a lady gives a talk in public in where there is only ladies no problem as far as the lady giving public talk in mixed Gathering their difference of opinion different opinion though there are some Scholars who say that fine a lady can come on the stage like on this stage in a mixed Gathering but those Scholars were um they say a lady cannot give talk in mixed Gathering and I agree with the second group of Scholars why because the Quran says in surinur chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that you should lower his gaze and guard his modesty whenever a man looks at a woman any Brazen thought comes in his mind you should lower his case so if a woman is giving a talk in public and that the men are watching they should lower the case if someone tells me I look at a woman and nothing happens to him then he requires a psychiatrist if a man is giving a lecture there are women looking at me the next verse the verse I quoted was foreign but today scientific research tells me that when a man looks at a woman his pupil dilates more as compared to a woman when she looks at a man a man is sexually more aroused when he looks at the woman then the woman when he looks at the man that's the reason today in schools which I single sex the results are better it is better for a man teaching mix Gathering it's preferable for a man teaching a woman a man teacher teaching a woman audience then a woman teacher teaching my audience scientific research in spite of that if any woman looking at a die including me if some anashem thought comes even should lower your case but a woman is less excited as compared to a man that's the reason I agree with the second group of Scholars who say for women to give lectures in mixed Gatherings it's not permissible that's the reason on our Peach TV when we show a lady we don't show more than three seconds why not five it is even though the modestly dressed maximum we show it for three seconds so that it does not let the gents get excited so sister I agree with the second group of Scholars how should they do dawa it is not compulsory for a man or woman to come on the stage to dhava sister you can do on the internet you can do email you can do dawa writing books no problem while doing dhava preferable man does to a man woman to a woman male to male female to female in some countries I go a man a Muslim die talking to a non-muslim girl in close doors alone in a closed room the third person is the devil even I cannot do dhawa to a woman one to one no we have our dawa Center in irf Islamic Research Foundation we have a gentle swing doing one to one dawa to gents ladies one-to-one ladies if there is some great he cannot be convinced and if I have to speak to a lady it is with my Miram either my wife is there with me or my sister is with me or that lady's husband is your brother is there this is Islam so we should follow the rules and regulations but within the purview of the Islamic Sharia the woman you have got great scope in Bombay the woman do one-to-one more than the gents in our Bombay Branch there are more ladies accepting Islam than the gents so masha'allah there are so many sessions they have marriage Preparatory course they have Ramadan month they have the Quran family so many sessions they have one day workshop three day workshop one big Workshop they have lectures and hundreds and thousands of ladies attend mashallah but it should be female with female agents who answers the question thank you foreign"
