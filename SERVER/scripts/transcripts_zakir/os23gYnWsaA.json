  "transcript": "there are various say Hadith in which a beloved Prophet M wasallam says that about the statement Allah makes it's mentioned bukari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1894 as well as Hadith number 1904 where Allah says that all the Deeds of the son of Adam are for himself except for fasting it is for me and it means that all the other acts of worship whether it be Salah whether it be zakat whether it be ha all these can be done only for sure the person can do for just for showing off that he's praying he can give charity for that he Z can but as far as fasting is concerned a person can easily go inside the kitchen inside his room and without anyone seeing he can easily eat so if he truly fast it is only for Allah subhana tala it cannot be for show it cannot be for so that's the reason Allah says that all the other acts of son of Adam are for himself but fasting is for me"
