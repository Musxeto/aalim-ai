  "transcript": "let's discuss the concept of God in Islam the best reply that any Muslim can give you regarding the concept of God in Islam Islam it is in numbers in senses it is the second largest religion in the world it has more than 2 billion followers out of the 8 billion population it has 25% Muslims but in terms of practice it is the largest religion the there is no other religion which is followed by more than 1.5 billion in senses yes Christian may be larger but in practice Muslims Islam is the largest religion Islam is a citic religion and the most sacred scripture is the revelation of almighty God the last and final Revelation the Glorious Quran which was revealed to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the best reply that any Muslim can give you regarding the concept of God in Islam is quote to you surlas chapter number 112 verse number 1 to 4 from the Quran Allah says in surlas chapter number 112 verse number 1 to 4 say he is Allah one and only Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not know he begotten there's nothing like him this is a forline definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala if any person says so and so candidate is God if the candidate you believe to be God passes this four line definition we Muslims have got no objection in accepting that entity as God number one say he's Allah one and only number two Allah Allah the absolute and eternal number three he begets not nor is he begotten and number four there nothing like him this it is the Touchstone of theology Theo means god logic means study theology study of God and Touchstone if you want to buy or sell jewelry you go to a Goldsmith if you want to buy or sell gold jewelry you go to a Goldsmith and want to verify how pure the gold is so the Goldsmith takes the gold jewelry and rubs it again against a stone called as touch Stone and depending upon the color he will tell you whether the gold is a 24 karat gold or a 22 karat gold or 18 karat gold or it may not be gold at all because All That Glitters Is Not Gold so surlas is the Touchstone of theology the god you worshiping put him in the test of surlas if he passes he's a true God otherwi he's a fake God for example there are many human beings who say that bhagan rashish is God once during question answer time Hindu said Hindus never say bhagan is God I never said that the Hindus say bhagan Nish is God I said some people and there are thousands of people who claim bhagan rajnish is's God let us put this bhagavan rajnish to the test of suras the first is was bhagan rashish one and only we know there are thousands of men who have claimed to be God he's not the only one and especially the country where I come from India there are thousands of men who claim to be God he's not the only one number two Allah Allah the absolute and eternal was rajish absolute and eternal we come to know from his autobiography he said he was suffering from aama from diabetes malius from chronic back achee imagine almighty God suffering from AA diabetes mtis chronic back ache third test he begets not no begotten we know bhagan rajnish he had Parents he was born in jabalpur later on his own parent become a disciple in May 1981 he goes to America and takes thousands of American for a ride he goes to the state of Oregon and starts his own village known as rajnish puram and he takes thousands of American for a ride and it was mentioned he owned more than 50 rolls Roy the person who owned the maximum rolls Roy in the world later on the American government they arrest him and put him in prison rash says that the American government gave me slow poisoning imagine almighty God being slow poisoned and the last test is so stringent that no one besides the one true God can pass the test the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God we know bhagan rajnish like all the other human being had two eyes one nose one mouth two hands two legs big white blowing beard the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he is not God suppose someone says almighty God is a thousand times stronger than Arnold swasher you might have heard the name of Arnold swasher he was given the title Mr Universe supposed to be the strongest man in the universe the moment you can compare God to anyone whether it be annar whether it be King Kong whether it be D Singh whether it be a thousand times or whether it be a million times the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God there's nothing like him is the Touchstone of theology we Muslims we prefer calling Allah by the Arabic word Allah rather than the English word God the reason is a person can play a around with the English word god which you cannot do with the Arabic word Allah if you add s to God it becomes Gods plural of God there's nothing like plural Allah say is Allah one and only if you add D SS to God it becomes goddess meaning a female god there's nothing like female Allah or male Allah in Islam Allah is unique Allah subhana tala has got no gender the moment you add father to God it becomes Godfather he's my godfather he's my guardian there's nothing like Allah father in Islam Allah by Islam if you add mother to God it becomes god mother there nothing like Allah mother or Allah mean Islam if you prefix the tin before God it becomes tin God meaning a fake God there's nothing like tin Allah in Islam that's the reason we Muslims we prefer calling Allah by the original Arabic word Allah rather than the English word God but if someone uses this word god like how I'm doing when you are speaking to non-muslims I've got no objection but I'd just like to remind you that God is not the appropriate translation of the Arabic word Allah there are many people who say that God he can do anything he can become a human being why can't you have a God man the reason I say you cannot have a God man because the qualities of God and man are opposite a human being has a beginning God has got no beginning human beings have an end God has no end you can't have a person who's a God man having an end and no end at the same time you can't have a person who has a beginning and no beginning at the same time it's meaningless it doesn't make sense you can either have God or you can have man you can't have a God man it's not possible human beings we require to eat Allah says in the Quran in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 14 that Allah is the one who feeded everyone but does not require to be fed you we human beings require sleep and rest Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter 2 verse number 255 that Norm Allah is the Eternal the self-existence no Slumber can sees him nor does he require rest to him belongs everything in the heaven and the Earth so Allah subhana tala does not require rest and sleep like how human beings require so how can you have a God man together it is meaningless you can either have God or you can have man you can't have a God man that's the reason Allah says in the Quran in several places in Allah has power over all things in Bak chap number 2 ver 106 inah Bak chapter number 2 ver9 in Surah Bak chapter number 2 vers number 284 in Surah Imran chapter number 3 verse number 29 inah chter number 16 verse number 77 in chter number 35 verse number one for verily Allah has powered over all things Allah says in Surah BJ chapter number 85 vers number 16 Allah is the doer of all he intends whatever he intends he can do but he does not intend doing ungodly things like becoming a human being like resting like sleeping like eating Allah clearly says in the Quran that the scriptures are very clearcut talking about God yet most of the human beings they don't follow Allah says in Bak 2 verse number 18 the deaf the dumb the blind they will never return to the true part the same message repeated in the Bible in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 13 verse number 13 seeing they see not hearing they hear not neither will they understand the Bible is telling that the Bible is clearly mentioning there's one God he has got no images don't make images of God believe only in him yet people will worship more than one God they will make two Gods they'll make three Gods they'll make image of God Gospel of Matthew chapter number 13 verse number 13 seeing they see not hearing they hear not neither will they understand similarly if you read the Hindu scriptures in r book number 10 him number 71 verse number four seeing the words they see not hearing the words yet they hear not that means it is clearly mentioned in the Hindu scriptures that God is only one he has got no images yet people worship more than one God yet people make images of God you know some people say almighty God he will do anything allmighty God will never tell a lie because to tell a lie is ungodly Allah subhah wa ta'ala he will never do Injustice Allah says in Sur n 4 number 40 Allah is never injust in the least degree Allah will never forget Allah says in Surah T 20:52 Allah never forgets Allah will never make a mistake Allah says in Surah 20: 52 Allah never makes a mistake the moment Allah tells a lie he ceases to be Allah if Allah makes a mistake he will cease to be Allah if Allah forgets he will cease to be Allah that's the reason Allah subhana wa ta'ala will never tell a lie he'll never make a mistake he will never forget he will never do Injustice therefore some people say almighty God become a human being he cannot be God and human together if he became a human being what is the use of woring of a human being like you and me he has lost his powers and then later on he the same human being became God it's not possible a human being cannot become God otherwise you and I also become God so that's the reason almighty God will never become a human being most of the religions besides Islam they have a philosophy called as anthropomorphism anthropomorphism means almighty God taking even a human form and most of the religion besides Islam they believe that almighty God became a human being once or more number of times and they have a beautiful logic that almighty God he's so pure he's so holy he does not know how does a human being feel when he's in trouble almighty God so holy so pure he does not know how a human being feel when he's sick he does not know how a human being feel when he's Disturbed so almighty God came to this earth and became a human being to know what is good or what is bad for the human being I'm asking a question if I make if I make a computer do I have to become a computer to know what is good or what is bad for the computer no I don't have to become a computer to know what is good or bad for the computer if I'm the creator of the computer I write an instruction manual how to operate the computer put on theity press the button on the computer don't put it in water it will get spoiled don't drop it from a height it will get damaged I write an instruction manual I don't have to become a computer to know what is good or what is bad for the computer so similarly Allah subhana wa ta'ala does not have to become a human being to know what is good of bad for the what does he do he chooses a man amongst men who we call as Messengers and he communicates with them on a higher level and he reveals the instruction manual the instruction manual for the human beings is the Glorious Quran the last and final instruction manual for the human beings is the Glorious Quran the dos and don'ts for the human beings is mentioned in the last and final revelation of Allah subhana wa ta'ala that is the Glorious Quran the Glorious Quran is the last and final Revelation the last and final instruction manual for the human beings Allah says in the Quran in Surah is chapter number 17 verse number 11 say call upon Him by Allah or by by whichever name you call upon him to him belongs the most beautiful name you can call Allah by any name but it should be a name that he himself has given it should be a beautiful name and there are no less than 99 different attributes given in the Quran to Allah subhana tala Alman Al Alim most gracious most merciful most wise most wise no less than 99 attributes given in the Quran and the crowning one is Allah this message that to Allah belongs the most beautiful name besides Surah is chapter number 17 verse 110 it is also mentioned in Surah 7 verse number 180 in Surah chapter number 20 verse number 8 and Surah chapter number 59 verse number 24 that to Allah belongs the most beautiful names now when you give an attribute to Allah subhana wa ta'ala it should be a unique attribute and should only point to him and no one else if it's not the unique attribute you cannot give the attribute to Allah Let me Give an example if I want to give a unique attribute to Neil Armstrong have you heard of Neil Armstrong the person who was the first man to set foot on the moon if I say Neil Armstrong was an American there are 100 million people who are American nothing unique if I say Neil Armstrong was an astronaut there are tens of thousands of human beings astronaut nothing unique to give a unique attribute it should be Neil Armstrong was the first man who set foot on the earth if you reverse it who is the first man who set foot on the earth the answer is only one Neil Armstrong so when you describe Allah the ATT tribute should be unique and should not belong to anyone else you cannot say Allah is the creator of the building there are many people who can create building Allah is the creator of the universe who's the creator of the universe Allah khik the Creator Alman the merciful Al the most gracious alakim the most wise if you reverse it who is the creator Allah subhana tala who is the most merciful Allah subhana wa taala who's the most gracious Allah subhana wa ta'ala who is the most wise Allah subhana almighty God should only be one some people say why can't there be multiple gods you know one God for cloud one God for rain one God for wind one God for sun what is the problem if there would have been many God like how we have in the mythology or some of the religions then one God will fight with the other God one God taking the help of the third God to defeat the fourth God what is this it is better to have one God who has all the powers rather than divide the powers into many you can have only one head you can't have two heads Allah says in the Quran in Surah Amia chapter number 21 verse number 22 if there were more Gods besides one true God there have been confusion in the earth and in the world Allah says in Surah M chapter number 23 verse number 91 Allah does not beet a son nor are the other God besides Allah if it was so each God would have taken away what it had created and would have holded on the other so the correct concept is God should only be one he should be absolute he should have all absolute Powers rather than having multiple gods that's the reason if you study the scriptures of most of the major religion in the world most of them they say that God is only one they believe in monotheism the scriptures say you should worship only one God but most of the time they change the scriptures they the other religion have changed the scriptures or they explain the scripture in the wrong way to the followers Quran says in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 79 vote to those who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from Allah to traffic with it for a miserable price vote to those for what they earn WOTE to those for what they write that's the reason Allah says in the Quran mashah it's much better now that's the reason Allah says in Surah Yu chapter number 12 verse number 106 most of them do not worship Allah without associating Gods with him that means they may believe in one God but they associate partners with him what's the use so Allah says in Surah Yu chapter number 12 vers number 106 most of them worship not God besides associating partners with him there are some people people who are agnostic like the Buddhist some people are atheist like the Gen religion they don't believe in God for those people who are agnostic who do not comment whether God is there or not or those who are atheist who do not believe in God at all I've given the talk on does God exist and the talk on is the Quran God's word if any human being watches this talk of Mind does God exist or is the Quran God's word the talk is for about 2 2 and a half hours and the question answer s for four or 6 and a half hours in Malaysia inshallah he'll be convinced that God exists I proved it with scientific proof with the help of the Quran the existence of Allah subhana tala with reason logic and science so anyone who's atheist or agnostic if he hears my speech it does God exist or is the Quran God's word inshallah if he has with open mind he'll believe that there's one God and should worship him alone Islam believes in toed toed does not merely mean believing in one God comes from the Arabic word which means to unite to unify to consolidate it means unification of one God and has got three categories and the first is means maintaining the unity of the lordship of Allah subhana wa ta'ala rubia comes from the Arabic word r meaning sustainer meaning cherisher so believing and maintaining that almighty God is the r Allah subhana wa ta'ala alone is the Creator cherisher and sustainer of everything in this world everything is dependent on him he isn't independent of anything and everything that's number two is maintaining the unity of the names and attributes of Allah subhana tala this is divided into five rules and condition number one you should describe Allah only by the way Allah has described him or his Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam you cannot give your own description of Allah subhana tala number two you should only give names to Allah what Allah has given in the Quran you cannot give your own name you cannot say Allah is the angry one Quran says Allah gets angry but you can't say Allah is the angry one because Allah did not describe himself like that didn't name him that say number three you cannot give the description of Allah to anyone else you cannot say I know of a man who has no beginning and no end that's Allah's quality you cannot give the quality ities of his creation to him you cannot say Allah repented Allah made a mistake Allah told a lie these are qualities of his creation he does not have to repent he doesn't make mistakes so why should he repent like how the Bible says almighty God repented in Islam in the Quran you'll never find almighty God repenting or telling a lie or making a mistake or forgetting or dying and the fifth is that you cannot give the name of Allah to somebody else you cannot name a human being arahman you can name him Rahman but notman arahman is the merciful you can not call him alakim the wise if you want to say you have to add ABD in the front of it Abdul Rahman the servant of the most merciful Abdul Hakim servant of the most spice and you cannot give any human being up of anyone else you can cannot say Abdul rasul he's the servant of rasool no it's not allowed you cannot say Abdul Nai the servant of the Nai no you can only be AB of Allah and no one else these are the five points of the third category maintaining the unity of worshiping Allah alone that means you should worship Allah and no one else if you believe in the first two and you give good names to Allah but along with it you worship somebody else besides Allah you break the besides believing in one Allah besides giving him the correct attributes and names besides the r you should also worship him alone and no one else and Allah says in the Quran in Surah unus chapter number 10 verse number 31 talking about the pagans the Arabs at the time when the Quran was revealed when you ask them who is the one who rules the faith from the heaven and the Earth who is the one that has power over hearing and seeing who is the one who gives life to the dead and dead to the life who is the one who controls everything they say Allah then why don't you show pety to him why do you worship as a Gods Allah repeats the message in Surah zuk chapter number 43 Verse 87 when you ask them who created you they say Allah then why do you worship somebody else that's the reason Quran says in Surah Yu 12 verse number 106 most of the human beings do not worship Allah without associating partners with him that mean they may believe in one Allah they may give him the good name but with that one Allah they also worship other gods this is shik if you break any one of the three categories of or it is called a shik shik is the biggest sin in Islam in imam's book shik is number one biggest sin in Islam Allah says in Surah 4:48 that Allah forgiveth not that you associate partners with him anything else if he pleases he will forgive anything else if he pleases he may forgive but anyone who has committed shik he has committed the most heinous sin Allah repeats the message in Surah n chapter 46 that Allah forgiveth not anyone joining Gods with him anything else if he pleases he may forgive for anyone who has joined Gods with him he has strayed far away so shik is the biggest sin in Islam and it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah ma chter 5 verse number 72 they say the Christians they say that Jesus Christ peace be upon him the son of Mary is Allah they are doing those who say Allah is Jesus the son of Mary Quran is saying they are doing they are blaspheming those who say Allah is Jesus the son of Mary but said Jesus peace be upon him oh children of isra Allah who my Lord and your lord anyone who associate partners with Allah Allah will make for him and fire shall be dwelling place and he shall have no help us in the herea Jesus Christ peace be upon him said and anyone who associate partners with Allah Allah will make J Haram for him and fire shall be dwelling place and he shall have no helpers in the Hereafter that's the reason I start my talk by quoting a verse from the Glorious Quran from Surah Imran chapter number three verse number 64 which says oh people of the book come to Common terms as between us and you which is the first term Allah that you worship them but Allah I did not say you believe in only one Allah I said Allah that you worship none but Allah that you associate partn with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and PR other than Allah if then they turn back say bear witness that we are Muslims bowing our will to Allah subhana tala before I end my speech I would like to quote a few verses of the Quran Allah says this Surah Anam 6 verse 108 revile not those who worship God besides Allah abuse not those who worship God besides Allah lest in the ignorance they will abuse Allah subhana tala Allah says in Surah lukman chapter number 31 verse number 27 that if you convert all the trees into pen and the ocean into ink backed with seven oceans yet the words of Allah will not be exhausted I would like to end my speech with the quotation of the Quran from Surah Hajj chapter number 22 verse number 73 which gives the summary of my talk aen listen to this all those who you wor this is a parable listen to this all those who you worship besides Allah if all of them gather together Allah is giving a challenge all the gods that you worship besides the true God some believe three God some thousand God some 33 CR 330 million God all the hundreds of millions of God you worship if they gather together to create a fly they will not be able to do it and if the fly snatches something they will not be even able to get it back feeble are those who petition feeble are those to whom you petition [Applause]"
