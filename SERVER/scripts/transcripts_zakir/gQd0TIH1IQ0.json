  "title": "Wear the Hijab and Represent the True Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "brother POS the question that there are some Muslim Muslim women who we the bka but when they go to the colle they remove the bka inside there were jeans and they MBE with the men the hijab of a Muslim woman should only be done in front of the N if they going to a ladies College in which everyone there is a woman so if they wear the bka on the streets and in the classroom where there are only ladies they remove the bka there's no problem at all no problem at all but I do know you're referring to certain colleges which have got men and women coed colleges have got colleges which contain male and female students in this cases it wrong in front of the namam it's compulsory they should wear Bas if there are a few Muslim women who do this that doesn't mean that no Muslim woman should wear a bka it is that there are black sheeps in every Community there are black sheeps in every Community just by picking up these black sheeps and saying that because these few people are doing wrong activities therefore I will not do that that's not right at all for example if you have to judge a car a Mercedes car which I bought in the market latest model and you ask a person to sit behind the steering wheel who does not know how to drive the car he doesn't know to drive and he bangs up the car who will you blame the car or the drive driver who will you blame the driver the person driving the car doesn't know how to drive if you want to check how good the car is you have to see how good is the specification how powerful it is what are securities what's the average how fast can it go etc etc and if you want to judge how good the car is practically let a person who knows how to drive the car sit behind the steering wheel therefore by saying that I will not wear a burka because some women they misbehave with men and take advantage it's like you saying that Mercedes car is bad because the driver doesn't know how to drive illogical there are black sheeps in every Community Hitler you know Hitler he incinerated 6 million Jews 6 million Jews can I blame Christianity for that can I no he's a bad example so similarly if certain women do these activities all the more reason the other Muslim should say because there are certain Muslim women who are maling the name of Islam all the more reason I should wear burka and prove to the other human beings that a Muslim woman is good if you find certain Muslim women who are misbehaving because of certain ill information certain bad Natures in this we as Muslims should do islah should improve them at the same time all the more should wear the label more if suppose a Mercedes car comes to no company that a person doesn't know how to drive and mag up the car they'll give a full page D the person who drove the car didn't know how to drive therefore he banged up the car so you have to advertise more all the more reason you should wear and prove to the people that Islam is the best way of life so you cannot say that I will not wear bka based on the wrong did by certain muslima regarding the second part of the question that there are certain non-muslims who wear the bka to hide themselves I've got no objection now they're wearing it to hide from certain reason maybe tomorrow they'll accept inshallah I'm aware that there are certain non-muslims who wear it to do wrong activities maybe Allah will open up the heart one day we cannot tell them that see what we doing is wrong we can tell them that the Nia is wrong you cannot say wearing bka is wrong you can tell them your Nia the reason that bka is there is to protect the modesty you are taking advantage of this act and doing an immodest Act we have to correct them and we have to let the people know that bka is actually for the modesty and give the reply for the hijab which you can refer to my video said that why Muslims should wear hijab hope that answer the question"
