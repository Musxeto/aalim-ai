  "title": "Can a Person Enter Paradise who doesn't do anything Haraam except that he doesn't Pray? â€“ Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "the next question from Hassan from Oman if someone does not do anything forbidden but the only thing is that he does not pray is it possible for him to enter paradise the question posed by brother husband from Amman that if a person doesn't do anything forbidden but the only thing he does he does not pray so can you go to Jenna it is like somebody asking me that I want to have a very good healthy body I do exercise I go to the gym I did he go to walk I'd recycling only thing I don't do it I do not eat anything the whole day do you think the person will be healthy just by going to the gym cycling going for the morning walk jogging very good fresh air but does not eat anything full day like it is known to us for a healthy body you should have three meals a day similarly for a spiritual soul it's compulsory that minimum you should pray five times a day praying five times a day is further than Islam regarding the question that can I go to Jannah if I don't do anything Haram and maybe do all the other good deeds but do not offer player our beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said it's mentioned in psyche Muslim way number one hadith number two for six that between the man and and Cofer stands the offering of Salah miss Allah brain Salah is the differentiation between a man and and go for that for the Prophet said that buried in the scholars many scholars say that if a person who does not pray at all it is coffee he becomes a kafir some scholars are more lenient to say that they were person doesn't pray but believe praying is the FIR then he cannot be called as a kafir the difference of being amongst the that is the most important I beloved Porsche masala some said it's mentioned in Fernandez I warned number five hadith number three 996 that the Prophet said that the first did that Allah will ask on their day of judgment is regarding offering of Salah so the most important deed amongst all the ladies Allah as we discussed in the last session the biggest sin is the sin of silk the thing which is haram issue then would be murder black magic etc similarly amongst the deeds that is the most important it is Salah it is Priya and if you don't do that that is like your hundred dollars in deeds now how I said infant shift is the worst similarly in deeds number one is Salah if you don't offer Salah can you go to Jenna Allah says in the Quran in surah Nisa chap number fours 948 and it's for any such up number for 116 if Allah pleases he may forgive anything but the sin of silk he will never for you yes if after completing silk if you repent as for forgiveness and stop it insha Allah ll forgive that also but if you die as a mushrik with our asking for forgiveness without living you are detained for hellfire there's no forgiveness the most important deed to be done is salah if you don't offer salah the chances of you going to Jannah is very minimal very negligible if I love wishes to forgive you because they have not done Allah may forgive you possibilities their probability is not a possibility yes but very low point zero zero zero one percent because that's the most important date if you do something else and if I laugh pleased with you and Allah wants to forgive you there is too much of ifs and buts the person cannot take the risk we're undergoing the final examination this is the test for the year after you cannot take that chance and if we analyze if I ask you a simple question there is a human being who everyone is saying was so grateful he's such a good human being and he is looking after other people he is going and helping the poor and he's loving everyone else and when you closely go and in life you realize that he had a mother and father who are very loving who took care of him who looked after him and who educated him gave him good clothes and then he became rich but later on he doesn't take care of his parents at all he's not even going and meeting them for years together he's not thanking them so how will you call him a good human being just because he's helping the poor but the mean people mean two human beings his parents mother and father who took care of him gave him the education and bottom up because of that why today he's got a good job and he neglects them doesn't meet them doesn't care for them doesn't go and even say how are you for yes together how can you call him a good human be no compare to parents in allah allah subhanho wa taala is not a crater in Fela we are thanking Allah subhanAllah and besides anger las manos allah we are getting guidance from him how should we lead our lives I have given a talk on Salah the programming towards righteousness that not only do we pray and thank Allah we also get guidance from him and if we offer Salah in the right way we are being guided to good deeds so the chances if you offer salat correctly will be on the straight path is very high and if you are in trouble the best solution is Allah if you are in trouble and if you have a problem you cannot see that you have tried everything to solve the problem until you pray in the last 1/3 of the night and ask for the problem we solve integers besides the five compulsory Salah there are many Salah Salah is the programming to righteousness it is your main soul the best deal a Salah and while I was doing my little research on the life of the Prophet I realized that the Prophet on average so the cedar is a machine exactly how many are they slept in a day on average open to my study he might have slipped between three to four hours a day because hadith a that if to pray for one third of the night used to pray sorry baccarat and for Imran that's more than two Jews in the nearly two duels would put together for Jules supernaturally to take us so based on this depending upon whether summer or winter the nights keep on getting short and long the maximum that the Prophet could have slept was maybe to do for us not more than that and if we analyze the time you have to spend praying every day if you just calculate logically it would be more than five six hours so according to me according to my research the Prophet prayed more number of hours then the number of as he slept anyway let me be very clear there is no hadith or no Quranic was telling that you should spend more time in praying then sleeping not at all but this was the practice of the Prophet I'm just telling you something what the Prophet practice not that every human being should do it it's difficult but not a normal human being requires about seven hours of sleep minimum seven to eight hours minimum is 6 hours so it difficult that way even if you heard my answer when I gave last month in the month of Ramadan I bought my daily routine I said when I was in Bombay I still sleep for about 3 hours and I have to pray us approximately for three hours when I came to Malaysia I started praying for about 450 minutes and my sleep increased to three and half as before what I said in Amnon but after I'm done for the last one man alhamdulillah I've increased my time for prayers I started praying Tydeus for minimum one and a half hour every day Aram the little after I'm done have juice in a slow recitation takes about one and a half hour previously might add you do - very from randomly 30 made some time 1r but average was about 30 minutes now they've increased to one and a half more than mana so now my average time I spent only the time from the oven and I do wudu walk to the mosque come back total all the Vaisala and the salad Aloha and taja they approximately 5 hours 15 minutes if I remove the time of Voodoo and the time of going in coming and the time of dois yet it will be more than four hours al hamdulillah and my time of sleep is about three and half hours so when I am the trying that let my hours of salah be more than hours of mystery anyway this is not compulsory at all for the muslims it is just my research and I'm trying to follow what I can and Allah has blessed me that I can do my work throughout the day even if sleeping less it's an AMA form allah subhanaw taala so prayer is the most important deed regarding the answer that if you don't pray and do all the other good deeds and stay away from the bad deeds the chances of you going to Jannah is very very very minimal to forgive you and put you in general that's a las perogative but the chances are very less so my request to you brother that see to it that you pay attention on your salah your full life should reward or inshallah if a person is a good practicing muslim all these activities in the day it revolves around salah the timing needs if mr. Saleh is there before salaf Kassala the time he sleeps with mr. inshallah the appointment he gives to anyone is based on salah so those people are practicing muslim and see to it that they offer salah five times a day in jamaat in the mosque the whole daily routine revolves around salah it is the most important factor it builds a discipline in you and it is the most important deed i request you that you should always pray alhamdulillah five times a day in the mosque in jamaat that the mr. hope the answer the question"
