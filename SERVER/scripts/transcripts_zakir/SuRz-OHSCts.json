  "title": "Quran is Unscientific when it says in 31:34 that only Allah knows Sex of Child in Motherâ€™s Womb.",
  "transcript": "again from the youtube salman kursit i am salman khushi from kashmir my question is that it is mentioned for luqman last was no one can predict what is inside the womb of the pregnant woman but today medical science can how so isn't contradicting the science the question poses is there's the verse in the quran instead of luqman chapter number 31 the last verse that allah says that the knowledge of the r is only with allah and only allah knows when and when it will reign and what will a person earn and what is in the womb of the mother so one of the things that only allah knows is mentioned in the quran is what is in the womb of the mother but unfortunately some of the translations especially urdu translations they have translated it as only allah knows what is the sex of the child in the mother's womb which is not a part of the quran it is their own edition what the quran says only allah knows what is in the womb of the mother it means only allah knows whether the child in the mother's womb will be a boon for society or will he be a bane for society will he go to jannah or will he go to jannah will he go to paradise or will he go to hell will he be beneficial for the parents or will it not be beneficial this with all the medical equipment in the world no doctor can tell you when the child in the mothers who really go to heaven or hell will it be beneficial for the ummah not will it be benefit for the mother or not so this is the real translation that we don't know about what is in the womb of the mother talking about the other thing not about the sex that's a mistranslation so that error goes to the translator not allah"
