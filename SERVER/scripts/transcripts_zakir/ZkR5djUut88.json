  "transcript": "manchester uk is kosher meat halal kosher meat is the meat which is slaughtered by the jews and i'd rather orthodox jews is it halal as far as the quran clearly mentioned in surah chapter 5 verse number 5 that lawful for you lawful for the muslims is the food of the kitab so all food of ali kitab is lawful but natural the difference of opinion as far as if a christian gives food there are many scholars many arab scholars who say that if christians serve the food even not serbia it is according to me it's not halal because they are not following the rules of the bible then ask them the question if they give poke you have they said no i said why so these chords say because haram in the bible now they may not be that much well-versed with the comparative religion that's not their field compatibility is my field so if we analyze the bible according to the bible also slaughtering should be done unfortunately most of the christians don't follow but the jews follow as allah says in the quran in no less than four different places in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse num 173 in surah maidah chapter number five verse number three in surah anam chapter 6 verse number 145 and sudan chapter number 16 verse number 115 um dead meat blood the flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides allah's name is invoked so all the muslims know very well that these four food are prohibited dead meat blood the flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides allah's name has been taken and these four foods also provided in the bible that's a different thing that the christians don't follow but the jews follow if you read the bible bible prohibits dead meat dead meat is prohibited in the bible time will not permit to describe in detail i'll just mention the references it's mentioned in the book of leviticus chapter number 17 verse verse number 15 and the book of deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number 21 that dead meat is prohibited even blood is prohibited in the bible in no less than five different places it's mentioned in the book of genesis chapter nine verse number four in the book of leviticus chapter number 17 verse number 14. in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 12 verse 16 in the first time in chapter number 14 verse number 33 and the book of acts chapter number 15 verse number 29 that blood is prohibited even poke is prohibited in the bible in the book of leviticus chapter number 11 verse number 7 and 8 in the book of deuteronomy chapter 14 verse number eight and the book of isaiah chapter number 65 verse number two to five any meat on which any name besides allah name is taken or it is sorted on an idol it is prohibited in the bible in the book of acts chapter 15 verse number 29 and the book of revelation chapter number two verse number 14. so based on this when the quran says food of the ali kitab is permitted according to me even dead meat is prohibited even blood is prohibited focus prohibit any name on which any name besides allah's name is taking this prohibited so the christians are not strict and they they sell meat which is non-zebia which is totally wrong which is non-cautious totally wrong but the jews which are orthodox they do in the way the bible has commanded which is the same as the islamic method almost same i remember in the late 80s or the early 90s when i used to travel there was nothing like halal food in the flights but there was the option of kosher food because the jews are very particular and they are more particular than the muslims so when i asked to travel i had to order kosher meat for a muslim if halal meat sabya meat is available that's the best to have but if there's no zabiya meat if they squash your meat you can safely have it it's permitted but don't have the non-zabiya meat it is haram for you"
