  "transcript": "the brother posed a question in Hindi I'll give the translation English he said that God loves even he loves God human beings love God the moment you love God all these good qualities I mentioned about honesty about charity come automatically so is it required that we should follow the Commandments mentioned in the Quran is it a requirement brother if everything comes automatically you will automatically follow what is mentioned in the Quran but everything doesn't come automatically to everyone you understand so what Allah wants if you love your creator for example I say that I love my mother I love my mother my mother tells me that my son don't tell lies no I love you mother but what does I'm in lying my mother says get for a glass of water mother I love you very much but I don't get the glass of water I am sick please get some tablets mother I love you very much if I don't obey the Commandments of my mother what is the use of this love it is useless it is a lip service therefore Allah says in the Quran in Surah anab 29 verse number two just by saying you believe Allah will test you if you say you love Allah will not leave you Allah will test you so just by saying you love Allah or just by saying I believe in Allah or believe in God Allah will surely test you so this life is a test now when you go for the test if you don't know the rules and regulation of the test there'll be a problem for example if you sit for an examination first you try and find out what is the portion of the examination and then you study that portion so what Allah said certain things are in B I agree with you certain things qualities honesty charity it comes in Born Allah has put but many things we don't know not having aloh is not inborn certain things that charity is inborn may come like if anyone is suppose anyone is tortured you feel hurt certain things are inborn not to gamble is not inborn so certain things are inborn certain things are not so what we have to do we have to follow the Commandments of Allah subhana wa tala as Allah says this life is a test so unless you do not read the Commandment of almighty God how will you pass the test why do I say read the Quran because this is the only book which is the revelation of Mighty God which has remained in prestine Purity according to Sir William Mo who a staunch critic of Islam he was forced to write first means he was compelled he had no option that there's no book on the earth which has remained as pure as the Quran for the past 12 centuries he said this 200 years back even a Critic he had no option he couldn't lie he had to say so compared to all the other scriptures of almighty God Allah subhana wa taala he sent several Revelations by name you know four tah Zab inil and the Quran Torah is the the Revelation was given to Moses peace be upon Him zabur is the the Revelation was given to David peace be upon Him inil is theah the Revelation given to Jesus peace be upon him and Quran is the last and final Revelation which was given to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam otherwise Allah says in the Quran Sur 13:38 we have sent a revelation every age there were many more Revelations sent by the passage of time they have got corrupted the only one which has remained in prane Purity is the Quran that's why I say that if if you want to follow the real commandment of Allah subh follow this and if you being a Hindu if you ask me how do I prove it you have to come for my talk on the 18th of January on Sunday for similarities between Hinduism and Islam [Applause] [Music]"
