  "title": "Should I Remind a Fasting Person if He Drinks or Eats? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya next question question four there's a \nHadith which mentions that if a person eats or   drinks forgetfully then Allah has provided him \nwith food and drink last Ramadan whilst fasting   my husband requested me a glass of water not \nrealizing that he was fasting I served him with   a glass of water and he drank should I have \nreminded him that he was fasting or consider   it a provision from Allah that question is \nrightly mentioned that the Beloved prophet   wasallam he has mentioned in s bukari Vol \nnumber three in the book of fasting Hadith   number 1933 the Beloved Prophet said that if \na person unintentionally out of forgetfulness   while fasting has something to eat or drink he \nshould complete his fast and what he has eaten   and what he drank he should think it's from \nAllah subhana tala so but a person person who   has unintentionally out of forgetfulness it \nis totally valid he can complete the fast but   here the husband has forgotten the wife knew \nit very well what the wife should have done   was she should have reminded the husband \nbecause the Quran says in Imran 3 verse 110 enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong \nand believe in Allah so here it was the duty of   the wife to remind the husband that he was fasting \nand Quran says that that they have to help each   other in Good Deeds goodness and righteousness so \nhere it was the duty of the wife because she knew   that the husband was fasting if she did not know \nand she gave it it would have been forgiven but   because knowing very well that the husband was \nfasting she purposefully gave it to him I feel   what she had done is wrong it's a sin but as far \nas the husband is concerned he asked for water   not knowing that he was fasting his fast would \nbe accepted it would be completed and that's the   provision of Allah but she should have reminded \nhim so she's at fault the husand is not at fault"
