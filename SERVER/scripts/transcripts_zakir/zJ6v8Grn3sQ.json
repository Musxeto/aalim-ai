  "title": "The Concepts of Free will and Qadar - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Tina um I'm a pharmacy student and I'm a Hindu Dr Zak I just want to ask you're from India I'm not so sure whether you're familiar with this um practice in among Indians you know um regarding this leaf that you go and consult uh someone and if you manage to find your Leaf based on champain that and other things like that your whole life your name parents' name uh past future what's going to happen is all WR in that leaf I don't know whether this is a practice of Hinduism or is something made by the temples or people and if so if everything is already written how is it comparing Hinduism or maybe this practice with Islam um faith and free will thank you [Applause] the sister posed a question that there may be certain practices in India about picking up Leaf which mentions about your future there are different types of practices it may not be part of the scripture but there are different different types mainly talking about the future jotish know go to jotish to a fortune teller go to a fortune teller different types you see on the streets there are many cards kept and a pirate goes and picks up a card and and then they read and that talks about the future you go to a machine put your date of birth and the Machine tells you something now based on this based on this you go it's very common and people make a fast Buck out of it I'll first tell you about it there was a psychologist in States who taught a class of 100 students and at the end of a week he said I will tell you about your past to each student and he wrote to each student separately he gave them a CH he said don't open you open together and after you open you tell me how accurate was I in my talking about your past so all the students open and 95% of the students they said that the professor was more than 90% correct 5% said that he was 80% correct the key to it was the professor wrote the same thing for everyone for example you go to a machine and give a birth date and the Machine tell you something bad is going to happen in the next 10 days even if 100 good things happen something bad will happen the next person the machine will say that something good is going to happen even if 100 bad things happen something good will happen so most of these things talking about the future it a big fast sorry I just wanted to say because like my family it's a thing to do this so my leaf was found and they they read it so things in it like I course you know science student try to think logically rational whether it's possible because sometimes when some things they say for example this is your mother's name they got it correct this is your father's name they got it correct and I think it's in Sanskrit so it's like you have to believe entirely what the guy is saying because you can't check it yourself whether it's right or wrong at uh I think I was 16 when I read it so they said the age where you read it was 16 there still like maybe out of 10 things eight things it got correct and it's like sometimes I try to think how do they do this and it seems a lot of people also come so it's like this logic and the Fate it's like a it's there's a fight there which should I believe I'll just come to sister let me complete my answer that will cover your question also as I was saying that most of the people that do is a big fast it's a big gimmick just to make fast money what Quran says which I mentioned in my talk 5 vers number 90 believe most certainly intoxic dedication of stone div of arrows these are sator abstain from the handw that may Prosper here Quran says alcohol gambling fortune telling and dedication of stone fortune telling is same these are Sint handywork abstain from it that you may Prosper Quran does not say that no one can predict the future F see many Muslims don't realize what the Quran says alcohol gambling fortune telling dedication of stones these are Satan hand they work abstain from it Quran does not say no one can predict the future but most of the people who predict the future they are just doing a gimmick to make fast money out of it based on the Quran and the Hadith we come to know that there are Hadith of the Prophet malli wasallam that there are jins who listen and they pass on the message to certain people we as Muslims should not be involved in it it is prohibited but that does not mean no one can predict the future most of the people who claim are all wrong but there may be certain human beings who can predict the future but we as human beings should not indulge in it whether it's right or wrong it will be bad for us so based on this the Quran says you should not indulge in it Quran does not say you cannot there are many people who talk about palm reading and there are times when some people are 50% correct some people are 70% correct if you put heads or tails 50% will be right sister know heads or tails 50% will'll be right so some people do it just by chance there may be few maybe a very small percentage who may have the art of knowing about the past that is mentioned in the of prophet but we as Muslims should not indulge in it we should not indulge in Black Magic we should not indulge in fortune telling why it will cause does harm so in this context sister we as Muslims are not allowed there may be a very small percentage which may tell quite a major portion of your past or of your future a very small portion but we as Muslims are not allowed to indulge in it that's a commandment like how we are not allowed to have alcohol we aren't allowed to gamble so indulging in it is not good it is prohibited the same thing I'll tell you that as a human being if if you agree that Quran is the word of God the Quran does not allow a human being to indulge in it it will be nothing but loss in the long run for you hope that answer the question s now I mean like now once I've already seen it I rather would have not seen it but because now you know it and then it's stuck here it's a bit difficult sometimes when you want to just believe in faith or fee will and then in this context do you believe that uh we can still practice free will or is on fate uh sister asked a question that if you know what is happening then can you practice Free Will as I told you there's no one who can say who can 100% talk about the future so even if you like you said out of 10 things eight are coming correct you may never know the thing which hasn't come correct yet will come correct or not so you yourself said % correct so it may come may not so it's in the Free Will as far as Islam is concerned Islam we have to believe in destiny that is it's one of the pillars of IM that we Muslims should believe in in Destiny I will tell you what is Destiny as far as Islam is concerned that is clearly mentioned in the Quran that Allah subhana waa when a child is born the f is worn on the neck mention in the Quran everything what you're going to do Allah knows but that does not interfere with your free will Allah has given a free will for example if a teacher is teaching in a classroom for one year just before the final examination the teacher predicts that this student he will get first class he'll come out first in the class this student he'll get second class this student he will fail it's just an example brother don't feel bad now when the examination takes place after the results out this student comes out first class first he gets second class this student fails now can the student who failed tell the teacher because the teacher predicted I will fail therefore I failed can you blame the teacher yes or no no why because the teacher knew this intelligent used to do his homework used to attend the class throughout the year this stent average this to go for movies play hookie buang school so teacher predicted same way Allah subhah wa ta'ala is now the difference between the teacher and Allah the teacher the human being can make a mistake can be right 99% but not 100% always Allah has G he has knowledge of the future but he has given you a free will for example you come at a crossroad there's Road 1 2 3 4 you can choose any you choose Road two so Allah knows in advance on this particular date on the 29th of September you will come at a crossroad you will choose Road two it is not because Allah has men shed you will choose road to your choosing it is because you will be choosing Allah Road in advance for example after you pass standard 12th or a levels you can either become a doctor or engineer you choose to become a doctor so Allah knows in advance that after you pass your A Levels you will choose to become a doctor choice is yours not because Allah has written you have become a doctor because you have chosen Allah wrote in advance now once you have come at a crossroad 1 2 3 4 You have taken Road two you come at another Crossroad a b CDE e you choose Road D Allah knows in advance that when you come at the next Crossroad you will choose Road D so it is because you will be choosing Allah Road otherwise people will say it's mentioned my I will commit murder I committed murder who's to blame Allah is to blame not me if it mentioned my destiny I'm going to Rob Rob who to blame Allah is to blame Allah gave you the option that after you finish your college you can either Rob or earn by doing hard work you choose to Rob so Allah knows after you finish your college you could do hard work or you could rob you choose to Rob so you can't blame Allah Allah knows in advance Allah so there is something like Destiny in Islam but Allah has given us a free will Allah has given the free will we are responsible other then where is the test and Allah says in the Quran in Surah mul chapter number 67 verse number two it's Allah who has created death and life to test which of you good and deeds this life sister is the test for the Hereafter so that's the reason Islam say don't indulge in fortune telling about the future now as you're saying something is always clicking here so you may think that he may have told you okay at the age of 30 you'll die so you may be thinking I'm going to die you may not die so what if you have done a mistake forget it sister take it out you lead your normal life try and find out which is the truth what you have to do sister do a research do a search of various religious scriptures which is the true scripture that will give you Serenity calmness Peace of Mind read that scripture follow it and forget what the fortune Del has told you even if it comes out to be right no problem you do what you feel is right based on your research that how to lead a life so this Quran sister is the last and final guidance given by almighty God to humanity it's not meant only for the Muslims or the Arabs or the Mal it's meant for the whole of humanity and if you read this book inshallah you would get peace of mind I request the volunteer to gift you a copy of the English translation of the Quran you read it inshallah it will give you peace of mind thank you answer the question thank you"
