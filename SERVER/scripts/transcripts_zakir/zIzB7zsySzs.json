  "title": "Reply to Critics who say that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) Wrote the Quran and Attributed it to God...",
  "transcript": "there are some critics who say that maybe the prophet attributed the quran though he was the author because he wanted fame status glory as well as leadership according to michael hart he writes in his book the 100 most influential persons in the history of humankind and he analyzes all the human beings from adam peace be upon him till the present time and undisputedly he puts prophet muhammad peace be upon him as number one as being the most influential person in the history of humankind so if you wanted to become a leader he didn't have to claim that the quran was from god if he actually was the author and michael h hart he gives reasons for each person why did he give him number one number two number three etc and at the end of the biography says that it was the indisputable secular and religious influence of prophet muhammad peace be upon him that makes him the undisputable number one person to have the most influence in human history prophet muhammed peace be upon him if he wanted glory fame power leadership he was so eloquent he had all the qualities he did not have to falsely attribute the quran to almighty god he had all the abilities and if we analyze logically any person who wants power glory leadership fame status along with him is attached good food fancy clothes magnificent places monumental palaces guards etc but if we see the lifestyle of prophet muhammed peace be upon him he mend his own clothes he repaired his own shoes he made the goat and he did his own household work he sat on the floor and ate when he went to the marketplace he didn't have any colorful guards he was an example of simplicity and humbleness and anyone who invited him even the poor people is to accept their invitation and used to eat whatever was served to him so much so that his enemies they pass a remark which is mentioned in the quran in surat alba chapter number 9 verse number 61 oh he listens to everyone his enemies they were angry what kind of a person is this he listens to each and every one even the poor people and there are many instances and occasions which are recorded in history and in hadith and one such instances there were a representative from the pagan arabs by the name of aduba and he comes to the prophet and says that we will give you all the bills in arabia make you the richest man of arabia we will even make you the leader if you want will make you the king only thing we want from you is that you should stop spreading this message that there is one god if the prophet wanted leadership if you wanted to become the king he would have accepted this offer very easy there are several examples we have the example that when the pagan arabs they told his uncle abu talib that ask and if you to give the message of universal brotherhood of the oneness of god he replies to his uncle that even if they put the sun in my right hand and the moon in my left hand i will not stop my mission i will not stop spreading this message until the day i die or whatever levels there was a time when his son ibrahim he died and it coincided with an eclipse so immediately people said ah this is a sign from god the sun is moaning because a person has died the son of muhammad peace be upon him immediately the prophet replied and he said that the sun and the moon they are signs of allah they do not eclipse because of the birth or the death of a human being if he wanted fame and power it was a very good approach he could have said yes because my son died we see the heavens are moaning they didn't do that because it's a truthful person"
