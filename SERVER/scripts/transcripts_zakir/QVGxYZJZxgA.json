  "title": "Is Wishing Merry Christmas or taking part in the Celebration of Christmas Permissible? â€“ Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "the first question on the whatsapp is from fidos sheikh a marketing executive from new york usa is it permissible to wish our christian friends merry christmas a similar question is posed by khasija soleman she is a university student from london uk can we accept food or gifts from our christian friends on the occasion of christmas a similar question is posed by sultan khan from toronto canada even though we know celebrating christmas is wrong can we politely wish our christian friends compliments of the season or happy days in our heart we disagree with them but to maintain the friendship can we say good words to them the basic question asked is that can a muslim wish their christian friends merry christmas or can they exchange food and gifts on the occasion of christmas or knowing it is wrong can we politely say some kind words or can we say happy season or complements of the season is it permissible as far as wishing non-muslims on the festivals most of the non-muslim festivals they involve either shirk or they involve things which are not permitted in our sharia so most of the festivals since they involve shirk or things which are prohibited in asharia but naturally wishing them on things which is wrong is prohibited in islam allah says in the words quran in surah maidah chapter number five verse number two that help one another in bir and taqwa in virtue in righteousness and good deeds we should help each other and the worst continuous but do not help one another in sin and transgression so we cannot help one another whether it be muslims or non-muslims in things which are prohibited in things which are sins allah further says in the quran's quran in surah for khan chapter number 25 verse number 72 that those who do not witness things which are false or do not witness falsehood so here allah says in the quran that the two believers the moment they do not witness falsehood so when we wish a non-muslim in the festivals which is against the sharia but natural we are agreeing to things which are wrong and we are saying that what they are doing is right it is like we know very well that most of the festivals involve shirk and especially christmas so when we wish someone merry christmas what are we saying is that we are congratulating them for the festival of christmas and christmas is a festival which the christians believe that jesus christ peace be upon him who they consider to be god or the son of god was born on the 25th of december and they celebrate christmas as the birthday of their god now when we wish them merry christmas what are we doing we are actually congratulating them on the shirk and giving shahada and bearing witness knows bella that allah was born on the 25th of december so we are actually taking part in the shirk and allah clearly mentions in the glorious quran in surah for quran chapter number 25 verse number 72 that they do not witness falsehood allah says in so reminded chapter five number two that do not help one another in sin and transgression so when we wish them merry christmas we are giving shahada we are bearing witness that knows bella allah begot a son on the 25th of december or knows billah allah was born on the 25th of december both of these things are absolutely against the teaching of islam allah says in the quran in surah maryam chapter number 19 verse number 88-92 and they say allah most gracious has begotten the son indeed they've put forth a thing most monstrous that anyone who says that allah has begotten a son it is the biggest abuser as though the skies are ready to burst open the earth to spit asunder what the kirinjibal and the mountains to fall down to utter ruin if anyone say that allah has begotten a son if the sky had feelings it would have burst open the mountain would have fallen down to utter ruin and imagine we muslims who claim to be believing in one allah believing in against shirk if we wish them merry christmas we are giving shahada that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has begotten a son on the 25th of december it is the beginning that's the reason all almost all the classical scholars the medieval scholars they said it is haram according to islam yeah he says that wishing the non-muslims on the festival is prohibited even exchanging food or wearing their clothes or bathing or using firework on the festivals of the non-muslims it is prohibited we cannot even take part in the celebrations we cannot even wish them on the days and shaykh islamic nation is very clear that all these things are haram and it is prohibited in islam according to may allah mercy on him he says that wishing the non-muslims on the festivals most of which involve shirk and things which haram is totally prohibited in islam it is like wishing them for example someone does adultery and you're saying good you have an adultery someone drink alcohol and you're saying good you have drunk alcohol these are sins so when you wish them in the festival you are agreeing with them that what they are doing is right and it is totally prohibited so almost all the scholars that you find the classical and the medieval scholars they say it is prohibited today you may find some scholars who may say it is permissible because there is no text in the quran which prohibits greeting them or exchanging gifts etc but this is only in small number and they are not following the classical scholars so according to me i do agree with circle islamic nathemia and milikayum and most of the majority scholars that wishing non-muslims during the festival is prohibited and if you read that almost all the classical scholars have prohibited so according to me wishing the christians merry christmas is prohibited even saying to them good words because you want to be polite to them or saying compliment of the season or saying have a happy day wishing good things for the non-muslims worldly things it is permitted there is no problem at all but specifically picking on the days of the festival and wishing them on this festival this is not permitted because you are going out of the way to wish them on the festival that means you are encouraging the festival and you're agreeing with the festival which is prohibited otherwise wishing good things for the non-muslims good health when they have wealth it's all permitted normally but specifically wishing them on the festival is actually encouraging them and according to me and according to majority of the scholars this is prohibited taking part in the celebration or exchanging gifts or wearing good clothes is prohibited i would go a step further and say that we have many of the muslims who are businessmen who try and do more business during the festivals of the non-muslims and they have a christmas sale then they have a diwali sale thinking they'll do more business according to me even this is prohibited the moment it's a christmas sale that means agreeing with christmas that means you agree that allah knows bella begotten son on the 25th of december you're agreeing that allah was born on 25th or december knows billah so for a muslim to wish the non-muslims on the festival or to take part in the festival or exchange gifts or even try and do more business taking advantage of the festival and saying we are having a christmas sale it is not permitted and it is not correct according to the sharia there may be certain non-muslims who may not understand and who may feel offended and i give the reply that in our festivals we don't force any of the non-muslims that they should follow a festival imagine if a hindu who is a vegetarian i would not expect him to come and wish me during bhakra eid or idol to wish me happy eat because he doesn't believe in eating goat eating meat eating beef so i would not be offended if he does not come and wish me happy yudhlada imagine if i tell all the hindus even though you are a vegetarian which many are you should come and wish me on either other they should offend it how can they wish me on idol and we know that in either other we sacrifice the goat or we sacrifice a cow and this they think is wrong so i respect their views so similarly a non-muslim should respect my views i expect the christian to respect my views now the question comes that if a christian comes and wishes you you cannot reply suppose you say merry christmas you cannot reply merry christmas or same to you this is also prohibited what you can do is best is to keep silent the best is if you know comparative religion if you have seen my lectures replying with ikma is the best but if you don't know any reply the best is to keep silent or you can say that may peace be on you or you can wish them may allah give you hidayah that is the best wishing hidayah for the non-muslim is the best dua you can do to them but if a non-muslim comes and wishes me merry christmas i will ask him that why are you celebrating this christmas so he will tell me that christmas is the birthday of jesus christ peace be upon him so i will ask him does the bible say that jesus christ peace be upon him was born on the 25th of december and the answer is no nowhere does the bible say that jesus christ peace be upon him was born on the 25th of december this 25th of december is the birthday of the pagan gods previously the pagan gods before the birth of jesus christ peace be upon him in the greek philosophy and in many other mythologies they believed this was the birthday of their god some believed it was the birthday of sun god and in different mythologies in different philosophies this was a common date 25th of december so the christians to make it easily acceptable by the people of that time they started saying that jesus christ peace be upon him was born and ready for december in fact if you read the bible it says that mary melania mercy on her who was the mother of jesus christ peace be upon him when she was pregnant and she was asked to shake the tree dead cell and we know that dates don't appear during winter so from this we come to know that when jesus christ peace be upon him was born it was not winter it was summer so for sure jesus christ peace be upon him was not born in december neither on 25th or december so when a christian asked me i will start doing the word to him and i will say who is the jesus christ peace be upon him you will try to tell me that jesus christ peace be upon him is almighty god so i will tell him that can you point out a single unequivocal statement from your bible anywhere from your bible when jesus christ peace be upon him himself says that he is god or where he says worship me and if you know your dhawa very well you can continue and you can prove so during these occasions if you are well versed with comparative religion you can take this opportunity for calling them towards islam in no way can you agree with what they're doing is right allah clearly says in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 was 110 the worst i started the session with allah says the best of people evolve from mankind the reason allah calls us the hieroma the best of people is because we enjoying what is good and we forbid what is wrong and we believe in allah we are called the khira um the best of people because we are supposed to enjoy what is good and forbidden is wrong so here we have to call them to the truth of sahih and forbid them from doing wrong you cannot enjoy what is wrong you cannot wish them on the festivals which is against the teaching of islam what you have to do is call them to tahit and do dawah to them and you can surely watch my video cassettes on similarities with some christianity on was jewish peace be upon him crucified is jesus god and various cassettes which will give you information on how you can convey the message of islam to the christians during this festival of this hope thanks for the question"
