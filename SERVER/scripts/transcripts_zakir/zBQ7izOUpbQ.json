  "title": "You gave an Excellent Exposition of the Quran and Islam. Then what is the difference between Islam..",
  "transcript": "I'm a lawyer a historian and also a theologian you gave a very excellent exposition of the Quran and Islam but Judaism Christianity and Islam are all abrahamic faiths a Jew could have said the same thing or there's almost the same things have you said by cutting the Quran sorry it's called recording the the Torah and the talmud a Christian could have said almost everything you said by cutting both the Old Testament and the New Testament and I do not know whether we should be trying to say one religion is Superior or more truthful than another and if we do go down that line what does that lead to that's what led to the Crusades Etc thing you mentioned about Justice and peace of course the Christian Bible mentions more that more of this is about Justice and peace than they are about the Holy Holy Spirit and of course Christians were pacifists until 313 when so what is the difference between what you are saying and Judaism and Christianity and what would that lead to but after me good question and I do agree with him that if you read the books of Judaism the books of Christianity you will find verses of Peace never in my lecture ever did I say that any religion is against peace or any religion is in favor of terrorism I always said all religions are against terrorism what I made one statement in my speech that the verse of the Quran chapter 5 verse number 32 this verse which is so emphatic I do not find a similar verse in any other scripture because I'm a student of comparative religion saying that if you kill one innocent human being it is as though you have killed the whole of humanity and if you save one innocent human being it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity it was only one verse so that generally I do agree that most of the religions almost all they speak about peace that's the reason Jesus Christ peace be upon him if you read the Gospel of Luke chapter number 24 verse number 36 when he goes to the upper room he says when which is Apostles shall which means same peace be upon you in Hebrew so the greetings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him too when he met the people of ashalamualaikum which meant same in Arabic assalamu alaikum may peace be on you regarding you saying that one religion superior to the other religion I believe almighty God sent only one religion he has not sent different religions what the Quran says he has made human beings into different tribes different colors different languages so that they may recognize each other not they might despise each other the only religion that God has sent to all his Messengers whether it be Moses whether it be Jesus peace be upon Him Moses peace be upon Him Mohammed peace be over it was to submit the will to almighty God I believe all these Messengers right from Adam Noah Moses Jesus Muhammad peace be upon them all all of them bought the same message that believe in one God and worship him alone and only him and submit your will to that almighty God hope that answers the question [Applause] thank you"
