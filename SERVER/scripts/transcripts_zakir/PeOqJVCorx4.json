  "title": "Can a Muslim have an Account in an Interest Based Bank? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "following on from the uh first question regarding riba is it permissible for a Muslim to put his Savings in an interest or rebber bearing account or bank for safety purposes if he or she pays the interest that he earns out in charcy most of the scholars they say that if under compulsion especially if you're a non-muslim country and for safety reason you can keep your money in the interest based conventional bank but whatever interest you get you have to give in charity without seeking the reward of Allah because it's Haram most of the scholars say that but I personally I disagree with them that's my view I agree more with the view of shi he says that even this is prohibited because the Quran does not say do not use interest if the Quran would have said do not utilize do not use interest then the verdict was right the Quran said don't involve in don't take don't give so if you have to give in charity first have take from the bank so disagree with that if you have to stop the system of RBA you have to totally ban this system we can't say they put for safety and then I'll take the money and give onchy indirectly you're encouraging them because the moment you open an account which has got interest you sign in and giving them permission that you're agreeing with interest with that itself is a sin Allah's curse will be on you Allah will war against you because I ask this question and I say to these people who say that you can't put in the bank and give in charity that suppose I deal in drugs in cocaine in brown sugar and suppose I invest a million dollars every month I make a profit of million dollar and the complete Prophet I give in charity to the poor people when is it allowed is said no it's Haram I said why because dealing in drugs cocaine brown sugar is Haram so when dealing in drugs cocaine brown sugar is Haram riba is a bigger Haram because if you deal in RBA Allah and hiso will wage a water against you so when you're giving me permission to keep in the bank and deal with RBA for a bigger sin surely you should give me permission for a smaller sin therefore I agree that if they really want to keep for safety they can very well keep in an Islamic Bank or as a last result they can keep in a current account there are some accounts in the bank which are accounts which don't give interest they call this current account there's no interest at all in that that as a last isort you can keep but only keep that money which is required for only because I know that being in different countries like in India in UK you have to deal with checks Etc so if you're a businessman keep only that much amount which is required for Rolling otherwise you can invest it in property in real estate in stocks whatever it is and the least if you want for security you can take a locker and keep hard cash in the bank I know it's foolish but yet it is better than involving inba at least you'll be safe from Allah and his they'll w war against you as a last result thought if you really want to new security take a locker which will cost just a few hundred rupees a month or a couple of thousand rupees a year and a few pounds if you go to UK take that Locker keep your money Hard Cash declare to the government no problem but keep hard cash if you really want security but taking RBA and even giving in charity because encouraging the system of RBA I consider that to be Haram okay I mean in the UK alhamdulillah we do have a few Banks now coming up by the way so may Allah subhana wa tala help us to encourage those organizations to do non-interest Allah May these organization be on the straight path a mean that they're truly interest free inshallah inshallah"
