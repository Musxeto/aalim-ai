  "title": "Spitting out Water after Mouth Washing during Fast - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "should a person spit having rinsed or washed his mouth out generally or after making wood normally when people fast there are some people who think that after you goggle your mouth with water or your mouth with water then they should spit out because you know maybe some water will be swallowed but the general ruling is that most of the scholars agree that once you gagle them out and after expulsion of the water from the mouth there's no need to spit it's not a requirement and even those few Scholars who say you should spit it's only once but there are some people who spit several times some people even take a cloth and they dry their mouth you know after gaggling thinking that the water will you know go into the stomach which is absurd because normally when we see and we read the SE of the prophet and the LIF of the sahabas many of times when they drank water just before fa before beginning the fast when they heard the F aan they stopped drinking but we have never heard of any SAA spitting out after drinking water if you have to spit while gaggling the people when they have water just before starting the fast at the end of the S when they heard the aan surely some had would have said that the sahabas they spat you know so that the water doesn't go into which is not seen and while doing woodoo when you gagle the mouth runs mouth and you expel the water that's it even if you want to spit maximum I think once is sufficient you can't go beyond that spitting several times and you know taking a cloth and drying your mouth everything else that remains can be counted as part of the saliva there's no problem at all you can't make life difficult for you"
