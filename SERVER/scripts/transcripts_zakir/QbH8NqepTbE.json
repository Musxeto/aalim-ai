  "transcript": "the topic I have chosen for this morning's talk is if the label shows your intent wear it it is rather an unusual topic people may wonder that what has the label got to do with Islam or the Muslims people are rather curious that what what will be the content of this talk it's rather an unusual topic I start my talk by quoting a verse from the Glorious Quran from Surah Anam chapter number six verse number 54 we say and when those come to thee who believe in our signs tell peace be on you it means that whenever a moment whenever a Muslim comes to you you should sayum may peace be on you it's compulsory that whenever a Muslim meets another Muslim whenever a m meets another M he should sayam alayum may peace be on you it's compacity the other verse I quoted was from Surah chapter number four verse number 86 which says which means that when a courteous greeting is offered to you meet it with a greeting still more or at least the same and Allah is careful in keeping accounts of all things that means whenever any person greets you you should greet him with a greeting which is more courteous or at least of equal courtesy it's compulsory for example if suppose someone wishes you assalam allum you should wish back if someone says you should wish back may peace mercy and blessings of Allah subhana wa ta'ala be on all of you or if someone says assalamu alaykum you can even reply the words are the same but it is coming from within within the heart from the depths of the heart from the bottom of the heart the words are the same but it is still a more courteous greeting or if someone says and if you cannot improve on that at least say minimum of equal courtesy but there are many Muslims who own companies who have got various employees under them and when the employees when they wish them assalam alayum they either nod or they murmur waum Salam some even don't care to reply these Muslims they are going against the Commandment of Allah subhana wa ta'ala in the Glorious Quran in Surah 4 ver 86 it says you should wish back more courteously or at least wish back with equal courtesy he greed back the person with equal courtesy it's minimum"
