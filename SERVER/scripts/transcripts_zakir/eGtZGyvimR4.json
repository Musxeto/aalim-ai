  "transcript": "so Arkham my name is Imran Mohammed I'm nineteen manager my question is regarding the media and conspiracy theories how should the Muslim respond to conspiracy theories such as America is trying to take over the world suppressing Islam etc etc all too often I'm finding Muslims who are not educated in Islam correctly dive into the conspiracy theories more than the knowledge that we should be acquiring how should the Muslim respond to seek conspiracy theories the brother has asked the question that how should a Muslim respond to the conspiracy theory by the American etc against Islam and we don't have our own knowledge what should we do but other the first thing we should do is we should know our team unfortunately most of the Muslim do not know their own religion that's the reason we end this problem if we know Dean very well this media would not have a chance to say what it's saying unfortunately we ourselves don't know of a team and that's the reason when the media says many things the Muslims become apologetic we tend to agree I'll just do an example there is a very good pious Muslim masha'Allah he comes and does me but the socket do you know these Taliban's they are very ruthless people bad people I said why what happened because they beat the woman and who told you I started with my own eyes Mary do you see he's ordered BBC say I'm not here to defend the Taliban they are not my friends neither are they enemies I haven't met them I'm never defend them but when I keep on traveling and meet people I was in Malaysia giving a talk and there was a couple both of them were doctors know the gynecologist and a pediatrician both of them are doctors they spend more than a month in Afghanistan trying to help the injured people and that's lady doctor she told me the shot they show on the television italia by hitting the woman they an Taliban and how do you know sit see because I've been with the Taliban's I know how they tied the turban for example we has non Arab we will not find a difference between the way the lateral side of the Arabs but Arab knows that the way and emirati ties Osetra is different the way us all the time the veteran is different the way a Kuwaiti ties is different they know we don't know so she being with Taliban she knows that the way the turban is tied in that shot it can be a Taliban so even the shooting that did in Hollywood where they did I don't know the ring no good job the media can change anything for example if ask you that how will George Bush is it good or bad you will say is not good for example I will chop off the knot and resound George Bush is good when I show you your own recording yourself by slip of the tongue I said he's good actually you didn't say that you said is not good I chopped off the knot I show you see this is brother you have said is good so you will say Oh gain it was suppose it wasn't slip of the tongue you wanted to say is not good I chopped off the knot and it sounds like he's good so this is the media play escape so we as Muslims what we should do that we should know our religion very well we should know Adam very well and when anyone deploys we should not be swayed by how they portray Islam and to judge Islam we should go to the authentic sources the Quran is a hadith we should not look at what which means do avoid the Muslim society does to judge Islam I'm not gonna judge is some by what the people in India are doing or Pakistan or Taliban asaji I am going to judge Islam based on authentic sources the Quran and the Sahadi so this strategy we use and when the media portrays something we should know how to turn the tables over see not the person who knows to question he only has one question why have you got the first answer only was the thing he didn't expect he didn't expect me to say that I'm proud of my country he thought I will say I'm not proud of my country I am really proud of my country not that I'm telling a lie I'm proud of India and that is a battlefield where a Mujahid jihad they are me striving you know by my name knife in Sanskrit nag means a warrior a hero so by name I'm a Mujahid to be in the battlefield I have to do my job therefore I want to live in Mumbai people said come here come there people are giving me they're giving me a first to stay in different countries your life is in danger I have to be in the battlefield that's my battlefield I love my country for many reasons for many reasons hamdulillah and I'm proud of that so therefore a Muslim should be trained in the medium in the reply to turn the tables over hope dancers question [Music] [Applause]"
