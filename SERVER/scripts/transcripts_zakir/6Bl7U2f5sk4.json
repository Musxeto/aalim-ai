  "transcript": "before we take questions from the viewers i already received a lot of questions on a topic i thought i would spend the major portion of this session on giving a talk on the first 10 days of zilajja it will answer most of the question asked and even answer those questions which are not asked that would be better rather than taking questions on this topic so inshallah the first part of the program of my program the major portion would be dedicated to a talk on the first 10 days of the ledger i've divided this talk into four sections the first is importance of the first ten days of the elijah the second is the important acts and deeds to be done during the first ending of the elijah the third is the virtue of arafah and the fourth is first we'll discuss the importance of the first 10 days of the ledger this is a forgotten sunnah of a beloved partner you may have sinned all year you may have missed doing good deeds in the month of ramadan you may have missed the last 10 nights of ramadan you may have missed doing good deeds doing ladies this is the opportunity make the best of it the first 10 days of the religion even if you have not sinned the whole year maybe you did some innocence maybe you did ibadah in the month of ramadan even you might have got the last 10 nights of ramadan even you might have prayed the full night of life other yet you cannot afford as a muslim the opportunity during the first ten days of the rija most of us muslims we are normally aware of the importance of ramadan and we prepare ourselves and i remember when i was a kid more than 30 years back when i was in school about 45 years back we used to prepare ourselves for none and we knew the importance of ramadan even off the last 10 nights of ramadan but we never heard about the importance of the first 10 days of the rija alhamdulillah now since social media has started this is being discussed by the speaker that my time when i was a kid when i was in school when i just entered college we never heard the speaker speaking about the importance of 10 days of the richard i remember the first time i heard was maybe about 15 years back in the social media when we got involved in the field of dhawa more than 25 30 years back that's the time we came to know about the importance of the first ending of religion and it was about 15 years back that the first time i heard in the social media a speaker speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of the raja and alhamdulillah year by year it's increasing and more and more people are speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of the winter that is the reason i thought i will dedicate the major portion of this session today to the first end of the elijah allah takes an oath in surah chapter number 89 verse number 1 to 2 allah says by fajr by dawn by the ten nights and the mufassirin they say these ten nights that allah is taking oath of refers to the first 10 days of the religion and in many languages when you speak about the days that include the night when you speak about the night it includes the day for example if i say in english i spend 10 days in london but naturally it includes i've spent 10 days and 10 nights in london depending upon the context it may include the full day it may include part of the day it may include the night it may not include similarly when allah when in arabic when the nights are referred to it may refer to the night only it may refer to the night and they put together or it may refer to the day only in this surah al-fajr surah number 89 verse number one to two when allah says wal-fajar walaya lin asher by dawn by the ten knights the mufassirin say and it's also mentioned in volume number eight page number 413 and if you refer to the summarized version printed the english translation by madara salaam it is volume number 10 page number 468. if niko said and minimum facility say that these 10 nights refer to the first 10 days of the ledger and they agree that these first 10 days of dulija are better than all the other days of the year it's even better than the last 10 days of ramadan but it's mentioned rebellion volume number five page number 412 that though the first ten days of the lijja at the best days of the full year the last 10 nights of ramadan are the best nights of the year the scholars differ some scholars few do say that the first ten days of the are better than the last 10 nights of ramadan there are few scholars who say the last 10 nights are better than the first lenders of the religion but the right opinion and the correct opinion is she called islam and he rightly said that the first 10 days of dulija are the best days in the full year it is even better than the last 10 days of ramadan but the last 10 nights of ramadan they are the best nights in the full year because it has the qatar it is the best night in the full year so the last 10 nights of ramadan are the best nights because it is and amongst the days in the full year the first 10 days of dulija are the best days in the year because it has the yamal arafa the day of arafah the second place where the quran refers to the first lands of the lija is in surah al-hajj chapter number 22 verse number 28 allah says that they witness the benefits which have been provided and they celebrate the name of allah through the days appointed here these days are referring to the first 10 days of the religion may allah have mercy on him he writes in futhal bari that these first 10 days of zolajir are the only 10 days in the full year where any muslim can simultaneously perform all the five pillars all the five hundred of islam if he wants to yes he can implement on the mahid he can offer salah some it finishes together in the first 10 days he can give zakat if he hasn't given or give obligated charity or give extra charity he then fast and he can also perform hajj these are the only days in the full year where a person can simultaneously perform all the five pillars of islam it is mentioned in say bihari volume number two hadith number nine six nine ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him he said that the beloved prophet muslim said there are no good deeds done on any other day better than done during the first 10 days of the rija done during these days and the sahabas the companion they asked not even jihad and the prophet replied not even jihad unless a person puts in danger his life and wealth in the way of allah and does not return with any that means he goes for jihad and he's martyred in the way of allah that means a beloved prophet muslim said the good deeds done during the first 10 days of the are better than any deed done on any other days of the year including jihad unless if the person is martyred and he loses his wealth and life during jihad that's the only one good deed which cannot be better otherwise the deeds done on the first day of the legion are better than any deed than on any other day of the year and the same message is repeated in al dharami hadith number 1925 where it's mentioned abner boss may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet peace be upon him said that no deeds done are better our more precious are more important than the deeds done on your arafa and the companion asked not even jihad and the prophet said not even jihad unless a person goes out in the way of allah with his life and wealth and does not return with any that means he is martyred in the republic so this same message is repeated again in another say hadith that the deeds done on the first 10 days of duluth are better than any deed done on any other day of the year except a person who is martyred in the way of allah while doing jihad it is so important and unfortunately this sunnah of doing good deeds during the first ten days of dhulijah is forgotten it's further mentioned in sahih muslim point number three hadith number 2747 when the prophet asked regarding fasting on normal arafah the prophet said it expiates the sins of the previous year and the coming year that means the most important fast after the further fast of ramadan is fasting on your alpha it is the most it expects your sins of the previous year as well as the coming year there are some scholars who say that the fasting of ashura the tenth of maram is the most important because there's a hadith that the most important fast after the first part is the fasting on yamalashara but the different opinion but the correct opinion is that your arafat fasting is far superior because it expedites the sins of the previous year and the following year whereas fasting on ashura expedites only the sins of the previous year but there's unanimous agreement that these two fast of your arafah and fasting on ashura are the two most important fast after the fasting of the month of ramadan it's mentioned in sunnah 2437 that the wives of the prophet said that the messenger of allah fasted during the first nine days of the rija and during ashura and three days every month the first monday and two thursdays so from this hadith we come to know that the prophet fasted the first nine days of the raja that means it is highly recommended to fast on all the first nine days of the luja one mask why not fast all the tenders of the ninja nan said is given in say buhari vomiting 3 hadith number 1991 where the beloved prophet said that he forbade fasting on israel fitter and because these are the two eids of celebration of eating and drinking so it is prohibited to fast on the two either end either and either other that is the reason we don't have to fast the first 10 days of zhouluja though the first 10 days are the most important days of the year we only fall during the first nine days of the lecture it's further mentioned inside muslim volume number three hadith number two six seven nine the beloved prophet muslim said that no one shall enter paradise except a believer and the days of meena are the days of eating and drinking that means a muslim should not even fast on your yamutashri the three days following the idol that is the 11th 12th and 13th of the lodge because these are the days of eating and drinking and feasting so besides the eighth day a muslim should not even fast on the yamatashiri that is the eleventh twelfth and thirteenth of julia it's mentioned in say muslim volume number five hadith number five one one eight that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that during the first 10 days of the rija a person who has an animal which he has to sacrifice he should not remove his hair not trim his nails based on this hadith a person who is sacrificing an animal has animal and wants to sacrifice on each day or the following three days he should not remove his hair or trim his nails from the first day of delijah until he sacrifices animal this restriction is only for the person who is sacrificing the animal himself if a person has asked somebody else to sacrifice on his behalf then the restriction is not there it's further mentioned in muslim ahmed hadith number 5 446 abdullah bin umar may allah be pleased with him he said that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said the deeds done during the first 10 days of dulija are the most important deeds done in the full year and that's the reason you should say the page number 462 that the virat mentioned there is that allah is the greatest allah is the greatest with them both they used to go out in the market place during the first 10 days of the ridja and loudly they used to recite the takbirat and when the others used to hear him the sabbas they used to repeat on their own that means it is a sunnah during the first 10 days of the rajya to say the loudly in the marketplace i have traveled to so many muslim countries i have never heard in any muslim country muslims saying loudly in the marketplace i have not heard many muslim countries have gone to maybe in some gulf countries there may be people saying but when i travel i have not heard this in the marketplace we should revise this and there's another hadith mentioned in jamaica media he said that the messenger of allah asked do you know the deed which is most loved by allah the deed which is most precious to allah the deed which is more beloved to allah more than giving charity of silver and gold more than going in the battlefield and striking the necks of the enemy more beloved than having your neck truck by the enemy in the battlefield and the sabbah asked which is that deed and the prophet replied zakar of allah now this hadith it is not specifically talking about the first 10 days of the religion it is generally the deed loved most by allah is the quran and the all the other hadith that quoted earlier says that the deeds the good deeds done during the first end of the of the elijah are better than deeds than on any other day so imagine if we do the zakar of allah during the first 10 days of the lijja specially go out in the marketplace and say loudly imagine this it is much better than distributing gold or silver in the marketplace much better than striking the enemy on the neck in the battlefield or being stuck by the enemy on your neck in the battlefield let us revive the sunnah and during these 10 days of the rija recite the sakbara on our own and even in the marketplace and the 10 days of dulija are starting from tomorrow in most of the countries in malaysia where now it is close to 12 midnight the dull ninja has already started the night has started but the day will start approximately 5 or 50 minutes from now inshallah malaysia is one of the few countries where the first 10 days of villager will start and later on the other countries the gulf countries four hours later five hours later so on and so forth so that's the reason i thought it's important for me to speak on this topic so let us decide today that these ten days of the ledger which are starting from tomorrow in most of the countries in some countries it may be one day later india pakistan etc in some countries it may be two days later but most of the countries it is inshallah starting from tomorrow so let us make the most of these first 10 days of the lecture now we will discuss the second point which is the important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days of the ledger i have enumerated 35 important points some people have listed 10 20 30 some more there are hundreds of good deeds you can do to make the list a bit shorter i have enumerated 35 important deeds and acts to be done during the first 10 days of the lecture and whenever i enumerate i try and enumerate the ones which are the first on the top then coming with the highly recommended sunnah and then the other sunnah later on that's my policy and when i repeat the good deeds i also repeat the pharah which are supposed to be done daily because what other farage daily has to be done first then you can talk about the sunnate makhada then you can talk about the sunita gyram so this is the order i follow whenever i list the important acts or deeds to be done so number one the most important act during the first end of the elijah is that you should offer salah in congregation in the mosque all the five daily salah in congregation in a mosque it is a farm especially for the muslim men for the woman there are exceptions and when i'm listing these 35 important points it is for all types of muslim whether you're more practicing muslim whether you're moderate practicing muslim or less practical muslim if you are a less practice muslim you will see to it that you will do as much as these good deeds as possible if you're moderate what you'll do you'll try and do all of these 35 good tips if you're already a practicing muslim then what you'll do you'll see to it that will increase the intensity of other so these days are meant for all the muslims whether less practicing moderate practicing or more practicing if you're less practicing you see to it that you do as much as possible of all the good deeds if you're moderate you see to that you do all the good deeds and increase the intensity if you're already a good practice muslim doing all the pharah's see to that to increase the intensity of the mustahab also do the gere mustap if you're moderate and you're doing the faraz then you do the sunnate if you are a highly practicing muslim then besides the farah and the sun is you do the sunnita germa if you are already doing the sunita garam you increase the intensity so during these two important days one is the first ten is of dilija and the other are the days in the month of ramadan it's very important that you increase the intensity of your ibadah so the first important deed to be done during the first villager is offer salah in congregation all five times in the mosque number two if you have not performed hajj you should perform hajj if it's hard on you if you have the means and if you have the health and the wealth and if you have not performed you should perform much it's the further on you if you have already performed hajj and if you can do it again it is mustabe it is sunnah it is encouraged but we know since last one and a half year we have this pandemic of the karna virus and last year hardly approximately one thousand were permitted to hajj this year alhamdulillah the saudi government has announced they will allow sixty 000 muslims to do hajj out of which 15 000 would be saudi national and the balance 45 000 would be the foreigners who are living in saudi arabia who already have the kama they will not allow any outside people to enter who are not residents of saudi arabia but those who are already residents of saudi arabia they will allow 45 000 people and the receipt to it they'll allow from all the different nationalities depending upon the percentage they're present you paid allah that may he next year solve this problem of the pandemic and again the muslims would be able to do in large numbers inshallah in millions like what we used to do two years before the third important act indeed is that you should abstain from all the haram acts from the major sins as well as the minor sins and if you're a good muslim not doing any major sins alhamdulillah there are some minor sins that muslims normally do unknowingly unknowingly see to it that during this ten days you abstain from all the sins not in the major sins but each and every of the minor sins the fourth is that you should fast during your arafah the ninth and as i mentioned earlier it will expedite your sins of the previous year and the coming year the fifth is fast during all the first nine days of the luja and that is a highly recommended sunnah six is that if you have the means you should sacrifice during yamuna that is either the tenth day of dilijah if you have the means and allah has given you capacity sacrifice an animal on this day the seventh is that say the tasbih that is subhanallah say that that is alhamdulillah say the talib that is and say that much as possible during all the 10 days of the raja we can recite together you can recite this as much as possible throughout the day the eighth is that you should go out in the marketplace and say that loudly so that people are reminded of allah and they also repeat it on their own and the third as i had mentioned earlier as much as possible go out in the marketplace tell to the others remind others to do zika to remember allah it is more savable than distributing gold or silver in the marketplace the ninth is praying the tahajud salah in the last one third of the night and do dua and ask for forgiveness during this last one third of the night in which allah answers the prayer of the maximum the tenth is pray that is there are 12 in which the prophet said if you pray this you will enter jannah and have a house closed to the house of the prophet and the 12th sunnita makada before the fajr salah the two plus two foraka sunnah before the duhar salah two rakat sunnah after the duhar salah the torah sunnah after the maghrib salah and turaka sunnah after the there are total twelve sunate makkada in the full day also offer the salat and the salatu doha is offered approximately when which is the right time he said immediately about 20 minutes after the sunrise till about 10 to 15 minutes before the duha time you can offer the salad anytime between this time you can offer two rakat prophet say two rakat as much as you can but the prophet most of the time you offered for a cat so preferred with foreign the prophet even offered eight rakaat during fatimaka before that but preferable is four rakat which was usually practice of the prophet and the better time to offer the prophet said is when the camel can feel the heat of the sand so it is preferable to offer after the midpoint between the fajr and between the doha this is the better time but you can offer any time 20 minutes after the sunrise and if you offer immediately after sunlight it's called ishraq but the better time is after the midpoint as in the sun of the prophet the twelfth point is that you should do dwa before breaking your fast the thirteenth is do as much as dua throughout the ten days of the dulca and do not miss doing dua during the friday of these 10 days the first 10 days of the religion whenever friday comes whether once or twice see to it that you offer in that one hour after sir sallah before my grip this is an important time one of the prescribed time for doing dua the 14th is do zikr of allah as much as possible throughout the 10 days of the religion point number 15 read the quran and if you don't understand arabic along with arabic read the translation of the quran in the language you understand the best point number 16 ask for forgiveness from allah during these first 10 days of the rija point number 17 give as much as charity as possible besides asaka if you have given your sakat good if you have not seen to it you give it but besides zakat give as much as charity as possible point number 18 do as many good deeds as possible point number 19 do task enough every day during these ten days of the ninja point number 20 recite the masumundwa of the beloved prophet if you have not reciting start reciting in this 10 days if you recite few start reciting more or increase the number of muslim dua for example when you enter the mosque there's a dua when you come out of the mosque there's a dua when you're under the toilet when you come out of the toilet when you were addressed this dua for most of the acts there are duas so see to it you do the muslin duas point number 21 do as many sunnahs of the prophet for example while you drink water seed to it you sit and drink water it is a very important sunnah of the prophet when you wear a footwear see to it do you wear the footwear on the right leg first when you remove the footwear see to it you remove your left leg first when you're into the mask end up with right leg when you exit the moss you enter with the left leg when you enter the toilet enter with the left leg when you exit the toilet you exit the right with the right leg when you are wearing a dress a shirt put your right hand first when removing the shirt remove the left hand first when you're wearing a trouser put the right leg first when you're removing the trouser remove your left leg first these are the various sunnah of the prophet do as many sunnah as you can if you're not doing start doing it if you're doing few do more if you're doing more increase it as much as possible during these 10 days of the region during these first 10 days of dulijah you should see to it that a good deed should increase as compared to the other days of the year it should be more if you are ready for you do us if you are reading only the first started in the sun if reading only soon in the quran start reading from the german if you're reading all these three increase your salah increase your dua increase you're asking for forgiveness 22 read the authentic hadith of the prophet that's i had it you have to say buhari say muslim and this is allah say of al-bani that they had it from abu dhabi from and so forth and there's also a new compilation done by sheikh zaraman azmi of jamaica we've accumulated all the hadees remove the duplicate which is approximately sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six hadith all they say so once you read this you can easily say that you have read all the say irrespective whether it's in bukhari muslim etc without duplicating so it's easier so if you read the java kamil it's a good thing to do point number 23 you should forgive people's fault forgive the faults of others whatever faults that people do around you rather than keeping in your mind or taking a grudge forgive it if you forgive people fault allah will forgive you whether it be of a family member whether it be of your staff whether it be people around you forgive as many faults as possible of the others point number 24 do isla with your other muslims point number 25 do dawah with the non-muslims point number 26 is that you offer sunnate there are total 10 sunnate gyaramo it is 2 raka sunnah after the duhar salah 2 plus 2 for kasuna before the salah 2 raka sunnah before the maghrib salah and 2 raka sunnah if you offer this alhamdulillah during all the 10 days of the religion the 28th point is attend as many lectures and programs and courses of the authentic scholars to increase your knowledge in islam and today being a pandemic if they thought the world attending life program difficult you can go to the next point that the 29 point you can watch the videos the video recording of the authentic scholars and the authentic orators whether it be on a learning management system whether it be on the facebook whether it be on the youtube whether it be on the alidayah whether it be on the peach tv on various social media platforms but see to it that these scholars and orators that are hurting authentic point number 30 here the audio recordings of the authentic scholars and orators you may be in the car and traveling it's a good opportunity while driving you can hear the audio you may be doing some exercise you may be jogging at that time you can hear the lecture and increase your knowledge point number 31 read the seerah the biography of the beloved prophet muslim and one of the good biographies that you can read is the rehab the sealed nectar which is written by sheikh safir and manu barak puri it is one of the best seerah that's available point number 32 spend more time with your family when i spend more time with the family doesn't mean that you go out more with them shopping all the 10 days yes if you want to shop just before eat then buy them good clothes they said no problem but not all 10 days not going for outing when i say spend more time with the family that along with the family you read the quran you read the skill of the prophet at an islamic program authentic scholars and authentic writers watch the video recording of authentic orators on various platforms social media platforms hear the audio together spend time discuss with them talk to them about the good needs to be done in the first 10 days of religion about the sunnah of the prophet read the translation of the quran this time you are doing a venn diagram besides doing the ibadah you're asking your family to devada and the prophet said that the best amongst the muslim is the one who's best with family especially his wife so spend more time with your family and encourage them to come closer to allah point number 30 3 do not waste a single minute during all these first 10 days of the religion our lives 34 be cheerful and happy during all these 4-10 days of the lecture and point number 35 see to it that you behave with the people around you with love affection and care this was in short the 35 important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days of the religion the third point that is the virtue of arafah allah subhanahu wa ta'ala takes a promise in surah chapter number 85 verse number 3 allah says mashud is taking a promise by the witnessing day referring to friday and by the witnessed day referring 85 verse number three is taking an oath of yamal arafa it's mentioned in jamaica remedy volume number six hadith number nine that the beloved prophet salallahu said that mashud that is the witness today or the attended day is your arafah that is the ninth day of the religion and shahood is the witnessing day it refers to friday it's mentioned in muslim ahmad number two hadith number 245 that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that allah took a covenant from the loins of adam on the day of arafah in arafah and it says that he took a covenant from the loins of the children of adam from the descendant and took a covenant and when he bought them from the loins and scattered them like ants on the fields of arafah and then escorted the verse of the quran of chapter number seven was 172 and 173 where it says that allah took a covenant from the loins of children of adam from the descendants and asked them am i not your lord and they replied yes we testify you are our lord and allah continues lest on the day of judgment you will say that you were not mindful that means allah subhanahu wa ta'ala took a covenant from all the children of adam from the loin from all the human beings that am i not your lord and all of them testified yes you are our lord this is mentioned in the quran and surah araf chapter number 7 verse number 172 and 173 that means on yamal arafa allah subhana wa tala took a covenant from all the human beings point number three is that yamul arafa is the day when our deen was completed and allah has fulfilled his favor on the human beings it's mentioned say buhari point number one hadith number 45 that um he narrates that a jew came to him and asked him o chief of the believers there is a verse in your quran which if it was mentioned in our book we would have celebrated it as eid so omar radhilan asked which is the verse and the jew said it's mentioned in your quran and he quotes so remind the chapter five verse number three where allah says on this day have i complete my favor unto you and have chosen islam for you and have perfected religion for you it's mentioned in surah chapter 5 verse number 3 where allah says i have perfected your religion for you and have completed my favor on you and have chosen for islam umar azilan replies we know this was it was revealed on a friday on the day of arafah that means it was the day of arafah when allah he perfected the religion of islam and completed his favor on the human beings and has chosen islam for us this is the third verse of arafah the fourth virtue of arafah is that arafah is also a day of eid and it's mentioned in surname number three hadith number two four one nine that the prophet said the yamal arafah that's the ninth of jilhaj yamun nahar that is that are the three days following eid the 11th 12th and 13th of july these are the days of eid these are the days of celebration these are the days of eating and drinking so you're more arafah for the people of arafah in arafah it's a neat day for them the fifth virtue of arafah is that it is the day when allah forgives and frees the maximum slave it is called the day of forgiveness and it's a hadith mentioned in sunnah messiah one number three hadith number three the wife of the prophet said that the prophet narrated that on no day does allah forgive his servants and frees his slaves with the male and female than on the day of arafah and he comes close to the angels and he boasts to them about them and says what do they want that means this day of arafah is also called the day of forgiveness and on this day allah frees the maximum slaves ever in the full year on this day of arafah from the hellfire the sixth virtue of arafah is that in jamaica media verb number three hadith number three five eight five where he said that on this day of arafah it is the day of supplication the supplication that is heard the best is on the day of arafah and in this hadith it is narrated that the beloved prophet said on the day of arafah allah subhanahu wa years the supplication the maximum and i and the earlier prophets they recited that there is no one worthy of worship except allah and he has got no partners don't belong all the domains and all praises are due to him alone and he has power of all things this is the best dua that anyone can do on yamal arafa that was recommended by the prophet it is called the day of supplication and the seventh virtue of arafat is that a beloved prophet said as i mentioned earlier inside muslim volume number three hadith number 2747 the prophet said that fasting on the day of arafah expects your sins of the previous year and the coming year and the same information is repeated in ibrahim volume number two hadith number 1730 where the prophet said that anyone who fast on yamal arafa his sins of the previous year and the next year is exped so these were the seven virtues of yamul arafa the day of arafah now we'll discuss the last and the first point that is that is the day of sacrifice the ease of sacrifice or the day of sacrifice and we know that allah had asked prophet ibrahim that what do you love the most in this world but naturally after allah he said my son is sallam and allah tests ibrahimovic that can you sacrifice him for me and ibrahim islam goes and tells his son ismail salam and he says don't worry father you will find me steadfast and on the instruction of allah when he is about to sacrifice the son allah's mother replaces it with a sacrificial animal and this is what we remember every year in either other that we should be able to sacrifice anything in this world for the sake of one of allah and during her day of sacrifice and either other the day of sacrifice we if we have the means we sacrifice an animal for one person it is a goat or if you want to do a big animal like a cow or a camel it can be for for seven people and it's mentioned in surah chapter number 22 verse number 37 it is not their meat or blood that reaches the last allah but it is a party which reaches allah so we don't sacrifice so that the blood and the meat is just one last one but we do it for our taqwa our party should reach allah and what do we do with the sacrifice when we sacrifice the animal we distribute it amongst the poor people amongst the friends among the relatives and keep some for ourselves normally it is recommended that that minimum one-third should be given to the poor people one third to the family and friends and the maximum you can keep yourself is one third this is the practice let me tell you the salient features that should be done on either other or your number one that have a bath early in the morning number two put perfume on yourself it's a sunnah number three is that wear the best of your clothes number four say that number five preferable do not eat anything before there is prayer number six go to pray early number seven that it is recommended that all the women including the children including the menstruating woman should go for the eat salah even if they don't have to offer salah or they don't have to go to the masala and when you come back from eat prayer see to it that you take another route not the same route in which you went for the salah and preferable to pay salah in a muslin open ground which is called as ka now what is the reason that a beloved person muslim recommended that all the women and the children including the menstruating woman should go for the salah even if they don't have to offer salah either even if they don't have to go and pray what is the reason why did the prophet said that you go from one root and when you come back take the other route why did he say that pray in a large place for all this we come to know that the reason is so that it boosts the morale of the muslims normally we muslims offer five times allah congregation in the mosque once a week in juma we have a bigger congregation we pray in the juvenile mosque the congregation is multiple then bigger than what congregation we have during the five time salah and twice in the year during the eden the idol and other the prophet recommended that you pray in an open ground known as why so that a larger number can gather imagine if you're living in a village and during the east side i come to know there are 30 000 muslims there are 40 000 muslims the morale of the muslims is boosted and if you are living in an area which has a non-muslim also the non-muslims will think 10 times before interfering with the muslims oh the muslim the 30 000 in number 40 000 imagine if you're living in a big city and if you pray in one idga in which 100 000 gather or a few hundred thousand gather imagine the scenario it will boost up the morale of the muslims and at the same time would give a non-muslim a thought that they better not interfere with the muslims this is the psychology what is the reason that the beloved person even told the woman and the children to go even the woman of the menstruating when you go through one way come through the other way not the same way why so that the other people in the other locality of that village of the town or that city no ah the muslims are going in large numbers if you go through route a come back through route b so that the people of route also come to know the people of root to be also come to know that muslims and large number the next important point when you come back if you have the means you sacrifice an animal if allah has given you the mean later on you go and meet your family friends it's the day of celebration and when you meet the greeting is may allah accept the good deeds from us and from you normally in india pakistan accept the good needs from us and from you you can say mubarak it is muba but the right thing is as the prophet and the sabbahs wished each other and the day of eid this should be a day of celebration be happy be cheerful let me tell you the important points of the eighth salah before i end this talk there are 14 important points of each salah number one the each salah is further for every muslim who is an adult and hussein male or female number two it is offered between the time after the fajr salah and before the salah but the earlier you offer the better it is number three it should be offered in an opening round almost allah also known as number four that if eid falls on a juma then praying juma on that day is not further but it is sunnah it is recommended if you pray it is good but if you want you can abstain from free masala at that time you should pray only the suhar salah next point number five is that there is no aadhaan or no akama before the salah number six there is no sunnah before the salah or after the salah number seven the each salah is of two raka number eight there are six extra takbirat in the first rakat before surah fatiha besides the takbirat ahram along with that there are total seventh agbirath in the first takat before surah fatiha in the second rakat after you get up from the sujud in the starting of the second rakat after seeing the tag beat there are five additional takbirat before the surah fatiha in the second rakat ninth point is that it is sunnah to recite surah allah in the first akkas and suritasia in the second rakha the tenth point is it is also a sunnah you can recite surah off in the first takaka and surah kamar in the second rakah the 12th is that after the each salah there is the thirteenth point is it is recommended that you hear the khudba of the imam after the salah but it is not afar it is highly recommended and the 14th point is when you go for salah and form one root seed to it while coming back you take the other root these were the 14 salient points of the salah and i've covered in brief in as short a time as possible the importance of the first 10 days of the rija"
