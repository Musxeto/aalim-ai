  "transcript": "the first question is the person who says wanna come wanna come is the Tamil word which means hello and I say hello to YouTube I believe the person is a Tamil who's asking the question and he writes vasanth here I'm a Hindu residing in Bahrain I am reading and getting knowledge about Islam for some time but slowly day by day can you please tell top five aspects of Islam which can Inspire non-muslims apart from the Five Pillars as I am aware of them basically brother wants to know the top five points that Inspire non-muslim to become Muslim get them closer to Islam besides the Five Pillars and let me tell you that the major points that Inspire non-muslim towards Islam are the five pillars I'll briefly mention some of the points of the five prayers and then come on to the other five important points besides the Five Pillars according to me the number one point that inspires non-muslims towards Islam is tahit it is Oneness of Allah and the concept of God in Allah it is unique unlike other religions the concept that there is only one God and that we worship no one else besides him alone and he is the all-powerful he doesn't have any Associates he doesn't have any Partners this concept of taheed not merely monotheism that you worship him alone and no one else it really impresses a non-muslim and the definition of Allah is given in brief in for a class chapter 112 verse number one before he says see he's a lover and only in short is the Touchstone of theology giving the definition of Allah in brief and it makes it completely different than the other concepts of God whereas if you see another religions God can be defeated God has got Sun God has got wife the wife gets abducted the God can be killed so all these are not the true concept of Allah number one is number two it is the second bill of his sum that is Allah that when a person offers Salah he gets closer to Allah it is better than any meditation it gets you peace of mind it gets to Serenity and it demonstrates the best example of universal without and when the Muslim men when we stand for Salah in congregation We Stand shoulder to shoulder and feet to feet irrespective whether the person next to you is a king whether it's black or white We Stand shoulder shoulder it demonstrates the best example of universal Brotherhood five times every day I'm just mentioning some of the ceiling features of all the Five Pillars which attract a non-muslim number three it is a zakat that every rich person who has a saving of more than the sub level 85 grams of gold should give 2.5 percent as zakat as obligated charity to the eight categories the poor the masakian ETC and here the people feel the closeness and as Allah says in Surah chapter 59 and verse number seven zakat prevents the wealth from circulating only amongst the rich it gets a closeness between the rich and the poor so this aspect attracts a non-muslim the fourth pillar is fasting into some and we mentioned all the objectives of fasting all these objectives get a person closer to Islam the fifth pillar is the means and the health and the wealth to perform I should do it once in his lifetime and Hajj is the best example of annual Universal method where more than 4 million people from all over the world from different parts of the world from Saudi Arabia from India from Pakistan from Bangladesh from UK from USA from Singapore from Malaysia from Indonesia they gather and the men that dressed up in two pieces of white cloth unsone and they only come and say here we come at the service of the Lord so this shows the universal Brotherhood it shows the equality of all the human beings all dressed up in two pieces of white unsold cloth this demonstration of Brotherhood impresses a non-muslim this was just in brief about some of the sale in Futures we can give a talk for several hours in reply to this question the important points that attract a non-muslim toward Islam now coming to the main question what are the five top important points besides the Five Pillars which attract a non-muslim towards Islam number one besides the five Pillar Point to me it is the Quran the Glorious Quran is the last and final revelation of Allah revealed to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the Quran is the ultimate Miracle it's a Miracle of Miracles and Anyone who reads the Quran even the translation if it's a good translation it brings tears to his eyes he realizes the beauty of life he realizes the purpose of creation he understands Allah he understands the Deen only giving the translation a good translation of the Glorious Quran to a non-muslim it will do wonders it is one of the major factors beside the Five Pillars which attracts a non-muslim towards Islam it's unlike any other book in the world unlike any other real scriptures number two besides the Five Pillars it is Prophet Muhammad upon him and according to Michael charts in his book of hundred most influential people in the world from other peace be upon him till today number one he places being a non-muslim is Prophet Muslim if you read the seed of the Prophet as the Quran right he says in Surah chapter number 68 verse number four that thou art standeth on the highest standard of character that means the character of the Prophet is so Superior it is the best standard and Allah repeat the message chapter number 33 verse number 21 that verily in the messenger of Allah in Prophet sallam you will find the most beautiful pattern of conduct his conduct his lifestyle his behavior was an example so much so that even his enemies could not deny calling him the trustworthy the honest person they respected him so if you read the seed of the prophet there are high chances that if a non-muslim reads with an unbiased mind though there are thousands of books written against the prophet but if you read the seera you will find that he was the best example best exemplary human being that Allah has sent on the face of the Earth number three top reason beside the five pillar that a non-muslim accept Islam and gets attracted is the concept of life after death that is believing there is life after death because when you look around us there is so much of wrongs happening there's so much of criminals so much of Injustice being done and you wonder how is Allah allowing this Injustice is he not capable of stopping it Allah gives the reply in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse number 185 that every fold shall have a taste of death and the final recompense will be on the day of judgment and this life is the mere Amusement if you enter Jannah you have achieved the objective of this life because this life is just mere tools of deception so here we know that the final recompensability of that but imagine if you have to think of Hitler the person who we know who are skilled the maximum number of human being in the world history tells us 6 million even if you catch Hitler today what management can you give him maybe that that will compensate for one what about the remaining 5 million 999 9999 human beings are skilled the only reply to this is Allah will give him the final punishment in the day of judgment Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 4 number 56 that as to those who reject our signs we will cast them into the Hellfire and as often as the Skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skin so that they shall feel the pain that means in the next life and today we have come to know that the feeling of pain it's based on the pain receptor which are present in the skin so if your skin is burnt and the pain receptors are destroyed you cannot feel the pain and that's what happened in this life a person has a 100 burn injury and his pain receptors have been destroyed you cannot feel pain but on the day of judgment Allah says as often as your skin they are roasted we shall give you fresh skin so that you shall feel the pain that means if Allah wants to incinerate burn Hitler six million times 10 million times 12 million times we can do it we can't give him such a punishment in this life so there has to be a life after death for justice in this world and the fourth point that attracts a person beside the people of Islam is that this life that we are leading is a test for the Hereafter Allah says in the Quran is to remove chapter number 67 verse number two Allah to test which of his best in deals this life is a test for us for the Hereafter many of the question that we ask that how are millions of people dying of hunger there's so much of poverty can't Allah give them food God almighty God there are so many people dying in diseases the dying in earthquakes what is the reason the reason is this life is a test for the Hereafter Allah test different people with different things some people test with wealth some people with poverty some people with health some people with diseases and Allah says in the Quran in chapter number two verse number 155 that do you think Allah will not test you before you go to Jannah last two testing Allah says we will test you with Hunger or with fear of life or with the property that we have acquired Allah will test you in different ways and the fifth reason that attacks a person besides the Five Pillars it is the repentance that the concept of repentance of Baba in Islam that irrespective however many sins you do you may do a sin as big as the mountains touching the sky you may sin the whole day whole night but if you truly repent and you ask forgiveness in Islam Allah will forgive anything even you have done the worst of the sin so this gives a hope to a human being that now he is bad and now he reads the book he knows about religion so can he turn into a new Leaf very well he can he may be the worst human being in the world if he sincerely repents and he asked for forgiveness he does Toba inshallah Allah will forgive him and the beauty of Islam is if a person who was a non-muslim the big sins he does and after he repents the bigger the sin he leaves so imagine if a person is the biggest Sinner and he thinks okay now if I accept Islam all my sins will get converted to the Good Deeds masha'allah so these are the five points that I can think at the top in priority besides the five pillars of Islam so hope this and so it's a very brief answer you can speak for us on this but because it's a question answered the session I don't want to spend more time because there was a non-muslim asking a question I gave a reply in more detail"
