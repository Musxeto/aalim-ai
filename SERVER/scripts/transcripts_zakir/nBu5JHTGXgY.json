  "transcript": "is it permissible to use toothpaste whil fasting as far as using toothpaste is concerned most of the scholars say that using toothpaste is permissible including shik bin Bas may Allah have mercy on him he says that using toothpaste along with toothbrush is like using Sak and the prophet has never prohibited using S it's perfectly all right it doesn't break the fast but it will be careful that you should not swallow any of it following any part of the toothpaste is forbidden that's the reason some Scholars say Mak thinking oh if someone has toothpaste that has a strong taste and someone swallow so that the reason some say it's discouraged but the right ruling is that as long as you're careful that you don't swallow any part of it you can use a toothpaste and a toothbrush it does not nullify your fast okay"
