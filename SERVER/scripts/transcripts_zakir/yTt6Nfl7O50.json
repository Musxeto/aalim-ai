  "transcript": "next question is what exactly do you think \nan ideal condition of a Muslim that has gone   through the whole month of Ramadan and has come \nout to the end now what is the ideal condition   the ideal condition or the desired condition of a \ntrue Muslim after the month of Ramadan should be   that first and foremost he should thank Allah \nsubhana wa ta'ala for making him able to fast   during the full month of Ramadan and as well as \nof aam in the month of Ramadan the condition of   a true Muslim is better after Ramadan than what \nit was when Ramadan started and his Good Deeds   should have increased and because of the whole \ninstitution of fasting the month of Ramadan   and the true believers they really fear that have \ntheir deeds been accepted or not and the righteous   pricers always they competed with each other in \nthe righteous work and to strive for perfection   in the Good Deeds but hoping that it will be \naccepted by Allah subhana tala and fearing that   it should not be rejected as Allah says in the \nQuran in Surah MAA chapter number 5 verse number   27 that Allah accepts the sacrifice of those \nwho are righteous that means being righteous   is very important and it's mentioned say Hadi of \nHadith number 3175 AA may Allah be pleased with her she asked the prophet regarding a words of \nthe Quran those that are given what they given   and they tremble with fear are these the people \nwho drink alcohol and they steel so the prophet   replies oh daughter of a sidik she the daughter \nof Abu Bakr be pleased with him so the prophet   says oh daughter of a sidik these are the people \nwho fast and they pray and they give charity these   are the people who fear that has Allah subhana \nwa tala accepted the deed or not and they are   the people who rush to do good deeds and they \nare the one to do it first so here is talking   about the state of a True Believer that they do \ngood deeds yet they hope that may be accepted and   they fear that it will be rejected so in the \nmonth of Ramadan a person does Good Deeds he   fasts Etc and a True Believer state is such it \ncontinues throughout the year until next Ramadan   but unfortunately there are some Muslims who are \nvery Pious only during the month of Ramadan they   may offer five times Salah they may F during the \nmonth of Ramadan they may pray theam Salah and   do all good deeds but the moment Ramadan goes \naway all these acts vanish from their life some   of them are even neglectful of their prayers \nsome don't pray jamat Salah some don't even   get up for the F Salah when they to read the \nQuran in the month of Ramadan they no longer   read and it's a Pity that the Deeds they vanish \nafter the month of Ramadan as though that they   believed in Allah only in the month of Ramadan \nit's a Pity and it's a wrong thing as though   the Muslims believe that Allah is only the month \nof Ramadan and the other months he doesn't exist   so we pray to Allah subhana wa tala that may \nhe make us and all of us be steadfast as we   were in the month of Ramadan through the year \nuntil the next Ramadan inshallah aan inshallah"
