  "title": "Dr Zakirâ€™s Response to Arabs Warning Hindu Fanatics for Spreading Islamophobia in Middle East",
  "transcript": "i asked from india what is the opinion about the recent tweets from the arab world leaders warning the right to wing hindu fanatics to abstain from spreading islamophobia otherwise they will be kicked out of the country for spreading venom against muslims they even want india to treat the muslim minorities well well india just like they treat hindus in arab countries we saw we even saw prime minister narendra modi tweeting soft messages towards muslims after that forward from the arab world what is my view a similar question has been asked i'm clubbing it together by sayad hashmi from doha qatar in the present scenario in context of indian muslims a planned campaign is being implemented radically the religious profi ridiculing and religious profiling and demeaning of indian muslims in india how should muslim tackle this and what what should be a strategy please appreciate uh what should be a strategy appreciate your guidance as far as what should we do in this situation when especially in india it's happening all over the world there's islamophobia you find in the western countries you find everywhere but i do agree that in india it has reached epidemic levels especially after the new government came to power that is the bjp led by our new prime minister narendra modi which is in power for approximately six years and when second time he came in second time when he got re-elected it has reached epidemic levels your what should we do as allah says in the quran in surah fusilla chapter number 41 verse number 34 repel evil with good you may never know the pearl the person who the enemy will become your friend so if they're abusing you if they are calling you with names illogically blaming you repel evil with could you be kind to them you'll be good to them as far as we in india we should soften the hearts another allah says you may never know that the enemy will become your friend and that's what i did when i was in it and that's the reason the majority of the non-muslims came for my talk the majority of the non-muslims who knew me they were my friends there were some non-muslims who even came and touched my feet which is not allowed in islam what are you doing they said no you're bhagavan gautam they love me they respected me said say what you want to do some of them come and say i've been seeing your videos for years tell me what i should do i said accept islam and they accept immediately they love me they respected me there were very few who are against me but since this new government came they created a campaign against me and they have given a feeling as the majority of the non-muslim luggage even in malaysia here majority when i'm staying majority the non-muslim they love me they when i go to the shop they give me free non-muslims they don't charge me there are yet few who are politically inclined like in india who for the political world bank they they criticize me otherwise majority of so we should love the non-muslims especially in india the hindu then majority care for them and try and remove the misconception regarding the main question what happened in the arab world that there were many people who started maligning islam abusing the prophet criticizing islam calling not so in the last couple of weeks alhamdulillah there has been a backlash from the people in the middle east mainly from kuwait from uae from dubai from sharjah from saudi arabia and they came up lawyers came up activists came up from the royal family they came up and they started saying what is this and we know that there are more than there are more than 10 million indians living in the middle east alone more than 3 million in in saudi arabia close to 4 million in uae and the other gulf countries and the major foreign exchange that comes in in india is from the middle east and all the muslim countries put together more than 50 percent from the middle east alone 55 billion every year more than 1 billion a month from saudi alone more than 1 billion a month from uae alone and out of those people working in the gulf countries approximately fifty percent are muslims fifty percent are non-muslims the non-muslims on the higher post most of the indian muslims they are on the lower post fear on the higher post the non-muslims most of them on the higher post fear on the lower post and if when i did a survey when i was when when i was a resident earlier of dubai the top hundred indians in the middle east the richest in the forbes list the top 100 richest indians in the gulf country 80 percent were not muslims 70 75 in hindus and only 20 were muslims so when so much money that is coming in to india from the muslim country majority earned by the non-muslim that means they're living comfortably i don't know of any single case in any of the muslim countries or the gulf country where a hindu was supposed to sell but never but the other muslims are forced to say many things which are against islam like jai shiram etc so the backlash came and there was a warning that if anyone is caught on the social media the non-muslims mainly of most of them were hindus from india belonging to who are the supporters of the bjp according to me most of the indians the hindus they love muslims according to me even today there is a small percentage of hindu maybe before bjp came to power maybe five percent were against muslims and maybe 15 percent were in favor always supported and 80 percent were neutral but they had no problems with the muslims when the bgb came to power the percentage increase now i believe maybe 15 in the first election after election 10 percent now when they won the second election maybe 15 percent against hardcore against muslims the hindus and the percentage favoring now has reduced from 15 point to me maybe five percent fear of backlash from the government being arrested and 80 percent are neutral and afraid to speak we should convey the message remove the misconception this backlash that came from the gulf country it should have come long before but better late than never and i agree with it that they gave the warning and many of them were arrested they were put in jails many were sent back how can you criticize the beloved prophet speak against the quran the country where staying which is giving you bread and butter they are not forcing you to say anything to do about islam you are living comfortably you are not paying an income tax you are sending most of your earnings back home so i am very much positive and then one of the lawyers from kuwait has made even a case in the geneva in the human rights and he said that anyone who finds any non-muslim making abusive remark against the muslim send it to him he will put it in the court very good we appreciate it very good but i won't i want to give them advice a step further besides collecting all the non-muslims are speaking against islam on the social media then percentage-wise there may be few let me tell you even the non-muslims who are against muslims in the muslim countries gulf countries would not be more than 10 according to me and speaking in the media would be just two or three percent so this lawyer said let's accumulate the data bank of all the non-muslims who are speaking against islam and see to it that what to task i would like to tell them that go a step further i would request that you even keep a data bank of non-muslims in india speaking against islam and those which are speaking are mainly the hard core activists of the bjp government and most of them they are rich and let me tell you that most of the politicians of india they have their money stored in uae in the gulf country most of them and most of them majority those of the of the non-muslims who travel abroad more than 50 percent they visit the gulf country or the muslim countries i would suggest to that kuwait lawyer that even collect the data of all the negative remarks and abusive of all the non-muslims in india and keep a data bank and store it into the computer next time if they come to the gulf country whether it be quote whether it be to saudi arabia whether it be to dubai whether it be to indonesia in the data bank you should mention okay now they have abused the prophet which is not permitted by law and they have abused islam bid them to task have a case against them arrest them and put them behind bar and when you do this to five or ten people believe me majority of them will stop because they travel to muslim countries if not majority at least 25 percent will stop make it public that we have our data bank don't reveal the names the moment they come arrest them take them to the court of law give them punishment believe me most of these people who are bjp bhakt who are spending venom against islam against the muslim they will get scared and my last suggestion is let the muslim countries make a block the major muslim country whether it be saudi arabia or uae indonesia malaysia can be nigeria qatar most of the oil that comes to india comes from muslim country from from saudi arabia from nigeria from uae natural gas comes from qatar palm oil comes from indonesia and malaysia let's make a block and we work collectively so that if they say anything against islam against the muslim we can be a better force so if the muslims unite inshallah and put a pressure on muslims and the other countries which are mining islam inshallah this will have a positive impact and they will stop doing this activity"
