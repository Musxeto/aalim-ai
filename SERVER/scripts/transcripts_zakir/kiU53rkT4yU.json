I have asked my team to Club the questions which are similar so that more people happy that are out of the question that I've answered the question a similar question is asked by a bin refer a little

aleikum sir i am rahul mia from india i want to be a dye sir please tell me what should i do i want to become like you and Sheikh Ahmed Deedat regarding the basic question all the three people I was that that all of them want to become a guy like me the 120 gentle for those let me tell you at the outset that it's not complicity to become like me to enter the nether for those as far as I am concerned I I pray to allah subhanaw taala that me accept my effort water weekend and i consider there are millions of people who are better than me in terms of knowledge in terms of Dawa it is has a bin full set up be it is only because of the mercy of Allah Muhammad Allah it is only because of the grace of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala that whatever little bit I have achieved is because of him and when I think of myself that there are you know hundreds of thousands of people have more knowledge than me how come people come for my talks how come people listen to me on the Facebook on YouTube I wonder and then that reminds mean you know that it is three criteria which always say is important number one if that Allah says in the Quran surah Imran chapter 3 verse 160 that if Allah helps you then can overcome you if Allah for six you who is dead then who can help you so let the believers put their trust in Allah number one is having faith and trust in Allah number two Allah says in surah and Kabuto chap number 29 verse number 69 if you strive in the way of allah subhanaw taala he will open up your pathways second is striving struggling hard work number three allah says in surah enhance chapter 16 verse 43 I'm sorry I am B except number 21 verse number 7 first allow holistically in Kundu malayalam o if you don't know as the person who's an expert the third is the technique so number one is Allah has helped second is striving and struggling in hard work number three is technique as far as getting Allah sell the more you have faith in Allah subhanAllah the more you worship Him the more you believe in him the more you have trust in him inshallah he will help you imagine I couldn't have dreamt in my wildest dream of speaking in front of 25 people I could have dreamt of becoming the best surgeon in the world the best doctor in the world but in my wildest dream I could not have dreamt of speaking in front of 25 people because as many of you know that I was the stammerer since childhood and people is to ask me what is my name after my name is ah dah dah dah dah so if then what I cannot dream when I started doing Dawa when I went on the stage I realised that I did not stammer most of the people were in they were in front of public they get cold feet for me it was opposite when I speak one-to-one I still stammer but in public my stammering vanished then later on when I have to speak the one to non-muslims even that demanded nurse Tamworth with Muslim life to Stanford and slowly slowly alhamdulillah my stamina kept on reducing and yet I stammered of the stage Allah helps me hamdulillah and I sure most of the millions of people are watching today most of you may have been multiple times better than what I was in a study made our known Allah can make such a person who's the stammerer give lectures we're live numbers attending so why can't you do that I don't think so I've really done any great deed neither have I sacrificed something people tell me oh I'm a fool that I left my medical profession some pre program is because you sacrifice the medical profession there is no sacrifice giving up a medical profession as compared to what Allah has given me in the field of Dawa everything people are watching the fame which had which was not the reason why we did it the recognition the heads of straight meeting me leaving the medical profession is not even the drop in the ocean and unlike a mid-ocean so the basic thing we realize is that we should sacrifice the things that you love for the sake of Allah if you sacrifice for the sake of Allah if you take one step in the way of Allah Allah will take multiple times more close to you so number one is sacrifice love Allah trust Allah have faith in him and then ask an expert as far as we have our training programs may be had in the past maybe trained people but number one help of Allah number two striving and struggling and last is the training training you've got a must I did not get ready it was Allah who helped me that's the least important and to go to Geneva through those follow the glorious quran and follow the say hadith as much as the implement of the glorious quran as much as the improvement of the say hadith and the commanders of the prophet and allah there are more chances that you will enter jannah inshallah Jannetty for those"
