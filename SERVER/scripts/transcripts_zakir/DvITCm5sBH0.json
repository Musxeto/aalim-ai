  "transcript": "furthermore one more article came in 2005 in the same Newspaper Sunday times it said that 26% of the britishers they feel that wearing revealing clothes is partially or totally responsible for the rape so what I say that the more modestly you are dressed up you are respected more so Islam has prescribed the modest hijab for the woman not to degrade her but to uplift her I do agree there may be cultural differences Islam cannot force anyone to adopt it there are cultural differences for example that some societies what they feel that even looking at a woman is a modest some societies feel looking is no problem but touching a woman is IM modest some of the societies feel shaking hand is no problem some societies feel kissing no problem some societies feel doing anything as long as both agree is no problem different societies and different cultur have got different rules and regulations"
