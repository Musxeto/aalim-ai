  "transcript": "Dr zakya there are many non-muslims no doubt and I have met some of them who are confused and they often ask themselves what sort of a religion is this in which um people of the same city you know are not United upon this wonderful day this celebration of Eid and also the beginning and the ending of Ramadan I would really appreciate it if you could comment on that I do agree with you that many a time we Muslims make a laughing stock of ourselves that they wonder what sort of religion is this Islam where people un united in the same city you have two different days of he sometimes you have three days three different days of Fe today tomorrow day after tomorrow three different days of Fe so they wonder what sort of religion is this and for this as I explained to you in the earlier two answers Islam is very clear there's decision but we Muslims are to blame it is not Islam we Muslims are to blame because the prophet M was very clear that we should be United the Quran is very clear it is we Muslims who are to blame that we are divided the problem is not in Islam the problem is in US Muslims the problem is that we have many Hil committees many one city has three four H committies or many times there is one committee but there are subdivision each belonging to one group so the problem is in US Muslims we have many H committees each belonging to one group one sect each fighting among themselves or one H committee having subdivisions so what happens that there EO problem between them and that happens in many parts of the world whether it be USA whether it be UK whether it be Pakistan whether it be India and in Bombay it has happened several times that Eid is celebrated on two different days sometimes in three different days and what happens that they have ego problem that if the witness of group or Hil committee a is there and Hil committee b gets angry or maybe they want that we should announce first and if Hil committee a announces first B out of the way will differ to prove that we are stronger and they want to show who has a bigger following so this is a big FNA and because of their own ego the problem we have in the Muslim umah is that we Muslims we are being troubled and we are not able to follow our Dean because of these groups so the main problem is The Hil committees because of the ego problem between themselves and it has happened several times in several parts of the world that they purposely differ if group announc The Group B will go out of the way to differ so you know what we should have we should get together and no problem for the betterment of the umah we should let our ego go down and we should come together on a common platform and whoever has more ego let him lead no problem as long as unitedly celebrate the Eid as the prophet said you fast when all the people fast you break the fast when all the people break the fast you celebrate e then all the people celebrate e so if you let the ego be reduced and let us come together and see to to celebrate the eat together then this problem otherwise this problem will never be solved and previously there used to be two different dates now third date has cropped up because of the people following Saudi which I discussed in my early advances that you know now they say that okay we will follow the time of Saudi Arabia that's another problem and that has cropped up recently it has become more and we find that in Canada in UK in USA there are three days of he the in fighting amongst the local commit one problem and some people saying we'll follow Saudi Arabia that's another problem so they have further increased the problem so we Muslims should be as Allah says in the Quran in IM 3 vers number3 hold the Rope of Allah strongly and be not divided the Rope of Allah is the Glorious Quran and the say Hadi so we should hold to it strongly and be not divided Allah what we need to do is bring back the logic ofam and when he was placing the black stone remember the the story if we could have that back that's right would be great and we see this problem is very little in the Gulf countries in Saudi Arabia there's only one committee where whatever they say everyone follows and fortunately even the countries around them whether it be UAE whether it be barin they follow Saudi Arabia because they fall in the same area it's not that big countries so there there's no problem and we are not laughing stock their celebrities on one day when they announce everyone follows it's seed when they say Ramadan everyone follows so they are the best example the gulf countries we Muslims in the non-muslim countries we have a problem we try to show off an ego Etc try to differ that's the problem so we should follow the example of the gulf countries alhamdulillah they United and they have won at least as far as the sighting of the moon is Con"
