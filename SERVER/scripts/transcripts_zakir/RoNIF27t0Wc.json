  "transcript": "the next question sir I am Arif Khan a 22y old from Kata India I want to know from many days your style and methodology of dawa which is very effective how do you prepare for dawa or what is your style of research because whenever you answer something or present something you very nicely topple down opponent's claim with very beautiful and unique hikma for instance if someone speaks an Islam on Islamic terrorism then you counter argue with some informative things that ultimately destroys their claim please tell me how you gather such information and how you structure it and how you prepare and what is your homework please let me please sir tell me your routine and what things do you take for research and how do you do research your dawa affected me so much alhamdulillah please help me with some bit of information or some tricks notes Etc if this message really reaches you then please give me feedback may Allah protect you and give more the brother has been watching my videos and he appreciates the way I do dawa and he says he likes the way how I use my hikma and I reply to the opponent and a top M or rather I would say a m because Allah says in the Quran in in Surah f chapter number 41 verse number 34 that you should win over your enemies winning over your enemies is more important than defeating them when them over so we were as far as the question that how do I do my research and how do I give the reply and it has been described normally if I'm supposed to give a talk on women that in Islam I see to it that I read all the vers in the Quran dealing with women then I try and collect various Hadith dealing with women so that whatever question that can come on women inshallah we should be able to answer so the preparation is very important when you're giving a lecture the lecture that you give should be hardly 10 to 20% you should have five times more knowledge than the lecture I've have given so that you can handle the question answer question answer is more important where a person we come to know how much is he in water so and regarding knowing a course the best advice I can give you is that you can watch the course let's become if effective D international laain program it's present in on the Al and if you go on the AL platform you'll find hundreds of hes and some of them are on compi religion on dawa and this will tell you in detail how you should do research how you should how you should present yourself and how can you win all your enemies hope the answer the question"
