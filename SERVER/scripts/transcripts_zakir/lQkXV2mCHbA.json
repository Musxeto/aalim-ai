  "transcript": "from amatulla from New Jersey USA what are your views regarding the killing of the black American George Floyd by a white policeman few days ago what the sister is referring to is an incidents that took place about 12 days ago on the 25th of May 2020 where a black American by the name of George Freud he was skilled in cold-blooded murder by a white American policeman in Minneapolis in USA where the white policeman by the name of Derek Chawan he put his knee on the throat of the black American George Floyd and when he screamed the black person black black American George Floyd when he screamed please I cannot breathe he yet the white policeman continued putting pressure by his knee on the throat of the black man for more than eight minutes and he killed him in cold blood not only that there were three policemen who were colleagues of Derek Sherman who were just watching silently this cold-blooded murder has created protests throughout USA and even outside US and other countries regarding the racism and the black person was innocent the one of the only reason that he was killed was because he was a black person and the protest again is new racism an operation has gone nationwide throughout USA v Muslims as a whole we stand the solidity and we completely support the black protest against the racism and oppression throughout the world the Muslims as a whole we are with the black people in this protest and this is completely against humanity and it is also against the teaching of Islam unless monitor says in the Quran in surah Jerrod chapter 49 verse number 13 yeah ayyuhan NASCO in natural economy is a criminal original Apple Shambo acaba a Lolita a food in the car between the Lord come in the laulima Kebede o humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of allah subhanaw taala in the fight of Almighty God is the person who has taqwa according to the verse of the glorious quran human beings have come from a single pair of male and female from Adam and Eve may peace be upon them both and the humankind Almighty God has divided into nations and tribes so that they may recognize each other not that they may despise each other and in this verse Allah says that one human being is not superior to another human being whether it be because of Carol of the skin one human being is not superior to the other human being because of race because of wealth neither is the superior because of age because of gender the only criteria which makes one human being superior to the other it is taqwa it is got consciousness it is PI T it is righteousness so according to the boast of the Quran all human beings are equal whether they are black or white yellow or brown rich or poor king or papa the only criteria that makes them superior stock wa it's God consciousness it's piety it is righteousness and a blob with brought masala Salam he said in his farewell pilgrimage he said o humankind you have been created from one pair of Adam and Eve peace be upon them both and he felt that no Arab is superior to or non Arab neither is the non Arab superior to an Arab a white man is not superior to a black man neither is a black man superior to a white man the only reason that differentiate of them is taqwa it is pi T it is God consciousness it righteousness and our beloved poet masala Salaam he was not a non racist non racist and those people who do not practice Isis him but the Prophet was an anti racist the anti racist they fight against racism the non-racist people don't fight against racism so a beloved part masala Salam was one of the first human beings who said this in his favorite image that no Arab is a superior to non Arab neither the white men superior to a black man nor is the black men superior to a white man he was one of the first human being who was very much against racism he was an anti-racist and you see that in February sirrah in several incidents of the seed of the Prophet of the life history of the Prophet and we know that when the Prophet peace be upon a magnitude of Medina and when they build the mosque he told Bilal may Allah be pleased with him who was a black Abyssinian slave he told him to give the azan the call for prayer imagined there were so many people Arabs of superior races of of high lineage but he chose a black and Athenian faith Bilal may Allah be pleased with him to give the hall for prayer and similarly when he did Fatima come and he came back to Makkah and when you are victorious he told the same person the black Athenian faith has the Blair may Allah be pleased with him to give the Adan he chose him in preference to all the other companions he had there were many other Arabs of high lineage coming from a royal family many of the sahabas but he chose a black person this shows that the Prophet peace be upon him did not differentiate between two human beings only because of hala and Allah says in the Quran Allah says in surah nisa chap number 4 was 235 that ya ayyuhal as in Amman oh you believe stand out firmly for justice as witness to Allah subhana Allah even if it be against yourself against your parents or your relatives when they'd be rich or poor Allah protects all so this was of the Quran faith when your standard for justice you should be firm even if it be against yourself even if there's justice against your parents against your relative when they reach a poor standing for justice is of very high importance in Islam here the color of a skin or the wealth of a person does not make you give a judgment in the person favor and Allah says in the Quran in free room chapter number 30 was the may 22 that amongst his signs he has created the heavens and the earth and if created the variation in your languages and color so Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has made different people of different colors and I've made them speak different languages so that you can recognize them so that you may know their lineage it is not to oppress one person or the other but it is for a cognition so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and Islam besides being anti-racist it practically demonstrates universal brotherhood in various aspects of life and the best example I can give you is Hajj in Islam the fifth pillar of Islam is Hajj every Muslim who has the means and the health and the wealth to perform Hajj should eat leave perform Hajj that despair agreement to Makkah and the fair only areas in the month of Hajj at least once a lifetime and here you find that millions of people from different parts of the world gather it is the biggest annual gathering where about three to four million people gather in Makkah and the surrounding areas and the men there dressed up in two pieces of unsold cloth you cannot make out the person standing next to you whether the king or a pauper with a rich a poor and you find people from all over the world from America from Canada from UK from Saudi Arabia from Pakistan from India and either from Bangladesh from Indonesia from Malaysia all over the world black white yellow brown rich poor dressed up in two pieces of unsworn cloth white cloth lebec a la mala big Here I am oh my lord Here I am coming to the service of allah subhanaw taala only to worship Him it is the best example of universal brotherhood and if you know the history of Malcolm X his name was Malik Shabbos al Hajj when he went had for the first time I think it was somewhere in the 15th and 60s that time the people were much less he was shocked when he performed that he was shocked and he wrote in a letter I can see tens of thousands of Muslims with blue-eyed blond hair mixing with black people this I could not imagine can be a reality in USA and he was shocked and that made him change completely and as you know Malcolm X was one of one of the greatest people live who lived the few decades earlier who fought against racism who fought I need an operation the other example that that we Muslims have and which we demonstrate in our daily life is we offer 5 times Allah when we offer 5 times Allah in congregation in the mosque when we stand for Salah we Muslims the men they stand shoulder shoulder and feet 2 feet the person next to you irrespective whether he's rich or poor when the king of Papa wear the black or white whether yellow or brown when the Muslim stand for Salah we stand shoulder shoulder we practically demonstrate universal brotherhood minimum 5 times a day in our life and the people talk about universal without we practically demonstrated every five times a day in our daily life and this example that we have is not seen in any other way of life in any other society in any other religion regarding the murder that was done by a white police officer in Minneapolis Derek Sherman of a black American by the name of George Floyd is to be condemned it was not only it was not on reason it was not only oppression it was murder and in Islam murder is the second medicine and Allah says in the Quran in surah maidah chap number five what's the matter he - if any person kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity allah says in the quran if any human being kills any other innocent human being it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and this cold-blooded murder we muslims condemn furthermore operation is the 26th major sin in Islam this is also prohibited this is nothing but oppression and injustice and injustice is also a major sin in Islam we Muslims support the black community throughout the world and the cry of Jorge Freud please I cannot breathe please don't kill me in the video recording when the white policeman is throttling him which is me for more than eight minutes will remain in a mind will always come up whenever there is an act of racism operation than 20 human be"
