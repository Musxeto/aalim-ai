  "transcript": "the next question is from Shaharyar ahead Canada I am working at the gas station where we have to sell and promote the lottery is it Haram for me to promote one of my friends is working at a grocery store where they sell halal and Haram meat and foods is it okay for him to work there basically the question posed by the brother is that can we work in a place which is Haram activities to make the answer more comprehensive as far as working in a business or working in a company which has Haram and halal activity the ruling is that if the company the major activities are major earnings is Haram then you cannot work in any position for example you cannot work in a bank which is a conventional bank based on turba on interest it is Haram you cannot work on any position where there the fountain where there the manager was there the doorkeeper because the activity major by itself is Haram you cannot work in an alcoholic company a company which makes alcohol because I call it a magician you cannot work in any position but there are certain businesses which are mixed with Haram and ha ha if the Haram portion is a small portion as long as it did not get directly involved in it it is permitted to work in such company for example if you're working in a five-star hotel and that first hotel is selling alcohol you cannot work in the bar or the restaurant and serve alcohol yourself because serving alcohol is haram but surely you can work in the other departments like as a receptionist like account manager of a hotel as long as you are not directly involved in the Haram activity and that Haram activity earned a small percentage of profit not the major percentage then you can work in that company or in that hotel as long as you are not directly involved let me give an example walking in a language is good you can work in the front desk we can work in the office but you cannot work at an airhostess because most of the airlines they serve alcohol if you are working in an airline we doesn't serve alcohol then it becomes permitted there are very few islands in the world we don't serve alcohol like Saudi Airlines etc so working there as a person there was this well you don't have to serve the Haram like poke or alcohol then it's permitted so basic equation regarding can you work in a gas station which tells you to promote lottery lottery is gambling it is prohibited if the force do to promote you cannot work but if they allow you excuse you work there you need not sell lottery you do not promote then it's permitted regarding your friend who's working in a grocery which is serving both halal meat and non halal meat if he's made to serve or sell the Haram product whether it be non halal meat whether it be poke or whether it be alcohol then he cannot serve it but if you're working in a big grocery store and he himself is not selling pork or the Haram food or I'll call it is permitted so you have to understand look at the concept this is the basic ruling that you should not serve anything which is Haram and if a right not involve you can work otherwise you cannot"
