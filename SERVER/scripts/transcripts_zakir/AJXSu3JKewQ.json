  "transcript": "dr zakir what is the importance and the authority of the sunnah of the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi of islam as far as the sunnah is concerned it is the second unavoidable source of islam if you have to understand islam number one source is the quran and the second is the sunnah of the prophet to understand the full islam you cannot understand without these two sources both are important as well as authentic hadith the authentic sunnah of the prophet and as far as the importance of sunnah is concerned allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 4 verse number 59 and those charged with authority among you but if you differ among yourselves refer it back to allah another fool if you believe in allah and the last day this is the best and the most suitable for the final determination here the word used in the quran is which means to obey and use obey allah and obey the messenger so the obey word is used for allah and the messenger but it's not used for those charged authority among you that means the undisputed obeying is only for alliance result and further goes on and saying that if those among you those charged with authority if you differ among yourselves refer it back to online is referral to allah and the soul are authority it doesn't say refer it back to those charged with authority because we know that many a time the scholars they differ among themselves so if they differ if any scholar differs you go back to allah and the result and the scholar who's in line with allah and the fool you have to follow him so this is the importance of the sunnah and further there are two separate things it says obey allah and obey the messenger so obey allah means follow the quran and obey the messenger we follow the sunnah of the messenger that is authentic furthermore it says that both these two sources are different quran is different and the sunnah authentic hadith are different and further if we analyze the word va is used between them indicating that we have to follow both it doesn't say summa sum mater then you follow the rasool you have to follow both of them simultaneously then only will you understand islam in the right perspective and here the word that is used here that it is obey allah and the messenger both are equally important when it says refer back to online result that means i've referred back to alliance so not only to allah or not only to the rasool both are important for you to understand the true sharia and the last point to be noted is that the starting of the quranic verses or you who believe what's your rasool that means obeying allah and obeying the messenger is for all the believers it's not only for the companions or for some of the believers it's for all the believers further it's mentioned in surah jinn chapter number 72 verse number 23 it says that if you disobey allah and his rasool then your place will be in the hellfire to dwell therein forever that means if you disable land with messenger your place will be in hellfire you'll not enter paradise further it's mentioned that if you don't obey allah and messenger your deeds will be in vain allah says in surah muhammad chapter number 47 verse number 33 obi allah and obey the messenger and let not your deeds go in vain further as far as the third of the sunnah is concerned and the importance is concerned obeying the messenger is allah allah says chapter number 4 verse number 80 that if you obey the messenger you will be allah and if you turn away we have not sent the messenger to look after your affairs especially your evil deeds and further is mentioned in the hadith of say muslim word number three hadith number 4518 the beloved prophet muslim said that if you obey me you'll be allah if you disobey me you disable allah so obeying the messenger is same as obama and furthermore allah says in the quran in surah najam chapter number 53 verse number 3 and 4 that the messenger does not speak out of himself it is nothing more than an inspiration sent down to him and the beloved prophet muhammad said it's mentioned inside buhari number 9 hadith number seven to eight zero the blood prophet said that there are among the believers who will enter paradise and some will refuse to enter paradise so the sahaba has asked who would refuse to enter paradise so the prophet said those who obey me they enter the paradise those who disobey me they refuse to enter it and finally the quran says that if you obey the messenger allah will love you allah says in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 31 allah says to muhammad say tell them if you love allah follow me let's follow the messenger and allah will love you and he will forgive your sins so following the messenger is loving allah so this is the importance of the sunnah in islam"
