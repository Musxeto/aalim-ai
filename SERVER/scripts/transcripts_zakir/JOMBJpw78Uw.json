  "transcript": "do we have any non-muslims on any of the mics of the sisters okay we have one in the right hand side go ahead sister I am a Hindu amota Ramesh I'm a diploma engineering sorry to asking this question Hindu believes their religion Muslim believes their religion but when both are meeting Hindu will not trying to convert in Hindu but the Muslims why do they are trying to convert in Muslims system understood your question correctly when Hindus meet Muslim they don't try and convert the Muslims to Hinduism correct yeah but when the Muslims meet the Hindus they can convert the Hindus to Muslim correct sister it is like giving an example there is a student who goes to school maybe within the seventh standard or eighth standard there is another student who goes to post graduate College postgraduate College may be doing his Masters now when they meet will the school student try and teach the postgraduate or the postgraduate will teach the school student sister is the school going student teach the postgraduate student or the post graduate student will teach the school going student sister asked you a simple question not a difficult question my question yeah yeah so will a student going to school will teach a student going to a senior college postgraduate college or will a student going to post graduate college will teach a student going to the school post graduated only correct so in comparison when the Muslims What We believe We oppose graduates so when we meet our younger brother who are in school it's our duty to share knowledge we don't want to be selfish I don't want to be selfish you know those who are selfish yeah the person should not be a graduate you know let him suffer let him be in school only if he comes to college postgraduate he may take my job away those are selfish people we mashallah we are selfless it's our duty to spread the message of Truth so when we meet a non-muslim whether Hindu where the Christian where the Buddhism come to Common terms and we try and educate them we don't want to degrade them we can educate them so that they can become a postgraduate and both of us will get a good job the good job is going to Jannah so we don't alone want to go to Jannah we want to take our brothers and sisters to Jannah sister do you want to go to Jannah do you want to go to paradise do you want to go to paradise no do you want to go to paradise yes or no I want to go to heaven Only Heaven yes have another name for Heaven is Paradise there are some rules and regulations to go to heaven as I mentioned in my earlier answer according to the Hindu scriptures according to the Quran according to the Bible if you want to go to heaven you have to believe there is one God you have to believe he has got no images he has got no photograph he has got no idols sister do you believe in one God yeah I believe Hindu only you believe in Hindu god do you believe that God has got idols no God is not idle so do you believe in idle worship Idol version I am believing also believe me not to worship yes so if God doesn't have Idol why are you worshiping the idol aren't you going against your Hindu scriptures your Hindu scripture says chapter 4 verse number 19 and read chapter 5 to verse number three of that God there is no image there is no photograph there is no painting there is no statue there is no sculpture there is no Idol so do you want to follow into scriptures or you don't want to follow you in the scriptures no I want to follow my culture only Hindu one culture not your religion my religion is Hindu only I want to follow but your Hindu religion is based on Vedas have you read the Veda sister no isn't your duty you have to read The Vedas when will you read it tomorrow or tonight I don't know I
