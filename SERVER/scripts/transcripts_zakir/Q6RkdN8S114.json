  "transcript": "first we'll discuss the importance of the first 10 days of the ledger this is a forgotten sunnah of a beloved partner you may have sinned all year you may have missed doing good deeds in the month of ramadan you may have missed the last 10 nights of ramadan you may have missed doing good deeds doing later this is your opportunity make the best of it the first 10 days of the religion even if you have not seen the whole year maybe you did some minor sins maybe you did ibadah in the month of ramadan even you might have got the last ten nights of ramadan even you might have prayed the full night of life other yet you cannot afford as a muslim the opportunity during the first 10 days of the year most of us muslims we are normally aware of the importance of ramadan and we prepare ourselves and i remember when i was a kid more than 30 years back when i was in school about 45 years back we used to prepare ourselves for amna and we knew the importance of ramadan even of the last 10 nights of ramadan but we never heard about the importance of the first 10 days of the religion alhamdulillah now since social media has started this is being discussed by the speaker that my time when i was a kid when i was in school when i just entered college we never heard the speaker speaking about the importance of 10 days of the richard i remember the first time i heard was maybe about 15 years back in the social media when we got involved in the field of dhawa more than 25 30 years back that's the time we came to know about the importance of the first 10 days of religion and it was about 15 years back that the first time i heard in the social media a speaker speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of the rajya and alhamdulillah year by year it's increasing and more and more people are speaking about the importance of the first 10 days of delinquent that is the reason i thought i will dedicate the major portion of this session today to the first end of the year allah takes an oath in surah fajr chapter number 89 verse number one to two allah says by fajr by dawn by the ten nights and the mufassirin they say these ten nights that allah is taking oath of refers to the first ten days of religion and in many languages when you speak about the days that include the night when you speak about the night it includes the day for example if i say in english i spend 10 days in london but naturally it includes i spend 10 days and 10 nights in london depending upon the context it may include the full day it may include part of the day it may include the night it may not include similarly when allah when in arabic when the nights are referred to it may refer to the night only it may refer to the night and they put together or it may refer to the day only in this surah al-fajr surah number 89 verse number one to two when allah says fajr by dawn by the ten knights the mufassirin say and it's also mentioned in india volume number eight page number 413 and if you refer to the summarized version printed the english translation by madara salam it is volume number 10 page number 468. if nikaceter and minimum facility say that these ten nights refer to the first 10 days of the rija and they agree that these first 10 days of dulija are better than all the other days of the year it's even better than the last 10 days of ramadan but it's mentioned rebellion volume number five page number 412 that though the first 10 days of villager are the best days of the full year the last 10 nights of ramadan are the best nights of the year the scholars differ some scholars few do say that the first 10 days of the are better than the last 10 nights of ramadan there are few scholars who say the last 10 nights are better than the first tenders of the religion but the right opinion and the correct opinion is she called islam and he rightly said that the first 10 days of dullika are the best days in the full year it is even better than the last 10 days of ramadan but the last 10 nights of ramadan they are the best nights in the full year because it has the qatar it is the best night in the full year so the last 10 nights of ramadan are the best nights because it is and amongst the days in the full year the first 10 days of dulija are the best days in the year because it has the yamul arafa the the second place where the quran refers to the first lines of the elijah is in surah al-hajj chapter number 22 verse number 28 allah says that they witness the benefits which have been provided and they celebrate the name of allah through the days appointed here these days are referring to the first 10 days of the religion and ibm may allah have mercy on him he writes in fotalabari that these first ten days of dulija are the only 10 days in the full year where any muslim can simultaneously perform all the five pillars all the five harad of islam if he wants to yes he can implement on the vahid he can offer salah some it's listed together in the first 10 days he can give zakat if he hasn't given or give obligated charity or give extra charity he then fast and he can also perform hajj these are the only days in the full year where a person can simultaneously perform all the five pillars of islam it is mentioned in say bihari volume number two hadith number 969 ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him he said that the beloved prophet muhammad said there are no good deeds done on any other day better than done during the first 10 days of the luja done during these days and the sahabas the companion they asked not even jihad and the prophet replied not even jihad unless a person puts in danger his life and wealth in the way of allah and does not return with any that means he goes for jihad and he's martyred in the way of allah that means a beloved prophet muslim said the good deeds done during the first 10 days of the are better than any deed done on any other days of the year including unless if the person is martyred and he loses his wealth and life during jihad that's the only one good deed which cannot be better otherwise the deeds done on the first day of the religion better than any deed than on any other day of the year and the same message is repeated in al dharami hadith number 1925 where it's mentioned abner passed me allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet peace be upon him said that no deeds done are better our more precious are more important than the deeds done on yamal arafa and the companion asked not even jihad and the prophet said not even jihad unless a person goes out in the way of allah with his life and wealth and does not return with any that means he's martyred so this same message is repeated again in another say hadith that the deed done on the first 10 days of the religion are better than any deeds done on any other day of the year except a person who is martyred in the way of allah while doing jihad it is so important and unfortunately this sunnah of doing good deeds during the first ten days of dhulijah is forgotten it's further mentioned in sahih muslim point number three hadith number 2747 when the prophet was asked regarding fasting on yom arafa the prophet said it expiates the sins of the previous year and the coming year that means the most important fast after the further fast of ramadan is fasting on your arafa it is the most it expects your sins of the previous year as well as the coming year there are some scholars who say that the fasting of ashura the 10th of maram is the most important because there's a hadith that the most important fast after the first part is the fasting on yamalashara but the different opinion but the correct opinion is that your arafat fasting is fast superior because it expedites the sins of the previous year and the following year whereas fasting on ashura expiates only the sins of the previous year but there's unanimous agreement that these two fast of your arafah and fasting on ashura are the two most important fast after the fasting of the month of ramadan it's mentioned in sunnah one number three hadith number 2437 that the wise of the prophet said that the messenger of allah fasted during the first nine days of the rija and during ashura and three days every month the first monday and two thursdays so from this hadith we come to know that the prophet fasted the first nine days of dhulaja that means it is highly recommended to fast on all the first nine days of the luja one may ask why not fast all the tenders of the rija nan said is given in say buhari vomit number three hadith number one 991 where the beloved prophet said that he forbade fasting on israel fitter and because these are the two eids of celebration of eating and drinking so it is prohibited to fast on the two either end either and either other that is the reason we don't have to fast the first 10 days of dholuja though the first 10 days are the most important days of the year we only fast during the first nine days of the lecture it's further mentioned inside muslim world number three hadith number two six seven nine the beloved prophet muslim said that no one shall enter paradise except a believer and the days of meena are the days of eating and drinking that means a muslim should not even fast on your mutthashri the three days following the idol that is the 11th 12th and 13th of zelich because these are the days of eating and drinking and feasting so besides the eat today a muslim should not even fast on the yamaha that is the 11th 12th and 13th of delicia it's mentioned in say muslim volume number five hadith number five one one eight that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that during the first ten days of the rija a person who has an animal which he has to sacrifice he should not remove his hair not trim his nails based on this hadith a person who is sacrificing animal has animal and wants to sacrifice on each day or the following three days he should not remove his hair or trim his nails from the first day of dilija until he sacrifices animal this restriction is only for the person who is sacrificing the animal himself if a person has asked somebody else to sacrifice on his behalf then the restriction is not there it's further mentioned in muslims number five four four six abdullah bin omar may allah be pleased with him he said that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said the deeds done during the first 10 days of dulija are the most important deeds done in the full year and that's the reason you should say the tahlil is page number 462 that the mentioned there is page number 65 that abdullah bin umar and abu harera mella be pleased with them both they used to go out in the market place during the first 10 days of the rija and loudly they used to recite the takbirat and when the others used to hear him the sabbas they used to repeat on their own that means it is a sunnah during the first 10 days of the raja to say the takbirat loudly in the marketplace i have traveled to so many muslim countries i have never heard in any muslim country muslims saying loudly in the marketplace allahu akbar allah many muslim countries have gone to maybe in some gulf countries there may be people saying but when i travel i have not heard this in the marketplace we should revise this and this another hadith mentioned in jamaica media word number six hadith number three three seven seven that abu dhabda may allah be pleased with him he said that the messenger of allah asked do you know the deed which is most loved by allah the deed which is most precious to allah the deed which is more beloved to allah more than giving charity of silver and gold more than going in the battlefield and striking the necks of the enemy more beloved than having your neck truck by the enemy in the battlefield and the sabbah's asked which is that deed and the prophet replied zakar of allah now this hadith it is not specifically talking about the first 10 days of the religion it is generally the deed loved most and the all the other hadith that quoted earlier says that the deeds the good deeds done during the first standards of the are better than deeds done on any other day so imagine if you do the zika of allah during the first 10 days of the elixir especially go out in the marketplace and say loudly the allahu akbar allah it is much better than distributing gold or silver in the marketplace much better than striking the enemy on the neck in the battlefield or being stuck by the enemy on your neck in the battlefield let us revive the sunnah and during these ten days of the rija recite the sakbirath on our own and even in the marketplace and the 10 days of dullija are starting from tomorrow in most of the countries in malaysia where now it is close to 12 midnight the dull ninja has already started the night has started but the day will start approximately five hours 50 minutes from now inshallah malaysia is one of the few countries where the first ten days of the will start and later on the other countries the gulf countries four hours later five hours later so on and so forth so that's the reason i thought it's important for me to speak on this topic so let us decide today that these 10 days of the ledger which are starting from tomorrow in most of the countries in some countries it may be one day later india pakistan etc in some countries it may be two days later but most of the countries it did inshallah starting from tomorrow so let us make the most of these first 10 days of the lecture"
