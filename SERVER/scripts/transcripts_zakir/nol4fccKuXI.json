  "transcript": "I've given the talk on Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him in the major world religious scriptures but today my topic specifically is Muhammad peace be upon him in the Bible today my main purpose is to prove to the Christian that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him has been prophesized in the Bible if the Christian do not believe that Quran is the word of almighty God I will prove from their scriptures the Bible which the Christians believe is the word of God that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is also mentioned in your [Applause] Bible First we'll discuss about the prophecies in the Old Testament the Bible if we analyze is divided into two parts the Old Testament and the New Testament the Old Testament deals with the stories of all the prophet from the first prophet that is Adam peace be upon him up to the prophets before Jesus peace be upon him and New Testament deals with the stories and the life of prophet Jesus peace be upon Him according to the Catholic version of the Bible the DU version there are 73 books in the Bible if you read the Protestant version of the Bible they have thrown out seven books from the Old Testament which they call as Apocrypha Apocrypha means doubtful so the Bible of the Protestants contains 66 books the Old Testament of the Protestants contains 39 books and the Old Testament of the Catholics contains 46 books the New Testament of both Catholics and Protestants contain 27 book books first we'll discuss the prophecy of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him in the Old Testament Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 7 verse number 157 they follow the messenger the unlettered prophet who is mentioned in the scriptures the law and the gospel if you read the Old Testament there is a very explicit Prophecy in the old test Testament in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 where almighty God says I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee and I shall put my words into his mouth and he shall speak all that I command him when we ask the Christians that who does this prophecy refer to and most of the Christians say this prophecy refers to no one but Jesus Christ CHR peace be upon him and when we ask them that how does this prophecy refer to Jesus Christ peace be upon him they tell us this prophecy says I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee like unto Moses peace be upon him so this prophecy says the prophet to come would be like Moses peace be upon him and the only Prophet who is like Moses peace be upon Him is Jesus Christ peace be upon him and when we ask them how is Jesus peace be upon him like Moses peace be upon him so they give us two reasons number one Moses peace be upon him was a Jew Jesus Christ peace be upon him was a Jew Moses peace be upon him was a prophet of God was a spiritual leader Jesus Christ peace be upon him was a prophet of God was a spiritual leader these two similarities are sufficient to prove that Jesus peace be upon him has been prophesized in Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 I tell these Christians that if these two similarities are the only two points for fulfillment of the prophecy that the person should be a Jew and he should be a prophet then all the prophets mentioned in the Old Testament after Moses peace be upon him all the prophets mentioned in the bible after Moses peace be upon him like Solomon Ezekiel Isaiah Daniel Joel HOSA John the Baptist all of them were Jew and all of them were prophets of God so all these prophets mentioned in the bible after Moses peace be upon him they fulfill the prophecy what is so unique about Jesus Christ peace be upon him so I am here to help the Christians I am here to make the Christians understand the Bible better and if I'm wrong the Christians are welcome during question answer time to correct me"
