  "transcript": "the next question zebra moomin from pune india she asks usually we see our muslim brothers and sisters aren't as successful as our non-muslim counterparts is it because we are in minorities or is there any other reason we muslims what is the reason that we are in the state abroad prophet muhammad peace be upon him said it is mentioned in a hadith that the nations they will call upon each other and they will set up against you just like how the diners set on the food so the sahaba they asked that will we be small in number the prophet peace be upon him said no but you will be large in number but you will be like the froth on the sea and allah subhana with allah he will remove the fear of you from the hearts of your enemies and he will cast one in your hearts the sahaba they asked what is one so below prophet muhammad peace be upon him he said the love of this world and the hatred for death unfortunately we love the life of this world and many a times we tend to love the things in this world and we forget the home of the hereafter which is eternal the life of the year after it is eternal and that should be our prime focus the ummah it is in decadence the muslims are divided today we are away from the teachings of the glorious quran strongly and be not divided the rope of allah it is the glorious quran we need to stick to the teachings of the glorious quran so this is very important and along with that we need to follow the sayings of our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him prophet muhammed peace be upon him he said that i have left behind two things if you stick to it you will not go astray and that is the glorious quran and the authentic sayings of prophet muhammed peace be upon him if we stick to these two things we muslims we will not go astray we muslims we need to be united on the glorious quran we need to follow the teachings of our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him and we will not go astray look at the lifestyle of our blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him look at the lifestyle of the sahaba they were the best generations the sahaba they were torch bearers of the world the prophet peace be upon him he created human beings who were taught bearers of the world he delivered the message to the sahaba who were taught bearers of the world and what was the reason that they were so successful because they had trust in allah they followed the commandments of a beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him they gave preference to the life of the year after more than the life of this world from the 8th to 13th century it was known as the dark ages dark for who for the europeans but it was the best age for the muslims after the time of the sahaba because there was so much advancement of science and technology the muslims they were front in the aspects of the world when it came to advancements and today we are divided what is the reason for our downfall we do not follow the quran nor do we follow the teachings of our blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him if we follow the quran and the teachings of our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him we will inshallah be on top of the world we need to stick to these two teachings and inshallah we'll be on top of the world coming to your last part of the question wherein you said that these non-muslims they are successful what do you mean by success is success based on wealth is it based on richness but the true success is the success in the hereafter you may not be successful in this world but in the year after you will have the true success many non-muslims they may be successful in this world but in the year after they do not have their share as allah says in surah chapter number 2 verse 155 and we shall surely test you with something of fear and hunger and some loss of lives so give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere i would repeat we need to stick to the teachings of the glorious quran and the teachings of our blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him and we muslims we will be on top of the world and we will not go astray"
