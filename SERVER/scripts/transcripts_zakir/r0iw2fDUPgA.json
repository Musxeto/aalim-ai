  "title": "Can Muslims keep Non-Muslims as Friends - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "in the Quran which many of the Muslims they misunderstand Allah says chapter number four verse number 144. where Allah says all you who believe take not for awliya the unbelievers in preference to the Believers and many of the translations they translate the Arabic word awliya as friends so the translation reads that o you who believe do not take for friends unbelievers and preference to believers which I feel it's a wrong translation the correct translation is the word awliya should be translated as someone who's a protector so the right translation is that or you who believe do not take from protect us unbelievers in preference to believers do not take for protectors non-muslims in preference to Muslims and the same message repeated in Surah maida chapter number five verse number 57 and 58 that all you who believe do not take for friends and protectors those who make a mockery of religion or take it as a sport that means all those non-muslims who take your Deen as a mockery or as a sport do not keep friendship with them no go to them for protection these verses of the Quran are very clear but otherwise keeping acquaintanceship with a non-muslim keeping normal friendship with a non-muslim is no problem at all under normal circumstances we should treat the non-muslims with Justice and kindness in fact I say we should go a step further so that they're impressed with our religion they're impressed with our Deen and you can find several examples in the life history of the Prophet Muhammad several you can give a talk only on giving examples how the prophet dealt with the non-muslims and many of us aware of that incidence where a non-muslim he enters the mosque of the prophet and he renates the sabbas irritated they want to teach the non-muslim lesson but the prophet he stops them and he says be calm get some water and wash the floor that's it we know of the famous incidents whenever Prophet Muslim is to walk there was a non-muslim lady who used to throw dirt on the prophet every day whenever we used to walk the non-muslim ladies to throw dirt one day when the prophet walks below the house of the non-muslim lady no dirt falls on him so he's surprised he goes to a house to find out why was no dirt thrown today and he realizes that she was sick and he prays for a shifa and that non-muslim lady she's so impressed with the prophet that she accepts Islam where the example in the seat of the Prophet Muslim that there was a Jew by the name of said the prophet had borrowed some money from him but before the time was due that Jew he comes to the prophet and it demands for the money back and he's rude he speaks brutally to the prophet that give my money back and the time was not yet up he gets angry and he says oh enemy of God had it not been for the treaty between the Muslims the Jews are as chopped off your head for speaking to the prophet like that that he was a man of Justice he gets irritated how could someone speak to the prophet of Allah like that the prophet immediately intervenes and he tells that be calm that gives this Jew his money back and add to it the amount of 20 gallons because we frightened him because frightened him the man did not have the right to ask the money because the time wasn't yet up the time wasn't due yet because he frightened that non-muslim the prophet said besides giving the money back to him add 20 gallons worth because he had fight in the Jew and alhamdulillah prophet and accepts Islam so generally the Muslims should be kind and just to the non-muslims we have to be the right example so that they realize we are the followers of the religion of peace a Muslim is a person who acquires Peace by submitting evil to Allah so as far as general dealing is concerned we have to be kind and just but there is a caution which always mentioned in my talk whenever I am dealing with this topic that keeping non-muslim friends is no problem as long as you are having an influence on that non-muslim if it's the wife versa then there is a danger if the non-muslim friend is having a greater influence on you then there is a problem because whenever there is a relationship between two human beings and when you keep on meeting very often no one can tell me that nothing happens either you are influencing him or he's influencing you you can't say that nothing is happening so if you are having influence on him alhamdulillah continue the relationship so that he understandslam better but if he's having influence on you then be careful you may follow his path which may be wrong so here if it's a relationship in which your Deen is in danger then I feel you have to discontinue that relationship you have to be careful the Quran is very clear as far as protection is concerned if there are two options believer and unbeliever a Believer is preferable at all times the worst is do not take unbelievers for protect us in preference to believers so as far as your Deen is not in danger and if you are having influence on the non-muslim alhamdulillah and I I have hundreds of non-muslim friends mashallah hundreds Hindus questions many and almost all that I know they respect me masha'allah they know that I speak about the religion yet alhamdulillah they respect me so as long as you are having influence on them it's very good"
