  "title": "How can I do Ibadah during the last ten nights of Ramadhaan as I am suffering from migraine",
  "transcript": "the first question is from shaima from Birmingham UK I want to do ibada during the last 10 nights of Ramadan I am suffering from migraine and my doctor has strictly advised me not to stay away late at night please advise me what should I do before I reply to a question I would like to tell the sister that you can ask a simple question to your doctor and ask him that if you have a business deal during night time where you may have to spend 10 nights awake for the business deal and there are very high chances that in that business deal you will make 100 million dollars profit then ask your doctor that even though your migraine should you go ahead with the business deal or not and I'm sure that all the doctors in the world when they hear that 99 chances 100 chances you are going to make a profit of 100 million dollars and you have a migraine and you have to stay awake for 10 nights they will never tell you not to stay away they will give you ways how you can stay awake and if the doctor doesn't agree with you to stay awake I'm sure you will not listen to the doctor now coming to the question what should you do when you have migraine and when you want to do about that in the last 10 nights and thereafter advised you not to stay awake first you have to understand that what is the importance of the last 10 nights of Ramadan and I started this session by quoting a Surah from the goddess Quran that is Surah al-qadar chapter number 97 verse number one to five Allah says foreign in the ninth of power what do you know what is this the night of power is better than a thousand months down angels and the Spirit by the permission of Allah by every errand if it is until the mono from this Surah we come to know that is better than a thousand months if you calculate it comes to 83.33 years it's Luna yes in solar years it is more than 80 years that means this one-ninth is better than the life of an average human being some human being died and earlier that the age of 20 some 40 some 50 some 80 some 90 but the average human being lives for approximately 75 years if it's a male in the world and about 79 years if it's a female so this night of power is better than the complete life of an average human being and there awareness Hadith is talking about the benefits of life and if you do about that during these last 10 nights the amount of benefits you'll get your sins will be forgiven the chances of going to Paradise is tremendous and on and on you can give a talk and last Ramadan session are given a full talk on this and the prophet has advised us Muslims that seek foreign [Music] for all 10 nights and 10 days if not at least in the last 10 nights and the prophet gave if not 10 nights then then seven nights or the odd nights in the last 10 nights or the last five nights and the three nights or 27 there are various options but the best is during all the last 10 nights so that you are sure that you get the blessings and if you compare what are the blessings of prey and doing ibadah in the last 10 nights especially in the night of life who said that if you offer to rakasala the sunna Salah before the Fajr Salah it is more valuable than the world and the wealth in it so imagine every day when you offered turaka sunna Salah before the Fajr Salah it is more valuable than the world and the wealth in it so what's the value of the farsala which is equal to doing a mother your full life what will be its value it will be billions of times more than the value of this full world and what's the value of the world it's zillions of dollars so if you compare it with this where is the question that the doctor the doctor may not be aware what are the benefits of life that is the reason you're giving a simple example if I have a deal where I have to stay awake for 10 nights complete nights I have a migraine and I make 100 million dollars he will give you 10 different solutions how you can solve the problem he may tell you okay sleep at daytime and stay awake at night or you may tell that normally when you sleep at about 10 o'clock at night time okay take a Panadol or if the headache doesn't work and all take Panadol extra there are various options there are 10 different options but surely he will never tell you that Mr business team that's the reason I would blame you that you have not explained the benefits to your doctor and if you're the foolish doctor and tells you that yet you should sleep then you can go to another doctor or you can surely find out a better way I will give one example Suppose there is a fire in your house and you're about to go to sleep your normal time of sleeping is 10 pm in the night because you cannot stay awake late or 9 pm in the night I mean about to go to sleep a fire breaks out in your house will you phone the doctor and ask him now the fire has broken out should I sleep I've got migraine if I don't sleep I get a headache what will you do you will not phone the doctor you will put off the fire because you know imagine if you miss if you do not do a bada during the last 10 nights of Ramadan what are you missing you're missing your full life a brother it is billions and zillions of times more expensive than your house so at that time you will not phone the doctor you will see to it that even if you have to stay awake the full night you will and put off the fire so that you save whatever you can of your house so here you should realize that every Muslim if they know the importance of the night of power of never ever really ever dream of wasting even a single minute leave aside the full night even wasting a single minute of any of the 10 nights of life the difference is that those people who realize the importance they ask for forgiveness they repent and the messenger of Allah has given dwas which you can recite during this night you can do as many Good Deeds as possible and inshallah inshallah this will be a makharat it will be a golden opportunity to obtain Jannah in the akhara very easily"
