  "transcript": "second definition of terms if you like is Psalm or fast as it's sometimes or mostly it's translated in English um could you shed some light on what are the implications of the term fast or psalm is that a big word which is singular CR Miss plural in Arabic is derived from the word summer which means to abstain or to restrain from the normal things whether it be eating drinking or talking and a person who observes some abstains from this thing is called as asym and this word is used in the Quran in surimarium chapter number 19 verse number 26 when the angel speaks to Mary Mela be pleased with her who is the mother of Jesus Christ peace be upon him and this word is used and if you read this word says that I have vowed to fast to Allah but here the meaning of the word Psalm fast doesn't mean refraining from eating or drinking it means refraining for speaking because when we grow the context when we read one verse before in the Quran sorry Maryam chapter number 19 verse number 25 it says that Allah says to Mary may Allah that shake the palm tree towards yourself and the ripe dates will fall and the next verse surimarium Chapter 19 Verse 26 says they eat and drink from them and then it says that when you meet any human being tell them I have vowed to fast for Allah and I will not speak to any human being so because here it says about speaking the word Psalm used here means that to abstain from speaking but the word psalm in Islamic terminology in the Islamic Sharia it means a person who does an act of worship and with intention he does it for the sake of Allah and he or she abstains from eating drinking or nourishment as well as from section into cost or from lustful ejaculation in short the word form in Islam means a person who abstains from the fast breakers and the fast breakers the things that break the fast are food where they taken by mouth or by nose or drink any kind of drink whether it be water milk fruit juice any drink taken from mouth or nose or any nourishment for the body taken from any source as well as abstaining from a sexual intercourse in short it means abstaining the stomach and the private part this is what it means islamically and this is the basic meaning but if you go ahead with the broader meaning it does not mean only abstaining the stomach and the sexual part from the things that break the fast it even means that along with the fasting of the stomach and the sexual parts there is fasting of the tongue of the eyes of the ears and the other limbs of the body that is the reason when we use the word Psalm our beloved Prophet Muhammad said let's mentioned in say buhari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1903 a beloved Prophet said that a person who does not abstain does not leave false action and false speech obsolete Etc Allah does not require of him to abstain from food and drinking that means beside abstaining from food and drink you also have to abstain from false speech false actions Etc and this message is further repeated number one Hadith number one zero six eight a blood Prophet said that a person while fasting many abstains from food and drink he should also abstain from first speech from obscene language and if a person gets angry and if he argues with him or fights with him he should say I am fasting I am fasting so if we look at it when a person fast there are basically three things that you should abstain from number one is the stomach and the private parts they should abstain from things that break the fast that is food drink and sexual lacking the second is that the other parts of the body the tongue the eyes the ears the limbs even they should fast fasting of the tongue means a person should abstain from backbiting should abstain from sandering from telling a lie should abstain from gossiping I have print from rumor mongering abstain from vulgarity fasting of the eyes means he should abstain from looking at things which are unlawful like when is lower his case he should not watch unislamic movies or understanding things fasting of the years means should abstain from hearing things which are Haram which are prohibited like abstain from listening to music abstain from listening to songs which aren't Islamic so this is the way how the other parts of the body also fast and the third thing is the fasting of the heart and the mind they should abstain from things which take away person from the worship of Allah from the vikar of Allah so this overall is the meaning of the word psalm"
