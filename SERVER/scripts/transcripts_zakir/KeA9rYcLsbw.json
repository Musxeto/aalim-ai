  "transcript": "sir my name is gil roy from bombay i'm a businessman and thank you for the opportunity to speak here i've really enjoyed today my first time now many muslim countries do not permit conversion out of islam but correct me if i'm wrong i don't know of any non-muslim majority country which prohibits people from converting into islam now what what is the right thing in islam because as you say you know you don't need the sword for islam and thousands and millions of followers will anyway get into islam what would be your response the brother asked a very good question and a very important question that why don't some of the muslim countries allow conversion or allow propagation they don't allow the propagation to take place they do not allow conversion from anyone to convert muslim to a non-muslim basic question whether it be anyone brother as far as the propagation is concerned there are countries for example saudi arabia which does not allow propagation the only country which i know very well which does not allow propagation in saudi arabia and the reason is that suppose brother you want to start a school if you want to start a school you are taking an interview of a match teacher so when you take the interview of the match teacher you ask the question 2 plus 2 is equal to how much so one math teacher says 2 plus 2 is equal to 3 the second math teacher says 2 plus 2 is equal to 4 the third math teacher says 2 plus 2 is equal to 5. now many people say what's the problem let them preach any religion whoever wants to accept let them accept i will ask a question will you allow a match teacher in your school to teach two plus two is equal to three will you select the math teacher who says two plus equal to five you say no i know mads i'm definite about it n max two plus two is equal to four and nothing else so as far as religion is concerned saudi arabia is very confirmed it agrees with the verse of the quran in surah imran chapter 3 verse number 19 in nadine in the islam the only religion acceptable in the side of almighty god is peace acquired by submitting evil to almighty god they will not allow anyone else to preach anything wrong but in science and technology they say to the americans hell and versailles most will come they get people from england they get people from india no problem in science technology they're not number one so in science and technology they have people coming from america from england from singapore from philippines from india from all over the world but as far as dean is concerned they are talk sure the hundred percent sure this is right same as you are sure that two plus two is equal to four you will not allow any wrong teachings same way i agree with that i am a student of compared religion brother there is no religious scripture on the face of the earth besides the quran which says that this is the only true religion you read the scriptures of the hindus you read the scripture of the christian the bible nowhere does the bible say that christianity is right the word christianity doesn't exist in the bible do you know that the word christianity doesn't exist in the bible the word hindu doesn't exist in the vedas do you know that nowhere does the vedas say that this is the only right religion nowhere does the bible say that this is the only right religion so quran is the only religious scripture on the face of the earth where almighty god says emphatically in the islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of almighty god is islam so as far as preaching propagating and religion is concerned i'm sure that if you know what is confirmed they will not allow anyone else to preach something which is wrong this india it's a secular country it's not a hindu country it's in the constitution of the people for the people by the people i'm an indian geographically i'm a hindu because i'm an indian but practicing muslim i'm a practicing muslim it's my birth right in this country to preach propagate and practice this religion that is what is in the constitution so you have to change your constitution"
