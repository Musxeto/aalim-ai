  "transcript": "assalamualaikum my name is mehdi ahmadi i'm a researcher in history political science and i'm currently studying in computer science my question is is pertaining to jaatu or magic or why whatever name you would like to address it i won't go into specifics but a certain family member recently found a piece of paper in which was supposedly some elements of negativity which they felt was of of this nature and they themselves indulged in similar practices to um to obtain a um a remedy for it believing that you know this is wrong i was wondering if we could um shed some light on this matter well there's a question that what do i have to say about black magic and what's the remedy as far as black magic is concerned there is something like black magic the quran mentions that in surah mentioned surah bakra there's black magic it does exist but we should not involve in black magic we should not do it we should have faith in allah subhanahu ta'ala and as far as the remedy is concerned the last two surah the most attained surah and surah naas were revealed for this these two surahs are the remedy for black magic now see one thing is that normally whenever people think that something has possessed first thing is allah says ask the person who has knowledge so rene chapter 16 number 43 chapter 21 verse number 7 go to a doctor if the doctor doesn't tell you the treatment or cannot treat the disease go to a psychiatrist most of the people who claim to have black magic they can be cured by doctors and psychiatrists there can be possibilities that actually ajin may have come and black magic may have taken place but that case you can follow the guidance of quran sunnah you can go to a person who's an expert in this field but i'm sorry to say most of the people who experts in this field who claim more than 99 are fake more than 99 are going to mia it is my analysis more than 99 percent who claim that they can cure black magic they are frauds the moment you realize asking from you money that means he's trying to make a fast buck do they do that give me so much money thousand pound two thousand pounds he's trying to make a fast buck out of it so there are people who are experts in this field i know a couple of them in saudi arabia mashallah they're very knowledgeable i don't know if anyone else otherwise so if he's knowledgeable we should realize that if we give the treatment from quran and sunnah died we have to go to a specialist who specialize in the field hope to answer the question [Applause]"
