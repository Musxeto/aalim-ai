  "transcript": "next question from brother kursid akhbar from karnataka india allah says in the quran that if all of you from the first to the last come and worship me it will not increase in my greatness if this is the matter then why does he order us to worship him what the brother is asking that if all of you come and worship me will not increase my greatness it's not a verse of the quran there are similar verses i'll come to it later on what the brother is referring to is a hadith inside muslim word number six hadith number 6572 where our beloved partner said that allah says oh my slaves if the first of you and the last of you if all the men and if all the jinns if they were equal to the most pious person whose heart is the most pious heart in the full world if the piety is equal to that party of the most pious man on the face of the earth it will not increase in my dominion that means it will make no benefit for me and allah continues oh my slaves the first of you and the last of you the men and the jinn if all of you are equal to the most evil person the evilest person in the whole of humanity if all the men and gin are equal to the most evil person it will not reduce even a bit from my dominion oh my slaves if the first of you and the last of you if the jinns and the human beings if all of you gather together on a strip and if they ask me whatever you want and if i give everything for whatever you want it will not reduce in my dominion the loss would not be greater than when a needle is dipped in an ocean i am recording and will repeat all this to you so that if you realize you will pray the last allah if you don't then you will be to blame from here we come to know that irrespective whether you are very pious or you worship allah it will not increase in allah's greatness or in dominion if you are very bad if you are evil it will not make any loss to allah if you ask anything what you want and allah gives you everything yet it will not reduce in the dominion of allah it is like if you dip a needle in the ocean even that much will not be the loss in allah which says that if you strive for your work allah does not require any of the wants of any of his creations allah does not have the need of any of his creation allah repeats a similar message in surah chapter 35 verse number 15 that it is you who are in need of allah is not in need of anyone and is free of all wants so these were the quran say allah doesn't require anything from his creation coming to the question then why is allah asking us to worship him allah says in the quran in surah haryat chapter number 51 verse number 56 that allah has created the jinn and the men not but to worship him what is the reason the reason allah subhana wa tala wants you to worship him is not so that he will benefit it is because you will benefit and how will you benefit if you worship him see when we worship the best form of worship is allah in our salah the most important thing that you have to recite without which the salah is not complete it surah is consists of seven verses it is the first chapter of the glorious quran it is called as umur quran the mother of the quran it is called the major quran if you read surah fatiha the first three verses it says alhamdulillah praise be to allah the lord of the words the merciful the gracious malik the master of the day of judgment the first three verses of the quran are praising allah alhamdulillah praise be to allah the lord of the worlds the most merciful the most gracious the master of the day of judgement here why are we praising allah the reason we play is because it is human psychology the moment you start praising someone you start following him for example if your mother is sick and if someone on the street a person comes and tells you do this treatment so that your mother who has got a heart attack she will be cured and there's another person who you know is the most famous heart specialist in the world he comes and tells you regarding the treatment for your mother who had a heart attack who will you follow will you follow the unknown person on the street or will you follow the advice of the heart specialist a famous heart specialist in the world but naturally you will follow the advice of the heart specialist because it's famous the moment you know that he is the person who is the best heart specialist will follow his advice similarly here when you say allahu akbar allah is the greatest allah is the most wise allah is hakeem he's the most merciful we are praising allah not because it will benefit him because the moment you start praising him then surah fatiha continues it says we are telling that we only worship [Music] of those they have earned their favor and not the battle of those who have constrained here we realized that the first three was the first chapter of the quran then we are saying you only ask him for help and no one else and then we say show us the straight path and then the path of those they have earned them in favor and not the path we have gone astray so this is the most important part of the salah then the full quran is the guidance of allah what you should do and what you should not do you have to give zakat you should do hajj you should fast you should not cheat you should not murder all these things so alhamdulillah the reason allah is asking us to worship him is because the reason allah is asking us to praise him if we say allah or a thousand times it will not make allah great at all he's already the greatest even if you abuse allah knows bella it will not make allah know allah is always the greatest he will remain the reason we praise him is because then we praise him we follow his advice and the full quran is the advice to the human being how you should lead your life so the reason allah asked us to worship him is not because we benefit him it will benefit the human beings we praise him so that we realize we have to follow one who is the greatest with the most wise with the most knowledgeable so it will benefit us it will keep us healthy it will insha allah take us to generating faith so the reason we worship him we praise him it's not for his benefit he doesn't require it it is for our benefits"
