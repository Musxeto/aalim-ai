  "title": "Priya asks Dr Zakir, “Why was Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) the last Prophet and no other Prophet...?”",
  "transcript": "my name is Priya Priya okay first of all I would like to thank you for opening my eyes to how important it is to not follow any faith or religion blindly now I realize how important it is to have questions to what you should and should not follow blindly so my question is for why was prophet Muhammad peace be upon him only the last prophet and no one after to guide in the sinful world [Applause] [Music] Muhammad peace be upon him finally messenger why we'll know the messenger come after him that's a very good question people also ask me that why wasn't Prophet Muhammad said the first and Quran revealed first no problem both questions are valid both are valid like my son says that I want to become a doctor why don't you put me medically College directly I said no but first you have to go my son to the nursery first 100 seconds so Allah our creator he knows the human being the best he knows what is the final message he knows that the human beings have not yet developed to receive the last and final message so therefore all the previous messages that came they give the basic message of tahit believing one God the Quran is the last and final messenger of it is the perfect and the final message all the other message was perfect but they were in brief like when you go to Nursery you study A B C D and then you keep on going ahead then mathematics one two three four two plus two is equal to four then you study other things multiplication division and you keep on evolving similarly Allah knew that when human beings were there first he gave them simple message depending upon the development and Allah thought 1400 years ago was the right time that now human beings have developed two assimilate the Quran but the beauty of the Quran is Allah knew that human being would further develop but the minimum requirement to receive the Quran was 1400 years ago human being mean that they since hundreds of thousands and millions of years you don't know we don't know so what did Allah do Allah reveals the last and final message the Quran and the last and final messenger mama because when the last message comes it has a time period and the last messenger comes is the final messenger so Allah revealed the last and final message Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 5 verse number three on this day have I completed your religion for you and have chosen Islam for you and have completed my favor for you Allah is telling the human being on this day this was the last verse of the Quran to be revealed I have completed my religion for you and has chosen for you Islam now once Allah has completed the religion nothing new can be added nothing can be subtracted if something is added that means the previous thing wasn't complete correct I like five ten fingers if you are 11 it's not complete so Allah has completed the Deen and completed the last and final Revolution the Quran by the last and final messenger well this mentioned as I said in my lecture chapter 33 verse number 40. that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is not the father of you men but he's a messenger of Allah and she loved the prophets now why now when Allah reveals the last and final message the human means keep on developing and we understand the Quran better science that develop the way we understand the Quran now we understand a little bit better of the Quran because developed but the message is the same now since the message will not change we don't declare a messenger so what does Allah tells the Muslim tells the Muslim it is your duty now to deliver the message and I said in my talk Allah says so because there will be no other messenger because therefore messenger comes there has to be a message so the scholars and the guys the people with excellent knowledge and the dais Who deliver the message they are the torch bearers they deliver the message to make people understand therefore it is our duty To Go in different parts of the world and deliver the message to the whole of humankind so no one can say that the message did not reach us now once the final message is there Allah gives the time period we don't know there is a time period till when the world will end we don't know Allah knows only Allah knows when will the world end but there are signs for the end of the world in the Hadith there are minor signs and there are major signs in the minor signs in my postbook phase I have given 87 minor signs and 10 major signs in the minor signs one of the first sign minus sign for the end of the world is the coming of the last and final messenger Prophet Muslim that's a minus sign that now the world is going to end but how long will it take Allah 100 years 200 years thousand ten thousand we don't know so that was the first minor sign coming of the last and final messenger one of the first few signs earliest sign of the end of the world is then there are other many signs you can go to my Facebook then the major sign will start so the reason Allah did not get a new messenger because Quran is the last and final message there is no new message no new messenger but Allah thought to it that he told the Muslim ummah that we have to deliver the message to the others and he said that the best profession for the Muslim is the Father which I touched in my talk so because the prophet was the last messenger and so because the Quran was the last message the prophet mama and a sediment talk because you are the last messenger he was if he was not he would have been only Rama to the Arab world correct if he was if there's one more Messenger to come he would have been meant only for one group of people maybe the Arab world maybe the Quran was meant only for 100 years Thousand Years two thousand we don't know so because Allah says this is the last and final Revelation and Prophet Muhammad final messenger it is meant for the whole of humanity that there is in the status of the Prophet is higher because the status is higher and the message is higher you can see the transformation much faster today in the world more than 25 percent of the human population are Muslims today in the world the most looked down upon people in the world are the Muslims the most targeted people in the world are the Muslims the most criticized people in the world are the Muslims everyone is against us yet the message is going it is the End of Time sister so because it's the end of time there will be new there will be no other messenger but the power of the message is so strong it is encompassing many people in the world the previous people who accepted the religion Christianity Etc they were just namesake today in the world when people say Christian they don't follow Christianity the people that follow any religion practically following any religion number one is Islam so the basic answers sisters because the message is lost the message has to be lost but the message is so strong and the messenger is so loving so powerful so Universal that it's transforming the world hope to answer the question sister thank you so much [Applause] [Music] [Applause]"
