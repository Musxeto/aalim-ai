  "title": "Is it Permissible to Watch Ertugrul a Turkish TV Serial Promoting Islaam? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "it shot the mir Kashmir India as Salaam walekum doctor Saab my may Allah has mercy be upon you and your family I mean you are one of my favorite scholars I have learned a lot from your lectures may Allah give you Jedi hair let me remind you I'm just a student of Islam and comparative religion I am a dye I am NOT a scholar and the question continues there is a Turkish drama or two guru which has broken all the cords on the youtubes Muslims in the subcontinent are praising it so much that anyone who tells them not to watch it is considered anti-islamic this cereal is supported by Oregon and Imran Khan also preached it they won the literally had to pass a fatwa against it this cereal has Guerre Meryem hugging and touching each other music and a love story plus the story is also not authentic what is your naseeha advice to the youth who are wasting their time in Ramadan in this Haram CDL a similar question asked by my name is a Tzadik from Kashmir is it permissible in Islam to watch or to guru Singh in a similar question is posed by Habiba Misbah would third Pradesh India my question is that how is it to see Turkish drama or to Guru Ghazi another question similar question posed by Faisal khursheed Pakistan what does Islam say about watching drama then movies my question is in reference to the Turkish drama or to guru Ghazi which depicts which depicts the glory of Muslims during Crusades against during Crusades against the Crusaders I'm aware that we received I think hundreds of questions from the hundreds of thousands of question at least hundred question maybe or neuron orthogonal I live the answer but please don't limit this answer is not limited only talking about orthogonal series first let me tell you that I being in the field of media almost all the movies the dramas almost all 99.9% that they will not fulfill the criteria of halal some less Haram sama mahara Islam and not broken any of the criteria so let me tell you for sure that almost all the movies some ammo Haram some lesser arms from my broken the Vinayak Amira from her broken the Vinaya Sangeeta as far as orthogonal is concerned I am NOT done a deep survey on with Google so I cannot answer to everything often through good but yes I have read reports I have an article saying orthogonal is one of the best cereal in the world not only on YouTube throughout the world it has broken the code even of Hollywood that's how I came to know about this cereal called article it is made in Turkey and what I read 157 episode each episode was for about two hour 15 minutes and some weight is going into three 157 episodes of the cereal was then it has been translating to various languages of the world or do English many dubbing are then to umpteen number of languages that is no Netflix etc yes what I came to row from articles that I read and what little bit you know it is less it is it cannot be fully permissible because there are lady actors which are not in hijab so it cannot be hundred percent halal there is music in it which again cannot be around as the brothers said there is hot feel that said no but surely it is not like normal movies like Bollywood and Hollywood movie there is no smooching there is no lovemaking scene that cetera yes shaking hands hugging etc not like the volume movie The Hollywood movie third if it is not it doesn't have those bigger harem but yes there are lady is not in her job there is music in it there are certain things short about Islam which is against Kida there are certain things which is against the paw Heath so surely it is not totally Islamic at all so no one can give you Fatah that watching is permissible but I would like to go step further that what first we realized that because of the evil that is spread throughout the world anyone who's not watching serial I would recommend this is Haram for you don't watch it at all please if you are not if if you're not watching movies because it's Haram if you are not watching serial my recommendation is read the Quran it will get you closer to a las manos Allah read the Hadees that will get you closer to Allah smart Allah read the Sira it will get you closer to a las marathon but those people who are addicted to movies there are many Muslims millions of Muslims in the world who I know they addicted to movies even if they may not be addicted to the very vulgar movies they addicted to the normal Hollywood movies and Bollywood movies which is a Farah they may not be watching pornography but they are watching the normal Bollywood movies in which the ladies are dressed with with with with with with skirts and with with you know revealing the body more than covering it there are music there are song away from Islam so if such a person who's hooked on to the normal Bollywood movie and the normal Hollywood movie hooked on to the normally serials that you see in the Star TV or the Zee TV or or the other serial and all of them almost all a Haram this is less Haram then the Bollywood movies in the Hollywood movies surely there are no love making scenes they may be a little bit honey that's what I'm told so based on that if a person is hooked on and he can best option for people oh god stop saying movies that's the best but if he cannot then see such cereal like orthogonal is better than seeing the Hollywood and Bollywood cereal what I had seen many years back was message and the best movie according to me that has been created in the world any movie it is message again the message movie which Arabic is our salah the method movie it was doctor was a Athena Quinn if you had the Fatima is it 100% haha even the method movie which I saw I cannot say 200% Halle because there was music there was sometimes ladies being shown which were not properly des but the way it was created the way it was made is superb it will surely get a person close to Islam but yet I cannot say 100% halal but if you want to watch a movie if you hooked on to a movie then please watch message the / series it was a series of 30 episode made few years earlier it was made by the embassy and funded by the Qatar Qatar Foundation even that I have seen that you cannot say it 100 percent Islamic there was music there was some scenes of ladies but as far as message if concern and Mercedes are concerned the the knowledge in it the the hadith is quoted the Quran is quoted it is wonderful it will surely get a person closer to Islam there is no obscenity in it that is not major Haram in it yes music is it and and hamdulillah as far as emergency visits concerned majority of the Hadees aside they may be a few here and there which may be problematic so the best amongst all I would say is you watch the message movie if you hoped on to movies if you're not don't do movies known what message if you want o cereal the best field to watch is the series of Omar series or through Google will not come on the same level as as as message it will not come in the same level as Omer series but let me tell you that suppose there is a lady who's very miniskirts and if she said okay I want to wear salwar kameez but my head is open is it permissible keeping your hair open his harem but better than wearing miniskirt so hotel that lady who is wearing miniskirts and deep neck okay stop that we're sharing our meat which cover the body completely with full sleeve covering your full body except that you seen if your head but that is multiple times better than me I cannot no no you want to reminisce cap we're fully job otherwise don't so this is this will be a foolish answer if you are very minuscule - either way job oh continue very miniskirt I haven't no the strap miniskirt wear shalwar kameez cover your full body of course covering a full body and only she show in your head is a lesson as compared to wearing miniskirts and wearing low neck so similarly those who are hooked on to serials and movies and then if they watch or through and or through girl also everything is authentic maybe 20 percent is authentic but it tries to get a person closer to Islam and try to revive your passion please let me tell you again I have not done a full survey on the orthogonals release I am NOT the a person but what reports I read based on that yes it is haram finger through girl is haram but if you hooked on and if you are watching bollywood movies and if you are watching Hollywood movies surely watching this are not watching that is better then not watching this and watching Hollywood movies I am very clear instead of watching or Hollywood or Bollywood movie I would prefer you stopping it number one if you can't stop because we hooked on to serial then watching your thrill is better than watching Bollywood and Hollywood this in short but yet it is haram but surely it will be a lesser Haram as compared to the Hollywood and Bollywood movies and inshallah this may get you closer to Islam and that time and maybe later on you may stop watching all these Haram and then follow and then hitting the Quran is the best reading the hadith is the best and it is my desire for example I I cannot make a movie even like message in if I want to because it again it's against my principles if I want I cannot even make a serial a commercial ever because it's against my participation there is a desire of mine that inshallah inshallah one day I would like to make a movie better than the method movie which is the best available but following all the principles of Islam you know we should not have any musical instrument but you can have a ceramic sound effects which are halal you know it's following all these principles it will be difficult like how we do in the pitch TV on the pitch TV masha'Allah we have no music at all we have the sound effects or human being we have the a lab and sin stuff is permissible by some of the scholars some say no we do your stuff so based on this inshallah I pray to Allah smother me fulfill my desire that one - I would like to make a movie totally Islamic following all the titles of Islam whether it be on the life of formless alsalam or maybe on the Quran or maybe on some other Islamic topic and a very high quality it's my desire so that at least we can say that is one movie of high caliber but there may be movie of low caliber which may be following Islamic principles totally I don't know of them maybe but of high caliber of high quality like the movie of message I don't know if any I pray tell us mother that may he give me the portion is d to do that inshallah before I die inshallah from the answer the question"
