  "transcript": "allowed in Islam to donate blood whether it be a Muslim or a non-muslim who requires blood the sister has a question that is it permitted in Islam for a Muslim or a Muslim or to donate blood to Muslim and non-muslim as far as blood donation is concerned or donation of any organ or any part there are three rulings that is there that if it's a must for the survival of the person we will donate that blood or the organ or the recipient it's fine the person donating should not cause a major loss to the life and third it should not be done for money so whether the person who donate an organ or blood if it's a requirement causing a major benefit for the recipient number one number two is not a major loss to the donor and number three should not be for money if these three calories are fulfilled is fine so in this criteria as far as blood donation is concerned Medical Science says that if you donate about 400 ml approximately within three months that blood is regenerated 10 liters not having a problem you may even die so yes you can donate blood if you're healthy Point number one if you're weak and you need 400 ml under the problem in your health that can also be detrimental to your health so first you do a medical checkup of the donors you feel healthy certified which most of the people generally more than 50 can donate you can donate once in every three four months if you want to the person receiving whether irrespective it's a Muslim or non-muslim I feel there's no problem because Allah says in the Quran it's a reminder chapter 5 or 32 if you save any human being it's as we have saved the whole of humankind it doesn't say if you save a Muslim to receive any human being whether Muslim or not Muslim it is as though you have saved the whole of humankind so in this context I feel there is no problem at all but see to it that you're healthy see to it it's not too often situate that the quantity is not too much if you follow these rules and if it's not for money sake then there's no problem sister hope that's the question sister"
