  "title": "God is imageless - but if someone still prays to 'Idols' will his prayers be accepted...",
  "transcript": "do we have on any of the other mics whether it be from the brothers or the sisters any non-muslims who would like to ask a question yes we have one from the brothers go-aheads first of all thanks god given this opportunity for me my name is sundar rajan basically from a hindu religion but i am not differentiating muslims and hindu or any other christian but one small doubt god doesn't have shape but even if you are going temple in hindu where you know very well there are different names of gods under different pictures and statues you know very well my question is if i am going temple if for example if i am suffering something problem if i am going temple if i pray for me god will accept or not this is my question the brother asked the question that god does not have shape but if i go to a temple and if i worship idols does god listen to me does god answer my prayer or not whether if you read bhagavad-gita bhagavad-gita is the most widely read book amongst all the scriptures of hinduism brother have you heard of bhagavad-gita i know some of thing but i'm if you read bhagavad-gita chapter number 7 verse number 20 says all those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires they worship demigods they worship false god that means if you're materialistic person you worship false god you worship demigod and further it says that those who worship false god almighty god true god yet answers your prayer but you go to the kingdom of false god that means even if you worship false god god many a time answers your prayers so that you go to the kingdom of false god same thing is mentioned in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 15 that allah gives them rope so that they may go through and fro allah says to the hypocrites for the monarchs to the kafir that allah gives them rope to go to and fro so that they will understand so many a time many a time even if you worship the false god your prayers are answered that does not mean that you are worshiping the correct god because many people think for example many of the people who are non-muslims they are wealthy they are leading a luxurious life now wealth is not the criteria for you to go to jannah it's not the criteria for you to go to paradise the quran says wealth is a test anything which good befores you it can be two things it can either be a reward from god or it can be a test from god any calamity that befalls you it can either be a punishment or it can be a test so suppose you worship a false god you go to a temple and you worship the idol just because your prayer is answered that does not mean you're worshiping the true god god is testing you you ask for wealth god gives you wealth god is testing you that do you follow the true part or not because if you read the hindu scriptures bhagavad-gita is called as the nectar of the vedas the most superior scripture amongst all the hindu scriptures are the vedas there are two type of scriptures one as shruti the other is pretty shruti is the word of god and spriti is the word of human beings so among the shruti you have the vedas and the upanishads these are the highest when you read the chando of panishad chapter number six section number two verse number one it says it's a sanskrit quotation which means god is one without a second if you read the sweta seta upanishad chapter number six verse number nine janitor of that god there are no lords he has got no parents almighty god has got no superior he has got no mother he has got no father it's mentioned number four verse number 19 which means an image a photograph a painting a picture an idol it means a portrait it means a statue so chapter of that god there is no image there is no photograph there is no painting there is no portrait there is no idols there is no statue there is no sculpture the same message repeated even [Music] of that god there is no image there is no picture there is no painting there is no portrait there is no idol there is no sculpture there is no statue so if you go back to the scriptures you realize that according to the hindu scripture almighty god has got no image that goes no statue so if you worship an image you're going against the vedas you're going against upanishad so just because you are going and praying sometimes as the bhagavad-gita says god may answer your prayer to test you that do you follow his commandment or not that does not mean that who you are worshipping is correct so that's the reason you should follow your scripture and your hindu scripture says that almighty god has got no idol has got no image has got no photographer has got no sculpture so making an idol of god an image of god a photograph of god a statue of god is prohibited in hinduism does that answer your question brother okay thank you so do you believe that god has got an idol yes do you believe god has got an idol you mean water clearly do you believe in idol worship yes so aren't you going against the scripture aren't you going against the vedas my point of view faith only brother you said that you are a hindu correct yes so do you believe in the vedas or not yes so i quoted the references from hindu scripture that your hindu scripture yajirova chapter 32 verse number 3 says that god has got no image has got no portrait has got no idol so isn't idle worship wrong you know i don't have much communication skill so that's why i would not express more you don't have to have communication skills you have to read you have to read your scripture i am quoting i am giving references from your scripture you don't have to hunt you have to go back home or we have a library in bombay islamic foundation library which we have translations of all the major scriptures in the world or you go on the internet and type go yajiro chapter 32 verse number 3 and read the translation it says almighty god has got no image that's got no photograph no painting so do you believe in the vedas or not yes i am playing so if your veda says god has got no idols will you yet go to a temple but from my childhood or not so i am going there suppose your father believes from childhood two plus two is equal to five would you believe today if they stitched from the first standard onwards then i would also same thing so if someone teaches in the village two plus two is equal to five from first standard and he comes to you so will you say two plus two is equal to five that is the first case of my knowledge then that is the way i will accept her so suppose your son goes to a school and they teach two truths equal to five will you say son no problem continue will you say that no no no no no no no no no what you will tell your son my son that teacher taught you wrong see already i studied 2 plus 2 is 4 so i cannot put my 2 plus three two is five no but if he goes to a school before admission do you interview the match teacher no no so suppose the match teacher teaches them wrong so won't you correct your son yeah i will correct it okay so that's the reason i'm correcting you i love you brother thanks because i love you i want to correct you that what you're saying is against your scripture forget what the quran says forget what the bible says if you read your hindu scriptures your hindu scripture says that god has got no image has got no picture has got no painting has got no idol so if you are doing idle worship you are going against your scripture so what i request you brother today when you go back home go on the internet type your way chapter 30 verse number three suitable chapter 4 verse number 19 and try and read the translation and tomorrow inshallah come again we are having a questionnaire session tomorrow at nine o'clock same time and inshallah we'll give you the first opportunity [Applause]"
