  "title": "How can a Person Achieve the Objectives of Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "does a person who fasts um achieve all of these objectives when he or she is fasting if a person truly fast in the right way with all its requirements inshallah he has to achieve all these objectives but when we see around us all of the people fasting don't achieve these objectives why whenever a person does Act it has got two components one is the method and second is the objective for example we human beings we eat why do it the first thing is act of eating and second thing is why do we eat what is objective of eating as far as Act of eating is concerned it contains four parts one is making the muscle number two is putting in the mouth number three is masticating it that's showing it number four is putting it down the throat but the goal the objective is to make our health the objective is to live people eat for the health reason mainly and to live but along with the main action there are ancillary things there are associated things attached which if it's not done then the objective will not be achieved for example suppose someone takes sand or sawdust and makes a morsel out of it puts it in the mouth masticates it and puts it on the throat do you think you'll achieve the objective will you achieve the health really live so there are associated things required with that similarly with fasting besides obtaining from food drink and sex from dawn to Sunset there are other things required along with it which we discussed earlier things encourage things which are recommended Etc abstain from things which are discouraged to achieve the main objective there may be some people who may do the right things or there are things for example the food that you eat it should be healthy if you make a muscle order of food which is junk food which is not hygienic and then if you have you won't achieve the objective you want to achieve good health or maybe a person has healthy food it makes a muscle out of it puts on his mouth masticates it choose it puts it on the throat but after some time he puts his finger in his throat and vomits out so will you achieve the objectives of eating that is Health not at all similarly to achieve the objective you have to have the unsolute things besides abstaining from food drink and sex abstain from false actions false speech and if you warm it out the whole purpose is defeated let me give another example example to the person who comes from the village to my city of Bombay and he says that I want to go to America so someone tells them okay purchase the ticket from Bombay to America and release America the main act to go to America you have to purchase a ticket and go by plane very easy the personal Village you purchase the ticket and he goes at the airport then they asking where is your passport what's the passport people told me I require a ticket I purchased the ticket they said no required passport it goes back and then you prepare the passport it takes him few days few weeks then he comes back again and ask him that do you have immigration clearance what is the immigration here some countries require immigration so it goes and gets back his immigration cleared then I said okay now I have to go to America so he has the ticket now you have the passport he has the migration clearance and it goes to the counter and he gives it so they shame the voting card when he goes to the immigration they ask him where is your Visa do I require a Visa also again he's stuck so he goes back and he applies for a Visa and you know to get the visa of U.S America is one of the most difficult so you apply then he finally gets it so how to go to America is we have to go by plane and you require a ticket the main Act is you have to fly in the plane and have to purchase the ticket but Associated ancillary things are that you require a passport there should be migration clearance you require a Visa a person cannot leave the country without having a passport a person cannot enter any country without having a Visa of their country so all these are associated things which understood to a person who has knowledge but the basic thing is purchasing the etiquette from Bombay to USA but even after he purchases and has all these things done for person if you compare this to fasting person abstains from eating drinking and sex from down to Sunset but the associated things are you should abstain from false speech to acquire the benefit he should stain from false action from all the things these are actually things and then he will achieve the objective now that person wants to go to America but what is his objective some people may want to go to America to study it's a country where you can get education some people want to go for sightseeing many people they want to go there for prostitution many people want to go there to have drugs some people do have alcohol some people go their formal Society because America is a country with homosexuality legal so what is the purpose that you want to go there some people want to go to America to gamble so one thing is to go to America what is your objective so some people fast not having the objective some people may fast to diet some people may fast to lose weight so then they will not achieve all these objectives Paradise forgiveness of sins they are fasting they're abstaining from food entering but the objective is losing weight so if person wants to go to America for prostitution for adultery for gambling for drinking alcohol for drugs his main other objective won't be achieved so what is the objective is important some people may want to go for education so we have to realize that all those people who truly know the ancillary Associated things along with fasting and if they know the objective which are listed in the first answer inshallah they have to achieve all of them if they don't then as the blood perfect Muslim said that it's mentioned in Hadith Hadith number one six nine zero there are many people who fast but they do not get any reward except for Hunger and there are many people who stand up in prayers their standing is of no benefit no reward except for sleeplessness"
