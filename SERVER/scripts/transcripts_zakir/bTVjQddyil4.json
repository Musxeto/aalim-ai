  "title": "How to Unite the Hindus and Muslims in India - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "[Music] sh sh [Applause] M Muslim Muslim brother as very good question that what is the suggestion from me that how can we get the Hindus and Muslims on a common platform how can we come together the reply to this is I have given a talk on similarities between Hinduism and Islam I've given that talk in bomb I've given the talk in chenai I've given in other parts of India and we find there that tens of thousands have attended in Bombay about 20,000 in chenai a similar number and other parts of India and many non-muslims have attended many Hindus have attended thousands of them and many of them told me that better Zak there was a person just a comment that what I did not know about Hinduism in the past 40 years of my life I've learned in the past four hours I follow the guidance of the Quran ofah Imran 3:64 which says come to come in terms as in us and you which is the first term that we worship none but one God what we realize that I don't believe in interface dialogue which says that Hinduism is the same Islam is the same Christianity is the same this is just a gimmick if I as the Hindu Pandit will you become a Muslim he say no if I as the Muslim will you become a Christian he say no if I as the priest will you become a Hindu he say no so what is same it's not same we have to agree that there are differences but there are similarities also let us agree at least to follow the commonalities what is different keep it aside so what I say that take all the religious scriptures whether it be the bhagat Gita whether it be the Veda the upanishad the Bible the Quran at least what is common what is different keep it aside we can discuss some other time but at least what is common let us agree to follow it and I've given the talk and I've showed so many similarities so many so you can refer to my video cassette and what happen many of them are not aware the Muslims are not aware of their religion similarly the Hindus are not aware of the religion many of the Muslim objected similari between Islam and Hindu is impossible so many of the people came in the talk to attack buling what nonsense Hindu and Muslim same but when they heard the talk they were shocked those who came to attack they agreed with the talk similarly many Hindus SCH so what we realize that what is common we should follow and number one is Allah that we worship none but one God that's the most common thing and which you can give quotations and you can give quotation from The Vedas from the bhagwat Gita it is mentioned in the CH chapter number six section number two verse number one God is only one without a second it's mentioned in the chapter number six verse number n of him no Lord he has got no parents these are Sanskrit quotations that means almighty God has got no parents he has got no Lord furthermore if he analyze it is mentioned in the chapter number four verse number 19 of that God there are no images there is no pratima there is no photograph there is no Idol there is no image same thing in chapter number 32 verse number three of that God there are no images so if you go back to your vas and your religious Scriptures it speaks about one God so people many a times are not aware of the scriptures and when the question just a couple of days back I'd given an interview to St news they asked me brother Zakir what is your view regarding vand mataram can the Muslims say or not I said what do the Muslims come to it afterwards I'll first tell you what the Hindu scriptures say he was shocked what do I mean by that I said that if anyone who a scholar of the Veda the Veda agrees that God has got no pratima so when you say V matam that this country is my mother and you call it God a person who a schol I'm not talking about the normal people who don't know about the scriptures but you ask a scholar he will say that vand matram goes against The Vedas because vand matram in no less than three places it says I bow down to thee I worship thee if you see a about the Arya s and you see the various top Scholars they think according to The Vedas idol worship is not permitted there are verses in bhagat Gita chapter number 7 verse number 20 which says that you should not do idol worship so here when we go back to your scriptures Unfortunately they believe in a form of pantheism so even according to The Vedas if you're a good scholar this song V mataram that I bow on and I worship thee as I quoted in Sanskrit about upanishad it's against even in Islam there are 12 lines which are objectionable three times it is said one mam which means I bow down to thee if once it says that this country is my mother once it says I will kiss the feet once it says about the Divine things about the smile talking about Divinity it calls it lakmi it is called Durga all these things objectionable we Muslims we love this country but we will not bow down to anyone but to almighty God even a mother even a mother who has born in a womb for 9 months we love we respect her but we will not bow down to our mother to our own mother the number one human being who we love and respect in the world after Allah subhana wa taala it is Muhammad sahi wasallam we will will not bow down to a prophet Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is it required that we should sing this song vand mataram it is a political gimmick politicians they thought they get the V bank they even made a gimmick on the date you know when it was written by bankin CH chadya in 1876 it it was published in 1882 now where is Century come now and where 7 September they made a mistake the politician political gimmick furthermore even a Muslim living in Saudi Arabia he cannot bow down to his country Saudi Arabia even a Muslim living in Pakistan cannot bow down to Pakistan it is shik so to say that the Indian Muslims are not patriotic it is our religion our creator of God who has made this country is far superior so we love this country when required for the truth to die for this country but we will not bow down to anyone but almighty God"
