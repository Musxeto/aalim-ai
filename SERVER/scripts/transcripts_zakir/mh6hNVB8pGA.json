  "transcript": "there is a question from rio from indonesia i am an entrepreneur if it is so obvious that other scriptures other than the quran have many errors illogical things and invalid things why the smartest people of the world still believe in the scriptures isn't it public by now that their scriptures have errors fabrications concoctions etc we all believe that god's word cannot be wrong unless those words are human beings words that's a very important question by reno from indonesia that how come the people when they know very clearly that quran is true compared to other scriptures why do yet non-muslims who are intelligent and who have the knowledge yet follow the scriptures basically what you have to understand that many a time when it comes to faith people get involved in blind belief and they may be very logical they may be scientists of nasa or they may be big doctors heart specialists but yet they do idle worship in india we have so we wonder how come this is because they are so much engrossed with the society that even if they know the truth they don't want to offend the parents or they say that if we know the truth if we followed we have to leave alcoholism we may have to do things which we don't like and if you read the quran compared to other scriptures quran many places says that will they not then understand quran that will you not then understand many a time this is a book for people who understand so quran is the most logical scripture on the face of the earth and if any non-muslim or any muslim any human being reads it he will understand but people when it comes to religion they believe more in the blind faith as though there is a screen put in front of the eyes and this is the major reason that even though people are educated etc they don't accept the truth and it is the shaitaan who whispers and prevents the person from coming to the straight path so my request always would be that read the quran with understanding so that you come to the straight path and it is the duty of a muslim that we should convey to these non-muslims who are intelligent who understanding who intellectuals to convey the true message of islam and one of the best talks for such people is quran and modern science compatible or incompatible and i have given this talk and it will be very beneficial for these people to come to the straight path"
