  "title": "Why Should We Pray Salaah & What is the Benefit Praying in Congregation in Mosque? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "just my question is about salah you've mentioned and gave us knowledge about zakah and how it benefit our society so what about salah why we should gather in the mosque what is the benefit of it for the community and the society thank you brother the question that in my lecture i gave the example of zakat what about salah what's the benefit of salah why should you go to the mosque and have a congregation and gathering brother i've given a full lecture on salah the programming towards righteousness it's for about one and a half i don't intend doing that you cannot cover all the points in one lecture salah is the second important the second pillar of islam after taheed believing in allah that there is no one except allah the word of worship and muhammad messenger the second is allah a beloved prophet sallallahu salaam said the first deed that will be asked you on the day of judgment is the body of salah an accounting imam of bahabi not praying falls as the fourth major sin in islam number one is shift second is murder third is black magic fourth is forgoing salah it is the fourth major sin in islam and a beloved prophet allah mentioned say bihari volume 1 in the book of salah that if you pray in jama you get 25 times 27 times mosab so praying in jabba is 25 to 27 times better congregation and there are several hadith of our beloved prophet but is the problem it's mentioned in cyborg volume 1 in the book of salah that the prophet said that people do not come to the mosque for the ju masala he felt like telling one of the sahabah to lead the salah so that he would go and burn the houses of those people who did not come for the ju masala there's another hadith in which the prophet muhammad said so based on the scholars praying juma salah is far and if you do it for three times without reason allah blocks your heart and upon the imam of dhabi it is the 66th major sin in islam not paying praying persistently ju masala and congregation is the 66 major sin imam dhabi also says sin number 65 once and before that that persistently not praying in the mosque in the congregation salah with jama without a valid reason there's another hadith one book of salah the prophet said the hypocrites did not come for the father salah or the isha salah and if they knew the reward they would come crawling i felt like telling one of the sahabahs to lead the salah so that i can go out and burn the homes of the men with them in it who did not come for the congregation salah so praying in jama the fight time salah according to very few scholars it is must have sunnah majority scholar says it is for imam abdi says in his book in a cabaret it is the 65th major sin that if you do not pray fight time salah in the congregation in the mosque so most of the scholars agree that you have to pray unless you have a valid reason that if maybe you're traveling or if you're sick or normally at the time of the sahaba if a person did not come to the mosque to pray he was either sick or he was a munafic that's what they did so praying compulsory in the salah in congregation is a must what are the various benefits i can give a talk for one hour only on scientific benefits time doesn't permit me but you can see my videos you come closer to the muslim ummah you get guidance from the imam your khusho increases the best time the best peace of mind is the time of sallah and the best part of salah is the suju allah mentioned sajdah and sujud in the quran 92 times but if you know what khushu is you will understand it you can only enjoy the fruit if you have a taste of it so if you know what benefit of salah one minor benefit minor benefit will tell you you know people say you know the 10 richest man in the world and list goes on mukesh ambani number 10 and warren buffett and number one goes to bill gates now it is jeff something he's overtaken bill gates recently jeff someone uh who's the owner of amazon he's overtaking bill gates number one and there was another post that says number 10 ambani number three bill gates number two jeff number one is who a muslim who offers two rakat of sunnah salah before fajr because the beloved prophet muhammad said that if you pray two raka's sunnah before fajr it is more valuable than the earth and the wealth in it so if you have a muslim you understand that you will know the reward of that it is the sunnah salah sunnah so imagine what would be the reward for the fajr salah but how many muslims realize that many do but not all if you know that you know once a businessman approached me the billionaire you know i i pray four times but i cannot get a fajr so i told him that what if you have a meeting tomorrow early in the morning at 5 30 where if the deal clicks you will get a billion dollar he said i will not sleep the full night so i told him you know the sunnah of the fajr is more valuable than the world and the wealth in it trillions and zillions of dollars so if you have that iman and if you have that faith then you will realize what important it is that's what the prophet said if the munafiq knew what was the benefit of coming for the isha's allah and fajar salah to the mosque they would crawl coming to it so unfortunately most of us muslims don't know the benefit but alhamdulillah i'm happy in malaysia as compared to india the percentage of muslims praying in india is very small in the mosque i would say less than five percent but yes i'm happy that the percentage of muslim men muslims praying in the mosque is multiple times more than india and pakistan but as a muslim the benefit to get the sukkon the serenity the peace it is much more than the wealth so if you know what peace is you will value it if you don't know you won't value it so if a muslim reads the quran and the hadith and understand what benefit it is then you will care less for the material things and you will come closer to the deen and you'll find the benefit for more details refer to my talk salah the to answer the question"
