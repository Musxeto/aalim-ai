  "transcript": "the POS a question that there are certain Muslims who say and argue that we don't wear the label the cap and the beard because there are times that we may indulge in wrong activities un Islamic activities like bribing cheating telling lies so we don't want to spoil the name of Islam they're concerned alhamdulillah they're concerned about Islam so therefore they say we don't want to wear the label there are two types of people one is a pessimist and one is an optimist the pessimist is a person who always thinks at the negative angle and there are such people who you're quoting we don't want to wear the label because sometime of Blue Moon we may do wrong activity like bribing cheating telling lies so we don't to spoil the name of Islam so I tell them that why don't you be an optimist that if you know that sometimes you do bad things and once you start wearing the label the cap and the beard and suppose it happens that the opportunity arises that you have to bribe to start thinking oh now I'm wearing the label how can I bribe and you will not bribe alhamdulillah if the opportunity comes where you can cheat and you realize I'm wearing a label how can I spoil the name of Islam you will not cheat if you have to tell a lie to support what you're saying and you realize oh I'm wearing a label cap and the beard you will not lie irrespective whether it benefits you in this world or not it will inshallah inshallah in the it will benefit you and I ended my talk by quoting the verse of the Quran from Surah is 17:81 that if you are a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits will to Allah subhana wa tala he's proud to be a Muslim he's proud to submit his will to Allah subhana wa tala proud to follow religion of H if he's truly a Muslim he should also follow the H and if he's on the H the Quran says inah is 17 vers 81 when truth is and false falsehood perishes for falsehood is by its nature bound to perish so what I tell such people that if you feel that once in a while if you do wrong activities and if you wear the label to spoil the lame of a label instead of being a pessimist you become an optimist you wear a label and inshallah it will make you a better Muslim and if you're so much concerned about the Muslim umah and the name of Islam it will besides helping the Muslim it will even help you it will help you and see to it that you remain on hope thatw the question"
