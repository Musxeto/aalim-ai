  "transcript": "the next question sad after heath from india presently living in sydney she asks few years back we made a huge mistake of buying a house on loan which we will have to pay from next year my heart is changed and i am a different person now as far as following islam is concerned but this was not the case when i took the home loan kindly advise what should i do now allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and 279 who believe fear allah and give up your demands on riba if you are believers for if you do not do so be prepared that allah and his messenger will wage a war against you riba it is a major sin and according to imam al-zahabi he writes in his book that is the major sins and he mentions riba and he lists it as the major sin this is the gravity of the sin of rabbah and the lowest category of riba is as if you are doing zina with your mother this is how great and grievous this sin is we need to abstain from it now as you have asked the question that you had taken this home loan now your life has changed i would request you that you take a loan from an islamic bank and repay this loan the home loan that you have taken repay it first and then slowly pay back to the islamic bank you should verify that the islamic bank is on the guidelines of sharia and it does not have ribba then slowly you repay to this islamic bank so this is the first thing that you can do the second thing that you can do is and anyone who's taken a loan from a conventional bank that involves an interest what he can do is that he can pay it from the zakat money if the person is poor because one category is the debtors this is the solution and after this you should ask for sincere repentance from allah subhana wa in fact moment you realize what you have done is wrong you should ask sincere repentance from allah subhana wa and you should make a resolution that you will not do it again allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran in surah chapter 11 was 114. for good deeds they take away evil deeds the more good deeds you do the more it will eradicate your evil deeds try to do as many good deeds as possible it will eradicate your evil deeds and for repentance there are basically four criteria the first is that you ask sincere repentance from allah the second is you stop doing that act the third is that if you can repay it you repay it for example if you've robbed something you return to that person and the fourth category is that you make a strong resolution that you will not do it again so if you are sincere repentance from allah involved in doing good deeds righteous deeds inshallah allah subhanahu ta'ala he will forgive you"
