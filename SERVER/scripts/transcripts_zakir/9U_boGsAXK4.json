  "title": "Is It Sufficient to Practise Islam Towards the End of Our Lives, as We Do with Academic Exams?",
  "transcript": "we have another six four months so we don't have to study right now at the end of the month we can do it well so no need to do anything now so what other ways to unlock especially you know if I understood that question correctly that normally in the examination we say that we will work in the end if six months are remaining last month we can study so are you trying to tell the Muslims can also enjoy life and work towards the end of their life is this what a question is so the Muslims can enjoy life now and work towards the end of their life correct okay my question is which Muslim knows how long will he live I don't know whether left till tomorrow or not I don't know sister do you know how long will you live one year 10 year 20 100 do you know even I don't know Allah says in the Quran very clearly in chapter number 31 verse number 34 no one knows when will a person die what will the person earn what is in the womb of the mother no one knows that's the reason our beloved Prophet sallam said that to live that you I mean there's a saying that you live you live as though you're going to die today and be prepared even for a long time if you know you're going to die tomorrow what will you do sister hypothetically if you come to a nine tomorrow what will you do um no no suppose you are the Muslim man to please who what will you do then to work hard you will pray you will do correct so every Muslim he should be prepared that he may die today or tomorrow so if you know if I think I'm going to guide tomorrow what I'm going to do I'm going to pray properly I'm going to pray the Sunnah I'm going to pray what if I die and if I don't die again tomorrow I do the same thing if I don't do tomorrow again even if I don't die am I losing if I don't die will I lose I just suppose you think you're going to die after 10 years and you don't plan to die will you lose you lose what you lose so my win-win situation number one when I'm praying I get serenity I get peace of mind this money cannot buy most of the billionaires they are not peace people think you know money can buy peace it cannot it can't buy happiness so when I'm worshiping Allah I find peace and believe me if you believe in Allah and the teachings you will not really bother everything is a believer that when a prophet comes he says alhamdulillah this is Iman and more the difficulty more you're happy inshallah Allah will give me those has taken everything the property the wealth I think when I tell my wife that we should be happy imagine suppose I call if I'm doing business I will lose my wealth who's to blame me if earthquake comes and my house goes no benefit if being a die if the enemies of Islam have taken over my property what better benefit can I get in I'm very happy nothing better could have happened for my property than what the enemies of Islam have done very happy no peace of mind they think they're causing me trouble they are fools they don't know that Jannah is my heart in my heart if they put me in jail they cannot take the Jannah which is in my heart so moment as a True Believer he is always at peace if you know Islam you will enjoy every day of your life it is the fool to think okay if I drink alcohol if I go to drugs I'll enjoy so let me enjoy now and maybe I will pray after 10 years full million times speed and serenity in our Salah are they free they have to pay money therefore health problems when we pray our health becomes better three the serenity we get it is all if you heard me talk I've given a talk on the Quran the guidance for creating happiness all this is artificial happiness immediately the true happiness and the things some people like dancing music some people like listening to Islamic lectures the Quran it is you who decide what is good and what is bad happiness is a state of mind you know like you like some people like Chinese food some people like Malay food some people like Indian food food is food it is subjective similarly peace and happiness depending upon your mind how you train your mind if you drain your mind I'm going to get peace inside you're very happy with it but the prophet never said that you renounce the world of Abdullah uh the prophet said I heard that you fast every day and I heard that you pray the full night he said yes he said first one day don't fast the other day pray part of the night see part of the night because your body is right over you your wife has the right to owe you and your guests ever I Told You So Islam doesn't believe in excesses Islam doesn't mean to renounce the world so if you think you're going to pray the full night and fast every day I'll go to Jannah that is again the Sunnah of the prophet Prophet never was at the first every day Prophet didn't say that you pray the full night so there is limitations there's maximum if you do above that it becomes excessive Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 4 171 Allah says do not commit excessive religion committing excesses of saharam there is a minimum maximum minimum Salah is five times minimum minimum Salah 17 plus 320 minimum then you can do you want to pay more okay Salah the best Salah after the five times will come first then would come twelvet foreign [Music] so minimum okay if anyone to come to the mosque country that's the requirement if you come to the mosque and pre-ordify time okay you may require two hours a day if you want to promote Etc and soon maybe for us limit minimum foreign fasting you can't fast every day minimum fasting the best after the first of Ramadan is the fast of moram after that the first of Ashura you want to keep more okay the fast and 10 days okay the white days I am will be 13 14 15 Monday and Thursday that's what the prophet did this is the Sunnah if you want more then the first of the other is beyond that you cannot do this is the limit so everything in Islam minimum and maximum is there but you'll only know if you have knowledge if you read the Quran Hadith so if you think like those people who are fools that I will only study towards the end we ask them when is the end we don't know so in this you tell that person for you your examination is only once a year our examination is every day the difference is the examination is once a year so maybe you can fool the teacher and study only towards the examination our examination is every day every hour every minute hope to answer the question system thank you"
