  "title": "The Length of the Beard for a Muslim Man? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "what about the required lengths of the beard because there are many people with different lengths and and it's rather confusing when you look outside and you think oh what should i be doing what did the prophet muhammad saw do as far as the length of the beard is concerned the scholars are divided they have different opinions and as for what is the length of the bird the two opinions one group of scholars say that because the hadith of say bihari one number seven book of death hadith number five eight nine two says the prophet said do the opposite of what the pagans do keep the beard and trim your mustaches so because the commandment is keep the beard that means they say that it should be kept that's it and the second hadith of sai buhari number seven book of death number 5893 says that cut your mustaches short and grow the beard so the first group of scholars to grow the beard must keep on growing you should not touch it keep the beard miss let it be therefore you should not at all neither trim the beard nothing at all you should let it grow as much as possible this is their view but if you read there is not a single say hadith which speaks about the length of the beard of the prophet not a single say hadith there's not a single say hadith but according to sheikh wataimi he says that we understand when hadees says that keep the beard or grow the beard it means we should leave it it's not touch it and let the length be as much as possible and if someone shaves it as a haram and someone trims it to the size of a fist that's the other view then it is macro so this one group of scholars said let it grow as much as possible the other group of scholars what they say that the length of the beard should be one fist as i mentioned earlier there is no say hadith which speaks about the length of the beard of the prophet there's a hadith which is hadith we say that the beard of the prophet it touched the chest but that's hadith mentioned in say muslim word number four hadith number 5789 where javier bin samura he says may allah please with him that the prophet had a thick beard so there are many say hadith we say the prophet are thick beard but doesn't mention the length of the beard but this group of scholars they say that since the length of the beard is not mentioned what we have to do is look at how the sahaba has kept the beard the length is not mentioned so if you look at the saba because the prophet said if you don't find in my example then look at the people around me in this generation that the companions sahabas and when we look at the sahabas we find several authentic hadith more than 10 say hadith which say that the sabbah they kept their beard at the length of one fist and whatever was below the one fist they trimmed the beard very close to the prophet the trim they appeared even though sabah who narrated the same hadith that the prophet said that do opposite of what the pagans keep the beard and trim your mustaches immediately after that this continues and says that whenever abnyomar mella be pleased with him he used to go for umrah and hajj after omran hajj he used to catch the beard with his fist and whatever was below the fist used to cut it so imagine those sapas who narrated the hadees and all these are by the name of herrera please with them all they were staunch followers of the sunnah of the prophet and they narrated the hadith when they narrate the hadith of trimming the mustache and keeping the beard growing their beard they understood the way the prophet wanted so why did they trim the beard if the view of the first group of scholars that's right that keep on growing growing means how to grow the way the prophet grew and if there's no hadith indicating his sayings or actions then you look at the way the sabbath did that's the way how you analyze the hadith that's the reason sheikh nasir dalbani he says that the right size of the beard should be the size of a fist and he says for example that when we analyze the hadith if it's present in the sayings that are the best of the prophet if it's not you look in the actions if not action approval if it's not there you look in the lifestyle of the sahaba what did they say what did they do so we agreed that what the sahaba did was they followed the prophet and you don't find a single hadith neither of the prophet or neither of any of the sabbath we say that they did not trim the beard there are more than ten hadith we say that the sabbahs they trim the beard below the fist if there was even a single hadith which says that this sabbah did not trim the beard at all then it can be possible that both are right because there's not a single hadith on the other side saying that the sabbah never trimmed the beard but there are no less than 10 say hadith we say that the sabbah is below the face they trim the beard according to sheikh nasrud albani it is further to trim the beard below the fist it is further and anyone who keeps the beard more than the fist length it is makru according to him mahru detestable so this is a strong fatwa albani he's very staunch and i personally agree with his view because there is evidence in the lifestyle of the sabbath and he further says in his book and he writes that why it should be the length of one fist he said besides the sahabas many examples we find who kept one fist and cut below one sister beard he gives the examples of many salafists salheen who had the beard the size of fist and they trimmed the beard below the fist like for example we have examples of imam malik all these great sulphur saline they trim the beard below the fist they could look like that and they trimmed it below the fist so this is the view of the second group of scholars and i agree more with the group of scholars including albany the right size is the size of the fist and the rest allah"
