  "transcript": "the quran says in surah azumur chapter 39 verse number 6 that we have made the human beings in stages one after the other in three ways of darkness according to professor keith moore he said that this verse of the quran when it mentions the three ways of darkness it refers to the anterior abdominal wall the uterine wall and the amnioquarionic membrane that the human being is made into stages in three ways of darkness the quran describes the various embryological stages in great detail the quran mentions this chapter number 23 verse number 14 that we have created the human being from a quintessence of claim then made it into a nutsfa a minor country of liquid then made the nutfa into alaka a leech-like substance then made the alaka into mudga that's a chewed-like lump then made the mudgar into azama bones then clothed the bones with him that is flesh and then we made a different creature glory be to allah who is the best to create these three verses of the quran describe the various embryological stages the initial stages of development of a human being in the mother's womb in great detail first it says that have made it from another which we discussed a minor counter of liquid then made the nutsfa into alaka that means a leech like substance which we discussed earlier the meaning of the arabic word alaka it has got three meanings one is a leach-like substance it also means something which clings and the third meaning of alaka is conjured out of blood besides it looking like a leech the embryo in the initial stages it also behaves like a leech it behaves like a blood sucker it derives its nutrition from the mother through the placenta it behaves like a blood sucker so besides looking like a leech it also behaves like a leech the second meaning something which clings we know that the embryo clings to the uterine wall throughout the nine months that the fetus in the womb of the mother it clings to the uterine wall the third meaning of alaka is conjured lot of blood and today's science tells us that in the initial stages the blood does not circulate and the blood plots in the vessels and it appears like a congenital clot of blood so all three meanings of allah alhamdulillah today sign is in perfect conformity to latest advances made in embryology it further says we placed it in a karate machine a place of security and we know today that the fetus is protected posteriorly by the spinal cord that the backbone as well as the posterior muscles and anteriorly it is protected by the anti-abdominal wall by the amniocoronic membrane as well as the amniotic fluid which protects the child so the science today testifies that the child is well protected in the womb of the mother it further says we made the alaka into a mudga a mudga means a chewed like lump so professor keith moore took a plaster seal and made it look into a leech like such an initial stage of embryo and then placed it between his teeth he bit it to make it appear like a mudga a chewed-like lump and when he saw it the teeth marks it resembles the somites from where the nerves develop and the quran continues we made the mudgah into his bones then clothed the bones with him that is flesh then we made it all together a different creature so what does the quran mean that we made it into altogether different creature till this stage of mudga is like lump bones flesh till this stage today science tells us the initial stages of development of a human being is similar to the development of a fish rabbit and many other animals only after this stage does the human development differ in looks where we have a head then we have limbs then the quran says we made it into a different creature glory be to allah who's the best to create imagine the quran describes the various embryological stages in great detail and professor keith moore he said that this description given in the quran based on shapes alaka leash-like substance like lum izama bones llam flesh is far superior to the divisions made in modern embryology where we say stage one stage two stage three stage four it's difficult to identify the description given the quran is far more superior and much more easy"
