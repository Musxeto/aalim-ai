  "transcript": "to have the best of both which when visited most of the schools that i visited now the thing is changing in the past six years i've realized that some schools have become slightly close alhamdulillah to the concept that i have but most of the schools they may be having maybe three periods a week on islam or maybe one period a day maximum i came across was two periods a day on islam and what was the main objective that a child when he passes from school you should have the knowledge of quran hadi shariafic and science etc that i could not find though visited the best of schools in america in south africa which is supposed to be very much advanced in this field of islamic schools uk australia malaysia etc so that we thought that let's make an effort and with allah we in bombay alhamdulillah about approximately six years back or rather five and a half years back we launched our own islamic school by the name of islamic international school because for my children we had to do it i was prepared proceeded to gear up my child though putting in a convent school by giving all the so-called education at home but then we thought that we should make a sample school and alhamdulillah we venture with this project in bombay and allah helped us and with allah support we launched the school and al hamdulillah from day one the response that we received from the people of bombay for the muslim the bombing was tremendous masha'allah the response was such that though the school was absolutely new we hardly publicized it we decided to start the school there was only three weeks publicity masha'allah but immediately when the school was launched the amount of response we got was phenomenal and it was overwhelming that ministers they phoned our school to see to it that some of the friends get admission to the school it was good masha'allah you'll hardly find a minister phoning on madrasah and telling that you know i want to see it in your mandrasa we find that in the convent school in india most of the convents school the minister's phone and they try and use the influence but alhamdulillah we are very strict as far as admission criteria is concerned we are very strict with the guidelines and unless a person fulfills our guidelines let them be a minister son also we don't give admission alhamdulillah the difference that is there that we appreciated that the movement that was started by many of the philanthropists and education throughout the world it was a good movement at least giving them an environment of islam so i was really happy that in the western countries whether it been usa uk there were schools in which a child could at least practice islam when the school that we launched we had a different system we had that i wanted a striking balance that when a child passes the test standard he should become at least an average album when he passes from dalaran as well as be able to compete with the best of condiment schools in that city that was the aim and with that target beside the school and we did many unconventional things which people told it's not possible but with allah"
