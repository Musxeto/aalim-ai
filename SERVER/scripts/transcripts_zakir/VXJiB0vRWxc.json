  "transcript": "the next question from Naveed Ahmad and Afghan immigrant living in Canada I have a question about living in a non-muslim country I live in Brampton Canada where I can practice Islam in the best way we have mosque nearby and I have all the freedom in terms of clothing and practicing Islam do I still have to make Hijra to a Muslim country my father being a good follower of Islam recommends me to take a decision to make Hijra to a Muslim country I would appreciate to get a reply from you a similar question is posed by Saad Khan Mississauga Canada in your talks you have emphasized not to migrate to non-muslim countries like North America as I was residing in the Middle East I couldn't continue because no one is allowed to stay there because of citizenship is it permissible for us to migrate in such a situation to a non-muslim country where a life is safe and we can practice our religion a similar question is posed by Muhammad shariful Islam from Bangladesh is it permissible to move from one Muslim country to another non-muslim country for a better life one more similar question by Abdul mannan residing in Ireland it's come on the Facebook just now Dr Zakir Naik will love you for the sake of Allah my question is what is the legal point of view of Muslims staying in non-muslim country question asked by the Four Brothers and many such familiar questions have come regarding Muslims staying in a non-muslim country this can be divided into two types a Muslim which is born in a non-muslim country what he has to do and a Muslim who migrates from Muslim country non-muslim country Allah clearly mentioned that and gives us guidance regarding this topic when the angels of death come to take the soul of the person who has died in sin against the soul and asks him what is your state and he replies that we have lived in oppression on this Earth our state was very bad oppressed then the angel replies that the Earth of Allah was spacious enough for you to migrate from the evil and for such people Allah continues the Abode is hell a refuge of evil and this verse was revealed in context in Muslims living in non-muslim countries this was if you read the news Allah Quran and people write in bracket mentioning for the Muslim living in non-muslim country it says that when the angel of death comes to take the soul of the person who has died in sin against the soul and ask them what is your state the reply we lived in oppression on this Earth and the replies that the Earth of Allah was patience for you to move away from people that means the world of Allah's mother so big that if you are living in a space where there is oppression where there is shirk where there is activity with an Islamic you have to migrate and if you do not Allah says your Abode is hellfire a refuge which is evil the next verses in surinasa chapter 4 verse number 98 as to those who are in operation and men and women and children who don't have the power or do not have the facility to migrate verse number 99 says Allah will forgive them worse than 100 says that as to those who sacrificed their home and leave their land Allah gives them many a refuge in the world and if the person died as a refugee away from his home Allah will reward him Ya Allah is talking about those who do Hijra for the sake of Allah with those who leave their home for the sake of Allah and his soul and take refuge the land is very big he'll find many refuge and if he died away from his home as a refugee for the sake of Allah Allah is solely about him who from this verse all the scholars they agree that if a person is living in a non-muslim land there can be three options number one option is that he cannot practice his Deen freely practicing Dean hidingly is not acceptable if you cannot practice your Deen freely and you cannot call yourself freely Muslims then it becomes compulsory for you to migrate compulsory further if you are living in a country where you cannot practice within freely cannot call yourself Muslims cannot do your fries cannot stay from the Haram in a non-muslim country it becomes first for you to migrate number two if you can practice your Deen very freely and there is no compulsion on you you can do all the Pharisees you can stay away from all the Haram then migrating becomes must have but not a fan but there is so the scholars say if you are living in a non-muslim land where you can call yourself Muslim freely practice your Deen there is no harassment at all then migration becomes Mustafa but not of Earth and for those people who are weak and do not have the means to migrate who oppressed women children don't have the power don't have the means for them if they continue to stay Allah will forgive them it is permissible so these are the three things now coming to the question of can a Muslim migrate from a Muslim country to non-muslim that is another question all the scholarly naturally agree those who are on the Quran and Sunnah I know some Scholars say aloud especially if you go to Western scholar they say no problem to migrate from Muslim country to a non-muslim country it is Haram unless it before education offer the purpose of dala for Education purpose you go you acquire education come back no problem or if you go there not as a part-time day as a full-time guy to deliver the message then the scholar say it's permissible but if you just shift from Muslim nine to a non-muslim land for a better living as the question opposed it is not permitted at all and I know there are millions of Muslims who have migrated for Muslim countries from Pakistan from Bangladesh to Western countries USA Canada European countries only basically for a Better Living they talk about education the education we have to come back the main purpose is for a Better Living because they can earn more money this is totally prohibited migrating from a Muslim country to a non-muslim country for a Better Living is prohibited if you are born in a non-muslim country then the options are three if you can not practice your Deen freely it becomes compulsory to migrate if you can practice the Deen freely it is Mustafa to migrate not a further I know there are many Muslims born in non-muslim countries a large percentage of the Muslim ummah are living in all Muslim countries if they're born there and if they can practice according to me nowadays there are very few countries in the world non-muslim countries in the world where you can actually practice very freely and that also in those countries it will not be totally freely but to a great extent and I would agree that amongst the Western countries that are available Canada would be better than the other Western countries Canada is much better than USA is much better than other Western countries in terms for Muslim to live because at present you have a prime minister that is Trudeau who has more care for Humanity and who really care for giving equal rights to human being unlike the other prime minister of other Western countries like France or U.S Etc so amongst the Western countries the best of the worst countries would be Canada but coming to the question what is the reason that Allah has requested you to migrate what is the reason and a beloved Prophet said it's mentioned of Abu Dhabi world number three Hadith number 2645 and this Hadith is mentioned the prophet said I disowned those Muslims who live amongst the mushrikeen I disown those Muslims who live amongst the idolators Discerning all the Muslims who live among the mushrikeen the reason is true number one if a Muslim may not be able to practice Islamic totality they may be he can follow some aspects of them he cannot freely say he's a Muslim he cannot freely of us Allah Etc and the second is the associated factors of that environment is such that it prevents you from doing the Sunnah and the Faris and takes you closer to the Haram activities let me give a better explanation there are very few non-muslim countries that really you can be proud to be Muslims and in those countries also certain areas not throughout the country secondly one thing you have to understand that almost all the Western countries the atmosphere is not very convenient for the Islamic lifestyle number one in almost all the Western countries there is obscenity the obsidity is coming on your face there is alcoholism there is drug addiction there is prostitution and the big Associated factor is most of the countries most of the places you get involved in Japan it's difficult for you to stay away from River what you have to realize some people may argue that okay there's options even Muslim countries I agree with you there are but the levels differ you go to a Muslim country I don't know of any Muslim country in the world which is as close as American obsidity as through the standardization not at all yes they may be it may be Haram but the level is less and in certain non-muslim countries which are not the Western countries if the facility is less depending upon the culture what you have to realize that in the Western Country it is coming at your face Glory the moment you walk out you see Billboards of ladies which are instantly dressed which are dressed with obscene clothes difficult in the Muslim country you may find but not as much as what you find in the Western countries so there is no comparison at all so imagine when you walk you have to lower your gear how can you live I know there are many Muslim living Western countries and I've been to Western countries a lot I have traveled a lot to America I've traveled a lot to USA to Canada to Western countries I've made my talk and there are situations where some of the Muslims come and tell me okay when I came to the Western Country I became more Islamic possible that is yes I agree with it possible but that small possibility the chances of a person a Muslim going away from his Deen is more in the Western countries than in the other parts of the world more in a western country than a Muslim country so they have to understand that there are possibilities that a person may go from Pakistan to America and become more practicing may start reading qurans may start offering Salah but the percentage is very small for example because the Salman he wrote the book The satnic verses there are thousands of non-muslims except in Islam that does not mean what Salman did is right or Salman is to be condemned that's a different question that even though it is wrong in that wrong thing it has its own benefits the majority people that go to the Western Country they go away from the Deen according to the Pew report and the PW report the Pew report is supposed to be authentic done by non-muslims it says that in USA in USA 25 percent of the Muslims born in Muslim family they leave their religion every year imagine 25 percent of the Muslims born in a Muslim family every year but the good part of it is equal number of people even come close even except Islam so the number of Muslims in USA remains approximately same the number living and number coming is same that's the reason the number of Muslims approximately different types like say in a population about 350 million people in USA the Muslim some say 4 million some say 5 million it is approximately one percent but surely not more than two percent it is close to one percent three million imagine 25 percent every year leave that piece of playing with fire I know so many of the duats who lived in USA got their citizenship got their green card but they came back because they couldn't is the family I know many people tell me oh because when we go to USA when we go to Canada you know there's a Muslim Community Center the moment a person goes away from his country or goes away from the people of like-minded and he stays in a minority there are possibility that you make your own Community but that's a very small possibility I have traveled to USS so many times I have gone to many conferences what you have to realize that what you see is just the outside world I know many of the good dive whose children have got into drug addiction whose children have got into adultery into alcoholism you can't stop it it is coming on you yes I know even in Muslim countries like Pakistan Bangladesh people are involved in all these evils but the percentage is less for the questioner to say that there's no Sharia followed in Pakistan as though Sharia has fallen in Canada it's totally wrong between Canada and Pakistan Pakistan will be a thousand times better than Canada I know there are evil practices in Pakistan in Bangladesh but yet it is thousand times better than a non-muslim country with all the prob yes only where the non-muslim country can be better is you may get more money you may get more luxury you may be able to drive a Mercedes car but you are a very bad businessman this is only for few years they live in this world for how long on average for about 70 75 years you may die at the age of 10 20 as years of 90 average 70 years but what will happen in akhara you are sacrificing your luxury if you take pain here and sacrifice the luxury here in akhara will go in Jannah prevented thousands of Muslims from Pakistan from Bangladesh to migrate to America and to Canada and USA alhamdulillah thousands of them so migrating is out of the question if you are born then in the question migrating or not but you migrating from a Muslim country to a non-muslim country for a Better Living is totally prohibited even though it may be a country like Canada it may be better than the other countries I know there are many refugees going there but yet what they have to understand that Allah has made it very clear-cut that if you are born in that country then you have option migrate or not migration is the best number one if you cannot follow your then it becomes the fun if you can follow her then it becomes unless you operate or weaker of no means then it's permitted I know many guys today from USA who want to come to Malaysia I don't want to take the name because they may never have told to others they spoke to me on one to one level and they want to migrate to a Muslim country and as I said in earlier and so one of the best Muslim countries to live today amongst all the Muslim countries Malaysia there are negative points but alhamdulillah as a whole it is the best available most of the dive that I know of they know when I also go to give lectures the person may be a president of Islamic organization but we know that if parents come and tell her though the person is involved in these wrong activities these are activities he has got so many girlfriends he doesn't that's not known to the world Cena is very common so the percentage of Muslims living in Western Country doing Zina is multiple times more than living in a Muslim country you cannot compare there are sins in the Muslim countries but the level in the non-muslim countries much higher I know many guys want to live there are few days who promote and say oh I'm very happy and because of America I've become a good Muslim all this is nonsense they don't know the Quran well they talk about the Quran but according to me and the context was Muslims living in non-muslim land of Surah chapter 4 verse number 97. Allah says if you live among the mushrikeen you will go to hell it is very clear-cut how can they say how can they misguide the People by saying oh America is very good it has changed my life what you should do I am thankful to Allah even staying in America Allah has saved me this should be not promoting America for what how can you promote such a country so these days have actually I don't agree with them at all but there are very few in percentage wise a very small number but the majority of the day they win today I when I meet them on a personal level they would love to migrate and some of them are staying because okay they want to convey the message no problem that's accepted in Islam but for a Muslim to migrate from a Muslim country to non-muslim Country this according to the scholars is not permitted except for education for the particular time or for being a full-time die hope that answers the question"
