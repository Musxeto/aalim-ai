  "transcript": "my name is david i'm studying in sixth standard my question is why non-muslim childrens are not along in your school to join they can learn arabic and became muslim soul they can learn arabic and become muslims also alhamdulillah young brother david age nine years old asking the question why are non-muslim children not allowed to enter your school so that they can learn arabic and they can accept islam brother asked a very difficult question to me one of the most difficult questions brother our school islamic international school it's a school that is mainly talking about the formal education and islamic education we don't want to make our school as a conversion center because children entering at a very small age we don't want people to say that is our enrolling people are six years old and nine years old and forcing them to accept islam what we would like to say that if your parents are convinced about the faith of this religion and if they want to put you in the school we have no problem but a child himself comes may allah give you i can pray i cannot say that a child cannot accept islam it's wrong he can but what i would like to say that if your parents come and have the right to follow the rules and regulation of the school then we have no problem in accepting you so ask your parents to come to our school and the rules and regulations that are there there are many rules and regulations as long as they do not mind following the rules and regulation attending our lectures reading the quran you want to learn arabic you want to accept there's no problem see to it that because i have to follow the law of the country also ask your parents let them come let them interact with the management and if they agree with the rules and regulations inshallah inshallah i'm sure there will not be any problems especially you brothers because they've asked the question to get in the school is difficult to get into islamic international school is one of the most difficult but inshallah because they have asked the question ask your parents to meet brother zakir and inshallah if they agree to follow the rules and regulations admission will be very easy inshaallah for you inshallah hope that answers the question you"
