  "transcript": "the next question from uttar Pradesh India \nhe asks I want to accept Islam but I wouldn't   be able to pray and fast because of family \nobligations so what can I do in this situation the brother he has asked that he wants to accept \nIslam but due to family obligations he will not   be able to pray auto fast so what can you do I \nwould request the brother that first thing he   should do is to accept Islam we do not know \nwhen we will die we do not know how long we   live Allah says number three verse number \n185. Every Soul shall have a taste of death   but the final recompense will be in the hereafter   so we do not know when we will die once you know \nthat Islam is the True Religion once you are   convinced you should accept Islam and you should \nnot delay practice will come slowly and gradually   now since you have mentioned family \nobligations you haven't specified what   do you mean by family obligations perhaps you \nare referring to maybe you are shy to play in   front of your parents maybe you are afraid what \nwill your parents say when they see you praying   you need to convince your parents regarding \nIslam alhamdulillah if you are convinced   regarding Islam you should accept Islam and \nafter that you should convince your parents   tell them teach them regarding the beauty of Islam \nand you should explain it to them regarding Salah   it is very important for a Muslim to play it is \ncompulsory for a Muslim to pray so you should   explain to them regarding the benefits of Salah \nand Allah chapter 29 verse number 45 in fact prevents from shameful and immodest Deeds so you \nshould tell them regarding the benefits of Salah   there are various benefits of Salah we have the \nspiritual benefits we have the medical benefits and besides that   when it comes to fasting you should also \ntell them regarding the benefits of fasting   the spiritual benefits the medical benefits \nEtc Allah says number two verse number 183 oh you'll believe fasting has \nbeen prescribed for you as it   was prescribed to those before you \nso that you may attain self-esteem and fasting has got various benefits \nand you can refer to the series   of my father Ramadan a date with Dr Zakir \nwherein the various spiritual benefits the   various medical benefits regarding fasting are \nmentioned in detail so you should try to convince   your parents and you should try to convince them \nthat these are the benefits and you need to offer   Salah you need to fast the first thing that \nyou should try to do is convince your parents   so that you can practice Islam openly but if you \nare afraid that you cannot tell your parents then   it is not a requirement for you to Proclaim \nyour religion that you have accepted Islam"
