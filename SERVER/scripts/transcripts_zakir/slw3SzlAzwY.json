  "title": "Is the Knowledge Acquired in this World Useful in the Akhirah? – Shaikh Fariq Naik",
  "transcript": "so let's take the first question from bihar india but is living in kyrgyzstan   he asks is there any use of the knowledge \nthat we acquire in this world in the akhirah the knowledge can broadly be classified into two \ncategories the first is the spiritual knowledge   the knowledge of the deen in this there is some \npart of it that is compulsory for you to gain   for example how to offer salah \nregarding fasting regarding giving zakah   so you need to know this knowledge regarding the \nibadat regarding worshiping allah subhanahu talah   the second category is the worldly knowledge \nthe worldly knowledge can broadly be classified   into three more categories the first is the \nknowledge that will take you away from allah   for example learning music this \nknowledge it is prohibited for you   to learn because it will take you away from \nthe deen it will take you away from allah the second category in the worldly knowledge it \nis the knowledge that neither takes you away from   allah subhana with allah nor gets you closer \nto allah and this it is muba it is optional   if you gain it you will not get reward from \nallah if you leave it you will not be sinful   and the third category in the worldly knowledge \nit is the knowledge that gets you closer to allah   for example you learn science in \norder to do dawah to the non-muslims   and to prove to them mentioning the scientific \npoints that are mentioned in the glorious quran   so if you learn science with this \nintention inshallah you will be rewarded so the spiritual knowledge it \nwill help you in the akhirah   the worldly knowledge if it takes you away from \nallah subhanahu ta'ala it will not help you   if it gets you closer to allah then inshallah this \nworldly knowledge it will help you in the akhirah   and you will be rewarded for it if \nthe worldly knowledge if it does not   take you closer to allah no it takes you away \nfrom allah this is mubarak this is optional"
