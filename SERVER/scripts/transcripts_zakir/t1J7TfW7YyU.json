  "transcript": "Dr Zak what is the importance and the authority of the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam as far as the Sunnah is concerned it is the second unavoidable source of Islam if you have to understand Islam number one source is the Quran and the second is the Sunnah of the Prophet to understand the full Islam you cannot understand without these two sources both are important in the Quran as well as authentic authentic Sunnah of the prophet and as far as the importance of Sunnah is concerned Allah says in the Quran in chapter number four verse number 59 obey Allah and obey the messenger and those charged with authority among you but if you defer among yourselves refer it back to Allah and hiso if you believe in Allah and the last day this is the best and the most suitable for the final determination here the word used in the Quran is which means to obey and used for obey Allah and obey the messenger so the obey word is used for Allah and the messenger but it's not used for those charge with authority among you that means the Undisputed obeying is only for Allah and his and further goes on and saying that if those among you those charged with authority if you differ among yourselves refer it back to Allah and hiso so Allah and theol are the final Authority it doesn't say refer it back to those charge with authority because we know that many a Time the scholars they differ among themselves so if they differ if any scholar differs you go back to Allah and theol and the scholar who in line with Allah andol you have to follow him so this is the importance of the Sunnah and further there are two separate things says obey Allah and obey the messenger so obey Allah mean follow the Quran and obey the messenger means follow the Sunnah of the messenger that is authentic Hadi furthermore it says that both these two sources are different Quran is different and the Sunnah authentic Hadith are different and further if we analyze the word VA is used between them indicating that you have to follow both it doesn't say that then you follow the you have to follow both of them simultaneously then only will you understand Islam in the right perspective and here the word that is used here that it is obey Allah and the messenger both are equally important when it says refer back to Allah and theol that means have referred back to Allah and the Not only to Allah or not only to theol both are important for you to understand the true Sharia and the last point to be noted is that the starting of the quranic vers says oh you who believe that means obeying Allah and obeying the messenger is for all the Believers it's not only for the companions or for some of the Believers it's for all the Believers further it's mentioned in Surah Jin chapter number 72 verse number 23 it says that if you disobey Allah and hiso then your place will be in the Hellfire to dwell therein forever that means if you dis Allah and his messenger your place will be in the Hellfire you'll not enter Paradise further it's mentioned that if you don't obey Allah and the messenger your deeds will be in vain Allah says in Surah Muhammad chapter number 47 verse number 33 obey Allah and obey the messenger and let not your Deeds go in vain further as far as the authority of Sunnah is concerned and the importance is concerned obeying the messenger is obeying Allah subhana wa tala Allah says inaha chapter number four verse number 180 that if you obey the messenger you obey Allah subhana tala and if you turn away we have not sent the messenger to look after your Affairs especially your evil deeds and further mentioned in the Hadith of s Muslim volume number three Hadith number 4518 the Beloved Prophet Mall wasam said that if you obey me you obey Allah if you disobey me you disobey Allah so obeying the messenger is same as obeying Allah subhana tala and furthermore Allah says in the Quran in Surah naam chapter number 53 verse number three and four that the messenger does not speak out of himself it is nothing more than an inspiration sent down to him and the Beloved Prophet mallam said it's mentioned inkari number n Hadith number 7 to8 The Beloved Prophet said that there are among the Believers who will enter paradise and some will refuse to enter Paradise so the sahabas asked who would refuse to enter Paradise so the prophet said those who obey me they enter the paradise those who obey me they refuse to enter it and finally the Quran says that if you obey the messenger Allah will love you Allah says in Surah Al Imran chapter number 3 verse number 31 Allah says to Mami wasallam say tell them if you love Allah follow me let is follow the messenger and Allah will love you and he will forgive your sins so following the messenger is loving Allah subhana tala so this is the importance of the Sunnah in Islam"
