  "transcript": "so Dr Zakir Ramadan is a month of opportunities it's a month of blessed opportunities what are the conditions that a person needs to have these Deeds accepted by Allah are number one is the intention it should only be for Allah and no one else whatever did you do it should only be for Allah this is very important if this condition is not met then all your Deeds are wasted and Allah says in the Quran chapter number 19. verse number five it says that you worship none but Allah and you do it only for him and for no one else it is further mentioned chapter number 76 verse number nine it says that we have fed you for the sake of Allah for the pledge of Allah we do not require any reward from you nor do you require any returns that means if you feed someone it is for the sake of Allah not seeking a reward or not seeking anything in return this is a very important factor that we should note all your actions should be for the sake of Allah that's a very important factor and further it's mentioned in the Quran in sureshwara chapter number 42 verse number 20. that if you do a deed for the Tilt for the reward in the Hereafter Allah will multiply your reward your tilt in the hereafter and if you do a deed or any action for a reward in this world Allah will give you the reward in this world but you'll have no share in the hereafter foreign 15 and 16. that anyone who seeks the reward in this world or does any deed for this world and for the glitter of this world Allah will surely give him in this world but he will have no share in the hair after except fire except hell and all his deeds will not be useful in the hereafter so therefore whatever we do should be for Allah and the second caliph of Islam volume number one Hadith number one he said that the Beloved Prophet Muslim said which means your Deeds are judged on your intention and the prophet further said that all your actions are based on your intention and anyone who has migrated he has migrated for the anniversary if anyone has an Hijra migrated for the worldly benefits or for marriage you have migrated for the worldly benefits and marriage so Nia is very important and this is further repeated inside Muslim way number four Hadith number 7114 it says that our beloved Prophet Muslim said that Allah says that I am alone sufficient I do not require any associate and if anyone does any deed for anyone else as well as for me I renounce that for the person who he is associated to that means you can't do part of the deed for Allah and part for someone else you have to do completely for the sake of Allah only for him and no one is Allah does not like anyone associate anything with him that's very important so this is a basic point that is the second point to be noted for a date to be acceptable is that our Deeds should be based on the Sharia it should be in accordance to Allah accordance to the teachings of the Quran and teaching of a beloved Prophet Muslim it's mentioned say Muslim number three Hadith number 4267 Prophet Muslim said that if your deeds and actions are not according to our way according to the religion of Islam according to Quran and say Hadith then that is rejected that means for a Deeds to be accepted it should be according to Quran and say Hadith and it's also mentioned in another of volume number three Hadith number four nine five zero said that he told the people that follow my example and the example of khulfar rashidin that's the rightly guided callous so if you follow them and cling to it with eye teeth that means strongly follow it the Sunnah of the Prophet my Sunnah the prophet said that his Sunnah his way and the way of that is rightly guided callous so for a dick to be accepted Anya should be only for Allah and it should be according to the Sharia Quran"
