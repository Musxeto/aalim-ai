  "transcript": "so let's take the first question assalamu alaikum you said that in surah fusillah chapter number 41 verse number 53 that god will show his signs in the horizon until we know that this is the truth then why is the whole world not muslim allah says in the glorious quran in surah yunus chapter number 10 verse number 99 that if all would have believed in the world entirely that means if allah subhanahu ta'ala will he could have made all the people on earth believe in him believe in allah but this life it is a test for the hereafter if everyone would have been muslims or if allah subhanahu ta'ala would have made everyone accept islam then where lies the test allah subhanahu ta'ala says in the glorious quran in surah mulk chapter number 67 it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you are good in deeds so this life it is a test for the hereafter and we human beings we have been given a free will to either do the right things to either do righteous deeds or to do bad deeds we have the free will it depends upon us human beings what path we choose so this life it is a test for the hereafter if allah subhanahu ta'ala wanted he could have made the entire world except islam now there are various reasons why a person he may not embrace islam there are many people who know that islam it is the correct way of life but yet they are persistent and they do not embrace islam now what are the reasons there are various reasons for example a person if he wants to embrace islam he may think that he will have to leave his previous lifestyle he will have to change his previous lifestyle for example he will have to stop having alcohol he will have to stop having pope the woman she may think that she will have to start wearing the hijab so all these things a person may think that they are obstacles that's the reason a person he may not embrace islam but the moment a person realizes that islam it is the correct way of life he should immediately accept islam the first and the most important thing is entering into the fold of islam later on the practice can come gradually but the most important thing is believing in one god allah subhanahu ta'ala and whenever you're doing dawah the first thing the primary thing that you need to focus on it is that's the oneness of allah subhanahu ta'alah because if you do not talk about tawheed all your dhawa it is useless allah says in surah nisa chapter number four verse number 48 answer nissa chapter number 4 verse 116 that if allah pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of shirk he will not forgive so this life it is a test for the hereafter if allah wanted he could have made the entire world embrace islam but allah subhanahu ta'ala he's testing as human beings and this life it is a test for the hereafter and those people who succeed in this test they will have the eternal reward they will attain the pleasure of allah and they will enter the gardens of paradise"
