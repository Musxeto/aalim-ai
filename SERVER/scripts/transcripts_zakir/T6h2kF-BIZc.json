  "transcript": "and many of the critics of Islam they quote the famous verse of the Quran of Surah chapter 9 verse number five which says wherever you find the kafir you kill him and Arun shuri in his book The World of fatwas quote the same verse and he gives the reference Quran says chapter 9 verse number five wherever you find the kafir into bracket he says Hindu you kill him and when you open the Quran verse number five when you read the translation the Quran does say wherever you find the unbeliever kafir Kilim but it is out of context to understand the context you start from verse number one chapter nine there was a peace treaty between the Muslims and the mushriks of Makkah this peace treaty was unilaterally broken by the mushriks of Makkah by the time Allah reaches verse number five he is giving an ultimatum to the musics of Makkah put things straight in four months time otherwise the declaration of war and in the battlefield when the any men they come to kill you when they come to attack you in the battlefield when the unbelievers come then kill them don't get scared kill them and wait for them in every stratism of War this is the verse of the Quran talking about the battlefield when the enemies break the contract and when they come in the battlefield to fight you don't get scared fight them back and this is normal any army General to boost the morale of his soldiers he will not run away he will say when the enemies come you fight them that is what the Quran says it is a verse in the battlefield it's taken out of context after quoting verse number five he jumps to verse number seven you know why verse number six has the answer to the sickness chapter number nine verse number six says if the unbelievers if the enemies if they want peace if they want Asylum don't just give it to them escort them to a place of security they want Asylum if they want peace don't just give it to them escort them to a place of security so that they may hear the word of Allah today which army General will say this maximum we will tell the soldiers if the enemy won't be let them go yeah Quran said don't let them go escort them to a place of security and almost all the verses of the Quran whenever it talks about fighting in the battlefield the next verse say peace is better whichever words you pick up of the Quran when he talks about fighting in the battlefield against enemy immediately next verse say peace is better even this verse says if the enemy want peace give and the Quran is very explicit the verse which was cited by the car in the beginning of the program Surah maida chapter 5 mathaidu says that if anyone kills any other human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone saves any human being it is as though he has saved the whole nation here the Quran says if any human being kills any other human being whether Muslim or non-muslim any human being kills any other human being whether Muslim or non-muslim unless it be for corruption for spreading corruption or for murder it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone saves any human being whether Muslim or non-muslim it is as though he has saved the whole of humanity this verse of the Quran alone is sufficient to prove that Islam is against killing of any innocent human being by the Muslim or non-muslim there is no other scripture in the world which says this that if you kill one human being you have killed the whole of humanity and if you save one human being you have saved the whole Humanity Islam is so clear and explicit killing of any innocent human being is totally prohibited and I remember in Bombay in 2006 I gave a talk on is Terrorism a Muslim Monopoly that's a different subject altogether and that happened immediately after the train Bomb Blast in Bombay and the situation in Bombay was tense here the police is telling me that why don't you give a talk to explain to the Muslims and the Muslims are telling me why don't you give a talk to the police to explain because I'm on the edge of a start now in the sensitive situation I ever talk on this terrorism Muslim Monopoly and I gave my views and during question answer time there was a Hindu who came and told that if I was a Muslim you know thousands of Muslims were killed in Gujarat thousands of Muslim women were raped and later on there's a bomb blast that takes place in Bombay more than 180 people are killed and it was in the newspaper that Muslims are behind the Bomb Blast so doing questions the time this Hindu gets up and says that if I was in the place of the Muslim and if thousands of Muslims were killed and thousands of women were raped I would have done the same thing I would have done the bombas in Bombay and everyone clapped I told him that what you're behaving is like a normal human being it's a reaction thousands of Muslims are killed and if thousands of Muslim women are raped but I cannot do that I being a Muslim I cannot do that because my Quran the past and final commandment in the Quran does not permit me to kill any innocent human being if some Hindus have done in Gujarat it does not permit me to kill the other Hindus in Bombay because some Hindus I cannot harm the Hindus of Bombay if you catch the Hindu in Gujarat who has done the mistake give him to the law give him punishment and for it but you cannot take Revenge by killing Hindus in Bombay it's not allowed in Islam imagine the innocent Hindu who's been harmed his family forever would become enemies of Islam killing any innocent human being is prohibited Islam and one more example that when I was in UK or when I was allowed to go to UK I give a talk on same topic Islamic Viewpoint a young boy after my life and then he said that the two George Bush that's true George Bush I give such a good lecture now this young Muslim on my full lecture ruined my full lecture then I told him that if you read the seera of the Prophet Muhammad sallam he prayed to Allah that there were two staunch enemies of Islam both their names were Umar so a prophet prayed to Allah that at least give hidayah to one Umar who became the staunchest supporter of Islam so I pray to Allah that give hidayah to George Bush by killing him he won't solve the problem I pray that give hidayah to one of the two George Bush or Tony Blair you read the Syrah of the Prophet rather than be emotional you know Muslim you are emotional if you read the seedah of the Prophet you know how did the prophet deal with things that fight against those who fight you but do not transgress for Allah likes not those who are transgressors chapter 2 verse 193. that fight until there is no more tumult and operation Islam is against oppression and even when we do kital there are certain guidelines laid down by Allah and his messenger that when you have to fight in self-defense almost all were in self-defense there are guidelines laid down that when you fight do not Chop trees do not hurt the woman do not hurt the old man do not come in the battlefield do not kill children do not break down monasteries do not destroy the temples today you find in the all bombing everyone women kill children killed men killed if you compare in the complete history of Muslim they were 82 encounters taking place and 1018 people were killed in World War One more than 10 million people were killed in World War II more than 20 million people were killed compare this today as I said media is very powerful can convert black into white day into night when the Christian nuns when they cover the head they are respected when Muslim women covered that then they say Islam degrades of women why when the sick where the turbulent keeps appeared he's called religious when Muslims were a captain keeper word is called as a fundamentalist terrorist thank you thank you"
