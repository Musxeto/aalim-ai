  "title": "Why is Consumption of Alcohol Prohibited in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "what does islam say about alcohol does it prohibit it entirely allah says in the quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 90. oh you believe in number hum roll my suru most certainly intoxicants and gambling well unswab will azamu dedication of stones divination of arrows rich su min ali shaitaan these are satan's handiwork first and ebula kum abstain from this handover that you may prosper so allah says this is risumin amali shaitan it's a certain handiwork abstained from it that you may prosper and imam adhabi in his list of al-qabayah in the 70 major sins he puts having alcohol intoxicants cummer having wine number 19 in the list and having intoxicants is even prohibited in christianity if you read the bible it's mentioned in the book of proverbs chapter number 20 verse number one it says that wine is a mocker it is strong raging drink and anyone who deceived he is not wise it's mentioned the book of ephesians chapter number 5 verse number 18 be not drunk with wine but unfortunately we find that none of the christians and the jews they follow their advice given the bible unfortunately and what is the logic the reason that islam has prohibited alcohol normally in a human being there is an inhibitory center this inhibitory center it prevents a human being from doing things which are illogical and not correct for example if a person wants to go to the call of nature the innovative center will say that don't do it in a public place go to the toilet anybody center is working at liberty center when a person speaks to the parents tells that don't be disrespectful to parents don't use foreign language so this is the work of anybody center when a person is intoxicated when a person has intoxication has wine has alcohol the inability center is inhibited and he doesn't know what is speaking therefore you find many of them they start cursing they start doing verbal abuse you find them saying obscene things you may find them that they urinate in their own clothes so this is because anybody's center is inhibited and if we analyze that alcohol is responsible for many crimes that take place according to the u.s department of justice 1996 every day in the year 1996 2713 cases of rape took place that means every third second one rape is taking place in america in 1996 and the report says that majority of the people who committed rape they were intoxicated furthermore in american statistics it says that eight percent of the americans they indulge in incest having intercourse with the close relative and it says that every 12th person you come across in america they're doing incest and majority of them they're in a state of intoxication when they do insist so we realize that alcoholism besides being bad for the health it's a cause for many diseases and health wise and even it's a cause for aids which has recently cropped up and there are many people who say that i am a social drinker and i have only one pack i don't get intoxicated when you interview the alcoholics all of them when we ask them they will say the initially they were social drinkers no alcoholic starts to drink because he wants to become alcoholic all of them are social drinkers and later on they become alcoholics and if you meet any social drinker who has been drinking for a couple of years you ask him that how many times he been intoxicated and there will be several time that he's been intoxicated with all the power that he has and once the person is intoxicated and if he commits a sin like rape like incest it's an unforgivable sin and irreversible damage done and we realize that that's the reason a beloved prophet muslim mentioned in ibn volume number three book of intoxicants chapter number 30 hadith number 3371 the blood prophet said that intoxication alcohol is the mother of all evils alcohol is the mother of all evils and further mentioned in ibn maja volume number three book of intoxicants chapter number 30 hadith number 3392 the beloved prophet said that anything which intoxicates in large quantity is even prohibited in small quantity no excuse for nipper taught you can't say that i'll take a peg you know whatever intoxicates in large quantity is improving small quantity and the beloved prophet he has cursed ten categories of people who indulged in alcohol it's mentioned in ibn maja volume number three book of intoxicants chapter number 30 hadith number 3380 the beloved prophet said 10 categories of people who indulge in alcohol are cursed the one who distills it the one for it is distilled the one who drinks it the one who transports it the one for whom it is bought the one who sells it the one who serves it the one who utilizes the earnings from the sale of alcohol the one who buys it the one who buys it for somebody else so all these 10 categories of people they are cursed by lasala and there are various different diseases that a person can acquire when he has alcohol and today alcohol is one of the major causes for the maximum number of deaths in the world and today science tells us and many people aware of it that the various diseases the person can have the most common is saros of liver if a person is alcoholic has high chances of having straws of liver he can have cancer of the esophagus cancer of the head and neck cancer of the bowel cancer of the liver he can have gastritis he can

woman she can get affected more by alcohol and the steroids of liver is much dangerous in the woman if she's pregnant she can have the alcohol fetal syndrome they can be skin disorders like alopecia they can be nail dystrophy they can be angular stomatitis you can keep on listing the diseases for us together only because of the consumption of alcohol but nowadays my colleagues the medical doctors they say that alcoholism is a disease you know they try to pacify that don't be rude to the alcoholic no don't blame him alcoholism is a disease if alcoholism is a disease it is the only disease that is sold in bottles it is the only disease that is advertised in the newspapers in the magazines on radiobroadcast stations it's advertised in the satellite channels in the television it is only disease that has licensed outlets for its sale it is only disease that brings a revenue to the government it's the only disease that causes violence that's on the highways it is only disease that ruins family it's the only disease that has got no viral or germ cause it's not a disease as allah says in surah maidah chapter 5 verse number 90 shaitaan it is the satan's handiwork first animal abstain from this handover that you may prosper"
