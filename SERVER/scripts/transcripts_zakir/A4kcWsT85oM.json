  "title": "Can a Police Officer accept Gratification and Gifts from Public which he does not demand for?",
  "transcript": "the next question is from jabir haruna from nigeria i am a police officer is it allowed for a public officer to accept gratification and gifts from public which one does not demand for another question from anonymous india but living in dubai if anyone accepts bribe for some years and he then repents and makes tawbah how can he refund or compensate as he has collected money from too many people by doing fraud brother has asked a question that if he gets gratification or without demanding some gifts as a police officer then is it accepted or not i believe what prophet muhammad said it's mentioned in cyborg number nine hadith number 6979 that the prophet told one of the persons to go and collect zakat so when he comes back he tells the prophet this is your money of zakat and this is the gift i received the prophet replies that will you go and sit at the home of your father and the home of your mother and do you think you'll get these gifts and the prophet gets very angry and immediately when he's addressing the people he tells oh my people i had appointed one of you to do an important task for me which allah had entrusted on me referring to collection of zakat that person comes and gives me and says this is the zakat money which is for you and this is the gift i received i told him that will you go and sit at the house of your father and house of your mother and do you think you'll get these gifts then the prophet says that o people you do not take a single unlawful thing otherwise you will carry that with you on the day of judgement the prophet said do not take any single thing unlawful otherwise you will carry that thing with you on the day of judgment to allah and the prophet said i do not want any of you to be seen carrying a camel which is grunting or a cow which is moving or a sheep which is bleeding that means the prophet has prohibited anyone from taking anything extra and unlawful it further mentioned in the hadith of sunnah abu dhabi verb number three hadith number 2943 that the prophet said that the person who we employ for administrative work and when we give him provision if he takes anything besides that it is meaning embezzlement meaning fraud meaning bribery it's further mentioned in the hadith number three hadith number 2945 that the prophet said that if we employ anyone for administrative work and if he comes with his wife if he doesn't have a servant he may have a servant if he doesn't have a dwelling he may have a dwelling and abu bakr allah continues that the prophet said that anything above this is treachery and theft it's further mentioned in muslim ahmed hadith number 23601 that the beloved prophet said that anything received by employee of the government it is rule embezzlement it is treachery from all these hadith we come to know that any employee of the government or provided by the government or as for that matter any company besides the salary what he gets and besides the perk what he gets anything else he received from anyone outside it is equal to bribery it is equal to colon it is equal to embezzlement that means any government servant in any country today muslim country or any other country if he receives anything besides the salary and the perk which is mentioned in the contract anything above it may be you know we call in india chai paneer pakistan chai pani meaning water and tea some people say sweets some people say oiling of the palm or greasing of the palm some people say under the table all these things gifts any gift direct or indirect besides the salary and the perks that has been given officially in the contract anything above that is bribery so as far as the first question is concerned asked by the brother in nigeria if you are a police officer or working at any post of the government besides your salary and the perks that is given by the government anything else is counted as bribery as for a matter of fact if a person is working on a high post or any post in a private company as a manager of the company he's getting his salary he's getting his perks he's getting his allowance above that if any of the client gave him any gift or watch or anything else this is counted as bribery according to the beloved prophet muslim it is counted as embezzlement regarding the second question a similar question that is asked by anonymous india that if anyone accepts bribe for some years and he repents and makes toba how can he refund or compensate as he's collected money from too many people by doing this fraud and as you know that bribery is the 32nd major sin in the book of al-qabaya by imam dhabi amongst the major sins imam dhabi lists bribery as number 32 it's mentioned in the glorious quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 188 that use not your wealth as bait for judges in order to eat other people's wealth it's mentioned in jamaica media hadith number 1337 that the beloved prophet muslim said that anyone who gives bribe or anyone who takes bribe allah's messenger has cursed them so bribing is a major sin if someone now wants to repent and do tawbah what can he do for doing so bad there are five requirements number one he should agree what he's doing is wrong number two he should stop it immediately number three he should repent and ask for forgiveness number four he should not do it again and number five if possible he should undo it for example if you have taken bribery from many people if you can remember the amount or the name of the person and if you can give back that's the best if you do not remember if you have taken too much then follow the first four things at least the degree it is wrong stop it ask for forgiveness don't do it again and what you can do is you can give charity what you think you have collected in all these years give that in charity to the poor people ask for forgiveness inshallah allah will forgive you"
