  "transcript": "the importance of maharam and fasting on the day of ashora our beloved prophet in say muhammad or number four hadith number 3197 that our beloved prophet muslim said that the year is 12 months and of them four are sacred three are in consecutive numbers that is and the fourth is rajab a similar message is given by allah in the glorious quran in surah alba chapter number 9 verse number 36 where allah says that the number of months in the site of allah are 12 in a year so you ordained the creation of the heaven and the earth and from them four are sacred and but naturally these four sacred months are mentioned in sai buhari as i mentioned earlier that is rajab so do not do wrong doings in them allah saying in surah by chapter 9 verse number 36 that in these four sacred months do not do any wrongdoings that means if a person does any sin the sins are more graver in these four sacred months they are more heavier in these four second months and the good deeds that you do they will be more rewarding so the muslims should see to it that during the four sacred months they should be more careful they should abstain from all the sins especially the major sins as well as almost all the minor sins too and we should do as many good deeds as possible time will not permit me to repeat all the good deeds and i done that earlier when i spoke about the virtues of dulija i had mentioned 45 good deeds the pharah is the muslim the other sunnahs etc it is further mentioned in sahih muslim point number three hadith number 2755 our beloved prophet salallahu said that the most important fast after the fast of ramadan is in the month of allah in maharan referring to the day of ashura and the most important salah after the first salah is the night prayers that is the kamul tajut and the wither it further mentioned inside muslim verb number three hadith number 2746 a beloved prophet muslim said that fasting on the day of ashura the 10th of muharram i will pray to allah that may he forgive the sins of the previous year that means if a person farts on the 10th of muharram on the day of ashura all your sins of the previous year will be washed away but natural these sins are referring to the minor sins not counting the major sins that means the most important fast after the further fast of ramadan is the fasting of ashora but scholars differ foca has most of the focus says that the most important fast is the fasting on the day of arafah because on the day of arafah besides the sins of the previous years being washed away even the sins of the future one year is washed away that means if you fast on the day of arafah two years of sins are washed away the previous year and the following that is the next year if you fast on the day of ashura only one year that the previous year's sins are washed away therefore most of them say the most important fast is arafa few say the most important fast is fasting on the day of ashora but unanimously all agree that these two fast fasting on the day of arafah and fasting on the fasura are the most too important fast after the first fast of ramadan it is mentioned in say buhari volume number five hadith number 3943 that ibn pass radhiallah one may allah be pleased with him he narrates that when the prophet reached madina he found that the jews were fasting on the 10th of mara and he asked them that why do you fast during this day they said this day allah gave victory to moses and the people of bani israel over feron so the prophet replied that we muslims are more closer to musam than the jews and he ordered the muslims to fast on ashura the tenth of maharam it's further mentioned in say buhari he narrates that he never found the prophet wanting to fast on any day more than the day of ashora and this month that is the month of ramadan it's further mentioned in solan abu dhabi volume number three hadith number 2445 that the prophet peace be upon him the people approached him and they told him that the jews and the christians they fast on the tenth of murrah on the day of ashura so the prophet said next year we will also fast on the 9th of mara it's mentioned in muslim world number 2 hadith number 2154 that the prophet said do the opposite of what the jews and the christians do besides fasting on the tenth of muram also fast on the ninth or the eleventh of maraam because of this when you read the shara of say buhari half is ibn hajjar ascalani he says that fasting of ashura is of three levels the lowest is fasting on the 10th of maram the day of ashora the second is fasting on the 9th and the tenth of maura and the highest is fasting on ninth tenth and eleventh of maura that means we muslims we learn from all the hadees that mauram is the month of allah it's one of the four sacred months in the sacred month we should do good deeds obtained from bad deeds and the best is that we fast on all three days the 9th the tenth and the eleventh of mauram that is the best if you cannot fast for three days at least fast for two days ninth and tenth of monroe or tenth eleventh of if you cannot fast for two days and you can only do for one day then the least of the least you can do is fast at least on the 10th of maram on the day of ashora this was the short message on the importance of maharam and fasting on the referee"
