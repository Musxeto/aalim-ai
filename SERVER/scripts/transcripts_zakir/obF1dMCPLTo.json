  "transcript": "what is the label for the Muslim for the Muslim woman even they have a label the Glorious Quran says in Surah n chapter number 24 verse number 31 that say to the believing woman that they should lower the Gaze and guard the modesty and display not the beauty except what appears ordinar off and draw their Veil over the bosom and display not the beauty except through the husband their fathers their sons and a big list of mam the close relatives who she can't marry is given and the criteria for hijab is mentioned in the Quran and the they're basically six criteria the first is the extent which differs between the man and the woman for the man is from the nav to the knee for the woman the complete body should be covered except the faith and the hands up to the wrist some scholar say even the feet below the ankle can be seen there are some Scholars who say that even the face and the hands should be covered this is extinct the remaining five criterias is the same for the man and the woman the second is that the clothes they wear it should not be so tight that it reveals the figure we have many of our Muslim brothers who wear jeans that are so stretch jeans you know skin tight stretch jeans wearing skin tight stretch jeans AA of the man is from the nav to the knee he cannot wear any clothes which reveals the figure of that part you know skin tight where you can see the curves it's not allowed the third the clothes they wear it should not be transparent so that you can see through the Muslim women may be covering the body they may be wearing loose clothes but it may be transparent you know made of or something like that that's not allowed fourth is it should not be So Glamorous that it attracts the opposite sex fifth is it should not resemble that of the unbeliever any label which is a specific sign of an unbeliever a Muslim cannot wear for example a Muslim cannot wear a cross it's a specific sign of Christianity he cannot wear om which is the sign of Hinduism he cannot wear a Vermon or a Tika which is sign of Hindu he cannot wear any specific signs which is a sign of an unbeliever and the sixth criteria is you cannot wear clothes that which resemble the opposite sex if you go to the Western countries you have many boys and gents they wear a earring only one earring it has certain significance if you wear one earring it has certain significance and the Indians whatever America does after a few years when we follow and you find even in Bombay nowadays men wearing one yearing According to Islamic Sharia you cannot wear clothes that which resemble that of the opposite sex and the reason for hijab for the woman is given in Surah aab 33 verse 59 where it says that oh Prophet tell your wives and the believing woman that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested the Quran says that hijab has been prescribed for the women so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested for example if two sisters who are twins and if both of them are very beautiful they're equally beautiful if they're walking down the streets of Bombay and if one of the twin sister she's wearing the Islamic hijab the complete body covered except the face and the hand up the wrist and the other twin sister she's wearing the western clothes the skirt or the mini and if they're walking down the streets and if around the corner there is a holigan there is a ran who's waiting for a catch who's waiting to tease a girl I'm asking a question which girl will it tease will he tease the girl wearing the Islamic hijab or will it tease the girl wearing the skirt of the mini which girl will it tease but naturally he will tease the girl wearing the score of the mini the Quran rightly says that hijab has been prescribed for the woman so that it shall prevent them from being molested there are some of a Muslim sisters who may give the excuse that when we wear the hijab when we wear the scarf or when we wear the CT or the hijab the people they stare at us therefore it is unnecessary attracting attention I tell them I do agree with you there may be cases in which because you're unique no one around you is wearing the hijab and if you wear the hijab people may look at you because you're odd the odd man out or rather the odd woman out it may it may happen but I tell them that when the people look at you when you wear the hijab they don't look at you with lust they look at you with respect there a difference to the other lady who's wearing the skirt of the mini the men look at with lust to you if they look at you they look at you with respect they may look at you because you may look unique but when they look at you they look at you with respect and you can ask this question to the ladies who do hijab and even my sister alhamdulillah she confirms that because we wear the hijab alhamdulillah the people around us respect us when we go in the bus they offer us a seat alhamdulillah it elevates the position of the woman and many women think that if you have to wear a hijab you have to wear a black bka it is compulsory no way does the Islamic Sharia say that you should wear only a bka as long as it doesn't attract the opposite sex you can wear any color you can wear brown you can wear blue you can wear white you can wear Ivory you can wear any color maybe people prefer black you know because if you wear a black bka you may have to wash it once in a week or once in a fortnite if you wear a white bka you may have to wash it every day or maybe every alternate day so the choice is yours you can either wear a black B and wash it once a week or wear a white bka or light color bka and wash it every couple of days the option is yours nowh does Islamic Shar say that you should wear black if you want you can make black you can make any color as long as you follow the six criterias of the Islamic Sharia"
