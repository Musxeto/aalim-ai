  "title": "Polygamy in Hinduism and Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "furthermore people talk about that why does Islam allow a man to have more than one wife in fact if you analyze most of the major scriptures they permit a man to marry as many wives as they wish if you read Ramen the father of ram King desrad he had three wives the Vishnu Sutra chapter number 24 verse number one it says a Brahman can have four wives Krishna and Harmony wives four ten thousand ten thousand Krishna had sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives four Quran says chapter number four verse number three married women for choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one in Islam you are allowed to marry two three or four but if you can't do justice you can only marry one but if you can do justice the max term you can marry only four you cannot marry beyond that and the reason why Islam allows polygamy you can refer to my video because I said women's rights in Islam"
