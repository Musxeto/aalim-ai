  "transcript": "now we will discuss the second point which is the important acts and deeds to be done during the first 10 days of the ledger i have enumerated 35 important points some people have listed 10 20 30 some more there are hundreds of good deeds you can do to make the list a bit shorter i have enumerated 35 important deeds and acts to be done during the first 10 days of the lecture and whenever i enumerate i try and enumerate the ones which are the first on the top then coming with the highly recommended sunnah and then the other sunnah later on that's my policy and when i repeat the good deeds i also repeat the farahs which are supposed to be done daily because what other farage daily has to be done first then you can talk about the sunnate makada then you can talk about the sunita here so this is the order i follow whenever i list the important acts or deeds to be done so number one the most important act during the first endeavor of dilijah is that you should offer salah in congregation in the mosque all the five daily salah in congregation in a mosque it is affar especially for the muslim men for the woman there are exceptions and when i'm listing these 35 important points it is for all types of muslim whether you are more practicing muslim whether you are moderate practicing muslim or less practical muslim if you are a less practice muslim you will see to it that you will do as much as these good deeds as possible if you're moderate what you'll do you'll try and do all of these 35 good tips if you're already a practicing muslim then what you'll do you'll see to it that will increase the intensity of a mother so these days are meant for all the muslims whether less practicing moderate practicing or more practicing if you're less practicing you see to it that you do as much as possible of all the good deeds if you're moderate you see to that you do all the good deeds and increase the intensity if you're already a good practice muslim doing all the pharaohs see to that you increase the intensity of the mustahab also do the germustab if you're moderate and you're doing the faraf then you do the sun if you are a highly practicing muslim then besides the farah and the sunnah you do the sunnita germa if you are already doing the sunita garamo what do you do you increase the intensity so during these two important days one is the first ten is of dilijah and the other are the days in the month of ramadan it's very important that you increase your intensity of your ibadah so the first important deed to be done during the first villager is offer salah in congregation all five times in the mosque number two if you have not performed hajj you should perform much if it's harder than you if you have the means and if you have the health and the wealth and if you have not performed much you should perform much it's the further on you if you have already performed hajj and if you can do it again it is mustabe it is sunnah it is encouraged but we know since last one and a half year we have this pandemic of the karna virus and last year hardly approximately 1000 were committed to hajj this year alhamdulillah the saudi government has announced they will allow 60 000 muslims to do hajj out of which 15 000 would be saudi national and the balance 45 000 would be the foreigners who are living in saudi arabia who already have the karma they will not allow any outside people to enter who are not residents of saudi arabia but those who are already residents of saudi arabia they will allow forty five thousand people and the secret they will allow from all the different nationalities depending upon the percentage they're present we pray to allah that may he next year solve this problem of the pandemic and again the muslims would be able to do in large numbers inshallah in millions like what we used to do two years before the third important act indeed is that you should abstain from all the haram acts from the major sins as well as the minor sins and if you're a good muslim not doing any major sins alhamdulillah there are some minor sins that muslims normally do unknowingly unknowingly see to it that during this 10 days you abstain from all the sins not in the major sins but each and every of the minor sins the fourth is that you should fast during your arafah the ninth and as i mentioned earlier it will expedite your sins of the previous year and the coming year the fifth is fast during all the first nine days of the luja and that is a highly recommended sunnah sixth is that if you have the means you should sacrifice during your that is the tenth day of duluth if you have the means and allah has given you capacity sacrifice an animal on this day the seventh is that say the tasbih that is subhanallah say the timid that is alhamdulillah say the talib that is and say the tagbird allahu akbar as much as possible during all the 10 days of the raja we can recite together you can recite this as much as possible throughout the day the eighth is that you should go out in the marketplace and say that that as loudly so that people are reminded of allah and they also repeat it on their own and the azad mentioned earlier as much as possible go out in the marketplace tell to the others remind others to do zikr to remember allah it is more savable than distributing gold or silver in the marketplace the ninth is praying the tahajud salah in the last one third of the night and do dua and ask for forgiveness during this last one third of the night in which allah subhanahu ta'ala answers the prayer of the maximum the tenth is pray the sunnate that is there are twelve sunuti makada in which the prophet said if you pray the swell rakaat you will enter jannah and have a house close to the house of the prophet and the twelfth sunita mokada the two raka sunnah before the father salah the two plus two four raka sunnah before the duhar salah two rakat sunnah after the duhar salah the torah sunnah after the maghrib salah and two raka sunnah after the isha salah there are total twelve marqada in the full day also offer the salat and the salah doha is offered approximately when sheikhoutimi was asked which is the right time he said immediately about 20 minutes after the sunrise till about 10 to 15 minutes before the time you can offer the salad any time between this time you can offer two rakat profits the two rakats as much as you can but the profit most of the time you offered for a car so preferably for a card you can even offer two rakah the prophet even offered eight rakat during father makkah before that but preferable is for rakat which was usually practice of the prophet and the better time to offer the prophet said is when the camel can feel the heat of the sand so it is preferable to offer after the midpoint between the fajr and between the doha this is a better time but you can offer any time 20 minutes after the sunrise and if you offer immediately after sunday it's called at ishraq but the better time is after the midpoint as is the sun of the prophet the 12th point is that you should do dua before breaking your fast the thirteenth is do as much as dua throughout the ten days of the duleja and do not miss doing dua during the friday of these ten days the first ten days of the religion whenever friday comes whether once or twice see to it that you offer in that one hour after sir sallah before my grip this is an important time one of the prescribed time for the fourteenth is do zikr of allah as much as possible throughout the ten days of the religion point number 15 read the quran and if you don't understand arabic along with arabic read the translation of the quran in the language you understand the best point number 16 ask for forgiveness from allah during these first 10 days of the rija point number 17 give as much as charity as possible besides asaka if you have given your sakat good if you have not see to it you give it but besides zakat give as much as charity as possible point number 18 do as many good deeds as possible point number 19 do task enoughs every day during these 10 days of furniture point number 20 recite the of the beloved prophet if you have not reciting start reciting in this 10 days if you recite few start reciting more or increase the number of dua for example when you enter the mosque there's a dua when you come out of the mosque there's a dua when you're under the toilet when you come out of the toilet when you wear a dress there's a dua for most of the acts there are duas so see to it you do the muslin duas point number 21 do as many sunnahs of the prophet for example while you drink water seed to it you sit and drink water it is a very important sun of the prophet when you wear a footwear see to it do you wear the footwear on the right leg first when you remove the footwear see to it you remove your left leg first when you're into the mask end up with right leg when you exit the moss you enter with the left leg when you enter the toilet enter with the left leg when you exit the toilet you exit the rod with the right leg when you're wearing a dress a shirt put your right hand first when you're removing the shirt remove the left hand first when you're wearing a trouser put the right leg first when you're removing the torso remove your left leg first these are the various sunnahs of the prophet do as many sunnah as you can if you're not doing start doing it if you're doing few do more if you are doing more increase it as much as possible during these 10 days of the lucha during these first 10 days of dulija you should see to it that a good deed should increase as compared to the other days of the year it should be more if you're ready for you do us read more to us if you're reading only the first start reading the sun if you're reading all these three increase your salah increase your dua increase you're asking for forgiveness 22 read the authentic hadith of the prophet that's i had it you have to say buhari say muslim and this is allah say of albani that they had it from abu dhabi from nisai from ibn maja and so forth and there's also a new compilation done by sheikh zaraman azmi of jamaica we've accumulated all the hadees sahih and remove the duplicate which is approximately sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six hadith all they say so once you read this you can easily say that you have read all the say hadith irrespective whether it's buhari muslim etc without duplicating so it's easier so if you read the java kamil it's a good thing to do point number 23 you should forgive people's fault forgive the faults of others whatever faults that people do around you rather than keeping in your mind or taking a grudge forgive it if you forgive people fault allah will forgive you whether it be of a family member whether it be of your staff whether it be people around you forgive as many faults as possible of the others point

point number 32 spend more time with your family when i spend more time with the family doesn't mean that you go out more with them shopping all the 10 days yes if you want to shop just before eat then buy them good clothes they said no problem but not all 10 days not going for outing when i say spend more time with the family that along with the family you read the quran you read the skill of the prophet at an islamic program authentic scholars and authentic curators watch the video recordings of authentic orators on various platforms social media platforms hear the audio together spend time discuss with them talk to them about the good needs to be done in the first 10 days of the elijah about the sunnah of the prophet read the translation of the quran this time you are doing a venn diagram besides doing the ibadah you are asking your family to devada and the prophet said that the best amongst the muslim is the one who's best with family especially his wife so spend more time
