  "transcript": "the second message that i want to deliver before we throw the floor open for the open question session is that 15 point action plan for the muslim ummah when someone insults prophet muhammad peace be upon him or indulges in islamic blasphemy i will not be repeating what i spoke last week last saturday in the last session about what was done in france including the act of president emmanuel macron of france i will not be repeating that and had given a short message of 24 minutes last saturday in that message i did say that what president emmanuel macron said that islam is in crisis all over the world he got it wrong it is actually islam has the solution for the crisis all over the world and i requested that if you hear my talk islam the solution for the problems of humanity it will clarify all its questions and even my talk on is terrorism a muslim monopoly it will reply to the allegations of president macron that islam is radical religion and islamist religion of terrorism it will give the details i also mentioned in the last session that regarding what muslims should do they should listen to my answer which i gave in 2006 regarding the danish cartoons the jolly boston newspaper in denmark which had given caricatures 12 cartoons of a beloved prophet muslim but because i got so many requests from the viewers that i should repeat the reply and but naturally since that reply was in 2006. that's about nine years ago today i thought of giving a short message on the 15-point action plan for the muslim ummah when someone insults prophet muhammad peace be upon him or indulges in islamic blasphemy if someone speaks against allah against the quran against islam so this answer is a brief regarding the 15 actions that the muslims should take it's not only focused or localized to what's happening in france it includes that but this is the general answer on 15 actions that the muslims should take this answer of mine will just be touching on the highlights of the 15 points i will not be going to the details because there is a question answer session each action or each point in detail can be spoken for an hour or more it requires a lecture so this i'll be just touching the salient features of the 15 actions that muslims should take and it will be specifically dealing on this topic i will not be discussing about the general pharisees that all muslims should do that we muslims should be good examples to the non-muslims that we should be honest we should be kind we should be merciful we should be humble we should be helping all this is spoken by me in detail in other various lectures of mine so today i will be hitting the nail on the head only speaking specifically of the 15 actions that the muslim ummah should take when someone insults the prophet or someone indulges in islamic blasphemy the first action whenever someone reads any article against the prophet or sees a sketch or a cartoon insulting a beloved partner we should follow the hadith of the prophet muhammad our beloved prophet muhammad said it's mentioned inside muslim number one hadith number 177 that the beloved prophet muslim said that if you see any evil action you should change it with your hand that means you take an action against it if you cannot then do it with your tongue that is by speaking if you cannot then do it with your heart that means hate that act and agree it is wrong then you will be the lowest level of moment the lowest level of a believer so the least a muslim can do whenever he hears any derogatory remarks against the prophet or any caricature or any cartoon against the prophet any insult against the prophet any blasphemy against islam the least he can do is condemn it immediately in his heart and agree that what is done is wrong this is the least anyone can do today after the society has advanced we find many muslims have got so much westernized and have started agreeing with the freedom of expression that many a times when someone insults a prophet you don't even bat an eyelid as nothing has happened oh this is freedom of speech today's world is you know it's a global village and the freedom of speech that someone wants to insult the prophet no problem a moment a true moment whenever he hears any insults the least he can do is condemn that act in his heart so number one that any muslim should do whenever he comes across any blasphemy against islam any insult against the prophet is condemn that act and agree it is wrong then only can you go ahead with the other steps if you don't condemn it if you don't hate that thing in your heart if you don't agree it is wrong then how will you be able to reply or to take the other steps so number one is you have to condemn that act in your heart"
