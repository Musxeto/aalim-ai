  "title": "Six Circumstances in which Backbiting is Permitted - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "backbiting of course is prohibited irrespective whether in ramadan or outside ramadan however would a woman who complains to her husband about her mother-in-law will she be considered as a person who has backbited regarding backbiting being haram and the major sin we discussed in the last episode and there are various hadith and quranic verses it's one of the major sins but as far as a wife complaining to the husband regarding the mother-in-law but naturally she is speaking something about the mother-in-law but the mother-in-law would not like anyone speaking about so it does come in the category of backbiting is it a sin is a question such incidences where a person complains to someone and thinks and feels that once the complaint is given to the person maybe there is a correction in action like a wife complaining to the husband about the mother-in-law or the wife complaining to the husband about a son that he is doing so and so things which are wrong so the husband will correct being a father of the child or maybe one of the two brothers is going and coming into the father that my brother returns to thing which is wrong it's being ill about him behind but that is so that the father can correct the brother so these things have been permitted because the main reason why doing this thing should not be to mock at someone or should not be to belittle anyone but the main purpose should be that the person who the person is complaining about there should be correction in act and if you read the commentary of imam and navi as far as the hadith of say muslim which we discussed in the last episode hadith number 6265 in which the prophet peace be upon him he said that do you know what is backbiting and the sabbah says that the messenger knows the best so the prophet said that if someone speaks about another person behind the back which you would not like that's called as backbiting and the sabbah what if i'm speaking about the person is true the prophet said then it will be called as backbiting if it's false it will be called as slandering so based on this the commentary of this hadith imam he said that backbiting gibath in six conditions it's permitted number one he says that if something is told to a ruler of the land or to a judge complaining against the act of another human being who has done wrong to the person maybe he is stolen some wealth from you taking your property away or at an injustice to you so if you go and complain to a ruler or to a judge against another human being another muslim this is permitted because you want the wrong to be undone so in such cases depart is permitted category number two that if you complain to someone who you feel that person has an influence on the person who has that an evil act or a sin and you feel that he will stop doing that evil act you're permitted for example if you know of a friend who is very close to the person who run evil act or done a sin and if you tell him that your friend that then so and so so it's a thing or drinking alcohol and he feels that he has an influence on the other person and he can prevent him from doing the sin it's permitted to keep up so the question regarding the wife complained to the husband either comes in the first category or the second category either it's an injustice done to the wife or maybe the wife wants to tell the husband that you correct the mother-in-law it may come in first two categories the remaining four categories which imam and now we said give up can be done the third is that if you are approaching a mufti or a religious person for some religious advice so you may say that my father then so and so act or my wife has done so and so act and describe that and ask what should i do even in this case if you avoid naming the father or the mother or say in the third person that my friend's father is doing so and so it is preferable but in such cases while taking religious advice for a fatwa for a particular act it's permissible the fourth category which imam anabi says that gibba is permitted is that when you know of a narrator who is a liar and if he narrates any hadith so it becomes incumbent on you to tell the people that he's a liar or his memory is weak because to protect the sharia or for example if someone is selling a slave and if he knows that there are some bad habits in the slave or maybe he does adultery so it's compulsory that the person who's selling it should tell to the buyer that the slave has so and so false or if a person asks you that he wants to marry another person and ask you how is the person so that becomes obligated on you to tell the wrong points or the points which are not correct in that human being your intention here is not to belittle that human being your intention here is not to degrade the person your intention is to give the right information whether for marriage or for business so in these cases this is the fourth category where imam and novi says that is permitted as far the fifth category is concerned that if you know a person is doing a major sin openly like he's drinking openly or if he's cheating openly or if he's robbing openly so then you can tell the public at large that this person is a person who cheats or a person robs or personal discontinuously buddha or there is a religious person who you know who is going father and you know that he's not a person or truthful so here it's permitted that you can speak against the person and the sixth category is that while identifying a person if someone asked you for identification at that time to identify the person you may have to use his nickname which the person may not like like you may have to tell that the person who shot person who is tall so here you're using these nicknames to identify the person with the person may not like mainly find it here also if you can avoid this nickname find a fiction is the best but if you can't avoid you can do imam under we have mentioned six categories in which gibbat is permitted thank you dr zakir"
