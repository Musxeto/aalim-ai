  "transcript": "when you recite in Arabic and when you also at the same time translate at the back of your mind recite in Arabic at the back of your mind the meaning is being translated no more portion of your mind is occupied less chances it will deviate those who know Arabic as a language besides reciting also concentrate on the meaning it will deviate less now once you start doing this maybe after a few months it becomes mechanical you're reciting in Arabic you know the translation so well you can say it in the middle of your night in the middle of your sleep so what then besides even recollecting the meaning also concentrate on the meaning a human being cannot concentrate on two things together you can concentrate 50/50% for example while driving a car you are concentrating partly and also talking no problem but if you're reading a book you can read a book and even listen to something else but your concentration is divided but if 100% you want to concent on reading the book and the meaning and doing something else no so similarly when you are reading the Salah in your Salah when you're reciting the Quran recollect the meaning concentrate on the meaning the more you concentrate on the meaning less will your mind deviate and less chances this evil thoughts will come less chances you will think of something else but to concentrate if you know the meaning if you don't know the meaning how will you concentrate"
