  "title": "Is Fasting merely Abstaining from Food, Drink and Sexual Intercourse? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "when it comes to the fast is it simply the doing away of food drink and sexual relations or other implications the things which are further purposely fast as you mentioned earlier one of them is to abstain from things that break the fast that is food drink and having sexual relationship but besides this one another important factor is is the intention is the Nia any deed without the near it is useless the near should be there the near the intention is very important because we intend to fast it's act of worship if this intention is not there then there are various different types of fast for example a person with fast for political reason a person may fast as a passive resistance a person may fast as hunger strike I'm starving hunger strike to get whatever he wants you know the people fasting non-muslims fasting a person may fast for health reason maybe for writing he may fast maybe to lose weight he may fast it may be a medical treatment but all these fast they don't have intention the Nia to be the Allah so that's the reason in the Islamic Sharia when we abstain from things that break the fast it should be accompanied by the Niya without the Nia the fast is useless it's very important is compulsory for every act of worship including fasting and I beloved Muslim said it's mentioned in say Muslim volume number two in the book chapter number 370 Hadith number 2198 a beloved Prophet said that when you have intention to approach your wife to a relationship with your wife the moment you have intention even that becomes charity the Sabbath asked having relationship with your wife is also charity the prophet said that if you have sexual relationship with people who are not your wife if it's unlawful isn't it a sin they said yes it is a sin so that is if you have sexual relationship with the person you're supposed to have that as your wife with the Nia that's an act of charity that means Nia is very important the moment you have Nia then you get thumb up for that and Allah says in the Quran in surabayana chapter number 98 verse number five it's mentioned and he commanded that you worship him alone and insincere devotion true in faith here the word used which means to worship but actually abadoo it means to Humble but the word in Arabic is normally used for worship it actually means to Humble the other Arabic word used is which means to serve with piety and with dedication so here we should serve only for Allah and a worship should be to him alone that should be Anya that is the main tension and Allah says in the Quran that we have created for you everything on this Earth when Allah has created everything in this Earth for us not one tenth not one-fifth not one-fourth not half but everything for the human beings in this Earth so but natural our servitude should only be to him and no one else if while worshiping him we worship somebody else then it is useless we have to only worship him and no one else we can't say that I am praying to rakat for Allah for somebody else we can't say I'm sacrificing one good for Allah and the second good for a king or a ruler all our worship should be to him alone and no one else and that reminded me of Hadith the first Hadith in say buhari the um he says your Deeds are based on your intention reaction are judged by intention and anyone who has migrated with the intention for the land is full he has migrated for the universal but if someone has migrated for the wealth in this world or for marriage he has migrated for the wealth and marriage the intention is important why did you do it and why did you migrate why did Jihad so intention is very important for any act of worship including Psalm that is asking"
