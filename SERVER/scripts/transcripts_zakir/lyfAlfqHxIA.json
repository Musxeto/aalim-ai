  "transcript": "previously the human beings we thought that the earth on which we live it is flat it was in fifteen hundred and seventy seven so france is drake when he sailed around the earth he proved that the earth was spherical quran mentions in israel chapter number 31 verse number 29 it is allah who merges the night in today and merges the day in tonight it is who merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night merging is a gradual and slow process the night slowly and gradually merges into the day and the day slowly and gradually merges into the night if the earth was flat there would have been a sudden change it would have been a gradual process of night marching in the day and day emerging to the night allah gives a similar message in surah azumar chapter number 39 verse number 5. it is allah who overlaps the night into the day and overlaps the day unto the night the arabic word used here is kawara which means to overlap a coil so the quran says it is allah subhana wa tala who overlaps or coils the night unto the day and overlaps are coils the day into the night coiling the word kawara is used how you coil a turbine onto your head so this overlapping and coiling of the night and to the day and the day into the night is only possible if the shape of the earth was spherical if it was flat it was not possible and allah further says in surah naziat chapter number 79 verse number 30. we have made the earth as an expanse and we have made the earth shaped and then we made the earth achieved one of the meanings of the ha is an expanse and the other meaning of the arabic word the haha it is derived from the arabic word which means an egg and we know today that the earth on which we live is not completely round like a ball it is geospherical in shape it is flattened from the pole and is bulging from the center and the arabic word doesn't mean a normal egg it specifically means the egg of an ostrich and if we analyze the shape of the egg of an ostrich it too is geospherical in shape imagine the glorious quran mentions 1400 years ago that the shape of the earth is geospherical it does not say spherical only it specifically mentions like the egg of an ostrich"
