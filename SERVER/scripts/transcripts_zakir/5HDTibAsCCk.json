  "transcript": "the next question by abdul razak from ghana reciting in ecuador there aren't many muslims in ecuador here and most of the cities have no muslims at all the animals here are killed in non-islamic ways as a muslim am i permitted to eat the meat depending on my current situation a similar question from imran ashraf who is a pakistani living in the philippines he says in philippines where i stay it is difficult to slaughter an animal and eat it moreover what is available in the market does not have a halal stamp what should i do in such a scenario we need to know that the meat that we eat it should be slaughtered in the zabiha method the zabiha method it is the method of slaughtering wherein we cut the throat the windpipe and the blood vessels of the animal without damaging the spinal cord because if we cut the spinal cord there can be a cardiac arrest which will result in stagnation of the blood and as science tells us that blood is a good medium of bacteria germ and toxin when we slaughter in the islamic method these diseases they are eliminated and the zabiha method the slaughtering should be done with a sharp object or knife and it should be done swiftly the meat that is slaughtered in the islamic method using the zabiha method the meat remains fresh for a longer time and the nerve that is reaching to the brain this nerve it is disconnected when we slaughter through the zabiha method thus causing the animal no pain the animal kicks and withers not due to pain but due to the flow of the blood out of the body so coming back to the question that if zabiha meat is not available so what should you do you should try to find forza bihar mean and you should ask the chef or the person in the restaurant if you are having food and restaurant that is the meat slaughtered in an islamic way if it is not then you should avoid this meal you have various other options for example you can get the chicken at home you can slaughter the chicken at home you can also eat fish you can eat vegetables etc but if the meat is not halal then you should avoid such meat"
