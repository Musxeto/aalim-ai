  "transcript": "the fifth strategy used by the media is that they say things about Islam which are correct but the interpretation is wrong they say Muslims are fundamentalist and because Muslims are fundamentalists today humanity is in problem Muslims are extremist because the extremist humanity is in problem what is the meaning of the word fundamentalist fundamentalist by definition means a person who follows the fundamentals of one particular subject for example if a person wants to be a good mathematician he should know follow and practice the fundamentals of maths unless he's a fundamentalist in the field of maths he cannot be a good mathematician if a person wants to be a good scientist he should know follow and practice the fundamentals of science unless he's a fundamentalist in the field of science he cannot be a good scientist you can't paint all fundamentalist with the same brush that all are good or all are bad depending in which field the person is a fundamentalist you have to him accordingly"
