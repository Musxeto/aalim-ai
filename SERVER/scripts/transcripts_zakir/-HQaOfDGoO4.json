  "transcript": "Dr Zakia I would call upon you to resolve one \nof the most common disputes in the Muslim umah   during the month of Ramadan regarding the number \nof rakat that are prayed in the twi or the or the   night prayer is it eight or should it be 20 our \nbeloved Prophet said it's mentioned inkari number   one in the book of Salah Hadith number 472 he said \nthat when a person asked that how should you offer   the the prophet said that he should offer in two \nraat followed by two raat followed by two raat   followed by two raat and so on and when he feels \nthat Dawn is approaching he should off one ra so   all the raat become with become odd that means \nyou can pray as many as you wish later on have   one number an odd number so that everything \nbecomes odd so as far as far as the number   of rat are concerned you can pray as many as you \nwish but as far as the practice of mm sallam is   concerned that's mentioned inkari volum number two \nin the book of Hadith number 1147 that may Allah   be pleased with her she says that the prophet \nwhile offering in Ramadan used to always offer   11 rat not more than 11 rat and this is to do even \nother months that means eight of and three of so   it becomes 8 plus 3 11 and there are various other \nHadith which always say that all the Hadi that we   find of the Prophet whether s bukari say Muslim \nall of them said that he or 11 11 includes 8+ 3   and further the same ofari volume number two in \nthe book of number 1147 her when she says that the   prophet always offered 11 raat in Ramadan and even \nother times and she said that he used to offer   four raat and I cannot narrate to you the time \nthe Beauty and the length of thisat and it's to   again off of fourat and I cannot relate to you the \nBeauty and the length of the fourat and then you   to offer three indicating eight plus three but if \nyou read the practice of the Sal of a predecessor   of the sahabas the we find from records that they \nprayed 11 raat some prayed 13 some prayed 19 some   prayed 23 some prayed 36 some 39 ra also and if \nyou read the M volume number two page number 165   166 it says that the T when they offered the \nin Ram which is known as they offer 20at some   place it says that they offer 36 rat so as far as \nthe rat are concerned as the prophet the call the   Commandment of the Prophet was that read two ra \nas much as you wish then one and as I mentioned   earlier in s bukari Hadith number 472 volume \nnumber one you can read as many ra as you want   in 222 and then one but if you want to follow the \nSunnah of the prophet the prophet always offered   eight raat plus three so what is permissible as \nmany as you wish 8 10 20 36 no problem and Then   followed by three with but the prophet offered \n8 + 3 11 but you can offer as many as you wish"
