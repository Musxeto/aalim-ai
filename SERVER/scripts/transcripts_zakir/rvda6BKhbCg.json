  "transcript": "good evening Dr Nike my question to you this evening is with all due respect to Islam you said that idol worship is the greatest sin in Islam and Allah does not forgive an idol worshiper for this but what about people who have been born into families of religions other than Islam for example in India most of the population is Hindu and lifelong they may not have had exposure to Islam or somebody else who may have educated them about that what is the fault of those people will they never reach Paradise will Allah never let these people enter Paradise what is their fault if they believe what is being taught to them since the day they were born does Allah not have mercy on them thank you very good question very logical question what about those human beings who are born in non-muslim families and the parents are doing idler worship so who's to blame how can Allah punish them and that's a very good question that's the reason a beloved Prophet Muhammad said that every child is born in the United every child is born as a Muslim irrespective if there is born in a Jewish family or a Christian family or a Hindu family or a Muslim family he is born as a Muslim Muslim as I told earlier by definition means a person who submits civil to almighty God so every child when he's born he submits civil to almighty God later on he is influenced by his Elders by his parents by his teachers then he may start doing idol worship he may start doing fire worship and he may go to the wrong path that's the reason whenever a non-muslim accepts Islam the more appropriate word is revert it's not convert convert means going from one Faith to another Faith reward means a person was on the right Faith went to a wrong faith and came back to the right Faith so the more appropriate word sister is reward now coming to your question how can Allah hold responsible a person if he's born in a non-muslim family that's the reason if a child is born a non-muslim family before he gains maturity if he dies he will go to Jannah inshallah why every child submersible to almighty God he's a Muslim he may have a Hindu name or a Christian name John ramu it doesn't make a difference but as long as he's a child and if he died as a child sister that child will go to Jannah irrespective whether he's born in a Muslim family or non-muslim family later on when a child grows up and he becomes an adult then it is his responsibility what he does that's the reason if a child commits a crime the quote is lenient when he becomes adult then he cannot say that my father taught me to Rob therefore I'm robbing if a child grows up at the age of 22 and if the police catches him after robbing he cannot say that my father taught me to Rob therefore I'm robbing will the judge let him go if he's a child at the age of five that may say fine he's a child he hasn't attained maturity but once he becomes an adult and then if that adult tells the judge that I'm robbing because my father taught me to Rob he will not be excuse everyone responsible for his or her own deed now once a person becomes the adult it's the duty of that adult to find the truth it's the duty of us Muslims to convey the message to the non-muslim but irrespective whether a person gets a message or not if a human being is let free there were two tribes which did not come in contact with modern civilization till as late as 1950. one tribe was the kapoku tribe and the second was asteroid in Aborigines the tribe did not come in contact with modern civilization till as late as 1950 and when researchers went and tried to find out what was the way of life it was nothing but Islam but they didn't call themselves Muslims they believe in one God they believe that God had got no images he had no Idols they prostrated when they worship God it was everything of Islam but a name so if a child is not given any external influence he submits his will to almighty God and remains on that path now once a person becomes an adult it's a duty of us Muslims to convey The Message of Islam if we do not convey Allah will hold us responsible he'll hold us possible but irrespective whether we do the job or not we'll be responsible but Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 41 verse number 53 that soon we shall show them our signs in the furthest region of the horizons and into the soul until it is clear to them that this is the truth Allah has taken upon himself that he will directly convey this message to every human being himself so if a Muslim does his job or not whether there are good examples or bad example Allah will directly put in the heart of every human being whether Muslim or non-muslim about the truth about one God so once the message comes that human being may follow may not follow he may not follow thinking that if I accept Islam I may have to give up the things which I like and have to give up my alcoholism I may have to give up dating and dancing and you know whatever thing which is Haram in Islam he may not accept the message then he is responsible similarly if the father teaches him something wrong to Rob it's his duty to realize that robbing is Haram it's a sin tells the judge that because my father taught therefore I'm robbing similarly here when Allah directly puts the message into the heart of every human being about the about the Oneness of God and The Idler worship is prohibited yet if the individual continues he or she is responsible so on the day of judgment therefore Allah says that no non-muslim will ever object to the justice of Allah because your organs will give witness about you your eyes your hands will speak about you so on the day of judgment even those people will be put in hell they will never object to the Justice Allah what they will say please give us one more chance and Allah will say it's too late there are many channels given in this world but to live only once in this world so on the day of judgment no non-muslim no human being even if he's put in hell will ever object to the justice of Allah he'll only say that please forgive me and it will be too late whatever is there in this world sister thank you"
