  "transcript": "says in the Glorious Quran in Surah Imran chapter number 3 verse number 64 say people of the book come to Common terms as us and you which is the first term Allah that we worship none but Allah that we Associated partners with [Music] him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and P other then if they turn back witness that we are Muslims bowing our will to Allah subhana tala this wasse of the Glorious Quran according to me it is the master key for doing dawa it says see people of the book come to Common terms as between us and you the most important part of dawa is [Music] that we worship but Allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and P other than Allah and if they turn back say that we bear witness so Allah subhah wa ta'ala is telling us a way showing us a way in the Glorious Quran how to do dawa with the Christian come to Common terms I have been asking you when you have to come to Common terms how can you come to Common terms without reading the scriptures so Allah is telling us we should learn about their religion also so that you can convey the message to them talking about comparative study when they showing the ban you have to study the ban and try and prove the the point of Islam to them we just don't have to swallow it hook line and sinker and all these attacks that the Christian missionaries do on the Muslims it is there available on video the answer also their on my website zak.com it shows us a way how to do dawa but most of us Muslims we want to give excuses for not doing the job many Muslims come and tell me you know brother I want to do da but I don't have knowledge our beloved Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam said it's mentioned in volume number four Hadith number 3461 propagate even if it be one verse even if you know one verse of Islam it's your duty to propagate it you don't have to wait till you become like shik Ahmed zad you don't have to wait till to become a big D or a big sh or a knowledgeable person a beloved Prophet said proper gate even if you know one verse about Islam and doing da is easy you don't have to wait till you become like sh at least you know that there is one Allah you know there is one Allah go and tell the people if they tell you how can you prove if you don't know come back and do your homework I've given the talk on concept of

subhana wa ta'ala will keep on giving you more and more knowledge I am a medical doctor I'm not I was inspired by she ahed I heard his speeches on the video and I started talking and Allah kept on giving me more and more you have to get into the field start talking once you start talking Allah subhana tala will keep on supporting you and then inshallah you'll get more knowledge and you'll be able to convey the message better you can't give the excuse that don't have knowledge a prophet said propagate even if you know one verse about Islam then some people will say the Quran says to use your way to me mine so why should you do dawa what they quoting is half the only one verse out of context what they're quoting is Sur kaun chapter number 109 verse number six you have to quote the full Surah full Surah Surah chapter 109 verse number 1 to6 says say to those who reject faith I will not worship that what you worship nor will you worship what I worship I will not worship what you want me to worship nor will you worship what I worship to use your way to me is mine before saying to you is your way and to me is mine you have to deliver the message only after you deliver the message and if they don't accept it then you can say you cannot say that first you're quoting out of context you have to deliver the message explain to them about Islam and then if they don't accept it's not your fault Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 88 verse number 21 and 22 your job is to deliver the message changing hearts in the hands of Allah you have to deliver the message just leave it to Allah"
