  "transcript": "uh the next question is from Hassan pathan from Kashmir sir how can we contribute financially for your organization is it legal to contribute from India a similar question was posed by Mrs Noor from Dubai assalamualaikum kindly help how can I donate to pitch TV I tried doing it from its website but Phil twice the basic question is that how can they contribute to the organization or can contribute to fish TV and one of the way that you can go to our website and wants to go to the website of peachtv the account number is given and you can contribute and I'm aware that when you transfer especially after 9 11 it has become more difficult to contribute to Islamic organizations and specially if it's outside your country it will become more difficult when people try they are not successful and therefore the trying to prevent all the Dao activities you know those who don't want Islam to spread if you can go to the website it's legal to contribute to the organization you can contribute even to pitch TV the thing is there the account is there but those people who really want to help somehow the other they get in touch with me and you know that because of the restrictions that are there and we are the policy we always believe that we follow the rule of the country in India whatever we accepted was officially in our trust account we believe in following the rules and regulation of the country so that we do not break the law of the countries that we can do dhava freely but in spite of this following the rules you know the enemies of Islam after us they're trying to see that the Muslim organizations don't get the funding they're putting pressure on the banks they're putting pressure on the organizations so in this case but natural a businessman who is really rich he knows the situation because he's a rich businessman he's a millionaire or a multi-millionaire he's a billionaire he knows the difficulties because in English so in this case the businessman who really wants to help a guy who really wants to help me they get in touch with me and very easy people know where I am and once they get in touch with me they find out which is a very legal way to contribute without causing problem to contribute good and big amounts and many people call me for lunch and for dinner and for meal and for every meal they give big amounts so those who really want to contribute they come and meet me in Mumbai they have to come to Bombay when I'm in Dubai District Malaysia they come and meet and we see amicable way which is legal without getting into problems and yet they want to hide that entity which is good no problem so what we realized that those really big people who want to support any activity whether it be they whether it be me whether it be peace tea whether it be other because they're in the field they know how to get in touch they get in touch and they support they can get in touch with my friends they're getting in touch with me it's very easy in the age of science and technology today the whole world is a global village but for those people who are not so well versed and maybe an average common Muslim wants to contribute you try it through the website through the official Channel if you cannot my advice to you would be you can always contribute to adava organization in your country if you cannot contribute to pitch TV what do you do you search for the dawa organization in your country in your city Google it do a little bit research and contribute to them you'll get double sour we'll get some of helping them and getting some of helping us also the people who you contribute to they will thank you they will do duas even I will do what the main aim of us is to spread the message of Allah but see to it that the organization is authentic organization is the genuine organization doesn't take time to do research and contribute inshallah I will think the amount has reached me because our main purpose is to spread the message of Islam if you're contributing to another organization indirectly or contributing to us and duplicate the farm hope that's the question"
