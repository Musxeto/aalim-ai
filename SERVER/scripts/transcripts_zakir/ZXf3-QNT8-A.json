  "transcript": "we will take the next question my name is safat hassan and i'm a student from chittagong bangladesh assalamu alaikum may allah bless you what is the meaning of trinity in christianity the word trinity is not in the bible the word trinity it is in the quran allah subhana wa tala says insulin chapter 4 verses 171 don't say trinity this is it is better for you allah subhanahu wa says in the glorious foreign number 5 verse number 73 in trinity and there is no god except for one god the closest verse in the bible to the concept of trinity it is the first episode of john chapter 5 verse 7. it says for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost but these three are not three but they are one but if you read the revised standard version of the bible the rsv that is revised by no less than 32 christian scholars of the highest eminence backed by 50 different cooperating denominations they say that this was of the first episode of john chapter 5 verse 7 it is a concoction it is a fabrication it is an interpolation and they have thrown this verse out of the bible who has done this not muslims not any common christians not any lay man but 32 christian scholars of the highest eminence backed by 50 different corporate and denominations they say that this verse of the bible it is a concoction it is a fabrication and they have thrown it out of the bible so in the rsv you do not find this portion of trinity and allah subhana talah clearly says in the glorious quran in surah chapter 112 verse number 1 say he is allah one and only and jesus christ peace be upon him he never claimed divinity in fact if you read the bible jesus christ peace be upon him said it's mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 28 my father is greater than i gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father's greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 i cast out the earth with the spirit of god gospel of luke chapter number 11 verse number 20. i with the finger of god cast out devil gospel of john chapter number 5 verse number 30 i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will but the will of almighty god anyone who says i seek not my will but the will of almighty god he is a muslim jesus christ peace be upon him was a muslim further it's mentioned the gospel of mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 jesus christ peace be upon him said so the lord our god is one lord so jesus christ peace be upon him he never claimed divinity he was one of the mightiest messengers of god it is clearly mentioned in the bible that jesus christ peace be upon him he is a prophet of god and jesus christ peace be upon him he himself never claimed divinity according to the catechism of the christian church they say that the father is a person the son is a person the holy spirit is a person but there are not three persons but they are one person one plus one plus one it is equal to three it is not equal to one but the christians when they explain the concept of trinity they say that these three they are one even if you have triplets if one of them commits a crime you cannot hold the second one responsible and when you speak to the christians and you ask them regarding the father in heaven they have a particular mental picture of someone who's sitting on one of the planets with earth as his footstool when you speak to the christians regarding the sun they have a specific mental picture someone who's tall and handsome with long hair someone like jeffrey hunter in the movie the king of kings who played the role of jesus christ peace be upon him if you speak to the christians regarding the holy spirit they have a specific mental picture someone who claimed to jesus christ peace be upon him as a dove someone who came as a spirit in the feast of pentecost to jesus christ peace be upon him so they have a specific mental picture but when you talk to the christians regarding trinity and when you ask them how many mental pictures do you have in your mind so they will tell you only one believe me the christian he is lying to you because 1 plus 1 plus 1 is equal to 3 and not 1."
