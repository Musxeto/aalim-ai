  "title": "Edward Asks Dr Zakir, \"Is it Necessary for Me to Change My Religion to Enter Paradise?\"",
  "transcript": "foreign foreign other way foreign Christian he says he has heard many speeches and in all speeches they have been praising their own religions I came here with a doubt that you may be also be of the same mind but it is a surprise to hear that you are stressing on one single God he wants to know if he sticks to his faith namely Christianity will he reach Paradise or not is it necessary that I should change my religion thank you brother asked a good question before answer the question or request if there any other non-muslim like to ask question yet there's enough time half another one I have balance for the question answer time any non-muslims who has questions please queue up your can break the Cure can come in the front of the queue any non-muslim brothers or sisters please come at the microphone it will be my pleasure to reply to yourquarius a good question he said that normally most of the religious speakers when they speak they praise the religion but when he came to hear my speech he was happy that I was stressing on one God rather than praising the religion and he wants to know that can you go to Paradise by following Christianity can he stick to religion and into Paradise whether if you follow Christianity in his pure form if you follow the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him you have to read Jannah because as I mentioned we believe Jesus Christ peace be upon him was one of the mightiest messengers of God we believe that but if you follow the corrupted form today what we believe we believe in the injeel which was revealed to Prophet Jesus peace be upon him but the present Bible that you have is the interpolation is a concoction it's a fabrication so if you say present Bible is the word of God I disagree with it in the Bible you have many contradictions many there are many unscientific things mentioned in the bible which you can't attribute to almighty God there is pornography in the Bible and I'm sorry to say you can't attribute that God so Jesus Christ we believe is the messenger of God so if you follow his teachings yet there are remnants in the Bible even though the Bible has got corrupted has got changed has got altered yet there are remnants there are Parts which speak about toys which are mentioned in my lecture but I also said Jesus Christ peace be upon him prophesies the coming of prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him Prophet Muhammad is prophesied even in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament in the Old Testaments prophesied in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse number 19 it's mentioned in the book of Isaiah chapter number 29 verse number 12 in the Song of Solomon Chapter number five verse number 16. he's even prophesied in the New Testament by Jesus Christ peace be upon him in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 in the Gospel of John chapter number 15 verse number 26 in the Gospel of John chapter 16 verse number seven in the Gospel of John chapter 16 verse number 12 to 14 he says that I have many things to send to you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide one to all truth he shall not speak of himself all that he hears shall he speak he shall glorify me the only messenger after Jesus Christ peace be upon him was praised Jesus peace be upon him as Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so Prophet Jesus said you have to follow him so if you're a true Christian if you truly believe in the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him you have to follow the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him see Jesus Christ peace be upon him the word Christianity doesn't exist in the Bible if you read the full Bible the word Christianity doesn't exist only once the word Christian is mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number 11 at Antioch where people called the nickname the followers of Jesus as Christians Jesus Christ Spirit be upon him never called himself a Christian what he said not my will but the will of my father Gospel of John chapter 5 verse number 30 I kind of my own self do nothing either here I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my view the will of almighty God is a Muslim that's what the Quran says Imran chapter 3 verse 52 that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him submitted revealed to God he was a Muslim so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him submitted evil to God and he said you have to follow the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon so if you're a true Christian you have to believe in one God you have to submit your will to almighty God and believe in Muhammad sallam if you submit a will to God and believe in Prophet Muhammad you will go to Jannah whether you call yourself Muslim or not Muslim means a person who submit civil to God you need not change your name you can keep your name and word no problem you can keep your name Edward and yet go to Jannah but you should submit your will and believe in the last and final messenger brother do you believe there's one God yeah yeah I believe do you believe Jesus Is God no no no very good do you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger yeah he is a messenger so finish yeah then you can easily go to Jannah okay where they want to change your name no problem if you believe there's one God and you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger yeah also have to believe that Jesus is a messenger peace be upon him then in Arabic you are a Muslim foreign can someone Translate for a couple of months he has been thinking of converting himself to be a Muslim but on observation I find that Muslims uh like the people of other Faith they are worshiping Idols or praying at the graveyards so there is one famous Saint who has been buried in Mount Road area and if you go there you will see many people raising their arms and worshiping in that place so when they are doing in this form of worship they are indulging how can I uh change my faith very good brother very good as I told you in the beginning of my speech to understand in religion don't look at the followers so to understand Islam don't look at the Muslims yeah yeah don't look at the Muslims okay you may not know whether they practice the Muslim are not practicing Muslim so don't look at the Muslims if you have to look at any Muslim the best example Muslim is Prophet Mama's peace be upon him okay I do agree with you in Islam we should not worship anyone but Allah so any person whether he calls himself Muslim or non-muslim if he worships anyone besides Allah it is not allowed in Islam when we go to a grave we can pray for the person we can't pray to the person or through the person of beloved Prophet said go to the Grave it will remind you that even you have to die one day so when we go to the Grave we pray for the person who has died we cannot pray to him or through him you can pray for him yes so when a person dies if you die that the Muslim you can pray for him but you cannot pray to him or through him anyone who prays to him or through him it is not allowed in Islam so therefore if you want to know an exemplary Muslim look at the life of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him thank you when you accept Islam follow the Quran nah I do agree with you that when we worship we worship only to almighty God when we prostrate when we prostrate we prostate only to God and no one else is foreign uh he also believes in one God and Muhammad is the last messenger but as you are all believe and in The Vedic they say there's only one God so all the faiths are focusing towards one God I have been having several doubts now after hearing your lectures my doubts have been cleared and only thing I had the route was by remaining in this Faith Christianity will I be able to reach parties or not even this point you have clarified I thank you very much for that so would you like to say the shahada he is following Allah is the one God he has been following this faith for the past so many years but does he believe that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God yes I believe he is the last messenger in Marshall so you believe that would you like to say the Sharda in Arabic yes yes ready yeah I'll say in Arabic and repeat is okay I'm ready is anyone forcing you to accept Islam nothing nothing no mashallah free will yeah okay I'll say an Arabic repeated okay [Music] and the witness that that there is no God there is no God but Allah by the Lord and and that Prophet Muhammad that Prophet Muhammad is is the messenger and servant of Allah in the messenger of from Allah Masha Allah mashallah means praise yeah and may guide you and the best book of guidance is the Quran I would like you to come on the stage and take the translation of the Quran it will be my pleasure this is the best book for guidance and I pray to Allah to Grant to Jannah best of this world and the next World also inshallah and I pray to Allah that we both meet you pray for me also so he brought me the Jannah inshallah thank you for the copy of the Quran you can come on the stage of the Quran [Applause]"
