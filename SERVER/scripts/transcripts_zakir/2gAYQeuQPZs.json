  "title": "How can a Person become Punctual in Offering Salaah? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question is from maida from kashmir india how can one become punctual in offering salah this is a very good question that how can one become punctual and offering salah and according to me each and every muslim should be very punctual and should take care that they offer salah on time all the males all the muslim male should offer five times salah in jamaat in the mosque and see to it that they reach the mosque before akama so that they are in time how can you do it nowadays it's very easy you have several applications of prayers of salah you just go to the app store if you have iphone or go to the google store if you have an android and type prayer or sala and there are hundreds of apps available these apps give you a reminder at the time of salah and depending upon the app you can even change how many minutes before you want the alarm to go on or go off as far i'm concerned i take extra precaution that i should reach the masjid in time not only before kama but few minutes before so that i can even offer the sunnah salah what i do though i've got various apps i prefer keeping alarms and i keep minimum three alarms for every salah based on the aadhaan of every salah the five time salah i put an alarm of five minutes before the aadhaar time where i'm staying in putrajaya in malaysia this is the first allah second alarm is at the time of aadhaan and the third alarm is few minutes late the first alarm is indication for me that whatever work i'm doing i should stop in the next few minutes maximum five minutes so that whatever work i'm doing i should wind it up and i see to it that i never pick up any calls once the first alarm begins to ring i do not take any other work i do not pick up calls this time is now dedicated to see to it that i reach in time for the most important appointment the most important appointment is appointment allah it is salah so the first alarm is indication for me that five minutes are left on i should wind up what am i doing i should not take any other new work the second alarm is on the dot when is the time for other at that time i leave everything and i go and do my wudu i go to the washroom i take about two minutes for that i do my wudu that takes another two minutes then the third alarm rings depending upon how much time i require to reach before the akama before every salah there is either two rakat or for a sunnah before father the two sunnah before zora nasser there is four kasuna mokada and germa before maghrib and isha there are two two rakaat so if there's two rakat i see to it i reach at least three minutes before kama because study two rakaat takes about two to three minutes i know the time i take from my house going by lift to the mask exactly is three minutes i leave my house four or five minutes before because sometimes the lift may take one minute to come up sometime two minutes most of the time the staff see to it that the lift has already arrived for me i reach on time so i leave five minutes plus three minutes before eight minutes before akama my bell rings if i have to offer two raka sunnah that is for the fajr time for the maghrib anisha time for the zoho and assert time i have to pray four rakahs the alarm brings five plus six minutes eleven minutes before adan time or ten minute before that time so that i reach in time for my salah where i am living in putrajaya the akama time is 15 minutes after the assad time in most parts of the world it is 20 minutes so based on that i do my wudu exactly at the time of aadhaar i do my wudu i go to the washroom i prepare myself and if it's four o'clock i have to read immediately after vudu i leave the alarm rings and i leave the house if i have to offer two raka salah that is for father time manisha i may have one or two minutes after doing the wudu when the alarm rings i leave so that i'm in time to be punctual for the salah is very important see to it that before the karma starts you should reach the mosque you have to base the timing depending upon how far is the mosque from your home or from your office place you do the timing set the alarm and believe me you will find a world of a difference you will find the serenity in your life you will find the calmness the peace in your life offering salah in jamaat in the mosque on time and for a practicing muslim his full day revolves around salah times what time it depends upon the salah time what time he meets people depends upon salah time what time he gives appointments everything is related to salah that if i want to meet someone it should not last it's a lot time i'll give him okay come two hours before salah or one half before salah immediately after salah is over and my timetable is everything revolving around salah so salah is the most important deed that allah will ask you the first deed that allah will ask you on the day of judgment is your salah so being on time is very important i have alarm for these five compulsory salah as well as from my tahajjud is the most important along with that is the most important salah after the fat salah that's one of the more then is the torah sunnah before the fajr and many people come and tell me that brothers are here i pray four times four times allah on time but fajr salah i cannot get up what should i do so i ask the person that suppose you have an appointment they say that no we sleep in the night but we don't get up and we can't get up you know so it's not our fault i tell him that if you have an appointment early in the morning maybe one hour before the sun rise and that appointment is very important for your business and in that appointment there are high chances that you will earn a million dollar so will you be able to get up on time for the appointment he'll tell me if it's a million dollar i will not sleep the full night i said why a million dollar i don't mind staying awake the full night so i tell him that our beloved prophet muslim said that the torah sunnah before the fajr salah is more valuable than the earth and the wealth in it the earth and the wealth in it would be trillions and zillions of dollars so for a million dollar you not sleep the full night a prophet said two raka's sunnah before the fajr salah imagine what would be the value of the fajr salah so if you know the real essence of the salah and how valuable it is there is no question that you will not get up the problem is because you don't know the value you are very relaxed imagine if you have to go and meet the prime minister what will you do you will get up early you will reach before time you will be dressed up in the best of loads will you be late for the appointment with the prime minister and answers no allah compared to prime minister prime minister nothing if you have to meet the king what will you do the appointment with allah is the most important appointment of your life how can you be late so if you know that allah is the most powerful is the most wife is the most knowing he is billion trillion countless time better than the king or better than any prime minister of president in the world so if you have this faith if you have this belief inshallah inshallah you will see to it that you pray five times allah on time including a taj of salah and if you're punctual your full life will change it will be disciplined and alhamdulillah you'll find the peace and serenity and sakena in your life"
