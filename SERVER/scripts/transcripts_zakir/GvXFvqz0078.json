  "title": "What is Jinn and how can they affect our Behaviour, and Make us do Evil? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign and how does it affect our human life because recently we have seen the news that two sisters people said they had a gen bad gen in there and they killed their father to ask the question that what are the jinns and can't affect the people and he had a news that the two sisters who had badging in them and they killed their father foreign creatures the Gen normally the Unseen normally in normal circumstances they unseen so these creations have a free will so therefore the Quran was revealed for the complete world including the Jinn and the human being even they have a free will like in the human beings there are people who follow our last Commandments they are the good people these are the ones who are amongst the management that means the Satan category the evil category of two types they are the scene satans the Unseen satans are the jinns so the jinns is a creation which has a free will like human beings that are good and bad similarly in the general so that are good and bad and can they come into human me yes they can come a human being can be possessed by Jinn and for this the two surahs of the Quran the most attend chapter number 113 114 the last two surahs of the Quran the most atten the one I recited these two surahs were revealed as a treatment as a remedy for this so the rajin science hasn't reached that far to completely identify this concept so therefore in science there is no 100 Proof genes are there but neither is the proof that there are no genes there are certain diseases which the psychologists say it is more with the brain with the human body and they cannot categorize in any of the scientific diseases which is known science hasn't reached that far maybe inshallah 20 years later 30 years later 100 years later science will advance and they will agree with the concept of the Quran since the Quran says the rajin we have to believe in it there are good things that are badges Etc but what we have to do is have to have trust and faith and the two surahs which have been revealed in the Quran for the treatment is so regarding the situation of these two sister I don't know whether it existed or not but they have to realize that to say that the Jinn normally always say that people take advantage of the position and they try and make a fast buck so you have people you know you go in every nook and Corner in most of the religion whether it be Hinduism Christianity or Islam you have religious people making a Fastback fast money they do something you know they throw some powder is that whether it be Baba so we have to be careful of that and they take away from last month my advice to anyone who says it's the personal possess show your child or your friend to a normal doctor then you can show to a specialist and find it to a psychiatrist and after there's no cure then you can search and say that it can fall in the category because normally some of the diseases are more of psychological disease which a Layman will say it's the position of gin which may not be that doesn't mean don't exist didn't exist a human being can be possessed and there's a book written the translation of one of the books on jinns and demons that give more details and there are very few people who really know how to treat the Jinn based on Quran and Sunnah and normally the moment the person tries to make a fast money out of it you can end up a shortcut if you ask you for certain gain then chances of him being in that category 99 percent but if initiate doesn't have some mind that doesn't mean that he doesn't find that category he may later on leave the car fine so many times they have habit of making because the small cause they leave aside and then if they give up all the hope and there's no medical treatment for it then you can't think of a possibility that it can be a position of the Gin Etc and then you have to approach a person accuracy is lifestyle lifestyle if his lifetime so now can he teach you and the treatment is but naturally you have to decide versus mentioning that but those who the specialists in that field go to him rather than to any person Dominican Harry hope that answers the question"
