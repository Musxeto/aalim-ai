  "title": "How to give Dawah to an Atheist using the verse (3:64)? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "you've already mentioned the chapter number three verse 64 regarding that being the Key Stone or the Cornerstone for giving da to non-muslims how can we use this verse to give daah to the atheist as the of IM says come to come in terms as between us and you which is the first ter that we worship none but Allah how can we use this master key for atheist if it's the master key it should be applicable to all the non-muslims irrespective whether he believes in a religion believes in a God or not how can you to dawa with this verse to an atheist the first thing I'll do when I meet an atheist is I will congratulate him you may wonder that why am I congratulate an atheist the reason is because most of the human beings they are doing Blind belief they are following their fathers and forefathers blindly he's a Christian father is a Christian he's a Hindu father is a Hindu many Muslims are Muslims because father is Muslim here this atheist is thinking his father may be coming from religious background but he says he does not believe in such a god who's weak who feels hungry who can be killed so he does not believe in God the reason I congratulate The Atheist is because he has said the first part of the Islamic shahada Islamic creeda there's no God the only thing I have to do is but Allah which I shall do inshallah for the other non-muslims I have a double job first I have to prove to them the God they're worshiping is wrong and then I have to prove to them about the con of Allah subhana here half my job is done he already has said there's no Goda so you already said the first part of the Islamic Creed Islamic sha so half my job is done the only thing you have to do is the second half that illah and then after that Muhammad Allah that m is the messenger and I have given the talk on is the Quran God's word and in this lecture I have showed various ways how you could convince to an atheist about the exence of Allah subhana wa tala time will not permit us to go into the details but you can prove to him scientifically I'll just mention a couple of points that if you ask an atheist and show him an equipment which no one in the world has seen and ask him that who is the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of this equipment after thinking he will tell you that the Creator some atheist may say the manufacturer some may say the inventor some may say the maker whatever he says it will be somewhat similar just keep this at the back of your mind then I ask the question when atheist are people who believe in SS Allah subhana tala when I ask the atheist how did our universe come into existence so he will tell me that a couple of decades earlier a few decades earlier there were a couple of scientists who describ how did the universe come into existence and they called it the Big Bang first there was the primary nebulah then there was a secondary separation it gave rise to galaxies which gave rise to Stars Sun and the Earth on which we live when we ask him when did you come to know this he will say 30 years back 40 years back so I will tell him that what you're talking about the big bank is already mentioned in the Quran more than 14400 years ago in Surah Amia chapter number 21 verse number 30 which says do not the unbeliever see that the heavens and the Earth will join together and we clo them aund this for talking about the big bang is already mentioned in the Quran 1400 years ago who could have mentioned this okay maybe it's a FL no problem don't argue ask the next question that what is the shape of the Earth in which we live so he will tell me that it's spherical when did you come to know about this he will tell just yesterday in science 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back he will tell the first person who discovered the world was sperical was the person when he sailed around the Earth in 1579 the Quran mentions 1400 years ago in Sur naat chapter number 79 verse number 30 well the and thereafter we' have made the Earth exg shape that big word d one of it meaning expands the other is an exg shape and we know today that the world is not completely round like a ball it is geosphere in shape it is sun from the pole and the word daha does not refer to a normal egg it refers to the Egg of an ostrich which too is jeans ship imagine the Quran mentions about the geospheres of the earth 1400 years ago when we ask who could have mentioned this atheist will say maybe your Prophet m s wasallam was a very intelligent man don't argue with him ask me the next question the light of the moon is it its own light or reflected light so he will tell me that previously we thought the light of the moon was its own light it is recently we have come to know 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back that the light of the Moon if not its own light it's a reflected light then we can tell him that Quran mentions 1400 years ago in Surah fan chapter number 25 verse number 61 that the light of the Moon is borrowed light is described as n or M it's a reflection of light who could have mentioned this 1400 years ago and so on and so forth you can talk about biology about embryology about genetics about geology about water cycle on and on there are more than a thousand verses of the Quran which speak about science and every time you mention a scientific fact you ask him the question who could have mentioned this 1400 years ago he'll come back to the original answer the Creator the manufacturer the maker the inventor this Creator this manufacturer this inventor we call him as Allah subhana tala through the help of Science and the Glorious Quran we can prove to The Atheist the existence of Allah subh"
