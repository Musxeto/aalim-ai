  "title": "If a Muslim Commits Suicide, will he be in Hell Forever with Never Ending Punishment? â€“ Fariq Naik",
  "transcript": "so let's take the first question assalamu alaikum i am hussain from dhaka bangladesh i am a school student if a muslim commits suicide will he be a dweller of hellfire forever will his punishment never end even if he was a righteous person in this worldly life and performed ibada to allah allah subhanahu wa says in the glorious quran in surah chapter number 4 verse number 29 and kill not yourself so suicide is clearly prohibited in the glorious quran and suicide it is a major sin according to imam zahabi he writes in his book al-khabar the 70 major sins wherein he lists the major sins and he says that suicide it is on number 29 in his list of major sins so suicide it is clearly prohibited in islam and the punishment for the person who commits suicide it is mentioned in the hadees of prophet muhammad peace be upon him wherein he said that if a person kills himself with a piece of iron then on the day of judgment in hellfire he will kill himself again and again in the same manner with the piece of iron if a person drinks poison and kills himself then in the year after in hell fire he will keep drinking this poison and will do it again and again so the punishment for the person who commits suicide is that he will kill himself the same way in hell fire and suicide it is never the solution this life it is a test for the hereafter allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran chapter 67 verse number two allah it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you are good in deeds this life it is a test for the hereafter so even if a person has trials and tribulations he has to bear it with patience and perseverance and if a person commits suicide he is being ungrateful to the decree of allah and one of the pillars of iman as we know it is believing in qatar that is destiny whether it be good or bad so even if their trials even if that regulations a person has to bear it with patience and a believer's situation it is always a win-win situation if good befalls him he is grateful and thankful to allah subhanahu talaha and if there is any test or any tribulation he bears it with patience and he will be rewarded for it so for a believer it's a win-win situation and suicide it is never the solution and as you ask in a question that the person he has committed suicide and if he performs ibadah and if he is a righteous person will he go to paradise a true and a practicing believer a true and a practicing muslim he will never commit suicide because he will never give up on the life on the trials and tribulations in this world he will be patient and he will be content with whatever allah has decreed upon him and allah subhanahu wa allah says in the glorious quran he will not forgive the sin of shirk but he may forgive any other sin if he pleases so if allah subhana tala pleases he may forgive your sins even if it be suicide and he may directly admit you into the gardens of paradise if allah wishes he may punish you in hell fire for some time and later on admit you into the gardens of paradise it is allah's prerogative and prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that anyone who says anyone who believes in the shahada that is rasulullah there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon him as a messenger he will enter paradise and a blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him said in another hadith that anyone who has an atom's weight of iman in his heart he will enter paradise so eventually the believers even if they have an atom's weight of iman in their heart eventually they will enter paradise so we should never despair of the mercy of allah even if we are tested even if we are trial even if there are tribulations in this life our main focus our main goal should be attaining the pleasure of allah should be attaining jannah and if this is our main goal even if we have trials and tribulations in this life we know that it is temporary but the home of the hereafter it is eternal and it is everlasting and the believers they will abide in paradise forever so the life of the hereafter it is eternal and it is everlasting"
