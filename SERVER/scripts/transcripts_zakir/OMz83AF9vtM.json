  "transcript": "a question from a non-muslim friend of mine uh she is asking me like uh within your muslims itself you have confusion like uh when you meet you ask first the question is uh whether you're a wahabi or uh sunni whatever these kind of questions are there's a confusion between you itself what do you want us to follow what is that uh we can exactly come follow and uh this is the question that the non-muslim sister asked there's a confusion among the muslims when you meet your ass you are a wahabi or are you hunter if you are a shaft you are a maliki so there is a confusion amongst the muslims so what is the reply i do agree with the non-muslim sister that unfortunately many muslims call different names but when i tell the hindus to go back to the vedas i tell the muslims to go back to the quran allah says in the quran in finland imran chapter number number 6 verse number 159 that anyone who makes division in the religion of islam or prophet you have nothing to do with him making sex making division in islam is prohibited it is haram but when we ask the muslims what are you some says [Music] what was the prophet what the prophet hanafi was the shafi was the humbly was the malaki what was he he was the muslim allah says in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 52 isa alayhi salaam jesus christ peace be upon you are the muslim allah says in the quran imran chapter 3 verse 67 that abraham peace be upon him you as a muslim allah says in the quran in sura chapter number 41 verse number 33 who is better in speech than one who invited the way of the lord walks righteousness and says that i'm a muslim a beloved prophet muhammad stole us to call ourselves muslim they cannot be a better label than muslim see all these four great imas imam abu hanifah imam shafi imam ahmad number imam malik malala be pleased with them all they were great scholars i love them i respect them all they were great scholars but all these great scholars said all this said that if you find any of my fatwa which goes against allah and his rasool then you throw my father on the wall so here if he analyzed that all these imam that came they came not to make a new sense they came for the people to go back to the original scripture the quran so what we have to realize that i know there are people who say that in their hadith in which the prophet said there will be seven three sects it's hadith number 171 the prophet said there will be 736 prophets you should make prophet knew that even though allah says don't make it bound to me so the best is to go back to allah and his rasool and the best label you can have is call yourself a muslim any scholar let it be anywhere in the world let it be the biggest call of the world you ask him for proof produce your proof if are truthful if your honest produce your proof so any scholar is the difference of opinion you ask him for proof get the proof check it up therefore in my talk i always give references what i say what zakir says is rubbish in islam it is zero nil therefore i say if allah says it carries it if the prophet says it's carried so therefore sisters muslims should not be divided we should call ourselves muslims and follow the quran and the say hadith anyone who divides the religion they are going against the quran"
