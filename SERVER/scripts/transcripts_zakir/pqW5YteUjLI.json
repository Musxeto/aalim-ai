  "transcript": "is Tang Moses an engineering student from K USC I must say thank you very much for the work you are doing and I wish you all the best in your mission please in your lecture you made mention that you believe in Jesus Christ that he was Len born me crossy he gave life to the death and I must say all the religion say man must die once before the said Judgment Day if Jesus gave life to this man was it just to show off because the man is no more living again so why should Jesus give life to the person so that the person will die again meaning the person died twice so was it just to show off or what was it or he still living he didn't die again the brother asked a very good question that we Muslims believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him gave life to the dead so if Jesus Christ peace be upon Him gave life to the dead a person dies only once so did Jesus Christ peace be upon and give life to the dead to show off why did he do it I agree with you a person dies only once Quran says in Imran 3 verse number 185 Every Soul shall have a taste of death and Quran says Jesus Christ peace be upon him said B wake up in the name of Allah and he gave life to the Dead the Bible says that but all the Miracles done by all the prophets of God right from start till Prophet Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam they were done by almighty God they were not done by the prophet himself but they were done by almighty God when Moses peace be upon him when he parted the sea that miracle was done by almighty God to prove to the the followers that he is a messenger of God and you can see this when you read the Bible and when you know once Jesus Christ PE be upon him when a person dies and two sisters go to Jesus Christ PE be upon and tell him that please save my brothers so he prays to almighty God that you listen to me he cries you are the one who can save him let this cup pass away from me he's praying to almighty God that me asking God to give back life to that man Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is praying to almighty God that when the life was given to the dead it was given by almighty God so all the Miracles that were done they were done by almighty God and Prophet Jesus peace be upon him was a messenger so all the Miracles that Jesus Christ peace be upon him did Moses peace be upon dead Prophet Muhammad peace be upon dead these Miracles are signs of almighty God given so that his followers will understand he's a messenger of God and this is mentioned in the Bible in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you witness to it a man it's mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 e men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him and you are witness to it that means all these Miracles God did just to prove that he was a messenger of God that doesn't make that person God that doesn't make that person Superior so all the Miracles that were done by Messengers were done by almighty God as a sign to show that he is a messenger of God hope that answerers the question brother meaning the person died twice that person died twice Miracle means exception to the rule and Jesus Jesus asked God for something in the Bible which God didn't also do sorry the night before Jesus was crucified in the Bible Jesus went into the garden and prayed so that God could have changed things you could see the Bible says that he sweat even on the cross you could see that it wasn't willing thing but Jesus God didn't do that for Jesus at that time so I don't see it like Jesus will say oh come out of death then God did it there but Jesus went into the garden pray God didn't do pre is not a consistent thing in Jesus life because not all the things in his life he was able to do in his life that's I mean he asked God in the garden the day before he was crucified for things to change but nothing happened he fulfilled the thing what God Said first I'll answer your first question then I come to your second your first question is did the man died twice yes the Miracles are things which are outside the natural thing when Moses peace be upon Him parted the sea for the SE to part is not natural it becomes a miracle correct so similarly when Jesus gave life to the dead a human being dies only once when Jesus gave life to the dead he comes back to life miracle done by almighty God for example a human being is born from a father and mother right yes sir but Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born miraculously without male intervention it's a miracle from God that does not make Jesus God some Christian say no no no see Jesus Christ peace be upon him at no father so he God so the reply to that is given in Surah Imran chter 3 verse number 59 the similitude of Jesus in front of Allah is like Adam peace be upon him he was created from dust and said be and it was if you say that Jesus is God because he had no father then Adam peace be upon Him is a greater God he had no mother and no father please excuse me I'm not a Christian but I am saying I not answered your question if you ask a question you should wait for the reply when you ask a question you wait for the reply after I finish the reply then you can talk correct you have to follow rules and regulations okay sorry so when Jesus Christ peace be upon him with the will of God gave life to the dead it was a miracle that person will die twice coming to Prophet Jesus peace be upon him you rightly said in the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him before he was put on the cross he sweats and he prays to God let this cup pass away from me correct he prays what happens God Saves him God Saves him when he can give life to the dead to a common man and when he cries to God can't God save him God Sav him that's the reason he doesn't die on the cross according to the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him did not die on the cross and I will prove it to you if you read the gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 people come and ask Jesus Christ peace be upon him that please show us signs and miracles so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says the son of J Will brother will you listen to me do you understand English asking a question I'm giving the reply again you're coming in between please please I was just trying to say I've looked at your was Christ really but if you knew you wouldn't have asked this question no but you didn't get my question rather let me finish the answer if you have heard my question you would have become a Muslim by now if you would have heard all my lectures by now you have been giving the shahada I respect your speeches a lot I respect your lectures I respect your lectures and I like it I'll come to it later on my respects I'll come to it later on first I'll give the reply if Jesus Christ peace be upon Him cried to almighty God one day before he was put on the cross what did God do God saved him Gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 to 40 when people say show as a sign Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says ye evil and adulterous generation seeketh the after a sign no sign shall be given to you but the sign of Jo J for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth now every Christian knows what is the sign of Jonah you go to Book of Jonah one and half sides you know that almighty God asked prophet Jonah to go to Jah and deliver the message but prophet Jonah thinks that the people of Joba will not listen to the message he goes to neva now when he's going to neva by the ship a storm comes at Sea and it was the Superstition of that time that if a storm comes it's because someone had disobeyed the master so they normally draw Lots who's the one who disobey the master so Jonah being a prophet of God he volunteers that I'm the one who disobey the master so because he volunteers they don't have to break his arm or leg or tie his leg he volunteers so they throw him overboard now when they throw Jonah over board was he dead or alive he was alive according to the Bible I'm asking you according to Bible and to your knowledge in a storm when a human being is thrown into a sea normal human being when he's thrown into the raging storm in the sea he ought to die as far as Jonah is concerned Jonah was dead or alive dead or alive when he was thrown into the sea in the storm dead or alive he was alive according to the Bible Alive according to the Bible very good a fish come then gobbles him up if a fish eats up of gobbles a man he ought to die was Jonah our life alive stilling to the Bible Miracle of a miracle of a miracle he was thrown he was alive in the raging Storm he ought to die does not die alive a fish come then gobbles them up he ought to die does not die alive a miracle of a miracle three days and three nights the fish takes him around the sea out of Suffocation a man ought to die was Jon alive alive according to according to the Bible not according to Dr Zak Miracle of a miracle of a miracle from the belly of the fish prophet Jonah prays to almighty God while he was praying was he dead or alive alive according to the Bible Alive according to the Bible a miracle of a miracle of a miracle of a miracle after 3 days the fish vits him out on the shore dead or alive alive according to the Bible according to the Bible so according to the Bible it's a miracle of a miracle of a miracle of a miracle Jesus Christ peace be upon him said no sign shall be given to you but the sign of Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so if you read the Bible if you understand the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him was put on the cross on Friday it was known that the Jews don't crucify on a Sabbath day on Saturday so before it become Sunset they were in a hurry to get him down now when they get him down they put him in the sear in the sear according to the Bible was Jesus dead or alive he was alive was Jesus Christ peace be upon him dead or alive in where on the cross or in the Tomb in the Tomb in the Tomb they say he resurrected according to the Bible brother I'm asking you a question when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was put in the sear I'm asking the question was Jesus Christ peace be upon Him according to the Bible dead or life they say he died on the cross and he resurrected I'm asking you in the I'm asking you what your name you you said I stay in Ghana I'm asking your name you're saying I live in Ghana brother do you understand English I'm asking a simple question in English in the Saar in the Tomb Jesus Christ peace be upon him was dead orive outside I'm not bothered in the tomb was he dead or alive I'm not a Christian I don't know so brother what are you I don't know unless you tell me if you're not a Christian what are you I'm not religious I'm I'm still looking for religion oh you're looking for religion con so do you believe in the Bible to be the word of God if you don't believe then why should I quote the Bible I don't believe if you don't believe Bible to be the word of God I'll quote to you Quran which is the word of God even I don't believe Bible is a word of God to me also if you don't believe Bible is a word of God even I don't believe Bible is the word of God there are in the Bible some portions which can be the word of God there are words of prophets there are words of historians there are contradictions there is pornography but let me complete my answer and you right according to the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was alive so that's the reason when you're asking me from the Bible that before you put on the cross he prais to almighty God so God Saves him because he prais to almighty God he does not die on the cross he's brought down Al life and in the T the life he fulfills the prophecy of the sign of Jonah that's the reason Jesus Christ peace be upon Him wasn't crucified he did not die on the cross he was saved and almighty God raised him up alive brother do you believe do you believe there is one God I believe mashallah I believe do you believe that Jesus is God I don't believe because in my African spirituality I believe in God but the concept of God that is brought to me is what I don't believe very good even I do not believe Jesus is god brother one more question third question do you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God yeah historically I know Prophet Muhammad existed no do you believe that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God I know he's a messenger of God mashallah so if you believe God is one and if you believe Muhammad is the messenger of God that means you're a Muslim no but you see musl prees about peace no the minimum two criteria Dr Nik the minimum two criteria required for any human mean to be a Muslim is he has to believe that almighty God is one and there is no one worthy of worship except almighty God which you believe and the second is that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of that God yeah so if you believe in these two things you become a minimum level of Muslim you can become more and more practicing later on for example if you're on admission if you take admission into a school suppose the school is St Peter School the school I studied from you become a St Peter IDE that means you become a student of that school now whether you're in first standard second standard third standard 10th standard that is later so if you take admission you are a student of that school so for anyone to be a Muslim minimum two things that he should do is he should agree God is one and no one deserves worship except almighty God and second is you should believe that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger if you believe in these two things then you become a minimum level of Muslim then you can get more knowledge you can keep on becoming better and better and better you can go first and second standard third standard 10th standard Bachelor Master's PhD that's later so according to me you are a Muslim brother would you like to say it in Arabic I'm an African conscious being on Earth sorry I'm a conscious being on Earth you're conscious of a natural being a natural human being on it yes you are a human being that believes almighty God is one yeah believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of almighty God so according to me you are a muslim okay that's from your view that's no that is the view yes of course my view only yeah and even from your view because you believe he's God Muslim means a person who submits his will to God what is the meaning of Muslim I told in my talk anyone who submits his will to almighty God and acquires Peace by submitting his will to God he's a Muslim so you have submitted your will to God you believe there is one God correct I believe and you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger yeah I believe he that means you're a minimum Muslim you can be more practicing by following better better things other things about almighty God but the minimum thing that you should follow of almighty God is believe is one and believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger I believe you have just entered the fold of Islam I'm asking you the question you said in English yeah that there is no one worthy of worship except almighty God and you told that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God yeah I'm asking you would you like to say it in Arabic to to say same thing what you said in English would you like to say it in Arabic I can't speak Arabic no I will help you because that is the language of the last and final Revelation I would like to speak you like to say it I would like to say it okay is anyone forcing you no no no you're doing out of your own free will something I believe if I you're doing out of your own free will yeah something you believe Muhammad is the messenger peace be upon him don't I believe he existed and he no one is giving you money no no okay I said in Arabic and you repeat it okay Ashu Allah Allah [Applause] ill for I bear witness I bear witness that that there is none worthy of worship there's n worthy of worship except Allah except Allah and and I bear witness I bear witness that that Prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is the messenger is the messenger and servant of Allah and servant of Allah Mah you are a Muslim may Allah subhana wa ta'ala give you good in this world and the yearafter I pray to almighty God see once you accept it and become a Muslim all your previous sins have been forgiven I pray to Allah subhana wa tala to Grant you good in this world and the and I want you to read more and more so that you understand this religion better yeah I read a lot I read a lot and I want you to see more of my DVDs I'll ask some of the volunteers to give you books I've got three books here in Kumasi I would ask the volunteer brother Abdul aiz to give this brother three of my booklets and I would also like to present to you a copy of the Quran can some volunteer get me a copy of the Quran here please can some volunteer get me a translation of the Quran please please keep some copies of the translation of the Quran on my table yes brother can you come and take the translation please [Applause] the brother said that may Allah bless you and I want to thank you brother for saying that
