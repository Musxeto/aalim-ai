  "transcript": "next question is from a person who usually works and or he stays usually stays in saudi arabia and the last ramadan he started his fast in saudi arabia and saudi arabia has a difference of two days or it did last year anyway from india which is his hometown so he came to his hometown and by the time he'd reached he'd already fasted two days in saudi arabia he wants to know does he have to finish 30 days and then be left with two days in his hometown which other people around him are still fasting should he consider this to be the point of reference or saudi arabia to be the point of reference i think is the question around the hadith it's mentioned in say hadith of trimethy in the book of fasting hadith number 697 the prophet said start your fast with the people who are starting the fast means you live in a country or live in a place if those people are fasting you should fast and break your fast with the people around you when they break the fast so if we live in saudi arabia he should start as fast with the people of saudi arabia if in between in ramadan if he goes back to the original home in india then he should fast till the time his people are fasting and i'm aware that many a time there's a difference of a couple of days so if he starts his first two days earlier and he goes to india by the time he finishes his 31st the people of india may yet have one or two fast left but yet he has to continue fasting till the people of india even though it exceeds more than 30 days it may be 31 sometimes high two days but hadith says that fast with the people who are fasting around you and break the fast with the people who are breaking the fast surrounding but if it is a vice versa if we start the first in india two days late and then comes to saudi arabia then maybe he'll fast 28 days so in this case he has to start with the people of india and with the people of saudi arabia and he cannot fast on the eu today because it is haram but after that he has to at least fast one more day because in any lunar month it's 29 days so he should at least fast additional one or two days to make up for 29 or 30 days so that it doesn't mean that he has fasted less than the minimum requirement"
