  "title": "Dealing in Riba (Usury/Interest) is a Major Sin in Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "one of the major sins and unfortunately nowadays many muslims consider riba to be completely lawful in this modern world that we live in what's your advice according to quran sun i do agree that there are many muslims who consider rebar not to be interest and they think it's lawful but riba means anything over and above it includes usury that's exorbitant interest but it even includes interest because by definition interest is money earned on money lent and user is exorbitant in interest so whether small or big reba is haram it includes interest as well as usury and allah subhanahu wata'ala has used the word riba in the quran no less than eight times it's mentioned in surah al-imran chapter number three verse number 130 surah nisa chapter number four verse number 161 in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 275 it has been used twice it's even mentioned in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 276 chapter 2 verse 278 and 279 where allah says in these two verses that give up your demands of ribba of interest of usury and those who do not give up the demands of riba take notice of a war from allah and his rasool that means if you indulge in riba allah and rather soul will wage a war against you there are other major sins like having intoxicants having alcohol drugs etc but this besides being a major sin the ruling is that allah and his rasool will wage a war against you it is the only verse in the quran for the only major sin where allah and this will be the war against you it is rabbah so it's one of the biggest major sins that's the reason it has been rated in the category number 12 in al-qabar by imam dhabi mentioned number 12 and as far as the punishment is concerned it's mentioned say muslim volume number three hadith number 3881 the beloved prophet muslim he cursed those people who accept rabbah and who give rabbi those who take interest and give interest those who record it as well as the two witnesses all of them are the same the prophet says that all these people are cursed the person who gives it about the person takes their by the person who records the person who's a witness all of them are cursed and all of the same level it's further mentioned in muslim hadith number 2259 the beloved part of muslim said that there are 73 different types of rabbah different degrees of rabbi and the lowest one is equivalent to a man doing zanavaji's mother with the lowest level of riba or the 73 level is equivalent to a man doing zuna with his mother and this is a say hadith and it's mentioned in muslim ahmed volume number five page number two to five also in same hadith repeated say al-jamiyah hadith number 3375 the beloved partner of salazar said that anyone who takes rabbi equal to one dirham it's worse than a man committing zina 36 times if you take one dirham of rabbah it's worse than a man committing zina 36 times this is the punishment and enormity of sin in islam and we see today that most of the western countries they are drowned in tribal everything is in interest you take a loan your interest you can take a house on interest you can take a car on interest the credit card so everyone and in this scenario it makes a poor man more poor it can make many rich men go bankrupt otherwise the other people are rich men become more rich and there are various evils and i've given the talk on this topic interest-free economy promulgated by the glorious quran that have proved all the evils of rabbi and we see that today a man will make more profit if he has the concept of islamic business prophet law sharing rather than based on interest that's the reason most of the top companies they're zero debt companies they don't take loan from the bank they prefer opening issues and having shares and sharing the profit with the public that there's some concept and all the top companies they are debt-free companies you'll find that they don't take any loan so they are working actually on the islamic concepts"
