  "transcript": "when you are speaking with non-muslims the best is let us come to Common terms with the other people and amongst all the terms the most important point is that we worship none but one Allah in order to understand the concept of God in any religion the best is to try and understand what the scriptures of of that religion has to speak about God if you understand the concept of God by observing what the followers of religion are doing it is not appropriate because many of times the followers themselves do not know what is mentioned in the authentic scriptures of this religion so the best and the most appropriate method of understanding the concept of God in any religion is to try and understand what the authentic scriptures of that religion have to speak about God"
