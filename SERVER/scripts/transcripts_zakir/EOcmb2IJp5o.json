  "title": "Where does Islam Part with Christianity? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the brother as a question that even in Christianity like Islam God is one and God loves the creation and what is the difference between Islamic form of worship as compared to other form of worship what is so unique when Christianity also says God is one Christianity says that God also loves Islam says God is one Islam says God also loves the creation Islam says worship Christianity says worship what is the difference between the worship of Islam and Christianity or what is the uniqueness about Islam as compared to other religions mainly talking about Christianity brother on the face of it if you read the Quran correctly and the interpretation I gave in my talk and if you read the Bible correctly with the correct interpretation we believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was one of the mightiest messengers of Allah subhana tala no muslim as a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was born miraculously without any male intervention we believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers is God's permission we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission but there are parting of fa there are many Christians who say that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he claimed Divinity now the difference between what the Bible says and the difference between what the Christians assume and what they practice the difference between that so many Christians say that Jesus Christ PE be he claim Divinity so when they say God is one they say Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is God which we Muslims take objection to there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or where he says worship me so the form of worship for the normal Christian is worshiping Jesus Christ peace be upon him and I repeat my statement there is not a single qu statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he says worship me if any Christian can show me any unequivocal statement in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says I am God or where he says worship me I Dr Zakir n i ready to accept Christianity today I'm ready to put my head on the guillotine I don't speak on behalf of my other Muslim brothers because if you read the Bible it is mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon us said that my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I with the spirit of God cast out devil Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number 5 verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God he's a Muslim therefore I said in my talk that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was a Muslim Quran says that in Surah Al Imran 3:52 it's further mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number three this is life eternal so that you may know Jesus Christ whom thou has sent it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 24 the words you hear are not mine but my fathers who have sent me it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 e men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles which God did by him and you witness to it a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles which God did by him and you witness to it so Jesus Christ peace be upon him was one of the mightiest messengers of God but he never claimed Divinity he never said you should worship me but unfortunately the Christian church today they teach that salvation Bible also talks about heaven talks about hell but the purpose of existence is not mentioned in detail it's not mentioned at all except what Paul has mentioned Paul mentioned in Corinthians chapter number 15 he says in the First Corinthians chapter number 15 that if Jesus Christ peace be upon Him died not for your sins your faith is in vain and everything is in vain that means Jesus Christ peace be upon him he died for your sins according to Paul and the quote the verse of the Bible Gospel of John chapter number 3 verse number 16 that for God so of the the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not die but have everlasting life so the concept of salvation according to the church is that you believe Jesus Christ peace be up and died for your sins and you shall go to Jenna you shall go to paradise which is not mentioned because the word begotten from Gospel of John chapter number 3 verse number 16 has been thrown out by tidu scholar of the highest Eminence from the RSV Revis stand version of the Bible as a concoction as a fabrication as an interpolation so what they're following is more po in Christianity but Jesus Christ peace be upon him said when a person approaches him in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 19 verse number 16 and 17 that good Master what good things shall I do so that I shall gain eternal life what good things shall I do so that I shall go to Jenna Paradise so Jesus Christ peace be upon replies why thou callest me good there is none good except one that is almighty God and if thou want to enter eternal life you follow the Commandments he didn't say that if you want to go to Jenna want to go to paradise you believe that died for your sins he never said that he said follow the Commandments and Jesus Christ PE be him said it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17- 20 that think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets I have come not to destroy but to fulfill unless the heavens and the Earth pass away not one J or TT shall be passed away from the law until all be fulfilled and whosoever shall keep the Commandments and teach men to do so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall break one of the least Commandments will be call Le in the Kingdom of Heaven unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scries and the Pharisees in no way shall you enter into Paradise is if you want to be a good Christian you have to follow all the Commandments there's only one God you should not do idol worship all what Moses peace be upon him said so here we analyze if we do a research of the biblical scriptures it is actually believing in one God not Trinity Allah says in the Quran in 4: 171 don't say trinity stop it's better for you so if you say God is three one it is sh you won't get salvation there's no statement at all about Trinity the word Trinity does not exist anywhere in the Bible but is there in the Quran besides 4: 171 it's also there in MA number 5 verse number 73 it says they are doing they are blaspheming those who say that God is three in one the word Trinity doesn't exist anywhere in the Bible the closest statement is the first Epistle of John chapter number 5 verse number 7 which says for there are three that bear aord in heaven the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and this verse of the Bible by tidu Scholars of the highest T Christian scholars in the revised Standard Version of the Bible they've thrown this verse out of the Bible as an interpolation as a fabrication as a concoction so the verse which come closest to the Trinity doesn't mention Trinity but comes closest is thrown out by the scholars of Christianity as a fabrication so if we analyze if you want to check what is right in the Bible here is the fan this is the criteria it will tell you what is right what is is wrong and if you compare with this and even today if you read the Bible the Bible never claims that Jesus is God peace be upon him it says you should worship only one God and when Jesus Christ peace be upon us asked that which is the first of The Commandments it's mentioned in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 says it's a Hebrew quation which means is the Lord our God is one Lord so the problem is that if you read the Bible the exact purpose of creation is not mentioned it is vague the Christian church has taken up a teaching of Paul St Paul and says that you believe Jesus Christ peace but died for your sins and you will go to heaven then you do anything you rob you rape you do anything if he's paid for our sins if Jesus Christ peace be upon paid for our sins I Can Do Anything For example someone tells me for restaurant go to the restaurant eat what you want I've paid your bill I can eat anything chicken mutton Biryani anything I can eat so if Jesus Christ peace be upon him I died for my sins then you can commit any sin and you go to heaven only have to believe that he died for your sins so this is a concept of the church which is not what the Bible mentions and you can refer to my video cassette similarities between Islam and Christianity which gives the similarities that's the reason I say that Jesus Christ taught nothing but Islam that is submitting a will to almighty God"
