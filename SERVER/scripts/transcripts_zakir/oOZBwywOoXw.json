  "transcript": "if a person in the situation where one feels compuls or forced into breaking the fast or when one breaks it out of ignorance of a ruling is it permissible that this person should be breaking their fast in such conditions as a rule whether the fast breaks or not or is it permissible if someone is forced to break it out of ignorance out of mistake Allah says in the Quran in chapter number 16 verse number 106 that after you have believed and then if you go to unbelief unless it is out of compulsion that means even if you do sh out of compulsion as long as in your heart there is tawa fear of Allah then it's permissible so if someone forces you something thing which is not allowed and it breaks the fast then you're responsible for that as far as the general ruling is concerned our beloved Prophet mam Salli wasallam he said it's mentioned Inn maah volume number three Hadith number 2043 as well as 2045 he said that Allah subhana taala has excused my um from mistakes from forgetfulness and from that which is forced on them so besides Force even if it's a mistake or if it is due to forgetfulness Allah excuses that and that's mentioned in the Quran in Surah aab chapter number 33 verse number 5 that if you do it out of mistake and don't intend doing it then Allah will forgive you and Allah also mentioned in Sur Bak chapter number two verse number 286 where we pray to Allah subhana tala our Lord please do not hold us responsible for our mistakes and forgetfulness so basically the things that break the fast whether it be eating drinking intercourse Etc all this there are four criteria to be looked into if it's done by force under compulsion then you're not responsible if someone forces something on you you're un responsible Allah hold you responsible number two if it is done out of mistake for example a person he hasur and he thinks yet Dawn hasn't come and he continues eating it's a mistake when realize he stops eaing so that's a mistake which Allah will forgive or someone does something out of forgetfulness like a person eats or drinks water while fasting unintentionally or of forgetfulness then Allah forgives you and the fast is that valid and the fourth thing is that if he does out of ignorance because he was not aware of it for example if a person doesn't know that vomiting deliberately vomiting intentionally breaks the fast and because he has uneasiness and he puts a finger in his throat and vomits out then it is out of ignorance of the ruling even that Allah will forgive inshallah so these four categories because Allah subhana tala does not want to overburden us and a prophet said that if these are the case out of ignorance out of mistake or forgetfulness if someone compulsion all these inshallah Allah will forgive you and that the mercy of Allah subhana"
