  "transcript": "please I'm call masin a student at Sunan po Technic please I would like to know why Muslim ladies always cover their hair and then the second question is why they clean their private path after they or after they urinate if I heard your question correctly sister you said why do Muslim women cover the head correct that's your question yes please and why do they wash their private part after the unit yes always I will first answer your second question then come to the first question as far as washing the private part when they go for un that's done by Muslim men as well as Muslim women both because we are hygienic because when we go for the call of nature we put water on it so that there are no droplets remaining I as a medical doctor you ask any medical doctor they will tell you that what the body does not require it comes out as an excretor or in urine and these are very harmful for the body so when you urinate when you urinate there are certain drops remaining when you wash when you put water these droplets go away so it becomes more hygienic and there are less chances of having itchiness and certain diseases in that part so it is for hygiene and for medical reason and sister regarding a first question why do Muslim women cover the head why do Muslim women cover the head the reply is hijab has been prescribed in the Quran but before the hijab for the woman Allah talks about hijab for the men Allah says in the Quran in Surah n chapter number 24 verse number 30 say the believing man that he should lower his Gaz and guard his modesty the moment a man looks at a woman if any brathen thought any unim thought comes he should lower his gaze the next verse speaks about the hijab for the woman Surah chapter number 24 verse number 31 say to the believing woman that she should lower her Gaz and guard her modesty and display not a beauty except what appears of and draw her whale a head covering over a bosom over a chest and display not of beauty except in front of her husband her sons her fathers and a big list of maram the close relatives who she can't marry is given there are basically six criteria for hijab the first is the extent which differs between the man and the woman for the man it's from the nav to the knee for the woman the complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and the hands up perished some Scholars say that even the face should be covered but normally for a woman a complete body should be covered including the head and the hair except the face and hands up the rest the remaining five criteria are the same for the man and the woman the second is the clothes they wear it should not be tight so that it reveals the figure third it should not be transparent or translucent so that you can see through fourth it should not be so so that it attracts the opposite sex fifth it should not resemble that of the opposite sex and sixth it should not resemble that of the unbelievers the reason why hijab has been prescribed is given in the Quran in Surah aab chter 33 verse number 59 where Allah says oh Prophet tell your wives and your daughters and the believing women that when they go abroad they should put on the cloak the Overcoat so that they shall be recognized and it will prevent them from being molested so Islam prescribes the women to cover the head and put on the overclo so that they shall be recognized and will prevent them from being molested I'd like to ask a question if there are two twin sisters two twin sisters who are very beautiful equally beautiful if they are walking down the streets of Kumasi in Ghana and one twin sister she's wearing the Islamic clothes complete body covered only part that is seen is the face and the hands up to the wrist the other twin sister she's wearing the western clothes you know mini skirt and shorts wearing a very low deep neck revealing more of the body then concealing and if both these student sisters are walking down the streets of Kumasi and around the corner there is a holigan there is a rafan who's waiting for a catch who's waiting to tease a girl I'm asking you the question sister will he tease the girl where in the Islamic hijab or will it teach the girl wearing the western clothes please I prefer the lady in the Islamic hijab which girl will he tease will he tease the girl wearing the Islamic hijab or tease the girl wearing the western clothes please I prefer the lady wearing the Islamic hijab he will tease the girl wearing the Islamic hijab why yes please VI but is decent I can't hear you is decent it is decent yes please I didn't get a question well no my question was if there are two twin sisters who are equally beautiful very beautiful walking down the streets of Kumasi one is wearing the Islamic clothes completely covered one twin sister except the face is seen and the hands up to the wrist is seen the other twin sister she's wearing the western clothes many skirts and shorts a top with a deep neck low neck her body is revealed more than concealed she's exposing more of her body than concealing and if both the twin sisters are equally beautiful of walk down the streets of Kumasi and if round the corner there is a holigan there is a rafian who's waiting for a catch who's waiting to tease a girl I'm asking you the question which girl will he tease will he tease the twin sister who's wearing the Islamic hijab or will he tease the twin sister who's wearing the western clothes which girl will he tease the one in the hijab he will tease the girl wearing the hijab why sister can you give me one good reason can can you give me one good reason why will that man tease the girl wearing the Islamic hijab only one reason I want I will attack the one in the naked dress one in the please they te the one in the nak the short dress ah correct it's a simple question simple answer he will tease the girl wearing the shorts the naked dress because if you invite and people will come that's the reason not only in the Quran not only in Islam even in Christianity it is mentioned sister are you a Christian yes please if you read the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 22 verse number five it says the woman shall not wear clothes that which perate to a man and a man will not very close that which perate to a woman all those who do abomination of the law it's mentioned in the first Timothy chapter number two verse number nine the woman should be dressed up with modesty with shamefacedness and sobriety they should not wear broaded hair or gold or Pearl or costly array it's mentioned in First Corinthians chapter number 11 verse number five and six that the woman that prophesize it and pray with a head uncovered a head should be shaved off the Bible says in 1 Corinthian chapter number 11 verse number 5-6 the woman that prays with a head uncovered a head should be shaved off Bible is more strict even than the Quran nowhere does the Quran say nowhere does the Hadith of prophet say that if a woman does not cover a head head should be shaved off the Bible is more strict have you seen the photograph of mother Mary have you seen the photograph of mother Mary yes please is a head covered or not covered why for modesty when you go to church when you see the nuns the nuns cover the head or not yes or no they do cover their head they cover why because Bible says that so what Quran says the same thing is mentioned in the Bible for modesty you have to wear the hijab if you don't wear the hijab there are chances that you shall be molested there are chances you shall be raped in Islam If any man after these rules and regulation has been done rapes a woman he gets capital punishment death penalty many people said death penalty is a barbaric law is a ruthless way of life do you know in America the maximum number of rapes that take place in any country in the world it's in America according to the 2008 statistics of the national survey of the crime victimization 23,80807 20 cases of rape took place every 25 second one rape is taking place in America you know I'm giving this talk since the past two hours already more than 200 rapes may have taken place since the time I'm giving a talk here I'm asking you the question if you implement the Islamic Sharia in USA that every man when he looks at a woman he should lower his gaze if any anashim thought comes after that the woman should wear the Islamic hijab the complete body covered the only part that is seen is the face and hand the after that if any man rapes a woman capital punishment death penalty I'm asking you the question will the rate of rape in USA will it increase will it remain the same or will it decrease please it will decrease it will decrease it's a practical law you implement the Shar and you get results that's the reason Islam is a religion which shows you a way how people will respect the woman in the Western World they talk about women's right but what are they doing they're selling their daughters they're selling their mothers they're selling their sisters know the Western Society talking about women's liberalization is nothing but a disguise form of exploitation of her body degradation of her honor and deprivation of her soul the Western Society claiming to uplift the woman have degraded her to a status of concubine to that of a mistress and Society butterflies which are mere tools in the hands of Pleasure Seekers and sex marketers which are hidden behind the colorful screen of art and culture what is the Western world doing they're selling the daughters in name of women liberalization what are they doing in most of the advertisement you'll find a woman how many women ride motorcycle but you'll find a woman in the motorcycle ad I was told about a very famous ad of BMW you know BMW it's a very famous car it's a very fast car someone told me in one of the ads there is a young girl standing in front of the BMW car in a bik and the ad reads test drive her now now who the girl of the car test driver now who the girl of the car what is the Western world doing they're selling the daughters they're selling their mothers they're selling their sisters in Islam we respect our mothers we respect our daughters we respect our wives Islam has spoken about hijab to uplift the woman to give her more status hope you agree with this that if the woman is covered she is more modest and she gets more respect do you agree with this sister yes please I do sister do you believe there is one God yes please do you believe that Jesus Christ is God do you believe Jesus Christ is God yes I do you believe yes please sister if you read the Bible there there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or he says worship me if any Christian including you can point out a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says I am God or where he says worship me I Dr zakin Nik am ready to accept Christianity now I'm not speaking on behalf of my other Muslim brothers and sisters I'm ready to put my head on the guillotine in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I will the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number number five verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God is a Muslim Jesus Christ peace be upon a Muslim he never claimed Divinity it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 e men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God not God a man approved of God amongst You by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him and you are witness to it a man approved of God amongst You by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by and you witnessed to it so when nowhere does the Bible says Jesus peace be upon Him is God so why do you believe he's God because the church says so do you believe in the Bible or do you believe in the church I believe in the Bible where does the bible say is God so someone has told you a lie so now when you have come to know the truth nowhere did Jesus say that he's God peace be upon him I have given you so many quotations so yet do you believe he God see the brother who came earlier he got convinced he's seen my cassettes he seen my lectures I'm asking you yet do you believe Jesus Is God according to the Bible Jesus Christ came to die for our sins and was crucified sister you said Jesus Christ peace be upon Him came to die for a sin and he was crucified I told you earlier sister just before you I proof that according to the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him did not die on the cross I told in the earlier answer did you listen to my answer sister did you listen to my earlier answer please I didn't hear you all I quoted to You gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 40 that Jesus Christ peace be upon him said as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and we know Jonah was alive correct Jonah was alive in the belly of the fish so even Jesus Christ was alive that means he did not die on the cross please I'll be happy if you can please explain to me how Jesus Christ died ah you asking me to explain how Jesus Christ died Jesus Christ peace be upon him did not die so how can I explain to you you died as I told you Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says that as Jonah you know prophet Jonah as prophet Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth when Jonah was thrown overboard was he dead or alive sister was alive in the belly of the fish was he dead or alive alive alive when the fish vits out Jonah was he dead or alive alive alive alive alive Miracle of a miracle of a miracle now when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was taken on from the cross and put in the sear in the tomb was he dead or alive please the question again Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth you told me Jonah was alive in the belly of the fish Jesus Christ after he was brought down from the cross he was put in the Seer in the heart of the earth when he was put in the sear in the heart of the Earth was he dead or alive alive alive that means he did not die so if he did not die how can you say that Jesus Christ died for our sins it's mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel chapter number 18 verse number 20 the soul that sin shall die the father shall not bear the iniquity of of the son neither the son shall bear the iniquity of the Father the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked turns and come back he shall not die so sin cannot be inherited according to the Bible one human being cannot die for the sins of the other human being correct so Jesus Christ peace be upon him did not die so now do you believe that he's a prophet of God that there is no place in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon unequivocally says that he's God now do you believe that he's not god sister I'm convinced you're confused I'm convinced you're convinced masallah so you're convinced Jesus is not God yes please do you believe in messenger of God I Believe In messenger of God Mah do you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God yes please that means you're a Muslim would you like to say it in Arabic if anyone who believes that there is no one worthy of worship except one true God Allah and Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of Allah that means you're a Muslim would you like to say it in Arabic yes please is anyone forcing you to become a Muslim is someone forcing you no are you doing out of your own free will yes yes is anyone giving you money no one is giving me money okay I say it in Arabic and you repeat it Ashu Allah Allah I bear witness I bear witness that that there is none there is none worthy of worship worthy of worship except Allah except Allah and I bear witness and I bear repat that that Prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is the messenger is the messenger and servant of God and Serv of mashallah you have become a Muslim and I pray to Allah subhana ta'ala to Grant you J I pray to Allah to give you Jenna to put you in paradise and I pray to Allah to give you the best in this world and the year after and once you have become a Muslim all your previous sins have
