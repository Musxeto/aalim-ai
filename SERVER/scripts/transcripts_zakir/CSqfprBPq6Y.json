  "transcript": "so the question just that's come on the Facebook by yogesh nimawat India if fasting has so many benefits then why don't you Muslims fast for the entire why only one month in a year that's a very good question a fasting has so many benefits why don't you fast the entire year by only one month if you have heard my talk in the second session of this Dr Zakir I said that fasting is like overhauling once a year of the complete body of the human being it is like servicing like how if you have a vehicle you have to service once a year once in six months so fasting is like servicing so and everyone knows that servicing is good for the car if I focus everything is good then why don't you keep on servicing every day and people will start laughing so fasting is the overhauling of the body so that's why once a month for one full month there are various medical benefits but if you do it throughout the year it will not be beneficial and the prophet said it is Haram to fast all the days of the year yes you can fast twice a week on Mondays and Thursday it's a Sunnah the the maximum we can fast in every alternate day but fasting every day is prohibited it will not be beneficial for the body that's really that Muslims don't fast every day of the year but fasting once a month has got maximum medical benefits then after that if you want more you can fast twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays and the other optional fast whether it be after a while whether it be a modram whether it be of it will be of arafah Etc"
