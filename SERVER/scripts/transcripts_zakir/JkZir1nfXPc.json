  "transcript": "but the next question is from Abdul Kareem from New York USA is it permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Christian woman if yes are there any conditions can he marry her even if she believes Jesus peace be upon to be God this is a very important question asked by Brother Abdul Kareem from New York USA that is it permissible for a Muslim man to marry a Christian girl or a girl from Delhi kitab are there any conditions can he marry her if she believes Jesus Is God as far as a Muslim man marrying a Christian girl is concerned Allah clearly mentioned in the Glorious Quran in Surah maida chapter number five verse number five that lawful for you are those things that are good and pure lawful for you ah the food of the halikita and lawful for you in marriage ah the chaste believing woman the mosinat the chaste believing Woman and the chaste woman among So based on this verse of the Quran the Quran is very clear-cut and it says that a Muslim man can marry a chaste woman from there are some people who say okay they like it up at the time of the Prophet they did not believe that Jesus Etc these people who say this they are wrong they don't know the Quran tell he mentions 72 that they believe that Jesus is God that it goes by saying they believed in Trinity and foreign but the majority of the scholars all of them they say that it is permissible to marry as long as she is chased this is a criteria there the condition put on that which woman from the LA GitHub can you marry and the Quran in Surah maida chapter number five verse number five if the expression says that you can marry the chaste woman from the moment from the Believers enath from the momina and mosinat from the helicita the condition is that she should be chased now based on this condition the least you can expect a chest woman to be leased there are various conditions for being chased for being more sanat the minimum the minimum condition the lowest is that she should be a virgin and today we find since the question is asked from USA from New York today we know according to the statistics that we have of the Western countries they say that the girls in the school 90 lose their virginity other stats we say that the girl by the time she passes College University 95 percent lose the virginity some say 98 percent even if you know the statistics of Europe of UK most of the statistics almost all they say that by the time a woman passes her University 97 but all of them agree it is more than 95 percent so one of the minimum criteria for mohsenath for being chased is that you should be virgin there are many other criteria So based on this hardly you will find any woman especially in the Western Country who will be chased and I was born in Bombay I lived my life in Mumbai I passed my Medical College in Mumbai and I remember that after I passed my Medical College in the early part of the 21st Century in the year 2002 or 2001. there was an AIDS conference in Bombay and according to the statistics in that conference we were told that in Bombay on an average 70 percent of the girls lose their virginity before they passed under 10. and was shocking to me Bombay India is much more conservative than America than the Western Country and that is talking about 20 years back so today what we come to know that in this 21st century it is very difficult for a woman to remain chest especially in the Western countries and now it's also coming to the Eastern country and the scholars most of them they discourage though it's permissible but they said they should be chased so where will you find the chaste movement from the helicita a chaste Christian woman and even if you marry the problem that we see after that is phenomenal there are high chances that after a Muslim man marries a Christian girl or a Jewish girl there are high chances that the marriage will not be successful and we find that the way of dressing differs the way of eating differs the way of behavior differs and imagine the cleanliness is not there imagine the Christian woman during menstruation she may not inform the husband and we know it's Haram to have intercall during the cycle whether will she be able to clean herself very well the eating habits are different and in Western world it is quite common that many of the Muslim men they marry Christian woman and these men actually are not very practicing Muslims so what we find them doing that after they marry when they go to the grocery they are buying alcohol for their wife they are buying pork for their wife they may not drink themselves but they are buying it for their wife many of them maybe they were drinking before marriage many of them not drinking start drinking alcohol after marriage all these things are common and we find that many a times if the marriage doesn't work it ends in a divorce and when the divorce and if you have children then you are Muhammad and your Abdullah any of the Rahman and your Fatima and your khatija they are going to church so I personally I'll give my view later on the additional criteria most of the scholars they do not encourage a Muslim man to marry a woman from the alligator it's permissible but the criteria she should be muscle and where will you find a mosena and even you find a motion there are eight problems so person who is a religious Muslim will never Venture into this and most of the cases that you have when a Muslim man is marrying a Christian girl 99.9 cases I love marriages the moment you have girlfriend and boyfriend it means that you are not chased so do you do you go out with a girl go for a movie go out fighting God for dancing where is she just leave us at virginity even going out for Dancing with the name going out to see a movie it is against the value of chaiti it is so if you apply the strict criteria of a Christian woman hardly you'll be able to find him and practically to follow this advice today in this 21st century is very difficult and we know the problem that can happen after marriage according to the call of IBN Abbas may Allah be pleased with him he says that a Muslim man can only marry an helicita woman in an Islamic State he cannot marry a Christian woman or a Jewish woman if it is in a foreign country and there are a group of Scholars who agree with this view of IBN abbasma Allah between him and I'm going to agree with the few because if you marry a Christian girl in a non-muslim country and if anything happens they will follow their law they will not for the Islamic law if there is a divorce then your children as I mentioned Muhammad Sultan Abdullah khatija Fatma will go to church so but natural it is not encouraged at all so I agree with the view that this is only permissible to marry a Christian woman number one should be chaste and number two in an Islamic State besides agreeing with the view of him I personally have another condition based on my studies of the Quran I don't claim to be a scholar I am a student of knowledge and my specialty Islamic comparative religion so I have my additional criteria based on the Quran it's not my criteria it's my study of the Quran as I mentioned earlier in the starting of Mansa Allah is very clear-cut in Surah minda chapter number five first number five lawful for you are all things that are good NPR lawful for you are the food of the halikita of the people of the book and the verse continuous lawful for you in marriage besides the chaste woman who are believers ah the chaste woman from the helicita this was there but then there wasn't the greatest Quran foreign twenty one which says that do not marry an unbelieving woman do not marry a mushrika and idolatrous a woman who does silk unless she believes a believing woman who is a slave woman is much better than unbelieving woman than a mushrika even if she allows you that means the Quran is very they put in Surah baqarah chapter number two verse number 221 that a Muslim can only marry a woman a Muslim cannot marry a mushrika cannot marry a non-muslim unless she becomes a Muslim a Muslim woman who is a slave woman a Bond woman is much better than unbelieving woman even if she allows you she may be the richest woman in the world she may be the most beautiful woman in the world she may be very attractive but a believing woman who is a slave woman who is a Bond woman is much better for a Muslim man than an unbelieving woman a non-muslim woman it's very clear-cut um that means you cannot marry a Hindu but there is exception in the Quran in Surah maida chapter number five verse number five that you can marry a chaste woman from the Ali Kita Quran is very explicit in Surah maida chapter number five verse number 72 might say that they are doing they are blaspheming those who say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary that means Quran is very clear-cut in Surah maida chapter number five verse number 72 that the Christians they say that Allah is Christ the son of Mary and the verse continues [Applause] shall be dwelling place and he shall have no helpers in the hereafter foreign anyone who Associates partners with Allah Allah will make jannat Haram foreign by saying Jesus Christ peace be upon his almighty God they believe in Trinity Surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 221 says you cannot marry someone who does silk so all these verses put together they seem to be an apparent contradiction if Allah is very clear-cut in the Quran and the Quran says a woman cannot marry a mushrika so how come surimaida said that you can marry Ali kitab they simply contradiction and Allah is very clear-cut in the Quran in Surah chapter number four verse number 82. do they not consider the Quran with care do they not Pond over the Quran with had it been from anyone besides Allah there have been many contradictions so they cannot be a contradiction so alhamdulillah since I mean they feel a comparative religion there is one verse of the Quran which gives the reply to this question Allah says in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter number three verse number 110. which is a very famous verse Allah says he had the best of people's evolved for mankind because we enjoying what is good and we forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah so this was of the Quran is a very important verse saying that the Muslim ummah is the best of the people evolved for mankind and the reason is because we enjoying what is good and we forbid what is wrong and we believe in Allah there's a very famous word but this is not the complete verse this is half the verse the verse continues it would have been better for them if had faith it would have been better for them if the Ali kitab had Faith had belief there are some who are believers but the majority are perverted transgressors so here in Surah imbran chapter 3 verse number 100 and Allah says that among the Allah but the majority of poverty transgressors so the one criteria which all the scholars agree is that the woman from the Ali kitab should be mosinat and there's no doubt about it be pleased with inputs another criteria that the marriage should only be done in a Muslim State otherwise not valid moment that means the believer that means they don't believe that Jesus is God they don't believe in Trinity so you can only marry the most it will not contradict against the verse of the Quran of Surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 20. so according to me in my humble study I don't claim to be a scholar the additional criteria besides the woman being chased and besides it being in an Islamic State the third criteria she should be a movement that means she should not believe that Jesus is God she should not believe in Trinity and at the time of the Prophet there were such people the example is novel was the cousin and he was a moment he was a Christian but he was the woman that's the reason you find that there are very few sahabas it's permissible I'm not saying in faram but there are criteria that women the Krishna Jewish woman should be should be chased should be in Islamic State and should be moment she should not do shirk that's the reason there are very few Sabbath I think for their families very few Sabah who had vibes from the helicita but my advice to the Muslims especially in the Western countries is that don't take undue advantage of this verse and think that it's fine this verse is very explicit that she should be a motion the chaste woman to get chest woman is extremely difficult and if you apply the condition of IBN Abbas that it should be a Muslim state but natural the question is from New York is from Western Country I would totally disagree that a Muslim man should marry a woman from the halikita especially in the Western Country even if in the Islamic country she should be a mosena and she should be a believer she should be a woman and what we find that most of these marriages I love marriages how can she be most enough okay if you find a woman who was a Christian woman who accepted Islam because she liked Islam no problem someone who accepts Islam and she's a river and then you marry no problem but you get into love with her you go to college together or you go to university together or you're working together and then you fall in love and then you say that Islam allows and then you may go to akadi and maybe say the Sharda for namesake this is only plastic surgery there are high chances that are children I totally disagree and this type Muslims are not practicing Muslims a practicing Muslim actually would not fall in love with the Christian girl so but natural because your Deen is weak and then you take an excuse from the verse of the Quran and Mary I am not making permissible Haram I'm saying there are conditions and it's very difficult very very difficult to find such thing so my advice to the Muslim young men and young boys is that please don't use this verse of the Quran as an excuse to marry the Christian woman there are various conditions it's almost very difficult to fulfill these conditions and doing in a non-muslim country also is not permanent according to many scholars and agree with that and these are only infatuations or living in a western country you go to work you go to school so these things we should be away from if you really find a reward girl who's accepted Islam not because you're falling in love and she's following the principles of Islam and she's praying five times a day and is a good modest woman then there's no problem but please don't get involved in love and then you say to the Lord in Islam please stay away from it it will be not only bad for you but for the generations to come hope that answers the question"
