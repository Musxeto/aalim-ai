  "title": "A Muslim who lives long can perform more good deeds than the Muslim who lives short? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question posed is by brother now from india allah created human beings some human beings he gave long life and some shot a long living muslim can perform more good deeds than the short living muslim what if a muslim wants to perform more good deeds but he dies very soon isn't it injustice where the nakshat has asked a very interesting question and he says that if a muslim dies at a very early age won't it be injustice as compared to a muslim who's living for a longer time a person may live 40 years they have the muslim life for 25 years so isn't it injustice for a muslim would live for a short time that he has no opportunity for doing good deeds if he had lived for longer time he had done more good deeds what brother nausea fails to realize that i can ask a counter question also that the more longer you live the more evil you can do so it is disadvantage is to live for a longer time because if you live for longer time you will do more evil deeds if you live for shorter time you'll do less evil deeds this life doesn't work in this logic allah says in the quran in surah chapter 67 verse number two allah has created that a life to test which of you is good in deeds allah subhanahu wa can test people even in short time even in long time suppose the person does good deeds allah knows that average good deeds into may be for example in a year a person averaged us 10 good deeds so if a person lives for 10 years he will do 100 good deeds if he lives for 50 years he'll do 500 good deeds that doesn't mean a person who does 500 good deeds is better than a person 100 good deeds the other same the average is 10 good deeds per year so it works more on a percentage and various aspects allah judges every human being depending upon the quality and the ability he has given he makes some people rich some people poor some people healthy some people handicap the people who are poor they don't never give the car they get hundred out of 100 in zakah the person who is rich has to give zakat has to give more charity so depending upon the facility allah subhanahu wa ta'ala allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 40. allah is never unjust in the least degree there's no question that allah can do injustice so you allah subhana with allah knows depending upon the ability has given you whether wealth or poverty whether health or sickness with the short life or long life based on the ability he has given you he will judge you accordingly allah is malik deen the master of the day of judgment he knows all these things no one on the day of judgment will ever tell to allah that you have been unjust even the kafirs will be put into hellfire they'll say we agree we are wrong but give us one more chance and allah say it's too late allah gives you thousands of chances in this world you come in this world only once and then is the day of judgment hope that answers the question"
