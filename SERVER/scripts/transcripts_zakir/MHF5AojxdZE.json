  "transcript": "the next question is from tahir sultan from united kingdom is it allowed to have pension after one has retired from a government job as far as pension is concerned there is nothing wrong in receiving pension whether you are doing a government job or from a private company but the only point to be noted is that most of the pensions that are given whether by the government or whether by private companies they involve interest and raba because most of the companies are government when the pension is deducted from the salary of the employee along with a percentage given by the employer this money is kept in fixed deposit in banks on money instruments which earn interest and later on after you retire you start getting benefit from this as we know very well that interested haram and allah clearly mentioned in the glorious quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and 279 that those who give up not the demands of rabbah of interest take notice of a war from allah and ever soul so interest is a major sin not only is it a major sin the quran says allah and his rasool will wage a war against you and in the book the khabar the major sins imam adhabi lists interest as the 12th major sin and the prophet peace be upon him said it's mentioned hadith that the lowest level of ribba is like doing dinner with your mother so because of this if that pension amount that you receive involves ribba then you should try and take out that element of rabbah because you may not be involving yourself in riba but your employer may be so if someone is forcing remind you what you can do is you can calculate what is the principal amount which is from your salary what is the principal amount which your employer has put and what is the element of rubber so when you get this pension after you calculate if you get rid of this element of ribba calculate the percentage it may be 10 percent 20 30 whatever the percentage is give this away in charity to the poor people for some noble cause because this riba has come involuntary to you voluntary taking repay and giving charity even that is haram but involuntary somebody is forcing you it is your money it is your right that the employer is giving you benefit but if it's involving with the principal amount the quran says you can keep the principal amount and give away the repa so that riba portion percentage from the pension if it is involving the interest should be given a charity but the best would be if the pension is from islamic source in the islamic country that are following the islamic sharia they put it in takaful which is an islamic based insurance or an islamic based sharia compliant pension fund in which everything is alarmed so if it's based on sharia principle you can keep the complete amount of pension if it's involving river you get rid of that percentage and in charlotte you can utilize the percentage which is free from rubber"
