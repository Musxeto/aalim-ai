  "transcript": "what are your particular words of advice regarding the on the occasion of Ramadan approaching us my advice would be that every Muslim he or she should make it a point that they should make a resolution that they should fast each and every day of this blessed month of ramnan and we should try and acquire all the benefits of this month and we should not waste a single minute in this blessed month on things which are travel and try and concentrate as much as possible in Remembering Allah we should try and look for his Mercy we have to try and ask for forgiveness we have to try and seek for his love and we have to try and increase our piety our righteousness and our patience and our beloved Prophet Allah said in say buhari verb number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1903 a beloved Prophet Muhammad anyone who does not live the false action and for speech Allah does not care if he leaves his eating and drinking that means if a person does not abstain from false action and for speech Allah does not care if you abstain from food and drink that means your fasting will not be accepted unless you stay away from false action and false speech he also said it's mentioned in say Hadith which is Britain in Muslim Ahmed ROM number two page number 230 Hadith number 7148 and it also appears in chapter number five Hadith number two one zero six Prophet Muslim said all people the Blessed month of Ramadan is approaching and Allah has ordained for you that you fast in this month and the Gates of Heaven will be open in this month and the Gates of Hell will be closed and the Devils they will be chained in this month is the night which is better than a thousand months and if a person is deprived of the blessings in this month he is truly a deprived person so we have to make it a point that we gain the benefits of this blessed month Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned say buhari in the book of fasting Hadith number 1901 a beloved Prophet Muslim said that anyone who fasts in this month with faith seeking the reward of Allah all his past sins will be forgiven that means if we truly with sincerity fast in this month and see the reward of Allah all our past sins will be forgiven imagine it is such an easy way to have our sins forgiven of the past and our beloved Prophet Muslim also said foreign number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1904 this is a very long Hadith which are basically Four Points our beloved Prophet Muslim said that all the children of Adam all the Deeds that they do are for themselves except for fasting fasting is for me and I will reward him and he further said that fasting is a shield it prevents you from sin and the person who observed the fast he should abstain from obscenity from yelling and from ignorance and if someone yells at him or abuses him he should say I am fasting I am fasting and the third point of beloved Prophet said in this Hadith is that I swear by Allah in whose hand is the soul of Muhammad that the breadth of a faster the person of us is sweeter to Allah than the scent of Musk that there are two things when a pastor is happy and looks forward to it the first is when he breaks the first and the second is when he meets the Lord Allah and further it's mentioned in the Quran in surinur chapter number 24 verse number 31 it says oh you believe truly have faith in Allah and seek the Bliss that means turn into Jannah it's mentioned Surah chapter number 46 verse number 13 and 14. that those are the people who worship none but Allah and they are steadfast in faith the word they are steadfast in faith that there's only one Allah and no one else and they shall not have any fear nor that Sheikh grief these are the people who are the people of paradise and they shall be rewarded for all the goods they have done Allah so this is advice for the people that they should take take the best of this month and should not spend time on trivial things and spend their time in the worship of Allah and remember Allah and forgiveness"
