  "transcript": "what is the meaning of fast alhamdulillah the word means to fulfill or compensate F which were due and they could not be executed means if there is a f f which you could not keep for some valid reason then it has to be compensated or fulfilled later on if there's a valid excuse that you could not keep a f during Ramadan whether it be the person was traveling or he was sick or lady was menstruating Etc then the fast has to be made up later on after the month of Ramadan or if a person breaks the fast for a valid reason whether he was sick or if he was traveling or minrating Etc then the fast has to be made up immediately after Ramadan as soon as possible Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 fasting was prescribed for a fixed period but if any of you is ill or on a journey then it should be made up later in the other days mean if you could not fast for a valid reason then you should make up the fast later on for example if suppose someone is sick or is traveling for the full month then the full month should be made later on if the month of Ramadan was for 29 days then the person should fast for 29 days later on if the month of Ramadan was for 30 days then the person should fast for 30 days and besides the fast of Ramadan if it was obligatory fast that a person says that if he has vowed that he'll fast on so so day if such a such thing is fulfilled then he's supposed to fast and if you could not fast for a valid reason even that should be made upat on and even that's called fast"
