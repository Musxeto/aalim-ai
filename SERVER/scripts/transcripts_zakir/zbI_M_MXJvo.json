  "transcript": "how correct is the phrase which some people say in their Dua oh Allah I do not ask you to change your decree but I do ask you to help when it comes to pass I'm aware that many Muslims ask this Dua but this is not the right way to ask Allah subhana wa tala because Allah has told us that we can ask Allah subhana wa ta'ala anything we can ask for forgiveness we can ask for the good things we can even ask him to even if it mentioned something in our decree that something wrong is going to happen something bad is going to happen we can ask him for good so it's wrong to say that we cannot ask you to change your decree but please help us further it's mentioned in the Quran in chapter number 113 where it says that that say we seek Refuge with the Lord of down from from the Mischief which has been created so we asking Allah subhana ta'ala for protection for Refuge it's mentioned in say bukari volume number n in the book of Hadith number 6616 that the prophet said that take refuge with Allah subhana wa ta'ala from the severity in the calamities from the evil end and the bad fate and from the malicious joy of the enemy so but natur you can ask Allah subhana wa taala to change his but I like to give an example that suppose there's a student who appears for his examination and he hasn't fed well and he knows that he's going to fail so he comes home and he prays to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that Allah subhana wa ta'ala please pass me and Allah subhana tala accepts his prayer so in the it was mentioned that this particular student he was going to fail he comes home and he prays to Allah subhana taala Allah subhana taala even knows whether the person is going to pray to him or not and Allah even knows whether he going to accept this prayer or not so in the original it was mentioned he's going to fail the examination Allah also knows in advance that he'll come and pray and ask Allah to pass so that he pass him the examination Allah even knows that is going to accept his prayer and pass him the examination so actually the is perfect it doesn't change but the previous which was there that going to fail is there so when you pray the previous gets changed but Allah also has that whether you're going to pray or not so therefore always you should pray to Allah subhana wa tala and ask for his forgiveness and ask for help so it's also mentioned the that he's going to pray and Allah will accept his prayer and he'll pass"
