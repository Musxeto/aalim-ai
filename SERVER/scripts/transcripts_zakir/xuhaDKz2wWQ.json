  "transcript": "next question asks by nawaz sharif from calcutta which is the most difficult question posed to you so far in your life this is the question this question which is the most difficult question posed to you so far in life is the most difficult question in my life yes there have been difficult questions i can narrate many as far as the most difficult question is concerned because it's not a very common question i will never tell it to the masses to the public because such questions can are so difficult so attacking and if it's not common why should i make it public alhamdulillah i have the answer and and allah helped me it's through allah's help i got the answer this only discuss with the scholars and the fokahas and i as the what is the answer and i've asked this to maybe uh 50 or 100 people who are scholars and people of knowledge and and and unfortunately the most difficult questions have not been answered because of the intensity not because of the knowledge based into the intensity of the question so those questions which are attacking islam and they're not common and it's difficult to understand the answer as a policy even if you ask i'll never tell you that's only to be discussed with people of knowledge and the scholars yes there have been many questions which are tricky many questions which may require a logical answer nothing to do with islamic knowledge and there are many i'll just give one example to you i don't say it's the most difficult but it was a tricky question and i remember i think it was in the year 2014 or somewhere close to that in dubai after my lecture in dubai there were about 15 20 000 people in the audience there's a lady who's a non-muslim who asked me a question and she said the dr zakir you often give the example of why a muslim lady should do hijab and you ask the question that if two twin sisters were equally beautiful one of the one of them is wearing the islamic hijab complete body covered except the face and the hands up to the wrist and the other twin sister she's wearing the western clothes with mini skirts and a low neck and if both of them are walking down the streets of dubai and if there is a hooligan if there is a ruffian who is waiting to tease a girl which girl will it is and you ask this question yes i have given this example and i've asked this question since the early 90s when i gave the talk of women that's in islam the first time in 1993 since this time i'm asking a question and i've asked this question in public forum that which girl will retrieve and always answer has been but natural the girl wearing the western tooth in miniskirt or low neck because she's attracting and for for 20 years the answer have been saved now this lady comes up and she repeats the question but she says that according to me the girl wearing the islamic hijab would be teached i said why she said because the man would like to know what is behind the clothes that's why he will tease the girl wearing the islamic hijab and my daughter who was in the audience he said no abby's trap my father is trapped and i was taken aback that this was never answered so what i say these type of these type of replies are mainly devilish replies to try and trap but alhamdulillah in such situation allah is the one who always helps i got up and i said okay sisters asked a very good question and i continued the question and i said though i disagree so the question is asked your man so i said i disagree with your answer it's an illogical answer but if you agree that the answer is correct then why are you wearing clothes if you don't want people to be close you should take off your clothes and believe me that woman was so embarrassed and that was a very good slap to her reply to a question which was a devilish question she went back and she sat quietly so these types of questions by non-muslims who come to attack you it has got nothing to do with islam my answer was logical but what i told okay i disagree with you answer but if you agree with your answer why are you wearing clothes and she was wearing clothes i said why are wearing clothes and so so these type of questions the answer should be with and beautiful preaching and argue with them in the ways that are best most gracious so such type of questions are many inshallah if you see my videos and see my question answer session you will find many of such such questions"
