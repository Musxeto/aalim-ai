  "transcript": "how does the voluntary fast differ from the obligatory fast in Islam as far as the voluntary fast and the obligatory fasts are concerned they are one and the same as for the ruling is concerned except for two things that is one is the Nia very difficult between the two and the second is the prophet said the person who does voluntary fast he is the leader of himself if you want you can break it whenever we wish it and this will lead the drive from the Hadith it's mentioned in this I in the book of fasting Hadith number 2323 that one is the prophet Muslim he asked his wife in the morning that do you have something to eat so she says no Then the prophet replies that I am fasting that means he did not have the near to fast the one night before which is required for an obligated fast here a person gets up as long as they had not eaten anything or has not drank anything he can do the Nia on the spot also it's valid the second thing as I mentioned that the person who keeps the warranty fast he's the leader of his own self or herself and they can break the fast another wish the Hadith mentioned intermedi in the book of fasting Hadith number 732 that um Allah we prayed with her she says that on the day of the victory of Makkah when we went to somebody's house was given water to drink after drinking he gave it to me and she told the prophet that I'm fasting so the prophet says that is it for atonement or the one in fast he said no it's a warranty fast so then the prophet says the person who keeps the warranty fast he's the master of him or her self and they can break the fast winner of the wish so if you want to break you can break if you please you can break the fast or you need not the option is mentioned in Sunan bahaki Hadith number 8362 where once one of the Sabah he invites to his house and the prophet goes with other sahabas and when the food is served when man says that I am fasting so the prophet says the man has taken the trouble to make food for you and you spend money so you break a fast and if you wish you can make it up later so these Hadith you come to know that number one Nia is not the same as obligated fast it doesn't have to be made one night before but especially for fasting on arafah day and 10th day of maharam Ashura it's preferable it's done before but otherwise in warranty fast it's not a must come down later also and a person can break the fast if you wishes after a break if you want so you can compensate or you need not compensate that is up to him"
