  "title": "Married Women are Prohibited from Keeping a Voluntary Fast without their Husbands' Permissions",
  "transcript": "looked exactly why is it compulsory for a wife to seek permission of a husband before she performs a voluntary fast the Beloved Prophet Muslim said that's mentioned in say buhari word number seven Hadith number 5192 the prophet said that no woman should perform warranty fast without the permission of the husband if he's at home said that no woman should fast even a single day without the permission of the husband if he's at home except in the month of Ramadan here we come to know the reason is that if she performs the voluntary fast she is infringing on the rights of the husband maybe he would want to have a you may want to spend time with her and if she fast without taking his permission she may be infringing on his rights and furthermore it may even tempt him to do a sin because if you want son if he breaks the fast it's a sin and furthermore we come to from the Hadith that if the husband is not at home and if he's traveling then she did not take the permission or if he's disabled Etc and diseased and doesn't require her then the forecast say that even at that time she did not take the permission at the normal time means at home she should take the permission"
