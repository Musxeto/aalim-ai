  "transcript": "the next question adeel bareilly uttar pradesh india is every hadith in bukhari authentic if yes then can it be compared to the quran a similar question asked by shaddaab khatri london uk are all the hadith in sahih a similar question by suleiman khan birmingham uk what are the criteria that make a hadith sahih are all the sahih hadith of the same level why is sahih bukhari so special so the three questions have clubbed together talking about say bukhari and the criteria that make hadi say and what makes buhari special regarding the first question that are all the hadith in say buhari authentic and can be compared to the quran yes all the hadith in say buhari authentic there are 7563 hadith in say buhari and all of them authentic can be compared to the quran the quran is the word of allah the quran is verbatim the word of allah which was revealed to a beloved prophet muslim to archangel gabriel then the scribes the sahabas they wrote down and prophet muhammad checked it up personally he asked them to recite it he checked it if there was a mistake he corrected it and prophet peace be upon him used to rehearse it with archangel gabriel every ramadan and the last ramadan before he died he rehearsed it twice so that means the quran is hundred percent the word of allah verbatim revealed to prophet muhammed the prophet dictated the sabbath they wrote it down he counter-checked it he divided it with archangel gabriel so quran is verbatim word to word without a difference even of a letter the word of allah as far as say buhari is concerned it is the most authentic book amongst all the books of hadith the highest level but the hadith are the sayings of the prophet and his actions some hadith are verbatim words but the others are meaning wise they are not verbatim the word of the prophet and they were heard by the sahabas sabas memorized it then the and the chain of narrators so it is not of that the quran is the highest level it is the orbital word of god the hadith are the sayings of the prophet if it's the sahajas we believe in it we have to follow it but natural quran is number one then comes the say hadith in say hadith the highest is saibukhari and it's ijma amongst the ali sunnah jamaa scholars among the sunni scholars that after the book of allah after the quran the next in authenticity the next to be followed is say buhari there's no doubt about it the second most important book of islam it is say buhari come to the second question are all the hadith in authentic is actually a misnomer means six sahih it should be kutuba sitta it is six books of hadith so kudubu sitta is the right terminology for six books of hadith syasitta is a muslima she has a term in six authentic books the right terminology is kotobus six books of hadeet and this book sunday these six books the scholars they say that if you read these six books of hadith you will come to know most of the rulings in islam but the hadith in all the six books are not hundred percent authentic the only books in which all that are authentic and say buhari number one then it's a muslim the remaining four books sununu in these four books most of the hadees is but not all hundred percent so these six books the scholars say if you read and you read the quran you will come to know most of the ruling in islam most of it not hundred percent but most of it the small group of scholars say that instead of ibn maja they should be imam tamalik this is another small group of scholars say the six books should contain besides say bihari say muslim surname it should contain imam that's a small group but we agree that six books are there if you want to join imam at the moment it becomes seven but most of the scholars say that my major is included in this so all the hadith of these six books only the first two say muslim and say bukhari all authentic the remaining four majority authentic but not all there is a great scholar of the recent time this that is ignacy albani what he did he has divided the last four books of quran into sahih and life he wrote and he differentiated the books of hadith the last four books then he took the next book then he took the next book says say hadith in the last four books of kudu he's done a great work so this is how you can differentiate come to the third question that what are the criteria for hadith to be sahih and what is so special about say buhari and what are the categorizations of hadith as far as classification and categorization of hadees is concerned it is called as mustala hadees that is the science of hadith the mod the scenes have classified hadith into very different categories the three more important classification i'll tell you there are many classifications one is based on who is the original narrator and according to abnessala he has classified the hadith into who is the originator and number one the highest hadith it goes up to allah if it says that mohammed sallallahu sallam said that allah said it goes up to allah it starts with the narrator goes to the sabbah goes to the prophet and prophet said allah said that becomes the secret to the highest category number two is the murph hadith the hadees which reaches marfum is raised it reaches to prophet muhammad so that becomes murphy the third category is means stop it goes to the level of the sahaba so if the hadees goes to the level of sabah but doesn't reach the level of prophet sallallahu it is called as mokof that is stopped that's the third level the fourth is the makhtu means cut off it reaches to the table so if it reaches allah it's called hadith reaches to the prophet it's called as murphyhadis reaches to the saba it is called as maokov if it reaches to the turbine that is the next generation after the sabha it is called as matu so this classification is based on who is the original narrator one type of classification the second type of classification according to nisala is based on the number of chain of narrators and it is divided into two types the motavatara and hadith in the mutavatar hadith there are umpteen there are several number of narrators the number is not specified it says several at every stage and this mutawat hadees is divided into two further muthavatir in terms of wordings mutawater in terms of meaning i'll give you an example of muthavatir in terms of wording that means all the hadith that you find the wording is exactly the same and mothawater means in every stage there are various narrators like at the sabha level there are various sabbah who narrated it then there are various other people who narrated from the sabbath and the next level and the third level one example is a very famous muttawater hadith which is hadith in words that are beloved prophet salallahu said that anyone who deliberately or purposefully tells a lie in my name he prepares his seat in the hellfire now this hadith the words are same but natural arabic this is the english translation which metaphor but in arabic the words are the same it was narrated by no less than 74 sabas 74 different sahabas narrated this hadith that they said that they heard the prophet say this 74. now in the next level you have much more than 74 people who have narrated it each sabbah have narrated it to many other people so in the second level you have more than 100 of narrators then third level you have another few hundred narrators so overall there are hundreds of people who have narrated this hadith and all those who have narrated the words are exactly the same so the scholars of hadith they say it cannot be possible that hundreds of people are narrating exactly the same words it has to be correct there is no different opinion that these are verbatim the words of the beloved prophet so many narrators at every level that means minimum narrators of this adidas 74 next level there are more than 74 third level more than that so minimum so if there are several narrators at each level then the hadith is let's come to the second example in meaning of the prophet sallam when he said that for fajr salah there are two rakat there are various narrators at each level umpteen number of narrators many saboteur narrated it followed by rabbi but the words kept on differing but the meaning was the same though the words differed the meaning was the same that in fajr there were two rakat in zoho and isha there were four in meaning meaning is the same the words metaphor so this was the type of mutawata these two types in the hadith it is further divided into three types of hadith one is mashup second is aziz and third is gary now all the these they do not meet the criteria of mutawater the highest level of hadees is the mashup that minimum three or more narrators have narrated at each level that means minimum number of narrators each level if they are three then it is called as a mashup that that minimum three sabbah have narrated it then the turbine may be more than three but if minimum three is there at each level it is called as mushrood or even more than three it can be four also yet it's called a masurati if it is several then it becomes a multivator but if it's three at each level or four at each level it is called as a mashup it is the highest in terms of the second level in hadith is the aziz there are minimum two narrators at each level with the chain of narrators and minimum two sahabas have narrated it and at the other levels also two or more have continued with the chain so that's called azir the third category of aadhaar is a grief that means at any one stage only one person other stages there may be 10 20 no problem and the best example is the hadith of buhari which was narrated by the marmalade be pleased with him the first hadith of say bihari word number one book number one hadith number one that a beloved prophet said that your actions are based on your intention all the there are hundreds of the all hadith that are there it goes to hazard says umar with mellah said that the prophet said below after the tumor may allah be business there are many narrators but at one stage there's only one narrator no other sahabah besides has uma narrated this so this becomes a hud it's a hadith it is there in bukhari it's a say hadid but it is all the chains reach towards the tomar mallapathism there is no other sahaba who narrated this so this is called as ad and so this was the second type of classification based on number of narrators there are various classification i'll just come to the main one which we are discussing the third type of classification of hadith is based on authenticity in this type of classification there are two types of hadith one is mahabul accepted and the other is which is rejected in the acceptance of hadith there are two types of hadith say hadith and hassan in the say hadith what are the criteria for say hadith there are basically five criteria for hadith to be sahih number one the narrator should be of good character that means he should be honest he should be truthful he should not lie he should not cheat he should be of good character that is the first criteria number two he should be a very good memory so that he can repeat what he has heard of the prophet or according to ibn salah it can also be that what he heard from the prophet he remembers it and he writes it down and then if required he can again read it even that's accepted the second category the memory should be very good you can repeat it at any time or at least remember till the time he writes it the third criteria for hadith is that there should be a continuous chain of narrators there should be consistency i cannot say that i heard from my great-grandfather if my great-grandfather died before i was born how can i say i heard from my great-grandfather so there should be a continuous chain of narrative all the narrators should have met each other and personally heard from them the fourth criteria is that there should not be any flaw i'll give an example of a flaw that two contemporary narrators who lived at the same time if one chain of narrator said that narrator a heart from writer b and according to the history we know that these two narrators though they lived at the same time but they never met so how can narrator a heard the hadees from narrator b when they did not meet so this is the flaw so there should not be any flaw and the fifth criteria for hadith is that it should not contradict with any other sound hadith any other hadith which is sound which is sahih if it contradicts then it is wrong so it should not contradict with any other sound hadith any other sayadis or hasan adid so there are basically five criteria for hadith to be saying number one the narrator should be of a good character number two of good memory number three there should be continuity in the chain of narrator the senate should be there number four there should not be irregularities of laws number five should not contradict any other sound hadith if all the five criteria are met it is called as say hadith if there is a slight flaw in any of these then the hadith become hassan but it is accepted it is makbool in the say hadith there are two types of hadith that is the say hadith with continuous chain and say hadith with a broken chain in the hassan again there are two types hassan hadith with the continuous chain and hassan adid with the broken chain so these are the categories of the hadith except if it falls under say or hassan it is accepted as a huja as an argument for you to accept it if it's or and if the prophet has prohibited it becomes haram for you if the prophet has commanded you it becomes complexity for you or it becomes muslim for you the second category is hadith which is again got various categories they done they because of the chain of narrator zaif because of inconsistency in the narrator various there are multiple different types of cipher the time will not permit to go into detail same with maodu there are different types so basically the third type of classification based on authenticity and the other classification also makes a hadith which is magbud hadith which is maduro which is rejected now the question also asks one more question that are all the say hadith of same category that means all the hadith which are the same category no they are levels and i remember when one of my first teachers of hadith that they sheikh zayaraman asmr he was the head and the dean of the department of hadith in the islamic university of madina and he expired just a few months back on the day of arafah on the 30th of july just three months back and may allah grant him jonathan he was my first teacher in hadith and he said that there are ten categories levels of hadith eight categories of sahih and two of her son imam buhari in his jamaica he put additional criteria for making hadees sahih besides the five criteria which are discussed imam bukhari put his additional criteria which obstructor then only said i will include in my james say i'll give you an example normally for hadith to be saying the narrator should be of a minimum level of category five the more the scene they have written the history and biography of all the narrators and they have given 12 levels to the narrators number one is sikka all the sabbahs come in the sikka means the best number one truthful then one two three four last is khazab liar so if the narrator is up to level five it can be counted i will only take narrators up to level 3 that means he is putting a stricter condition so if bukhari put additional criteria to make it more authentic if it's a hadith in say bukhari it's a high level imam muslim who was a student of iran bukhari he put few additional criteria off his own he said i will take narrators only up to level four four and above bukhari said three and above one two three muslims that i will take up to level four and not take level five his additional criteria so the scene they say that number one the highest hadith that hadith that means the hadith which was compiled by bukhari and he said it is sahih in his sahih bukhari and the hadees which were compiled by imam muslim and isla muslim and it occurs in both of them so if it occurs in say bukhari and in say muslim it is called as muttafiq allah that means it is available in both say bihari and shy muslim and there's a book lululer marjan that has collection of all the hadith which occurs in both bukhari and muslim so that is number one the hadith that is present in both bukhari and muslim that is the highest level number one number two is the hadith which are present in sahih buhari number three are the hadees which are present in say muslim number four the monthly scene they say that imam bukhari was not able to analyze all the hadith the modernism says that approximately today there are approximately 1 million hadith and bukhari memorized approximately six lakh hadith six hundred thousand hadith so the madison say that those hadith which imam bukhari did not analyze we are analyzing and applying the criteria of bukhari nonetheless they say that those hadees the imam muslim did not analyze we are applying the criteria of a muslim on those hadith which imam muslim did not analyze and we are telling this fulfill this criteria so number four is the hadith which imam bukhari did not analyze the other modis this analyzed and which imam muslim did not analyze and the other mode they seen applied the criteria from muslim analysis and it's matching both the criteria of imam bukhari and imam muslim but these imam did not analyze themselves that is number four number five is those hadees which imam bukhai did not analyze but fulfill the criteria of buhari that comes to number five number six is those hadith with imam muslim did not analyze but fulfill the criteria from a muslim analyzed by the other modicine that come that level six and imam bukhari as i mentioned there are seven thousand five hundred sixty three hadith even in say muslim there are 7563 hadith the numbering differs in different editions so this is level six level seven is a sahih hadith with continuous chain which doesn't fulfill the criteria of buhari and muslim which fulfills the normal criteria of say hadith which i discussed five criteria of say hadees but it is a continuous chain number eight is the say hadith fulfilling the five criteria of say hadith but it is a broken chain number nine is hasan hadid a little bit doesn't fulfill 100 of site but very close to it with the continuous change that is number nine hassan hadid with the continuous chain and the tenth category is hasan hadid with the broken chain so these are the ten categories of say hadith this science of hadith it is very vast and believe me if you compare to how the historians approve any historical fact and they say okay this is historically correct there's a criteria which normal non-muslim historians when they agree that this is historical fact but the criteria put by the muhaddi scene for hadees to be say is multiple times stricter it is multiple times more difficult it is multiple times more stringent as what the storage too that's the reason if for a hadith to be sahih i just told you the brief of it it's not that easy every narrator his history has been written there's a rigid all in detail it is so difficult it is such a minor study that if the muhad scene when they give a verdict they can be a minor difference they cannot be someone saying it's a very high category someone saying that they're saying it's not possible it may differ level one of these or level two one or two level may differ that's it if authentic good month in the refer and they check so this is the science of hadith it is not possible for a lay man or a person like me who's just a student of knowledge i cannot decipher say your life i have read about the criteria but i am not qualified at all so this to classify with hadith is sahih or zaif or modu or which level of say it is the work of this specialization and in the recent time one of the famous what this as i mentioned was sheikh nassurdan albani and he had done a great job shingles with money and the question which when i studied which sheikh zayed rahman as me mella grant in jannah that when we talk about quran and say hadith we don't have all the say hadith compiled the maximum i could do i started with him in the year 1997. we could say okay takes in salah sahih but that doesn't have all the say hadith it contains muslim and the other four books so alhamdulillah after sheikh zayar iman asked me he retired there are many scholars in the last 1400 years who tried to compile all the say hadith together in one volume but all those who tried they never completed the project alhamdulillah sheikh zaraman asked me after he retired he took about 17 to 18 years to complete this project and he compiled all the sahara together and he compiled in the book called as jama kamil al-hadees the full name is short form it's called ajami kamen and about four years ago he compiled it and the first edition was published and after it was published the revision was done about two years before and it was printed just in this year and alhamdulillah after the second edition was printed and published and shakes me he checked it up and you're happy that at least the revised edition was out though he wrote the manuscript in 20 volumes it was printed the first edition in 12 volumes the second edition because the print was larger it came in 18 volumes he also made a mukta in five volumes in the original jamaica mill as texas me said there were more than a million hadith out of the million hadith there are many duplicates like inside bukhari if you remove the duplicates there are 2220 hadith so if you compile all the 1 billion hadith and remove the duplicates according to xeraman as mean there were about sixty thousand hadith from the sixty thousand hadith he collected only the say hadith removing the duplicates and in his jamaica mill there are 16 546 hadith so according to sheikh zayaram and as mean after removing the duplicates the say hadith today in the world are sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six and we can safely say if not hundred percent at least this compilation of his at least minimum contains ninety five percent of the hadith in this compilation he has given the huja he has his own criteria he compiled all the hadees which are saying and remove the duplicates he gave a reason that if this hadith was sahih and according to him it was if he even mentioned that outside is jama camel so there are additional 3000 hadith which other scholars say it is sahih but he says it is life and he gives her why it is life and he mentions it so that people don't think he has forgotten then he has even added in that three thousand of these the very common hadith famous hadith but they are they famous hadith which are modu for example the very common and famous hadith that hammer it is a modulo hadid there's another model adid that as far as you go to acquire knowledge no problem even if you go to china china was never the seat of knowledge at the time of the prophet hadith so he mentioned this famous hadith but it did not say hadith it is the mouth when giving his reason so totally jamaica mill contained 16 546 hadith plus approximately three thousand of these which other mod this in episode 5 and he says it is if or the other famous hadith which as if and modu so people don't think he has missed out and in this the big volume which is printed 12 volume in the first edition in the second edition this has given the tahrir the details why they say why it is safe and all the reasoning and if the hadith is that he gives the references there in say bukhari hadith number so and so including say muslim hadith number so and so including buddha number so and so so after the end of every hadith has it is available in three books of hadith or i will five books of adi or two books of hadith or only one book of hadith the details are given so that you come to know from where it comes in the mukta sir the research has been removed so that it's easy for a layman to read so the complete jammeh camera is mainly for scholars and for the more they seen for a layman the mukta said sufficient we have started translating it into english it was a three years project we started it about four years back but unfortunately when the translation was complete i wasn't happy with the english language so we are revising it so now we have completed one third of the revision inshallah next year by the end of next day it will be out so we will inshallah translate the mukta services then five volumes and it will be easy for people who don't know arabic to read it and to understand it we are translating also into urdu and other languages with people allah that this work is a phenomenal work so when we say quran and say hadith you can say quran and jamaica kamal contains all the bukhari all that is the muslim all the sahadees which is there in the quran and abu dhabi in sunnah in sunnah there are other books of sahih the other books of sahih that we know that bukhari and muslim are only two books which are 100 authentic and scholars even say that imam mohta malik or say so for a lay man if he wants to know he cannot do research if that is a bukhari or muslim or imam safely you can say otherwise he has to check whether they say or not there were other books of hadith compiled by scholars saying it's completely saying but the scholars don't agree everything say after bukhari muslim there is a compilation of say according to after bukhari muslim there are some hadith which scholars say is not sahih but it comes the third level the fourth is then there is the fifth book it's mustard he also claimed everything you say but the scholars differ and they say that everything is not sahih so these three books compiled as everything is saheed most of them almost all are say but not everything in the other kutapus are the four books when imam dawud when he compiled his main objective wasn't to compile only say his objective was to compile hadith which solves matter of salah or of udu or of other aspects same with the other modifin imam nasai so that's the reason they themselves mentioned in the collection that this is life i've done that but for a lame man for him to know hadith say if it's a bukhari or a muslim it is safe to call it sahih or if it's a hadith which is there in imam tamalek it is safe to be say any other hadith he has to go and check up what have the muhaddisin said and then he can decipher whether they say or not this was in brief what i mentioned it is just scratching the surface it is just scratching the surface on the science of hadith it's a huge sense because of this we know today alhamdulillah all the mind new details of the last and final messenger our beloved prophet muslim there is no human being on the face of the earth whose life has been preserved with so many new details it is all because of the hadith that we have and when allah says in the quran in surah chapter 15 verse number 9 that we have revealed the quran and we shall guide from corruption the word you are used is zikr it surely means the quran and many of them this scholar says it also includes that and also the say hadith and he received that he protects it"
