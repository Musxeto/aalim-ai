  "title": "13 Point Action Plan to the Muslim Ummah for the Palestinians â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "as most of us will be aware what's happening in Palestine what is the position of us Muslims in this situation number one we have to realize as Muslims that today there are 5211 million Palestinians of which more than 2 million are in the Gaza streate and the total Muslim po population of the world today is more than 2 billion according to me these Palestinians for the last several decades they are doing they are protecting the third holiest site of Islam they are protecting the Masjid AA what they are doing is for it's the duty of every Muslim if they were not there it would have been our duty to protect it so what they are doing is they are risking their life the Palestinians they are doing for on behalf of the Muslim umah today the Muslim umah are more than 25% of the world population there are more than 7.8 billion human beings in the world today of which more than 2 billion are Muslims more than 25% are Muslims and it is a shame that all the Muslims more than 25% of the world population put together we cannot protect Masjid AA so number one these Palestinians are doing for by protecting the third holiest mosque the third holiest site of Islam what should we Muslims do time will not permit me to speak for long I will just mention a few important points in brief I will mention 13 points in brief what the Muslims should do of which the first seven any Muslim can do and should do and the remaining all will not be possible but those who Allah has given the position they can do number one the least that any Muslim can do and should do is do duas for the Palestinians and for mjid AA I feel it is a f for every Muslim that they should pray for our Palestinian brothers and sisters we should pray for the safety we should pray for the victory we should pray that may Allah give them sa we should pray that those Palestinians who have been mared Allah should give them the highest level in J fos and my suggestion would be the best time to pray for our Palestinian brothers would be in tud because Allah subhana wa ta'ala descends in the last onethird of night and if you do Dua in in the Salah that would be the best those of us Muslims who regularly get up for tud they should pray and those who are not used to getting up at least this can be an excuse or an initiative for you to see to it that you get up in the last onethird of night and pray T Salah to Allah subhana wa ta'ala and in that Salah in suud you make duas for our Palestinian brothers and sisters for the safety for the security for the sa for the victory to Grant Jenna to those who have been mared you may never know that because of this tomorrow it may become your habit that you get get up for T Salah every night and this is the best time where Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala answers the prayers of the Believers and he says who is there who like to ask and I will answer your prayer so least a Muslim can do is do Dua for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Palestine number two you should make the situation aware on the social media the atrocities that are done by the Israelis on the Palestinians the violation of Human Rights the violation of the international law that is being done time will not permit me to speak about in detail which you can refer to my talk on VIR the Majid AA where I've have given in brief about the history that how were the Palestinians initially there how did the Jews come and till the city situation that is today time will not permit me but we should make on our social media whether it be on the Facebook whether it be on the Instagram on the Twitter on WhatsApp we should make the world aware of the atrocities done by the Israelis on the innocent Palestinians number three we should spread the literature whether it be pamphlets whether it be books whether it be ebooks on this issue so that the world is aware of what is happening in Palestine number four we should make publicity whether on billboards whether on buildings Holdings whether it be on buses on different venues so that you make the people aware in your locality in your city in your country about the atrocities done on our Palestinian brothers and sisters by the Israeli forces number five there should be peaceful protests all over the world by the Muslims but see to it that these protests are peaceful and see to it that if you're are living in a non-muslim country say to it that you follow the law of the country take permission do protest sit with you give a memorandum to the Israeli High commission or to the Embassy if it's there in the country if you're living non-muslim country the sixth is that we Muslims as a whole throughout the world should boycott all Israeli products we should boycott consuming all Israeli products surely the 25% of the world population if we boycott 100% of the Israeli products it will be surely a reminder to Israelis and it will be a good lesson to them number seven we should contribute financially whatever we can and as I've always said in many of my talks before that when you contribute see to it that you contribute besides your F zakat that you have to give see to it that you donate a percentage of your income your monthly income whether it be 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% as much as you do it is better for charity and from this amount of Charity that you commit from your monthly Prophet see to it that you allocate a portion for Palestine for our Muslim brothers and sisters in Palestine maybe for building hospitals maybe for building schools maybe for building their homes maybe for the food for various causes we should see to it that we contribute whatever we can and always Allah subhana wa ta'ala doesn't look at the amount he looks at what percentage of donation you have given from the N Allah has given you and I said that before that if a person who's earning $1,000 a month if he donates $100 he will get more AER than a person who earns a billion dollar and he donates only a million dollar because $1 million from a billion dollar is. 1% where $100 from $1,000 is 10% so the person who earns only $1,000 and donates $100 will get 100 times more Saab more blessings as compared to a person who earns a billion dollar and donates only a million dollar so Allah will look at the percentage of what you have that you donate not at the amount so let us make a commitment that we donate a percentage of our income income for the cause of Allah subhana tala and from this we allocate a share for the Palestinians number eight these first seven points that I mentioned each and every Muslim can do every common Muslim can do this and he should do this the least we can do for the cause of a Muslim brothers and sisters in Palestine the remaining points some can do a few can do a handful can do depending upon whom Allah has given capacity Point number eight is that all those who have contacts in the mainstream Media or influential or own mainstream Medias they should see to it that they condemn the atrocities done by the Israelis on parishin in the mainstream media for example because we have control over PE TV and alhamdulillah as you may be aware PE TV has a reach of 150 to 200 million viewers at this present time I'm sure tens of millions of people all the world will be watching this program they are watching on the Facebook on the YouTube and several million more are watching on the social media so we should see to it that whatever capacity Allah has given you see to it that this is publicized on the mainstream media Point number nine we should see to it that we have specialized organizations which are expert in the law so that we can file legal cases in the international court of law against Israel Point number 10 they should be diplomatic protests see to it that the Muslims protest on a diplomatic level to the authorities and if there are embassies or Consulate in the country see to it they give a letter to the Ambassador against the atrocities done by the Israeli government on the Palestinians number 11 if the Muslims can get together and we have a trade boycott with Israel a total trade boycott see to it that all the Muslims in the world not only individually do we boycott the goods all the Muslim countries today there are 57 Muslim majority countries in the world we have a trade boycott and should not in any way deal with any Goods o in any way whether diplomatic with Israel number 12 we should severe diplomatic relationship and alhamdulillah majority of the Muslim majority countries in the world they have already severed diplomatic relationship with Israel unfortunately there are some Muslim countries which are majority Muslim countries yet continue or have started having diplomatic relationship how can We join hands with the killers of the innocent Palestinians and killing innocent human being is the second major sin in Islam after shik the second major sin is killing innocent human beings and especially if it's a Muslim and a beloved Prophet mallam said the various Hadith that the life of a Believer is more sacred than the Caba and and imagine hundreds of Palestinian Muslims are being killed and what are we doing how can we join hands with the enemies they are not just Muslims they are Palestinian Muslims who are doing for on behalf of the Muslim umah how can we become friends with the killers of the Muslims in Palestine we should sever all diplomatic relationships and I would request all the 57 majority Muslim countries in the world pass such a law that anyone who supports Israel on ground in reality or on the social media should be imprisoned if not 10 years at least keep 5 years see to it that they're imprisoned make it a law I know many people are afraid that Israel is supported by superpowers we fail to realize that we have Allah with us Allah supports us and Allah subhah wa ta'ala is always with the Believers unfortunately unfortunately as the Hadith of the Prophet wasallam that a time will come where Muslims will be in large numbers like FR but they'll be powerless they'll be just like fro the numbers are large the 13th point that all the Muslims in the world we should unite all the countries in the world we should unite and as Allah says in the Glorious Quran in Al Imran chapter number three verse 103 Allah says hold strongly all together to the Rope of Allah that's the Glorious Quran and Hadith and be not divided we Muslim should be United the number one uniting factor for the Muslims is the Glorious Quran and the say today the scenario that we have another important point for all the Muslims in the world to unite irrespective whichever thought you belong to whichever School you belong to whichever country you belong to is the Palestinian cause because masj AA is important to each and every Muslim in the world irrespective whether they living in Saudi Arabia or Malaysia or India or Pakistan or turkey anywhere Masjid AA is very important to every Muslim if this cause of the Palestinian issue where they are being mercilessly killed in this war innocent Palestinians were killed civilians were targeted civilian buildings were targeted by jet planes by bombs and what is the world doing yes there has been a cry there has been an objection but I feel it should be much more and alhamdulillah you find that many countries are supporting but we'll only be effective if we unite together if all the Muslim countries if they unite and we unitedly stand for our innocent brothers and sisters in Palestine and we pray for them inshallah we will be more effective irrespective Allah subhana wa ta'ala is testing us he does not require you and me the raish that we are he alone is sufficient and Allah promises in the Quran that he will surely teach the zalim a lesson Allah also says in the Quran that he gives them rope to go to and fro he's just giving them time Allah doesn't require you and me but why don't we make hey while the sun is shining why don't we support like our beloved Prophet wasallam said that all the Muslims are like one body if something happens to one part all of it whole body is in fever so I request our Muslim brothers and sisters throughout the world that Implement on the few suggestions that I've given and see to it that we pray to Allah subhana tala and I pray to Allah subhana wa taala that may he keep our Palestinian Muslims safe may he give them sa may he give them Victory may he give the highest level of J fos to the Mars of Palestine and we'd like to thank from the bottom of the heart each and every Muslim I thank on behalf of Muslim umah the Palestinians for doing a for protecting the third holiest sight of the Muslims we thank you and we pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may he reward all the Palestinians inshallah with"
