  "title": "Before Muslims are Given Victory, They Are First Tested - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the first part of the question was why does Allah allow the Israeli forces the unjust Israeli forces to kill thousands of Palestinians because Allah is testing them why doesn't Allah give Victory to the Palestinians and Allah can give them very easily I said and we know in history that in the Battle of bad where the Muslims were hardly 3133 and the enemies were more than a thousand three times more yet they were victorious the enemies were more powerful they were more well equipped they have better horses they had better equipment for fighting yet because of support of Allah in the Battle of bad the Muslims they defeated the non-muslims even though they were three times in number we know if mentioned in the Quran and from history Prophet David peace be upon him very weak very small in terms of numbers but when he fought with gol who was more powerful more stronger much bigger more in number yet the victory was with those who are in the truth"
