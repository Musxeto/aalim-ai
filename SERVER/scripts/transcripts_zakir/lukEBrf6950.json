  "title": "Why Should Disabled Person who Cannot Fast Pay Ransom? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "next point if you like regarding the situation of a disabled person why is it a disabled person has to pay a ransom due to the fact they haven't fasted allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse 184 that if it is difficult for a person to fast he can either fast or pay a ransom that is feeding of an indigent person or a poor person the reason is that if a person is disabled or if he's sick permanently and there are no signs that he will become healthy where he can observe fast so the question of him compensating for the question for him to keep the fast later on doesn't arise at all so that's the reason for him there is a ransom that he has to pay something that is equivalent to feeding an indigene person or feed indigene person for every fast that he has missed dr zakir regarding elderly people which category of elderly people are exempt from fasting allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 2 verse 184 that if it is difficult for a person to fast he can either fast or he can give a ransom that is feeding of a poor person as far as those elderly people who exempt it are those people whose health is so weak that if they fast it will damage the health a person who's reached a very elderly age the age is not fixed whether it is 60 70 or 80 or 90 depending upon his health condition due to the old age if his health condition is bad which prevents him from fasting then is the time where he should feed one individual person and there's a hadith of our beloved partner say buhari number six hadith number 4505 where beloved prophet said that the old elderly men and women they need not fast but they have to feed one poor person for every fast they skip and similarly there are various hadith for example if you read darakutni 2 stroke 208 it says that if a person who has to give a ransom he has to feed a poor person one month of wheat one mother is equal to two hands outstretched full of wheat that's what we should feed there's another hadith which says in darkness two stroke 270 that annasmith pleased with him one year when he became very old and you could not fast so at the end of the month he called 30 poor people and he fed them with bread crumbs and meal a proper meal for 30 poor people so it means that for every fast you miss you should feed one poor person but coming back to the question that if the elderly person is a sound mind and not healthy that's the time he has to feed a person okay for instance but if a person is elderly and he becomes insane if he's not a sound mind then he doesn't have to fast he's exempted neither does he have to give any random neither he has to compensate because he is like a child as a beloved prophet said earlier which i mentioned that the pen has been lifted on three categories of people person who is a child reaches puberty so these people again become like children or they become like a person who's insane we say that the person has become senile when he reaches an age in which his mental stability is not there he need not fast neither does they have to compensate the fast later on neither has to pay any answer okay"
