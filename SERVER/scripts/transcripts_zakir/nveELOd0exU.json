  "title": "Why are Supplications Rejected? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "why is it that some people the often when you're speaking to people they say oh my door hasn't been answered you know this is a common statement by the Muslim brothers and sisters you meet around the place why is it that certain supplications perhaps are not answered there are certain criteria they required and many a time the supplication is rejected because point number one maybe the owning is huh what is eating Haram maybe the earnings they he is driving all his lifestyle maybe his business Aram may be involved in RIBA usury interest he may be dealing in a business which involves bribing may be dealing in a business which involves lying cheating etc all these things which are little Haram things that's the reason it one of the major reasons my supplication is not understood number two maybe he's operating someone else causing oppression 20 the human being number three he may not be enjoining what is good and may not be forbidding what is wrong which is a fart in Islam and there are some other criteria required for a supplication to be accepted and that is the reason why most of them are ejected one is that we should not say that oh Allah forgive me if you please oh Allah bless me if you please or or Allah grant me such strains if you please because a beloved prophet merciless Sun let me said it's mentioned in say Buhari one number nine in the book of tawheed Hadid number seven 477 where the Prophet said they do not supply gate do not pray by saying that oh Allah forgive me if you wish oh allah grant me mercy if you wish oh allah give me from your bounty if you wish because allah subhana wa ta'ala he does what He wills and you cannot command him so saying such things is totally wrong which many people do which is a big mistake that it is in supplication and understood furthermore people many a time they give names to Allah subhana WA Ta'ala which Allah never mentioned in the Quran neither the Prophet used any of the say Hadid to call Allah subhanAllah Louise attributes and names which are not given by lana vessel that is totally wrong by supplicating furthermore many people when they supplicate they add on many names and many things for example they say that please forgive my father my grandfather my great-grandfather my mother my grandmother my great-grandmother man kill man be keep on you know that because big list instead of that is preferable to be brief and say that please forgive my family or please forgive my relatives or my brothers and sisters in Islam that's sufficient and one of the other mistakes that people make is they normally supplicate very loudly you know Lord supplicate may Allah says in the Quran instead of Japanese 7 worse than 55 that ask to allah subhana wa ta'ala with humility and privacy unless in the next verse in surah Araf chapter 7 verse 56 that call to Allah with fear and longing nice so these are the basic mistakes that people make when they supplicate and furthermore many a time when we ask something from Allah subhana Allah we may follow all the things but yet a last man does not answer a prius unless is no quran in surah bakra chap number 2 verse number 216 that you may dislike a thing which may be good for you and you may like a thing which may not be good for you Allah knows and you do not know there may be a situation where a Muslim may pray to allah subhanaw taala that allah subhanaw taala give me a motorcycle a BMW i want a BMW Allah in CC and Allah does not honestly spear because Allah knows that if Allah gives them a BMW he may go fast he may have accident even fracture is like so allah subhana wa ta'ala but not answering his prayer is actually answering him so Allah subhana Allah is the knower of the unseen of the future so I'm a like a thing which may not be good for you Allah knows and you do not know"
