  "title": "How can we Unite Despite the False Scholars and Leaders Misguiding the Muslims? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum dear brother Zakir I Mahmud from Toronto Canada I am a postgraduate student of life science Muslims today are divided more than ever before and most of us are being misled by constant propaganda and false celebrities who distort Islam but POS as Muslim Scholars my question to you is how can we get United Muslim umah as envisioned by our Prophet Muhammad wasallam and another question is are we currently living in the same situation as the Jalia days before a prophet peace be upon Him came or are we comparatively in a better or a worse of times I would appreciate your valuable knowledgeable responses and guidance for the um the two question question number one is that we are being led by false propaganda and false information by celebrities and many people who pose as Muslim Scholars and the second question is that how can we have United umah envisioned by our beloved prophet wasallam and the third part of the question is that are we in the times of Jia before Prophet Muhammad are we better or are we worse as far as the first question is concerned that I do agree there is a lot of false propaganda there is a lot of PE there are many celebrities of and Muslim Scholars and Muslim um is divided coming to the question of Muslim Scholars of course that reminds me of the Hadith of the Beloved wasallam in which Imam bukari has mentioned in his book and albani has classified it as Hassan he said that now one of the sahabas says that now is the time where there are many fukah and few speakers there are very few beggars and there are many people who want to give charity but there will be a time when there will be very few fukas and many speakers there'll be a time where there'll be many beggars and few people who would give in charity and there are various other Hadith in which the prophet said that there'll be a time where people who will not have knowledge will start speaking about Islam and I do agree with you that you know at the time of the Prophet the sa da mainly one to one or when there was a talk people gather few people 10 20 30 40 rarely the lar Gathering like Etc and as time went on most of the knowledge was spent either by sh in the durus or giving talks in public directly one to one and even in my childhood when I was in school when I was in college I remember the days that we used to go to listen to talks of religious speakers or Scholars and at that time maybe in the '90s Etc in the late 80th we found that the videos became popular and besides hearing talks which became less we used to get Knowledge from the video cassettes or from audio cassettes of a books of Scholars so as time passed on besides one to1 dawa the print media Advanced the audio media the video media but in 2000s you know the social media came up internet came in the late '90s and social media Facebook I think 2006 and in the 2000 started in 2010 and now we are in 2024 and the social media has expanded so much in the last two decades in the last 20 years phenomenal and we find that any Tom Dick and Harry can address the full world on the social media there is no experience required he takes his mobile phone phone a smartphone records it and uploads it he may have few views he may have hundreds thousands or even million views but to address to the world has become very easy because of the social media the pros and cons there are Pros is that okay you can spread the dean faster the cons are that even the fash and the wrong thing spread faster and even those people who want to distort the religion or want to spread wrong things become easier so as far as the brother's question is concerned that now there is T is divided and you have many celebrities who pose as Muslim Scholars and I do agree with you that now because of the social media most of the people unfortunately that come on the social media they are more targeting how many viewership they get how many followers do they get how many subscribers do they rather than delivering the message and unfortunately this trend has even crept amongst the Muslim speakers I'm not talking about the non-muslim what they're doing wrong but even amongst the Muslim dies or the Muslim Islam speakers most of them I wouldn't say all are more bothered about how many views they gather on the videos how many subscribers they have how many followers they have on the social media and what's happening by this trend it's happening by the to the non-muslims also in this other social media but unfortunately even amongst the the Muslim speakers what's happening is that instead of the knowledgeable people guiding the society the society is guiding the knowledgeable people so those people who come they are more bothered on what the society likes so they tailor the talks according to society not according to what is required by Society so you know what when we consult the experts of social media they say okay if you want more views I mean you're Islamic speaker but you make a video on how to cook so when you start making a video how to cook biryani maybe you get a million views and what they're saying is a fact because you know people like to know things which are different not only talk talks so and you may find that the export on social media will tell you okay you play maybe with a cat you know the largest pet amongst Humanity's cat so if you play with a cat you get more views so unfortunately not all but many can say most of them are Guided by the society on what they want so they're changing their matter on what is wanted by Society rather than what is required by society and this trend is very dangerous and coming to your question of Muslim Scholars I would say that based on the Hadith that the fukah are very few according to me today the scholars are only handful Maybe maybe 100 or maybe a couple of hundred not more than that not like the previous days where there were many scholars you know every country had mashallah tens and hundreds of Scholars now in the full world if you have to name you hardly be be able to name 100 scholar leave aide more than that and that's the reason when someone asked me many years back on this ask Dr Zakir and I named a few of the scholars they were handful and never do I consider myself to be a scholar I consider myself to be a student of knowledge and I consider myself to be a Di and the role of the DI is that he should acquire Knowledge from the scholars and make it common to the masses acquire the knowledge from the scholars and make it palatable make it digestable make it acceptable for the umah or for the non-muslims so the roles of people like me who are dies we are not Scholars we we don't POS like Scholars and I don't consider myself to be a scholar I'm a student of knowledge and I consider myself to be D we have to read the books and hear the videos and read the articles of the scholars books of Quran andth and make it more compatible more palatable and more digestible for the audience so my role is to get the information from the scholars and make it more acceptable to the Masters coming to a second question that what should be done to to Envision the idea thought of prophet wasallam of one the only way we can do it is that we should stick to the Quran and sunah we should stick to Quran and sayth so if the full Muslim umah sticks to the Quran and say as Allah says in the Quran in Alan chapter number 3 verse Number 103 hold strongly to the Rope of Allah and be not divided the Rope of Allah is the Glorious Quran and the authentic Hadith of the Beloved Prophet so if the Muslim umah unites together and are not divided only on the basis of the Glorious Quran and on the say Hadi we will be one United um the only way we can be United is under the manner of the Glorious Quran and say and regarding the last part of the question question that are we now in the times of jalah before the prophet or are we better are we worse of course the time of the J before the prophet I would say worse than now we are better than that but we are detoria the time of the Prophet the time of the sahabas the practice of the Muslims of the sahabas you know after the prophets after the ambas the best generation was the generation of the sahabas the companions of the Prophet the Kash the sahas they were the best as the generation that keep on coming later and later we find that we are getting away and away from the de and now we are more than 1400 years away from the time of the prophet and of course the times have detoriated the going more down and down but yet I feel we are yet better than the jelia the days before the prophet and we pray to Allah subhana ta'ala that may he give us the wisdom the hikma and the courage and the patience that all the Muslim umah United you know the non-muslims they are so much against the Muslims there is no way that we Muslims can differ we should leave aside our small differences and unite together on the banner of Quran and say and see to it that when we deliver the speeches and talks on Islam see to it that the message you give gets a person closer to Allah and his rasool see to it that they get closer to Allah andol so that inshallah all of us we pray to Allah subhana wa tala that all of us all the Muslim umah we will enter J of f inshallah a mean"
