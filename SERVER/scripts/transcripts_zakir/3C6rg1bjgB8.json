  "transcript": "the next question relates really to the length of time the length that one should make the night prayer is there any indications from Quran Sunnah relating to the length there are various Hadi talking about it and the length can vary but the Sunnah of the Prophet was that he used to pray usually for long hours and the Hadith in say bukari volume number two in the book of tud Hadith number 1135 that says that I joined the prophet one night while he was offering the and it was so long that evil thought came to me so when he asked what was the evil thought he felt like sitting down and keeping the prophet standing that means it was so long there another Hadith in s Muslim Point number one in the book of Salah had number 1697 where it says that once a sahaba he prays the along with prophet wasallam and the prophet started reciting Surah bak and the sah says that when we finished about 100 verses he thought the prophet would bow down but the prophet continued and later on he thought that another after some verses he would bow down but he continued then he thought that okay maybe after Surah Bak ends the prophet would bow down but after Sur bakar ends he continues reciting he recites Sur n and that again is 176 verses and after that ends he recites Surah Al Imran and he continues leisurely that means Prophet used to pray for our imagine Surah Bak Surah Al Imran it is about all put together at least five J imagine only in that one ra Subhan so this was the length at many time but there's no fixed length a person can vary as much as the prophet always preferred praying longer further it's mentioned say had of Abu da number one in the book of Salah Hadith number 873 the Beloved Prophet one of the sahaba says that we need to pray he started the and he after heak then he went in the ru in the Bowing position and when he was in the Bowing position he stayed there as long as he was standing before then he got up he put his head straight and he was in the standing position till as much time as he was in the bo position then he goes in the suud and the Prophet was but naturally say that he said in the ru glory be to Allah and then in the he Allah glory be to Allah who the highest and he was in the suud position as long as he on the standing position and in between the two suud also he was as long as he was in the suud position saying that all these positions theu the standing after Ru the sujud and the sitting between the two sujud he used to take his own time and it used to be long that means was very long there's another Hadith in say Muslim volume number four Hadith number 6774 may be pleased with her she says that the prophet while offering the night prayer he used to stand for such long hours that his feet used to swell so his wife may Allah be pleased with her she says that all your past and the future sins have been forgiven so why do you ask for forgiveness so much why do you pray for so long so he said shouldn't I be thankful to Allah subhana wa tala so all the moreon he say should be thankful so the prophet normally used to pray for long hours so the longer you offer the the better it is"
