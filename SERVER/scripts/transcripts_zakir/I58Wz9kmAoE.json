  "title": "Is any Expiation Required for Breaking Voluntary Fasts? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "does a person have to offer experation for having sexual intercourse whilst he's uh doing a voluntary fast as far as voluntary fasts are concerned there is no experation if a person has sexual intercourse the kafara that is there is only when a sexual intercourse is done during a f fast during the fast of that's the time it's F there's a Hadith which is mentioned in AB da number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2450 which is n by may Allah pleas with her she says that the prophet gave water to drink during the conquest of Makkah water was brought to the Prophet The Prophet gives the water to drink she drinks the water and she says that I have broken my fast I was fasting so the prophet asked her what the fast for some atonement she says no so the prophet says then there's no problem if it's a voluntary fast then there's no problem so here we come to know that the sin is only there if you break a f fast because a voluntary fast it depends upon the person he can break the fast he can even eat when he wants and break the fast as we quoted Hadith earlier that one of the person calls a saaba to have food at his house and the saaba says that I'm fasting prophet say that he has made food for you he spent money so break your fast got a voluntary fast so voluntary fast can be broken there is no sin at all so in the same way if a person has sexual intercourse with his wife during a voluntary fast then it's not a sin because Wy fast and he need not make up for the fast he wants to make up he can make up but neither is anyar again there's a Hadith in sunai book of fasting Hadith number 2323 once the prophet gets up in the morning and he asks for food from his wife with her she say there's no food the prophet said then I'm fasting again for voluntary fast the N need not be made the night before it can even be made afterwards as long as the person did not have any food after Dawn So based on this there's no kafar if a person has sexual intercal during a fast which is voluntary"
