  "transcript": "well i am shashank sekhar from ranchi jharkhand i am doing my engineering from satyawha engineering college here sir your lecture after hearing a lecture our misbelief about islam and muslims vanish today sir i have been to jammu and kasmir and i've seen the trauma and pain that the people are suffering there because of the so-called jihad of some muslims sir my question is that does islam support such activities if no then what actually the word jihad means is it in accordance with the 56th verse of the seventh chapter of quran which says do not mischief or the 40th verse or 42nd chapter which says forgiveness is better than retaliation or the 32nd verse of the fifth chapter which states if anyone killed a person he kills the mankind sir i have one more question in the same context and it is that islam teaches to give priority to the religion that is dharma or majah before the country or motherland that is thanks a lot the brothers ask you very good questions the first question is regarding concept of jihad he says that why are people fighting into kashmir about jihad does islam encourage this fighting what is the meaning of jihad does it not disagree with the quotations he gave also reminded chapter 5 32 brother as far as the word jihad is concerned there is a misconception not only amongst the non-muslims but even among the muslims what most of the people think that any war fought by any muslim for any reason whether it be for its personal gain whether it be for politics whether it be for language whether it be for color it is called as jihad jihad does not mean any war fought by any muslim jihad comes from the arabic word jahada which means to strive which means to struggle so jihad basically means to strive to struggle and in the islamic context it means to strive against one's own evil inclination it also means to strive to make the society better it even includes to strive in the battlefield to fight in self-defense jihad also means to fight against operation and tyranny jihad basically means to strive or struggle many people are misconception that jihad means holy war and many people translate jihad as holy war the arabic word for holy boy is if you read the quran nowhere in the quran not a single verse know when the authentic hadith of muhammad sallallahu salaam is this word mentioned anywhere there is no harmony at all the translation of jihad is not holy at all this word holy war was first used by the historians to describe the crusades of the christian who spread christianity and who killed thousands of people in the name of christianity unfortunately today many people including so-called muslim scholars invited commerce they translate the holy war it's a mistranslation yes jihad means to strive to struggle one of the striving can include fighting fighting also should be in the way of allah subhanahu wa that is not regarding a question that why does islam encourage fighting and killing and there are many critics of islam who normally says islam is a ruthless religion it always says that we should kill the non-muslim wherever we find them many critics including the critic of india arun shuri and he writes in his book the world of fatwa he quotes surah by chapter number 9 verse number 5 and says that the quran says wherever you find a kafir into bracket hindu that you killed them and if you open the quran surah by chapter 9 verse number 5 and if you read it does say whether you find a coffin you kill but this is a quotation out of context for the context if you read the first few verses it speaks about a peace treaty between the mushriks of makkah and the muslims if you read surat chapter 9 first few verses it speaks about a peace treaty between the muslim and the mushrik of makkah now this peace treaty was unilaterally broken by the mushriks of makkah by the time allah subhanahu ta'ala reaches verse number five he gives them ultimatum to the mushriks and he tells them put things straight in four months time otherwise the declaration of war and in the battlefield allah says that when the enemies come to attack you you kill the enemies so this verse is revealed in the battlefield that when the enemies come to kill you don't get scared fight them but naturally any army general today to boost up the morale of his soldiers he will say that when the enemies come kill them he'll not say that just be quiet and arun shuri after quoting verse number five he jumps to verse number seven because verse number six has the reply surat torpa chapter nine verse number six says that if the kafir if the enemy seek asylum if they want peace don't just give it to them escort them to a place of security if the enemy wants peace or asylum escort them to place of security today the most merciful army general maximo will tell his soldiers that let the enemy go here allah says don't just let them go escort them to a place of security so whenever these verses are they of killing including the verse of surya and far chapter 8 verse number 16 when they say that prepare your steed and be prepared attack the enemy the next person but if the enemy is inclined towards peace you give it to them so almost all the verses we talk about fighting after that it says that if they want peace peace is better now regarding a question what about the verses of surah maidah chapter 5 verse 32 surah nisa chapter 4 verse 40 that if anyone kills any human being it says we have killed the whole of humanity this is the basic rule of islam that if anyone kills a human being whether it be a muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for creating mischief in the land spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone saves any human being it is as though he has saved the whole of humanity now if you read if you read bhagavad-gita bhagavad-gita chapter number two verse number 50. it says christian shri christian tells arjuna to do jihad strive if you read mahabharat mahabharat talks about thousands of verses of fighting thousands of verses many number of times more than what the quran speaks mahabharat in the scripture as you may be aware it talks about a feud a fight between the pandavas and the cowards the five brothers panders and hundred by the coward of fight and bhagavad-gita is a part of mahabharata 18 chapters in which christian lord he gives advice to arjuna arjuna says arjuna says in bhagavad-gita chapter number 1 verse 42-46 that i would prefer getting killed unarmed rather than fighting my cousins how can i fight my cousins the power of my cousins i would prefer getting killed unarmed rather than fight immediately lord christian you know what does he say in chapter number two verse number two and three says that how could such impure thought come in your mind it is sinful how could you become so important how could your heart become so weak so lord christian says such thoughts are important they are impure they are sinful it will prevent you from going to the heavenly planets going to jannah after that bhagavad-gita chapter number 2 verse number 31 33 says he says lord christian he says to arjuna that it is the duty of ashatriya to fight if he does not fight he shall not go to heaven and if you do not fight you are doing a sin so if you analyze in bhagavad-gita christian says that you have to fight imagine if i take verses of bhagavad-gita and say that lord christian tells arjuna that you have to kill your relatives if i quote out of context it will be devilish but in context it is lord christian says that if you have to fight against falsehood for the truth you can fight against anyone even if it be your relatives so now in context it makes sense that if you have to fight for justice even if it be against your relatives there's no problem so that is the message of bhagavad-gita and mahabharata fighting truth against falsehood the moment i tell a hindu about mahabharata bhagavad-gita he has the knowledge he says no but mahabharata bhagavad-gita is a fight between truth and falsehood that is the same thing was mentioned in the quran so movement according to your bhagavad-gita mahabharata you understand the quran better and further many people say oh this quran talking about jihadis if you do jihad if you die you go to jannah many critics including around surely quote and they quote even hadith volume number four in the book of jihad chapter number two hadith 46 it says that a mujahid is the person who strives in the way of allah and allah alone knows who strives and further the prophet said that if a mujahideen dies in the battlefield he shall go to jannah he'll get paradise but if he returns back if he does not die he will turn back with the booty of war this hadees and several verses of the quran are quoted by the critics of islam i wondered how could the hindu critics quote these things haven't they read the bhagavad gita haven't they read the mahabharat even shri krishna he mentioned bhagavad-gita chapter number 2 verse number 37 o arjun o son of kunti rise up and fight even if you're killed no problem you will go to heaven and if you return back successfully you will get the good riches of this earthly world same thing as the hadees so when christian says to arjuna that fight if you are killed no problem you will go to heaven if you return back successful you will get the riches of the world that is the same thing what say bukhari says what the quran says so therefore you should understand each other better by reading the scripture so islam allows fighting as a last resort in self-defense or to fight against operation otherwise know and jihad means to strive to struggle now coming to your second question which is more important which is more important following the rules of the country or following the mass of the deen it is you asking me who do i belong to first do i belong to my father or my mother first brother as far as following the rule of the country and for the rules of deen almighty god is concerned almighty god is our creator he is more superior to us following the rules of deen is more important for us than any other rule laid down by father mother or any country but but i am an indian i know there is not a single law in the indian constitution which prevents any muslim in india to follow islam in fact india is one of the few countries which is mentioned the constitution that it is the right it's the birthright of every citizen of india to preach practice his religion that's what i'm doing there is not a single law in india which prevents me from doing something which is first or compel me for doing something which is haram there is no law i can offer five times allah if i want if i don't want i can't offer there is not a single law in the indian constitution which prevents me from becoming a good muslim therefore as far as i'm concerned i am a very practicing muslim alhamdulillah and also practicing indian and is by definition by geographical definition an indian geographical is called hindu so if hindu means a geographical definition i am a hindu living in india and i'm a practicing muslim"
