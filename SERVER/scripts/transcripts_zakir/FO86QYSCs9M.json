  "transcript": "the next question from what's up is from faro khan from houston texas usa i'm a physician a medical doctor by profession a die from usa by the name i'm sorry i won't mention the name disagreed with your style of dhaba and said i quote from his video open inverted commerce in my humble opinion tawa is not primarily done by the tongue via intellectual arguments via solid logical rational debates it is not done that way i was impacted by didat zakir naik is somebody i consider to be a friend i was with him many many times but the brutal fact of the matter is that those tactics did not convert hundreds and thousands of people that's just the facts what it did was it reaffirmed our iman we loved more than those outside our faith do you agree with everything what he has said what is your reply at the outside i will i tell you that normally i do not take if someone has posed the question about some other die and if it requires a reply which may not agree or it may disagree as a policy i don't take the name of hadai that's the reason i did not say the name i just read the question i would rather discuss about the matter than the person taking names is there if it's discussing about fatwa about the great scholars then we may have to take the name because to know which scholar said what or which scholar you agree with which scholar disagree with that is that i'm taking your name is complexity but otherwise generally as a policy i don't take the names of people i don't criticize i don't disagree on public about issues with the normal duats or the normal scholars except if it's while talking about fatwa etc as far as the questioner from houston asked that one of the thai said that in my humble opinion dawa is not done by the tongue via intellectual arguments via solid logical rational debates this is not the way it is done this was the first part of a statement and to reply to this one verse of the quran is sufficient rather part of one verse of the quran is sufficient to reply to all this three arguments and it is a very common verse of dawah it is the worst i started my program this evening and allah says in the quran in surah and hell chapter number 16 verse number 125 invite all to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them and debate with them in the ways that are best and most gracious the three points mentioned by this brother of us and we are friends and he actually said that but he said that in my humble opinion da'wah is not done by the tongue via intellectual arguments via solid logical rational debates this verse of the quran includes all three it says invite all olu illa sabili rabbika balikma invite all people miss okay though you may not have to invite me speaking if is the opinion though we can't say that okay let's go ahead invite all to the way of the lord with visible and beautiful preaching has to be with speech your preaching is with speech it is with your tongue so allah is telling us in the quran which is one of the most common or important verses of dawah there are a few verses of dawah which are very important besides the one i mentioned for imran chapter 3 verse 64. even in surah chapter 16 verse number 125 it that means you have to speak so how can someone say that dawah is primarily not done by the time second point intellectual argument it says invite all to the way of thy lord with wisdom wisdom is intellectual and the third point that it's not done with solid logical rational debates and argue with them some of the translators they use the word debate and argue with them and debate with them in the ways that are best most gracious this part of one verse of the quran of surah and hell chapter 16 verse number 125 is sufficient to disagree with the statement who is saying this not zakir knight not anything not any scholar it is allah subhanahu wa ta'ala in his last and final revelation in the glorious quran is explicitly saying invite all to the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching with your tongue with hikmah and argue with them and debate with them in the ways that are best most gracious this was alone insufficient there are hundreds of ayah in the quran which can be quoted to disprove this point of this diet let's take one point at a time from all these three points the first point he said is dava in his humble opinion is not primarily done with the tongue allah says in the quran say to those who reject faith say to the non-muslims how do you say you have to say with your time allah says say he's allah and only when the christians when they came to the prophet in madina and they asked him that who is allah the prophet did not know where to start i mean the explanation is so big then the he was revealed absolutely this is the four line definition of allah given in the quran in surah a class chapter 112 verse number one to four which i call it as the touchstone for theology the litmus test for the study of god and our beloved prophet he said in hadith that surah a class is one third of the quran and what does allah say who is telling us muslims go and tell to who to those who don't believe that allah is one you won't tell the muslims the muslims already believe when we read a salah in the mosque and the imam is reciting he's telling us muslim that when you go out of the mosque tell to the non-muslims say tell that allah is one allah allah absolutely eternally he begets not know he's forgotten nothing like him allah is telling you to say then the response would have been asked say i seek refuge in the lord of mankind will always be say i seek refuge in the lord of the dawn focus in the quran the word kul say is mentioned no less than 332 times allah in the quran in the last time final revelation is which i don't disagree with can be done with actions it can be done with emotions but to say that dawah is primarily not done with the tongue it is against the teachings of the quran many places quran says so people of the book the other verse which i say is the mastery for dawah of the book no less than 332 times in the quran the word quran is mentioned so to say primarily dhawa is not done by the tongue i totally disagree allah also disagrees our beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned say buhari number four hadith number three four six one a beloved prophet said propagate even if you know one verse how do you propagate with your tongue you have to propagate with your tongue the zika video is with your tongue so our beloved prophet muslim saying even if you know one verse as long as you know correctly it's your duty to propagate it so primarily dhawa is done with the tongue there are other ways also but with the tongues primarily let's discuss the second point why are intellectual arguments that means our brother said it's not done with intellectual arguments the quran says in several places the men of understanding allah says in surah ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number 52 here is a message for mankind let them take warning there from let them know there is one god let the men of understanding take heed men of understanding several places in the quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 muslim 190. in surah yusuf chapter number 12 verse number 111 allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 39 verse number 21 says how not it is allah who sends on water from the sky and leaves it in the cracks in the ground and causes sown field of varying colors to grow this is a message for men of understanding allah repeats the message in surah for chapter number 40 verse number 54 that this is the guidance and message for men of understanding for and you are saying it is not intellectual arguments allah says in the quran in several places will they not then understand allah says chapter number 57 verse number 17 it is allah who gives life to the earth after it is dead we show you our signs will you not understand allah says will you not then understand this word will you not then understand is also mentioned in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 73 in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 242 in surah anam chapter number 6 verse number 151 in surah yusuf chapter number 12 verse number 2 it's also mentioned in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 61 will you not then understand allah says many places in the quran are falafel so that they understand several places in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 44 in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 76 in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 65 in surah anam chapter number 6 verse number 32 in surah yunus chapter number 10 verse number 16. in surah chapter number 11 verse number 51 in surah yusuf chapter number 12 muslim 109 in surah ambiya chapter number 21 in several places so that you understand quran repeats this message that this book the glorious quran is for the men of understanding will you not then understand so that you understand all these verses are nothing but intellectual arguments many a time when the quran mentions about the scientific facts in the quran it ends with saying this is for men of understanding so that you understand will you not then understand cerebral verses so how can you say that intellectual argument is not primarily the weighted dhawa the third point solid logical rational debates this verse of the glorious quran surah and hell chapter 16 verse 125 which is one of the important verses of dawah if you go a few verses behind it says that in prophet abraham was a beautiful example that means for dawah one of the beautiful examples is abraham islam and what did abraham and salam do when you read in the quran in surah alam chapter 6 verse number 75-79 ibrahim when he looks at the star he says this is my lord when it says he says i don't love which sets as the lord then when he sees the moon he says this is my lord when it sets he says that oh god you guide me otherwise i'll be misguided and when he looks at the sun he says this is the greatest this is my lord but when it says he says i will not associate any partners with allah what is all this these are intellectual arguments these are debates he's telling the people he's just giving examples not that he did not know he knew that the star is not god the son is not god the moon is not god he's trying to reason with them argue with them debate with them that do you consider that the star is the god the thing which sets the moon is a god the thing which sets the sun is the god which disappears which sets how can you associate partners with him and you know the story of ibrahimovic that he breaks the idol and leaves the biggest idol there and when they catch him and they ask him who broke the ideas he says you are this big idol he will reply then they say that how can the idea speak so he said that do you worship such a thing it doesn't speak what is this this argument these are debates so how can you say that logical reasoning and debates is not the way of dawah how can you say that and for these three points there are hundreds of verses in the quran and there are several hadith which can disprove this point that alhamdulillah the primary dawah has to be done by them allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 88 verse number 2122 for your job what is zikr you are not the manager of affairs allah is telling that o prophet you are not the one who is to give it that allah gives there your job is only true so dawah primarily has to be done with the tongue yes also action dhawa is also with the way you behave about your good nature about your honesty about your kindness of course even if somebody argues and says okay the actions are more important i'm not here to debate but to say that by tongue dawah is not done primarily it's totally wrong they can be one or two primary things according to me it's the most important no one can ever disagree that dawah should not be done by tongue it's the first time i'm hearing this and someone is saying that and of course the quran has various verses addressing the intellectuals and especially in this age and i have said in many of my lectures that quran is the word of allah and it proved itself to be the word of allah in different ages previously was the age of miracles and alhamdulillah the glorious quran is the miracle of miracles when the quran was revealed it was the age of literature and poetry and alhamdulillah muslim and non-muslim arabic scholars alike they agree that quran is the best arabic literature available on the face of the earth today is the age of science and technology so in today's age intellectual reasoning argument is one of the primary ways to dhawa and what is the difference between islam and other religions if you read the other scriptures they are illogical the reason that people accept islam is because of logic if not all i would say a large number and further our brother says that i was impacted by sheikh nida zakir naik i consider to be my friend and i am his friend i met many many times and i have met him many times but the brutal fact is that those tactics do not convert hundreds and thousands of people to say this that these tactics do not convert hundreds and thousands of people is totally wrong because i'm not going to speak about myself i only pray allah that even if one person except islam via muhammad efforts i would thank allah let's talk about sheikh ahmed sheikh ahmadi dad i went to meet him in south africa in durban the first time when i went to south africa was in 1988 and there when i met his son at that time i asked him that how many people have accepted islam because of the efforts of sheikh ahmadine and his son yusuf did that and unfortunately last year he was assassinated melania grantham janma too he said that only because of his father he has record of more than ten thousand people who have accepted islam ten thousand not hundreds not thousands ten thousand and i am giving shah that i personally have met and seen more than two hundred people who have accepted islam only because of shaykh i've met people in america i've met people in europe i've met people in india whenever i travel throughout the world when i meet people they say one of the major reasons i've accepted islam is after hearing the lectures and debates of sheikh hamad i can give shahadah personally more than 200 people directly i know who have accepted islam because of shaykh so how can you say that these tactics do not convert hundreds and thousands of people how can you say that i'm sure the brother may not be aware of shaytan i was very close to shaykh that i stayed with him for several days i've been to durban i've been to berlin there will be very few people among who may be knowing sheikh did that more closer than me i've studied his lectures i've met him i've questioned him so many times i stayed with him for days together i stayed with the family with the son alhamdulillah even today the way sheikh dida speaks according to me he is one of the best orators among the guys that i know and last session last saturday i spoke about dr israel who is another guy who i feel amongst those who speaking dies he is one of the most powerful and most effective urdu speaking die in terms of auditory skills in terms of english duats i don't know of anyone in this present age in the last 100 years that are north who is a better speaker than sheikh didat in oratory powers he can mesmerize people alhamdulillah even now today when i hear his speech alhamdulillah it's difficult to put off the video it is my speech more than ten thousand that was in 88 and he continued the hour for another eight years you may be aware that he got a stroke in 1996 so for another eight years he continued tawa and then he was bedridden he had a stroke for more than nine and a half years on the bed and he continued grant him janitor so to say that these tactics do not convert hundreds and thousands of people can be possible that this die he was not able to convert because of logic and reason so that's his reasoning but you can't say general he should have said that when i spoke with the reason logic no one accepted islam a few people except islam i've got no problem but to say in general taking the name of sheikh didat and saying these tactics don't convert hundreds of thousands it's totally wrong and you can see the videos and even today we do mashaallah conferences large gatherings and large number of people at one one time 10 people 15 people except islam in one one lecture 20 25 only if you count you'll have hundreds on the video and this is only a tip of an iceberg of course when we talk on a personal level more people accept islam in the public level it's more difficult so what you see in public it's the tip of an iceberg i know today dies masha'allah because of his efforts allah subhanahu wa allah has given hidayah to tens of thousands of course it is allah who gives no human being not even the prophet can convert a person or revert a person it is only allah who gives a diary but the zarya is there it is true some people so these die like sheikh ahmed has reverted tens of thousands of people so how can you make the statement if you would have said that i tried logically people didn't accept i've got no argument but to take the name of sheikh dida and then these texts don't convert it's totally wrong furthermore he said that it reaffirmed our faith i agree with him totally it is we who loves more than the non-muslims agree with him of course the muslims loved haiti that more than the non-muslims of course the number of people that came for his talks more were muslims alhamdulillah but to say non-muslims did not come as totally wrong there were hundreds of non-muslims who came for his talks today masha'allah when we give lectures in india when there is a gathering of 100 000 people 200 000 people on average 20 of the people attending the live lecture of mine they are non-muslims so imagine if there's a gathering of hundred thousand people twenty thousand are non-muslims twenty thousand i don't know of any english speaking thai maybe one or two who can get twenty thousand muslims livers are non-muslims so how can you say it does not attract the non-muslims how can you say that when there's a gathering of a million people even if 10 percent are there the hundred thousand are non-muslims on the youtube the subscribers about 2.4 million our survey says that 20 of the people who are subscribers and watch my videos on the youtube they're not muslims on the facebook the following on the facebook of mine mashallah is 22.7 million and according to our survey approximately 20 percent are non-muslims 20 of 22.7 million it is more than four and a half million i don't know of any english speak in thai except one that is dr bilal phillips who has more than four and a half million followers on his facebook so how can you say that non-muslims don't see these tactics or don't hear on comparative religion don't be on reason and logic and i believe that most of the non-muslims that are watching are because of reasonable logic how can you say yes what you can say that most of the dice cannot logically convince a non-muslim okay i agree with that but to take the name of sheikh and then say these techniques don't work it's totally wrong and if you see on peace tv mashallah peace tv network have got 200 million viewers even if you count 10 percent unknown muslims it's more than that it will be 20 million so i believe what the brother should have done he should have asked people who are in the field and ask them directly if you are asking that and asked him did a hundred people accept islam because of you that will not say that how many people accept to ask the son go and ask in his office there are records kept what has happened i believe that nowadays there are many duats in the western world who speak about science who speak about logic but a time comes when they cannot convince the non-muslim logically when they cannot convince a person logically then they say dawah should not be done with science dawah should not be done with logic i'm not talking about this i'm talking generally there are many western thais they speak about science for many years when they cannot prove a point then this is our should not be done with science what you should do we should follow the verse of the quran of surah and hell chapter 16 verse number 43 which says fast if you don't know ask the person who knows the same message repeated in surah ambiya chapter number 21 verse number seven that if you don't know either person knowledgeable instead of going and saying science should not be used for dawah logic reason should not be used for dhawa they should speak with those people who are successful while speaking with logic and reason alhamdulillah masha'allah i have spoken to tens and thousands of non-muslims millions masha'allah so why the satellite via the facebook via the youtube the numbers are huge that's the reason if you see on my facebook my likes are 18.4 million but the followers are 22.7 billion normally the likes and follows are somewhat similar here the followers are masha'allah 4.3 million more why because many of the non-muslims who follow they don't like they like after they accept islam this is one of the reasons that the difference between in my facebook my followers and my likes my followers are 4.3 million more than my likes there are many non-muslims also like me and what happens when you are effective there are bound to be reactions and the same brother of ours he goes there and he says that not only was it not effective it even puts off many a time people it's not mentioned the question but when you hear it stop it puts off when you do dawah everyone cannot agree your dawah should put off some people otherwise it's not effective dawah namely one messenger of allah who did not have enemies who did not have people who disagreed with them when prophet muhammad most of the people disagreed with him he had very few followers then he had five then he had 40 and alhamdulillah towards the end of his messengership before he expired majority masha'allah people that were around him accepted islam but if you see the life history of the other messengers majority refused him so this is not the criteria that if most of the people don't agree with you then your dhawa is wrong if most of the people are put off your dhawa is wrong when nua salaam gave the message of allah most of the people were put off when abraham al-salam gave the message most of the people were put off how many people agree with nuala salaam his family member didn't agree a handful that doesn't mean is wrong if you read the quran majority of the people rejected him they didn't believe in him they were put off a handful people agreed with him that doesn't mean he's wrong when you read the story of jonah in the quran salaam majority people rejected him so this is not the criteria that if people are put off dhawa is wrong it's not the criteria allah says very clearly in the quran in surah rasha chapter number 88 verse number 21-22 your job is to deliver the message with your tongue zika how do you do thicker with actions you do thicker with your tongue so the basic role of the messengers of allah is to do zika with the tongue the basic role of the dae is is to do dawah with the tongue of course you have to die even with actions with your nature with your honesty of course but primarily it is with your tongue so i believe that these views that are coming is because once a person is logical you should always remember logic is not number one always number one is allah is the glorious quran number one then comes the authentic hadith then you bring the other things now people who are logical they put logic number one and then they crash because you may not know everything i may not know everything because they put logic above everything and when they cannot prove they have a downfall then they say logic is not required science is not required alhamdulillah i feel science is one of the best tools today to dawah and alhamdulillah no one has been able to prove me wrong i have had discussions with top intellectuals with thousands tens of thousands of non-muslims listen to me alhamdulillah so what i believe that if there is something in which you are not effective as the person who is effective you can't make a blanket statement that these tactics don't convert hundreds and thousands of people alhamdulillah it has converted tens and hundreds of thousands of people alhamdulillah and i pray to allah that may he give genetics to because of whom we were mashallah inspired and i do agree with the last statement of this brother of us that we muslims love sheikh that more of course we love him more it boosts up a moral i find a debate is concerned what my view is that at the time of sheikh ahmed there were christian missionaries who were taking out false in the quran that quran has got mistakes there are contradictions in the quran and they were happening and there was no muslim who could deploy and alhamdulillah that came at that time i'm talking about the 80s when we were kids when we were in the schools when we went to colleges 40 years back at that time i believe debate was one of the important factors of dawah now the strategies have changed of the christian missionaries that time the strategy was they got mistakes in the quran and quran is not the word of god there are scientific errors there are contradictions someone should reply they're using our quran to prove their point and shaydee that mashallah he gave it to us on a platter now the strategies of the christian missionaries have changed so today i don't think so that debate is one of the important factors yes one to one yes it is but there is difference between individual debates and public debates public debates i do agree today may not be one of the important factors of dawah public debates individual limited yes it is yet that's the reason if you know i have had hundreds of debates one to one privately but publicly very few i don't think so more than 20 maybe nine nine available on video at the time of shayta that public debate was important factor the last debate that i had was with sri sri ravi shankar and after that i said anyone who has a large following i would not mind debating not with people who are small so let's not make people who are unknown famous so my criteria has changed that unless you can get 20 000 people individually for your talk i will not debate and since 2006 since the last 15 years no one has come forward today the times have changed but individual argument is a must individual debating one to one is a requirement but public debate i do agree it boosts up the morale and it may have negative repercussions also but that doesn't mean it is wrong as long as you do not break any of the rules of the sharia as long as you do not break any of the rule of the quran they say hadith you can very well debate but debating is not everyone's cup of tea today if you ask me how many people get debate the best debater that i know of was that in this time i'm not from the olden times i shake it they were great but today if you ask me who is a good debater i'll have to scratch my head to think who's a good debater debating is a different technique altogether a person may be knowledgeable but debating is the different ball game all together and i do not suggest normal duas to have a debate i always discourage them to have debates in public because if you are not well versed in the technique of debating you will cause more loss than good sheikh hamad mashaallah he knew the knack of debating so today if you ask me among the english dua who is a good debater i'll have to scratch my head and i doubt whether i can name a couple also one is look average but i'm talking about good anyway coming close to sheikh ahmed or even half of sheikh m that or even twenty five percent of shakespeare so that's a different technique altogether it's a different speciality who allah has alhamdulillah given to sheikh ahmad but not to a normal die so i agree with that part that a normal guy he should not do public debate because he is not well versed with it there were many people who debated during the time of jesus but they were not defective because they didn't have the knack of debating otherwise alhamdulillah primarily dawa should be done with the tongue it should be done with intellectual arguments it should be done with rational with reasoning it should be one-to-one debate no problem so that you can prove your point and you can follow the guidance given by allah in the quran"
