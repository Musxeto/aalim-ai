  "transcript": "the next question is from brother rizwan from west bengal india which is the most important and effective method of giving dawah there are various different ways and strategies of doing dawah some are less effective while some are more effective the most common method used by muslims while doing dawah to non-muslims is that whenever they meet a non-muslim they speak hundred good things about islam even if that non-muslim agrees with those hundred good things we have mentioned regarding islam yet at the back of his mind he will think ah you are the same muslim who is a terrorist ah you are the same muslim who is a fundamentalist you are the same muslim who marries more than one woman you are the same muslim who subjugates the woman by keeping up behind the wheel these few negative factors at the back of his mind will prevent him from accepting the beauty of islam whenever i meet a non-muslim the first question i ask him i ask him up front that with your limited knowledge whether you're right or wrong what do you feel is wrong with islam and i make him comfortable you can criticize islam you can attack islam you can speak against no problem you only tell me what do you feel is wrong with islam and after making him comfortable he poses about three or four questions and invariably these three or four questions fall amongst the 20 most common questions asked by non-muslims regarding islam if every muslim memorizes and knows the reply to these 20 most common questions asked by non-muslims quoting from quran and say hadith quoting from the scriptures of the non-muslims the bible the vedas giving answer with reason and logic giving answer on the basis of science inshallah even if we cannot convert the non-muslims he can at least neutralize the animosity which they have the logic is when the cup is full when you pour it will overflow so first empty the cup whatever misconceptions the non-muslims have regarding islam you first remove it then even if you speak a few good points about islam he will accept it these 20 common questions how do they arise in the minds of the non-muslim depending on how the media portrays islam and the misconceptions they spread these 20 common questions keep on changing the 20 common question we have today 10 years back they were different few decades earlier they were different depending upon how the media portrays islam these 20 common questions keep on changing and these 20 common questions are the same throughout the world whether they go to america uk singapore saudi arabia dubai whichever part of the world you go to india these 20 common questions are the same there may be an additional two or three questions based on the society and the customs of that particular country maybe if you go to western country where interest is more common they may ask why is interest private in islam but the remaining 20 common questions are the same so it's preferable to learn the answers of the 20 most common questions than to learn answers of 100 uncommon questions so number one is you memorize the replies that are good and i've written a book on this once the common question is by non-muslims or muslims of islam and it's translated to various languages of the world and you memorize it it's one of the best ways to do dhawa one of the most important criteria for dawah is given in the glorious quran in surah al-imran the chapter number three verse number 64 where allah says of the book that we erect not among ourselves lords and people other than allah find of allah and if they turn back at this moon that we are muslims bowing away to allah so one of the best criteria of doing dawah is come to common terms as prince and you coming to common terms with the non-muslim is one of the best criteria and amongst the common term the most important term is that we worship them that we associate no partner with him that means when you are doing dawah the most important point of dawah is tahit removing shirt from the life of the non-muslim while starting dawa you can start dawa with quran and science you can start dawa with literature depending upon which subject the person is interested in no problem but your main aim should be you have to convince him about tahiti about one allah worshipping him alone and no one else and remove the shirk in his life this is the most important if you cannot do this your dhawa is useless you may convince a non-muslim not to have alcohol you may convince them not to have spoke you may convince them not to gamble but if you do not remove the shirik from his life you do not remove the idol worship from his life you do not get him to tahit oneness of allah but the others use this that's the reason for adai his main goal should be convincing about taheed the oneness of allah then number two is about the last and final messenger prophet muhammad these two are the most important criteria for dawah all the other aspects are secondary you can start with other things in which the non-muslim is interested but these two are the most important then we'll come ahra then become salah so on and so forth while coming to common terms it's important that if you read the scriptures of the non-muslims you will be in a better position to talk about tahit mentioned in the scriptures and i've given the talk on concept of god in major world religions and i proved from the bible from the vedas from the scriptures of christians jews hindus parties about oneness of allah i have given a talk on muhammad sallallahu salman the various worldly scriptures and from the scriptures of the christians jews hindus from the scriptures of the parties have proved the coming of the last and final messenger prophet muhammad so if you're doing dawah and if you read the scripture this is one of the criteria i mentioned in the quran it becomes easier the other important verse of the quran for technique of dawah is surah chapter number 16 verse number 125 he says invite all the way of their lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best and most gracious hear allah saying that invite all invite the non-muslims to the teachings of islam to allah with hikmah and husna when into dhawa you have to do dawah with hikmah and husna with reason with wisdom and beautiful preaching but many people think that wisdom always means being soft yes most of the time we have to be soft but at times you have to be tough if you read this roku the few verses before surahnel chapter 16 verse 125 it says that in prophet abraham is a beautiful example peace be upon him and what prophet abraham did he broke the idols so that was him at that time so depending upon the situation hikmah doesn't mean always being soft most of the time yes being soft but sometimes they have to be tough and all these strategies you can hear in my talk i've given for more information you can go to my website zachinlike.com there's a separate section international training program which gives you various strategies etc and will give you a training how to become a guy hope that answers the question"
