  "transcript": "common errors from sections one and two the most Grievous amongst the errors in the first category that is errors committed regarding the obligatory rules and regulation of fasting is the most common is that Muslims many a times they don't do the near for fasting intention is very important without Nia without intention the fasting is not accepted so making intention is obligatory and we'll be discussing this inshallah in detail inshallah tomorrow the second error is that many a times Muslims even after the Fajr Azan has started yet they continue eating and they think that the end of suhur time is only at the end of the Fajr Aza in fact the moment the Fajr Adan starts the moment the beginning of dawn starts the Soul Time ends so this is error which normally nullifies or invalidates the first the third error in the first category is that many people they delay paying their zakatul Federal and many times they pay after the Salah if we pay the zakatul feather after you do feather then it is like normal charity it does not come under this so these three are the most Grievous in the first category the common errors committed in the second category that is errors that are contradicting the Sunnah of the fasting is number one many people they skip this over some people they have an early suhar that is they have this over one or two hours before the Fajr time in fact sohur is a blessing every Muslim should have it and the prophet said we should delay The Sur as much as possible we will have it till just before the first time the third mistake committed by Muslims in this category is that they delay opening their fast they delay devtar and a prophet Muslim said that the people will be good as long as they hasten in breaking the iftar that means immediately after Sunset they should break devtar the fourth common error in this category is that many Muslims they read an authentic Dua the most authentic Dua as far as iftar is concerned is Zama inshallah which means that my thirst is quenched the veins are moistened and the other is near inshallah God willing the reward is near God willing and some people when they read this Dua for breaking the fast they say it before breaking the fast before they put their date in the mouth they say this and it's contrary to the meaning the meaning says that my thirst has been quenched zahabazama my toast has been quenched and the veins have been moistened your thirst cannot be quenched before breaking the fire so normally it should be said after you eat the khajur after your water and you're satisfied maybe after some minutes after you break the fast then you can eat this Dua zahabazama inshallah which means my thirst had been quenched the veins have been moistened the reward is new inshallah God willing the sixth common error made by Muslims in this category is that many Muslims they eat excessively during iftar and many of them even eat throughout the night the seventh common error is that many of them they are negligent as far as concerned because they think it is no problem if a Muslim misses tarawi is missing a great deal of reward and many Muslims who perform tarawi they read taravi very fast 10 miles per hour they try and finish it in a short time and they defeat the purpose in fact you should read with the moderate base so that people understand and they grasp the message of Allah the ninth common error is that those who go for ethical and the mosque many of them they are socialized during it as though it's a time to meet people and friends which is totally contrary to the Sunnah the 10th common error is that many of the Muslims think that the letter Qatar is on the 27th night of Ramadan and the only worship Allah on this night inside in the odd nights of the last 10 days the last ashra the 10 days therefore can fall either on the 21st night or 23rd or 25th or 27th or 29th so this is one of the common errors made by Muslims is that they spend their time doing Ramadan in unproductive work rather than spending in zikr and worshiping Allah they spend the time rather for offering besides the compulsory Salah an awful the voluntary Salah the 12th error made by the Muslims is that this the 13th is they should ask for forgiveness this month of forgiveness 14th is they should read the Quran as much as possible to get the rest of Allah the 15th is that they fast and they keep themselves hungry but basically they're not mentally prepared for that fast and it is as though they are staying hungry but the main purpose of fasting is not obtained this was in brief regarding the second category"
