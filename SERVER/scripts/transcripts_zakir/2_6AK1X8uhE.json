  "transcript": "my name is I'm from Bangalore India I work as an operations manager I have a young daughter whom I want to admit into an Islamic school the Islamic school is very far from my home we have a convent school right beside our home my wife argues that we put her in the convent school as it is closed to home she cites reasons such as it is unsafe to send a girl child far nowadays but I want to put her in an Islamic school so that she can stay away from shik have an Islamic environment and at the same time gain worldly progress I do not mind risking her sending far away I faith in Allah subhana wa ta'ala that he will protect her if I strive in his way how do I convince my wife brother um has asked good question that he wants to send his young child the young daughter to an Islamic school but the wife is insisting that since the Islamic school is very far better put in a school which is closed by even though it's Convent because it's not safe to put the child in a school Which is far away basically let me tell you that Bangalore is a safe City Bangalore is not like Manhattan of New York or bronx or you know the safe City I've been to Bangalore many times I have many friends so if your child is going to school she's going to go at daytime so I don't think so it is unsafe to send your daughter to a school Which is far away it may be half an hour it may be 1 hour see to it that you arrange a proper Transportation whether it be a school bus whether it be a proper vehicle which is secure I don't think so it is risky but what you have to realize that I do agree with om your husband because he is striving for the AK imagine if you're putting your daughter in a convent school and she starts believing that Jesus is God or she starts worshiping Jesus Christ be be upon him will you be able to forgive yourself you know many a time people give the excuse that the school is far therefore I'm not sending maybe they more impressed by the standard of the convent school as compared to Islamic schools but I'm aware that alhamdulillah in Bangalore there are many Islamic schools you have a lot of options you can surely choose the school you feel has a better standard which is more close to Quran and Sunnah and even if hypothetically if the standard is less than the conent school which is close to your house it is preferable and safer to put your child whether your daughter or a son in Islamic school rather than a convent school because there are high chances that your child may go away far from your Dean so I do agree with Omar that and I completely support him and I would like to remind the sister that please don't be so much relaxed and not at all worried about putting your child in a convent school there are high dangers that they may go far away from the dean it is more dangerous than the danger you're thinking that's unsafe for a girl to travel because if she goes far away from the de that is multiple times more dangerous more harmful more un Islamic than talking about the safety of your child so please I request sister that see to it that and Allah is there to protect you if you and I do agree with the statement of om that if he's striving in the way of Allah subhana wa ta'ala surely Allah will protect and Bangalore is a safe City how many cases have you heard that young girls going in Bangalore to school withar they have got problem hardly any cases so and even if it's far and if it's tiring Allah will support you you'll get a better a and one more thing it's good for you also because the Beloved Prophet wasallam said that when a person dies only three things continue as one is the wealth that you have spend in his way one is the knowledge that you spread about him about the dean and the third is pious children praying for you so if your child is pious and prays for you you will benefit if your child is not Pi then it will get no benefit for you in the so it will not only benefit the child it will benefit you also if you put in a good authentic Islamic school hope that answer the question"
