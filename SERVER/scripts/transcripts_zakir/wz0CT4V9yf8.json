  "transcript": "to an effort to prove in an effort to prove the Quran is so heavily agreeable to modern science what happens if modern science is wrong does the Quran always change to reflect the changes in France that's a very good question it's a very important question and we Muslims should be very careful while bringing compatible with the Quran modern science therefore I said in the beginning of my talk I will only be speaking about those scientific facts which have been established and a scientific fact which has been established for example the Earth is spherical it can never go wrong established science can never take U turns but unestablished signs like hypothesis and theories can take you turns I know Muslim Scholars who have tried to prove David Theory from the Quran nonsense so therefore we should not go overboard and try and prove everything of modern science we have to be careful to check up whether it's established or unestablished if it's established alhamdulillah with scientific proof the Quran will never go against it if its hypothesis it may be right it may be wrong like Big Bang Theory it was hypothesis early earlier it was a hypothesis today after solid proof about the celestial matter according to Stephen Hawkins Etc it's a fact so Big Bang Theory today is a fact yesterday it was a hypothesis once it becomes the fact I use it you know that hypothesis is saying that human beings have been created from a single pair of genes Adam and Eve I don't use it because science has established it goes along with the Quran it goes along with the Quran that we have been evolved from one pair Adam and Eve peace be upon them but I don't use it because that is not an established fact so therefore while bringing a correlation between Quran and science Etc see to it that you use only those scientific facts which have been established and not hypothesis because Quran is far superior to modern science I'm not trying to prove the Quran to be the word of God with the help of science no not at all what I'm trying to do for us Muslims Quran is the ultimate criteria for the atheist and for the non-muslims may be science may be the ultimate criteria what I'm doing I'm using the criteria the yardstick of the atheist and comparing with the Aztec of the Muslim the Quran I am not trying to prove the Quran to be the word of God with help of science what I'm trying to do when I'm being a compatibility and I show the superiority of Quran that what your son says told us yesterday Quran has told us 14 years ago I am trying to prove that our yashtik the Muslim yashtek the Quran is far superior to your yashtik the science therefore you should believe in Quran Which is far superior hope to answer the question"
