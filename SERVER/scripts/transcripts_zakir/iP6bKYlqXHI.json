  "transcript": "the next question if islam is the best religion then why christians are more in number than us from dhaka bangladesh without the question of islam is the best religion then why are christians point number one those who are in the maximum number those who are majority are not always right this is the wrong concept that those who are majority are always right and that which is the nine numbers i can give you several examples if you ask someone which is the best car available in the world some may say rolls royce some may say bentley but you know that the number of rollers in the world are very few the number of bentley are very few the number of maybach are very few the largest company of car that is sold is toyota and toyota is not the best it may be it may not be for knowing what is the best you have to analyze the specifications if you want to know which is the best car you have to know what is average of the car what is the safety measures what is the look of the car what is it made of what is the pickup what is the horsepower all these things then you can decide not just who's using it maximum and even a person using auto will agree that roosevelt is better but he would not want to spend that much money he may not have the money or he may not want to spend the money he may have the money let me tell you i do agree with you people who fill the census form today in the world maximum aggression they are close to two and a half 2.75 billion and muslims are about more than two billion in the world so i do agree with you but the people who practice religion number one is islam out of the two billion people majority practices now at least the main pillars alhamdulillah maybe 75 percent may be closed but in christianity there is a small minor percentage maybe five percent ten percent who may be following the religion they may fill the form how many people go to church how many people attend the services in the church if you ask them most of the christians don't believe also jesus is god most of the people don't believe in the teachings of the bible but yet they fill the form and they say they're christian because i have to mention religion so as far as following the religion is concerned today in the world the maximum religion that is followed is islam and the muslims surely more than a billion but those people who claim are christian then according to survey insha and the next maybe 50 years islam will also overtake christianity even in numbers in filling of census form so the number which is maximum is not the best the best is that which you have to see the criteria so if you compare the quran and if you compare the bible there is no doubt at all that if you compare it with the test of science or with logic or with reason surely quran will pass the test and the other scriptures of other religions will fail the test so if you see which religion is practiced most in the world it is islam and alhamdulillah islam is the best religion and allah clearly says in surah al-imran chapter 3 verse number 19 in nadine in the islam the only reason acceptable in the sight of allah is islam"
