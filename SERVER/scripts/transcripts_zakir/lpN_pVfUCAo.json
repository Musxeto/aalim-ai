  "transcript": "Whenever you follow the commandments of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala, it is called as ibada. It is called as worshiping Allah subhanana wa ta'ala. And the most important is the believing there is no god but Allah. And the most important form of worship is salah. Then we have zakat the compulsory charity. 2.5% of excess wealth every lunar year more than inab level you have to give in charity then fasting in the month of Ramadan the full month from dawn till sunset abstain from food water drink and sex then hajj if you have the means if you have the health and the wealth at least you should perform once in your lifetime Hajj that is the holy pilgrimage to the city of Makkah Mina Arafad etc. These are the main pillars of Islam. But anything what Allah says if you follow it you're doing ibada. If you abstain from the thing he has prohibited you're doing ibada. Allah says not to have alcohol and intoxicants in Surah Maida 5:9. If you abstain from having intoxicants, you're doing ibada. Allah tells us not to cheat, not to lie. If you do not cheat, if you do not lie, you're doing ibada. So whatever Allah has prohibited and if you abstain from that, it's called as ibada. And if we analyze that every machine it has instruction manual. Whenever you buy a machine with the machine comes an instruction manual. If you buy a DVD player you'll get instruction manual that if you want to play insert the DVD press the play button. If you want to forward press the FA button. Don't drop it from height. It will get damaged. Don't immerse it in water. it will get spoiled and more complicated the machine but the more the requirement of instruction manual. If you allow me to call the human being the machine, you'll have to agree that human beings are the most complicated machine available on the face of the earth. Don't you think it requires an instruction manual? The instruction manual for the human beings is the glorious Quran. The glorious Quran. The last and final revelation of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala to the whole of humankind is the instruction manual of the human beings. The dos and don'ts of the human beings are mentioned in the glorious Quran. And there are many people who may say that why does Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala want us to praise him? Is he hungry for praises? You know, we say Allah abbar, alhamdulillah, why does Allah want us to praise him? Do you think if we say Allah abbar, Allah will become greater? We know Allah is already the greatest. Whether you say Allah abbar or don't say Allah abbar, he is already the greatest. It will not make a difference to him at all. So why does Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala wants us to praise him? because he is the creator of the human beings and he knows how does the human mind function. He knows that the human beings when we pray someone we follow him and we obedient to him. For example, if your mother has a heart attack and you and you know there is a very famous heart specialist and you have one person lay man on the street. If your mother has a heart attack, whose advice will you take? Will you take the advice of the heart specialist who's the most famous in the world or will you take advice of a lay man on the street? But naturally, you will follow the advice of a heart specialist. He's famous. We know that he's number one in the world. So similarly when we praise and say Allah abar Allah is the greatest Allah is the most wise Allah is the most knowledgeable we are telling this so that when we agree he's the most knowledgeable most greatest we follow his advice so Allah is asking us to praise him for our benefit not for his benefit"
