  "transcript": "next question posed by Ginza safe from Lahore Pakistan I am an electrical engineer I want to say that you are my favorite human being on this earth I am a huge fan of yours may Allah grant me the Eman you possess I mean and may Allah give you the reward for your hard work in this path I mean may you live a very beautiful and long life I mean many easily I mean we meet you a lot the Muslim Ummah needs you I also want to spread Islam and become a dye please pray for me inshallah may Allah make you die I really wish I had a father like you the values and Islamic teachings of Islam you have given to your children I wish you oh my father sir I want to ask one question hope it won't be personal I see you as a perfect human being but everyone has flaws right yes you're right I want to know what are your bad habits you want to change or what is that bad thing in you which you want to change or trying your level best to overcome that thing I'm asking because I believe that there would be nothing you want to change right question man sir I also want to ask what is your favorite food and of which country I think biryani must be a favorite as you have mentioned biryani in your talks a lot the sister has basically she's a fan of mine and and she sprays me and may Allah not hold me responsible for the way she I said may Allah forgive her for what she does not know about me and may Allah make me better than what she thinks about me regarding she said that she thinks I'm a perfect human me and that's totally wrong and she say that every human being has a fault and she's right my answer is that I have got several umpteen number of faults the best example human being is a beloved performance Alessandra and Allah says in the Quran in surah column chapter number 68 wasn't before that readily in the Prophet will you find a beautiful pattern of conduct Allah says in surah ahzaab chapter 3 verse number 21 verily in the Prophet is a beautiful example to follow so the best exemplar human being on the face of the earth in the beloved prophet o son son he's the best regarding what are the faults in me Allah says in the Quran it is human to err I have got many faults what would I like to change number one I would like to increase my knowledge the knowledge I have is less than a drop in the ocean I put it on last manner that will give me more knowledge more knowledge and I paid a visit the ilma that may Allah increase my knowledge and I keep on praying and a lot of the work for many things for halal income and may my actions be accepted by Allah that mean it was regarding one flaw that I have that what do you say English language I am a perfectionist no human being is perfect I know that but there's a English word called as perfectionist and I want to make everything the best this trait of being a perfectionist is good at that both it most of the things benefits me but sometimes it becomes a burden everything that I want to do I want to do it to the best and sometimes things which are not important also I waste my time trying to make it better I'll give you a simple example that when I send text messages to my staff and some of my staff don't even know English well but since I have to communicate they send me message and when I am giving them a reply because of the type of error or becomes I&I becomes oh and if the spelling is wrong there is a typing error is there I go out of the way to go and correct it and read it that's not required the person doesn't know English well so what difference does it make that if there is a spelling error but that is my nature I am a perfectionist I'm not a perfect human being at all I first manager is to try and make everything to the best and that's very helpful in the field of Dawa in the flow of Islam I try and strive a lot to see to it that whatever I do whether they'd be little thing or a medium thing or a big thing I do it I do it to the best of my ability this is good and bad also more cases that is good but sometimes it wastes your time in small things and it prevents you from doing other good things I appeared Olas masala - to remove all my faults and in a paternalist mother let me accept my effort whatever is in his way the main thing is mal accept effort and whatever said and done one thing is for sure that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has blessed me millions and billions of things and the knee amma that he has given me I would not like to exchange my position with anyone in this world and all the people that I know I don't know everyone in the world but all the people that I know the kings and the presidents and the Prime Minister of the country and the celebrities all that I know I am happy to be what I am as I am as a package there are many things on to improve but if anyone tells me that if Allah gives you the option would you like to swap your position with anyone in the world living today I'm happy without that I'm not the best with me in the world no why am i claiming that I'm the best Muslim in the world they may be many Muslims will be hundred times better than me we may not be doing about them but among the people that we know in the Kings I am happy with what I am because as a package I am happy that maha at least is secured insha Allah if Allah accept Mefford rather than the position of these celebrities and this thing and the prime ministers and the presidents how many of them would go to general and awesomest so whatever I am I thank Allah for the position he has given me for all the calls I have got very very negligible qualities but Allah has put love in the hearts of millions of so the lab is not because I'm a good speaker it is because Allah has done a favor to me and Allah has put love for me in your hearts otherwise there are thousands of people have more knowledge than me there are tens of thousands of people who are more intelligent than me that tens of thousands of people who are better writer than me but yet Allah has put that love in the hearts of the human means for me there are hundreds of thousands of non-muslims who love me there are millions of Muslims who love me a hamdulillah so this is only has I mean first literally it is only because of the grace of Allah subhanAllah so what Allah has given mean Yama I would not like to exchange my position with anyone presently living in this world there may be hundreds of people better than you I may not be aware of and I pray to Allah so Allah to forgive my mistakes and forgive my sins regarding the last question and that which is my best food is it biryani my best food the fair was married it was a food made by my mother and now it is the best food for me in the food made by my wife I am a person who satisfied mashallah because I see more for the thing which would get me benefits in akhirah the food that my wife makes I am NOT claiming she's the best cook but for me she makes the best food for me and I would prefer the curry Kotori made by my wife than the biryani I do use the word biriyani in my lectures because biryani is the delicacy for the people of the Indian subcontinent for the people of India for the people of Pakistan that is the reason I give examples of food which are popular if at the correct Italy that will not be the best food for many of the human beings so the simple food made by my wife I prefer them the biryani made by the chef outside and I'm very satisfied and I thank Allah - Allah - to give me this position"
