  "transcript": "the next question from abraha from kashmir peace and mercy be upon you there is no doubt that almighty allah has taken great work from you may allah make your bounty more common dr sahib the way we see today is that there is a lot of effort to defame muslims and the muslims themselves are going astray day by day and the muslims are now weak in every way in terms of faith in terms of strength in terms of knowledge the condition of muslims now would hardly have happened in any era my question is how do muslims get the heritage back what do we need to do to regain opposition the brother has rightly said that the muslims today are weak where it comes the condition of faith where it is regarding strength where it is regarding knowledge we are weak what should be done to regain our past glory there are various things to be done so that the muslims can get back the past glory the full speech you can give on that time will not permit me to speak in detail but i can give you three important points that the muslims should lay stress on to solve this problem number one the muslims should go back to quran and the authentic hadith of the beloved prophet muhammad if we look in the past at the time of muslim at the time of the sahabas at the time of khul farashadin the muslims were powerful the muslims were on top of the world so much so that during the reign of the time allah we visited him the second caliph of islam the islamic empire it expanded and alhamdulillah we were one of the most powerful people in the world but today we find that we are looked down upon we are criticized we are pointed fingers at we are laughed upon and i do agree with the question the reason is we have gone away from the quran and sunnah if we go back to quran sunnah if we follow the guidance mentioned in the glorious quran and the authentic hadith of the beloved prophet inshallah we will be taught better than the world again if you read the history of europe it says from the 8th to the 12th century it was the dark ages dark for whom dark for the europeans not for the world the amount of advancement that the muslim arabs made from the 8th to the 12th century is phenomenal if you go back to history and you read that in terms of science and technology from the 8th to 1st century muslims on top of the world the father of chemistry was they say gaba it is not gibber the western is the name it's jabyrib nahiyan in mathematics in astronomy in physics the muslims on top of the world so much so that if you wanted to excel in science it was compulsory you learned arabic language today you have to learn english language because english is the international language at that time arabic was the most sought after language if you wanted to excel in science and technology and in literature you had to learn arabic which is not the case today because that time the muslims were close to the quran and sunnah we were on top of the world number two allah says in the quran in surah al-imran chapter number three boston 103 will be hold strongly to the rope of allah be not divided the rope of allah is the glorious quran and authentic number one number two we have to be united and we should not be divided so this verse of the quran gives the two most important solutions for the advancement of the muslims hold strongly to the rope of allah and be not divided so we have to hold strong to the quran and sunnah go back to the quran sunnah number two we should be united and we should not be divided unfortunately today most of the muslims are divided in most parts of the world they're divided into different schools of thought and different sects and different ideologies they are divided in two different groups different organizations you may have different organizations no problem you may have different schools of thought no problem but we should be united we should be as one ummah today the non-muslims are taking advantage of us because we are divided if we are united this will never happen and the third is that today the muslims are caring more for dunya than allah says in the quran that if you strive for the dunya allah will give you dunya but will not give akhera but if you strive for the akhirah allah will give akhira as well as dunya all of us know one of the most important dwars that we make very often is from surah baqarah chapter give us the best in this world and the hereafter and save us from the torment of the hellfire we know this but do you know the verse that comes before this and majority of the muslims don't know the words before this dua says that those who strive for this dunya allah give to the dunya does not give you akara then this dua comes even in this dua if you analyze the first one to dua is talking about the dunya oh lord give me the good in this world and give me the good in the hereafter and save me from the torment of hellfire so one third of the duas give me the best in this world number two is give me the best in the akhirah and the third is save me from the torment of hell fire so first one third is talking about dunya the next two third is talking about akhirah the best in the akhirah and save me from the torment of the hellfire that means even in this dua one third is only for this dunya two-third is for the hera unfortunately today most of the muslims majority they are running after dunya so much that they have forgotten the akhirah if you strive for the akhirah inshallah i'll give the dunya if you do dwa for the dunya okay let it be maximum one third not more than that today we find the muslims whether they be in any field whether they in business whether they be as a professional whether they be as a politician they are striving more for this dunya if you strive for akhirah allah will give akhira and this dunya also so these three criteria were in brief that if we pay attention on these three things with the most important three factors and there are other factors also for privilegement of the ummah but these say according to me are the three major factors that if we go back to quran and sunnah and we follow the guidance of allah in the quran and in the authentic hadith of the beloved prophet number one number two the muslims should be united and should not be divided and number three that we should strive more for the akhara also if you strive for dunya it should not be more than one third if you strive for inshallah allah you the best in akhirah as well as dunya hope this answers this question"
