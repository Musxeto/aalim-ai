  "title": "Criteria for Selecting a Life Partner for My Son Fariq who is a Daee â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the second question from muhammad yunus mumbai india mashaallah you have a family of dave what would be the criteria you would look for while selecting a life partner for your son farik considering he is also die brother muhammad yunus has posed the question that what would i look for a life partner if i have to choose a life partner for my son farik who died number one the choice will depend on my son not on me because my son would be leading your life with his wife he should select the right one but nature i being a father can give guidelines because of experience if i was to guide my son and you already aware of the criteria and we discussed this many times alhamdulillah love you on the same wavelength and the reason is because of my wife whatever my son today is and my daughters maximum credit you could say 80 or more goes to my wife and i pose this question very often that when is the latest you would like to plan for the future of your son so some people say you know i would like to plan maybe when my son goes to university or my daughter goes to university some people say when she would go to college some would say in school some would say i would plan for my children when they enter nursery but the islamic method is and the islamic criteria is that the latest you plan not the earliest latest is when you select a life partner when you select a life partner then you're planning how would you want your children so i wanted my children to become thais that's the reason i selected adayah i wanted them to be religious that's the reason i selected religious girl and today most of the people think that my children are dying and alhamdulillah ahead in the field of dawah and islam alhamdulillah is because of me if percentage-wise i have to give marks out 80 percent is due to my wife alhamdulillah my guidelines are there my support is there everything is there but the credit goes to my wife now coming to the question what are the criteria that i would see or look for in a life partner for my son fari kuzadai as i mentioned in my early answer a beloved prophet muslim said inside buhari number seven hadith number five zero nine zero and the same hadith is repeated and say muslim word number four hadith number three that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that women are chosen for four things in marriage when you marry a woman you look for four things wealth lineage nobility beauty and religion choose her for her religion so the prophet said though people look for four things in a life partner while choosing a woman for marriage wealth lineage beauty and religion choose her for religion the best is religion and as i mentioned earlier that i would tell my son that while choosing a life partner see to it that you give 95 percent weightage to religion the other three are time bound mainly for worldly things religion hadeem and for this world and allah says in the quran that if you seek for this world allah will give you this world but not the akhirah if you seek fakhera allah will give you akhra in this world as far as the wealth is concerned i would not like my son to use the wealth of his wife for the living he should be a man he should look after himself he is the kawam so what different does it make whether the girl is rich or poor so as far as the wealth is concerned there is no weightage at all only thing we should be careful that poorer she's the better it is the richer she is it is difficult but if she is extremely rich then you have to be careful if she's extremely rich and used to that luxury of life she may be a billionaire's daughter then i would say be careful unless a deen is 100 out of 100 then maybe she would not care for the wealth that she has but otherwise if she's too wealthy you have to be careful you may not be able to take care of her so poorer the better so the weightage for the wealth is zero but only be careful that she's not extremely rich if she's poor the better if she's normal also no problem rich also no problem but not too rich or excessively rich point number two the lineage or the family i would say that makes no difference but if you're coming from a very religious family it may carry a very small maybe half percent vintage according to me if it is good but whether it is or not the dean is more important some people from the very good family may not be good we have the examples of children of the ambiance of messengers who are mushriks you have examples of children of mushriks who became messengers so we have both these examples so lineage is important but not that much i would hardly give any attention to that maybe half percent as far as beauty she should not be repulsive but natural my son should like her and beauty differs it's in the eye of the beholder and everything is in the mind so i would say okay you can give about maybe three or four percent marks of beauty 95 minimum should be for thee this is what i would guide him and this is what i believe even he believes regarding the criteria and the requirement but naturally the basic requirements that a muslima should be in the criteria i would have eight criteria which are compulsory number one she should be a practicing muslim following islam as per the glorious quran and the sahadit and she should do all the pharah's i repeat the first criteria and the most important is she should be a practicing muslim who follows islam as per the teachings of the glorious quran and the say hadith and she should do all the farah all the faraz means all she should have tahid she should pray five times a day she should give zakat if she has to give she should fast in the month of ramadan if she has to do hershey should do it hijab and all these can speak for us together number two should abstain from all the haram activities all the major sins all the minor sins as much as possible but natural if it's one or two minor sin no human being can say that he does not sin at all but abstain from all the major sins abstain from all this is if possible almost all number three she should be virtuous and do as much as mustahab as much as sunnah of the beloved prophet muslim third is a virtuous girl who follows as much as sunnah of the prophet does as much as mustahab what is recommended in the quran and say hadith that is should be high believe in tahit beside the five times salah she should offer the taj salah she should pray the sunnah listen to her mahda she should give charity besides the forzakat besides fasting in the month of ramadan she should fast the day of arafah fast the first nine days of zillaj the three days of mauram nine ten eleven she should keep the sixth fast of shawwal she should fast three days ayam will beat every month she should fast on monday and thursday and so on and so forth as much as of the muslim as possible as much as virtues as possible and this you can speak for us together on the third point alone the fourth point is she should have the passion for dawah and spreading the message of islam amongst the muslims and almost passion for dawah and spreading the islamic teachings fourth point fifth point she should encourage and support her husband that is my son for doing dawah completely that means she should support in all the dhawa activities of my son she should completely support and encourage and help him in all of our activities for number six she should be willing to lead a simple life which is non-luxurious inshallah my son's life is quite comfortable but if required for the sake of islam she should be able to sacrifice all comforts seventh she should be fluent in english because my son is sued a niche and he would want her to be fluent in english the eighth is she should be willing to settle militia or wherever my son would shift but his plans are to stay and live in malaysia so she should be willing to settle in malaysia these are the eight compulsory criteria if i would mention the criteria for selecting life partner for my son as far as the criteria which are very important but not compulsory number one would be i would want her to be fluent in fosa arabic the classical arabic the arabic of the quran she should be friend and that the reason is that i would want my children to be friends in arabic my son knows arabic fluently for sir i would want his wife to know so that the children are fluent in english and arabic both number two she should be adaya she should propagate islam to the non-muslims and the muslims number three she should have a bachelor's degree in any of the islamic studies whether it be islamic studies in general or in sharia or in quran or in hadith these are preferable not compulsory if little bit is less or more no problem but preferable the third is bachelor's in islamic studies the fourth is i would also want her to be a hafez my son is halfway don't want to be office so the children also are office and being half as is preferable for java number five she should be associated with an islamic organization and number six that she should have watched many of the english speaking dies so that she knows what is dawa and what is the surrounding atmosphere so these are the six additional points which are not compulsory but preferable if one is missing or a little bit less doesn't matter but there are eight compulsory points and there are six highly recommended preferable points that i would look for in a life partner for my son these are the main criteria the addition of course is there that there are many additional points for example the culture should match and the other things are there you can't expect a chinese to live with an african can if the first state criteria are 95 and above in marks and even the additional 0.6 are very good then the other things can be compromised the culture differs between the people so these things are which are secondary and tertiary but the first compulsory points have mentioned eight then the six points and then other points are later on so this was in brief what i would look for in life partner for my son fari hope that answers the question"
