  "transcript": "the next question lamin james from gambia but living in italy he says my question is is it allowed to give charity to non-muslims i am in europe and i see a non-muslim family struggling to make both ends meet will i be rewarded if i help them so the brothers basic question is that is it permitted to give charity to non-muslims does not prohibit you from dealing with kindness and justice with those people who have not fought you nor have driven you out of your lands now the mufasa in the commentators they say that one type of dealing with kindness and justice with the non-muslims is by giving them charity it is permissible for you to give charity to the non-muslims if you see a family struggling so then you can give these non-muslims or this family charity that is sadaqa and blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that he is not a muslim who sleeps with his full stomach while his neighbor is hungry and the neighbor includes the muslims as well as non-muslims so you can very well give them sadaqa that is charity in fact one category of zakah as allah subhana tala mentions the categories of zakah and sura tauba chap number nine verse number 60 one category is those whose hearts are inclined towards islam so if you see a non-muslim his heart is inclined towards islam he wants to accept islam even he can be given zakah normally zakah cannot be given to non-muslims but one category of zakah can be given to those people those non-muslims whose hearts are inclined towards islam so sadaqah charity normal charity can be given to any non-muslim whereas zakah can only be given to muslims one category of zakah can be given to those people whose hearts are inclined with islam"
