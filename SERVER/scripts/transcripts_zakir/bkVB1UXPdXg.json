  "transcript": "furthermore some people say that the Quran is a deception when we ask them what is the origin of the deception they give no answer can you point out a single deception in the Quran they cannot answer so how can you say something which you can logically prove there are some people who tell a false thing who make a false statement and they fool themselves by sticking to it for example suppose there's a person who thinks Mr a is an enemy he thinks he does not have a logical proof he has no reason but he thinks he falsely believes that Mr a he's my enemy the moment he meets Mr a that person starts behaving like an enemy to Mr a now Mr a being a human being he retaliates why is he treating me as enemy he retaliates the moment Mr retaliates the person says Ah didn't I tell you he's my enemy see there is retaliating to me so you make a false statement and you fool yourself by sticking to the statement this is what the critics of Islam do they make a false statement and they fool themselves by sticking to it furthermore the Quran it believes in reasoning and there are several verses which talk about reasoning you can analyze it you can discuss the matter of the Quran several places including Surah ibah chapter number 14 verse 52 that here is the message for mankind let them take warning there from let them know there is one God let the men of understanding take heed many Muslims think that the Quran discourages reasoning it discourages arguing with people it discourages discussing about the Quran with others and religion with others in fact the Quran encourages that you have to discuss with the other human beings you have to argue with the other human beings it's mentioned in the Quran inah chapter number 16 verse number 125 invite all to the way of their Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best most gracious Quran encourages reasoning and arguing and discussing but with hi and in ways that are best and most gracious"
