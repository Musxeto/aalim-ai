  "transcript": "today when we analyze throughout the world there are more females as compared to males in New York alone there are 1 million females more than males in USA alone there are 7.8 million females more than males in UK alone there are four million females more than males in Germany alone there are 5 million females more than males in Russia alone there are 9 million females more than males and God Alone knows how many millions of females are more than they miss throughout the world if I agree with the non-muslim that every man should marry only one woman and suppose my sister or suppose your sister happens to live in USA and if the market is saturated Every Woman have found a life partner for herself yet there will be 7.8 million females who will not find husbands and if unfortunately your sister or my sister happens to live in USA and if she's amongst one of those 7.8 million females who has not found a husband what is the option she has the only option she has is that she either marries a man who already has a wife or she becomes public property public property sophisticated what I can use I cannot think of a better word there's no option she either marries a man who already has a wife or become public property in America having Mistresses is very common the American studies tell us on an average a man has eight different sexual partners before he settled on with one doesn't say that but before he married he has on an average eight different sexual partners having mistress in America has come and no problem 10 20 no problem having two wives doesn't go down the throat you know when a woman becomes the second wife of a man she gets honor she gets a right she lives a very peaceful life with Grace With Honor with all the rights and when a woman is a mistress she doesn't get a rights she has no protection she leads the life of this gift therefore Islam permits some men to have more than one wife to protect the woman and I do agree if someone tells me that no woman would like to share the husband agree with them I don't argue I agree with you that no woman under normal circumstances would like to share the husband but the Islamic Sharia says let a small loss take place to prevent a big loss that means a good Muslim who knows the situation of the world would not mind sharing a husband to prevent her sister from becoming a public property you ask any modest woman would she prefer becoming the wife of a man who already has a wife or becoming public property any modest woman would choose the first one"
