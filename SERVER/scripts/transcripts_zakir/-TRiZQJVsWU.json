  "title": "When there is a Difference of Opinion amongst the Scholars on Islamic Issue, who should we Follow?",
  "transcript": "the next question brother mohsin bashir from kashmir india what should we follow when there is difference of opinion among the scholars on a particular issue this question related to the earlier question that what should we do and who should we follow if there are different opinion among the scholars allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 59 obey and those who have been endowed with knowledge those who have been giving the commands that means talking about the scholars obi allah and obey the messengers and obey those who are knowledgeable those who are the scholars a little um but the verse doesn't end there the verse continues but if they differ go back to allah and rasul that means they have to follow quran and follow say hadith and the scholars but if the scholars differ go back to our land is rasool all the scholars say you should pay five time there's no need of going anywhere pray five times all the scholars say they should fast during the month of ramadan no problem all the scholars give two point five percent zakat in most of the cases okay follow that when there is difference of opinion and if scholars differ the quran says go back to online industry now when the scholars differ what should a person do for this i would like to give an example depending upon which level do you belong to your decision will based on that i remember when i was in school when i was in the primary school for us for a child in the primary school teacher is always right irrespective whether the teacher is knowledgeable or not for the child going in primary school for him or her the teacher is the most knowledgeable in the world and i remember in the primary school when my science teacher told something and i told my father my logarithmic my father he was a medical doctor he was a psychiatrist he had done his post-graduation medicine and when there was a medical issue and i told my father my father said that you know this is wrong i was a diamond no my teacher cannot be wrong that time i was a kid you're seven eight years old not knowing that my father is a medical doctor but for me the teacher is always right similarly when a child is in primary school for him the teacher is always right so for a person who has no knowledge of thee or maybe the beginner in deen who is a reward or maybe who has not studied at all he may be an elderly person but did not study then at all so i would consider him to be in the level of school level so for him he should judge one scholar consider him to be teacher and follow that is the safest whichever scholar he believes but that is for a person who has limited or no knowledge of thing normally the fukahas they divide the muslim the two levels one is the mustang a scholar and one of the non-muslims i divide normally into four levels the different levels of division i would count a person who has bare minimal knowledge of the bare minimum or maybe a reward or maybe he's elderly but no one taught him really about the deen so i would call him a person who's in school bare minimum the lowest level in the muslim the highest level i would call as a scholar or a muslim and today in today's world there are very few mustang very few scholars maybe a few hundred very few all the dyes that you see giving talks and all very few are really scholars very few the highest level scholar the lowest level is just the beginner the second level from top i would say is a student of knowledge so most of the duats are students of knowledge for example the person who studied deen and spent years studying those school of fake or the hadith of seed you can call him a student of knowledge student of knowledge may differ he may be a graduate from islamic university he may be a post graduate that his masters he may be a phd just by getting a phd degree don't become a scholar can become chances scholar is a different category altogether allah has given him the sense of analysis of understanding he knows all these souls and has the element of puja et cetera that's a different level so scholars are very few in the world maybe a few hundred now in the full world so these are students of knowledge in the students of college there are various categories low level medium high very high phd may be a very high level but yet a student of knowledge and a person may not have gone to university but they might have spent months and years discussing with the top scholars and focus he may be more knowledgeable than a phd and in my organization in islamic such foundation when i was in bombay and the school itself we had more than 500 employees out of which about maybe 25 of them were graduates post graduates and phds from foreign universities mainly from mostly from islamic university of madina some from imam mohammed south university some from another university maybe 25 of them bachelors post graduates and phds then we are another 30 40 people who have passed from the islamic universities in india some have done the ifta some have done the alim some mufti another 30 so totally we have about you know 50 60 people all of them i call a student of knowledge there were some who were in the research department who did not pass from any of the islamic universities but they spent years in doing research for me they were more valuable than the masters and the phds amongst my staff they were very knowledgeable they could argue they could quote the hadith they didn't go to any islamic university but the level of understanding of deen was much higher so the salary was higher even than the phds who have done the doctorate from the islamic university of alaska etc even from madina and none of my staff i would call not even i'm not a scholar at all i'm just a student of knowledge so student of knowledge differs at different level that is the second category the third category above the basic beginner is those who have knowledge of the deen but may not have studied to a great extent but because today it's easy to acquire knowledge either by internet or by social media they have interacted but not to the level of a student of knowledge so i would call them in four levels one is the scholar amusta is very few in the world few hundred then you have the student of knowledge the experience of knowledge of various categories lower level medium level higher level then you have the people who have knowledge of the deen but may not be costly of knowledge but they know quite fair and one is a lower level just the beginner if you're a beginner you're like in the school catch one scholar follow him that's the best you don't have that if you're a student of knowledge if you're a student of knowledge and if the scholars differ they have to analyze go back to allah and result go back to the evidence given by the scholars so if two scholars differ the student of knowledge will actually check that what is the evidence given by scholar a and what is the evidence given by scholar b he himself may not be a scholar but he has the basic knowledge of at least analyzing the evidence and no die unless he's a scholar should give a fatwa i never gave a fatwa of my own what a thai can do he can read the fatwas of the scholars and then he can agree with one scholar more than the other scholar saying i agree with this scholar more because the evidence is giving is much more reliable than the other i feel this evidence now depending upon what level of student of knowledge are you can you agree but naturally for a very low level of student of knowledge then it may not be right for you to judge which of the scholar is correct but you have a higher level you can those who are on the third level who have knowledge of the theme what they should do they should ask a student of knowledge that these two scholars are differing who do you think is more appropriate and based on the evidence they give so basically you have to go back to allah and his rasool see the evidence in the quran and the hadith there may be chances that some scholars they have made mistake out of ignorance they won your friend some said because of difference of opinion various so if you analyze and then make a decision so if you are a student of knowledge you can analyze the evidence given by the scholar then decide which call is correct if you are the third category you can ask a student of knowledge or ask a scholar a third scholar which of the two evidence is more appropriate and hear their reasoning and based on that you can decide if you are the fourth level just knowing hardly knowing the level of deen you catch one scholar follow him blindly there's no other option but naturally should not be a fake scholar it should be a scholar by its two cents and if you do that you have no other option because your knowledge is very low in the theme these are the options we have but as the quran says go back to our language rasool we have run out of time that was the last question that i could answer just to give information inshallah that there will be a program next saturday but it will be only ask farik till then we meet inshallah"
