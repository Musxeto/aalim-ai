  "title": "Is using the Siwaak Recommended in Ramadhaan? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Zach and many people have the misconception that using the siwak during the fast in Ramadan is discouraged could you just clarify this point please there are many people who think that using fever while you're fasting is discouraged it is based on the Hadith the same Hadith I quote earlier of say buhari volume 3 in the book of fasting Hadith number 1904 and one eight nine four Prophet Muslim said that by Allah in whose hand is my soul the breadth of a person who fast is sweeter to Allah then the scent of must now based on this people think that if you use Seva the breadth the bad breath that normally comes in a person who fast will not be there so Allah will not enjoy the breath and based on this they think it is discouraged in fact we should realize that when a person is using the sevach to stick it does not stop the bad breath which normally comes when a person fasts because when you use the two sticks it normally massages the gums and if there are any food particles in between the teeth like how you use a toothbrush it is someone similar to that the bad breath of fasting comes from the stomach because no food enters the stomach and that's how it comes so no way does IT contract that and furthermore beloved Prophet Muslim says it's mentioned in say buhari number two Hadith number 887 that the Beloved Prophet said that if it wasn't too difficult for my ummah I would have made it compulsory to use the sevak before every prayer so the prophet said if it would have been difficult for the ummah would have made it completely to use the sevak every time before prayer and that means it is a recommended Act and if it wasn't good for fast you would have mentioned it like how we mentioned for excessive sniffing of water Hadith off or number two Hadith number two three six zero beloved Prophet said that sniff water excessively while doing Evolution except while fasting that means sniffing water excessively is good but don't do it while fasting because there are dangers that will go into the throat and Mentor the stomach so here too if it was a disadvantage the past would have said that I would have told my ummah to use the sevak except by fasting So based on this it is a recommended act it is and you should do it and it shall it will get to Rewards"
