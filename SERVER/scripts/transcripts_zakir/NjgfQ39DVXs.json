  "transcript": "salaam alaikum to everybody my question to brother zakir naik is regarding dawa to a special hindu friend of mine she has been suffering from psoriasis vulgaris since childhood and she does not understand why god is punishing or examining her for no fault of her own and because of this i have not been able to carry forward dawa because she she comes and stops on this regard can you give me a logical explanation mother asked the question that while doing dhawa to non-muslim girl she's suffering from psoriasis and she doesn't know why god is punishing what is the reason brother first thing should say when any calamity befalls on a person it's either a punishment or a test when any good things happen to any person it's either a reward or a test many people who are non-muslims they're very rich so there's no reward it's a test for them similarly for her any calamity comes it's either a punishment or a test if she feels she has not done any sin then it's a test for testing that does she have faith in god after having the disease a good moment there is a statement that says that i used to always complained because i had no footwear i had no shoes as to always complained because i had no shoes until i saw a man who had no feet understand we are complaining god i've got no shoot no shoes when he saw a man with no feet hang or at least only soreness is a disease which is fine nothing great there are other people who have aids other people have major diseases which are detrimental to life so yes this is not that so therefore look at the people below you then thank god that he has at least blessed me with this life so tell her it's a test for her she has only a small disease there are people of multiple times more disease cancer terminal illness aids she should thank god that she has no cancer do you thank god that she doesn't have aids should thank god that she doesn't have disease which is incurable so this is a test for her hope to answer the question [Music]"
