  "transcript": "don't say mosque m-o-f-q-u-e always say Masjid because Islamic organization has found that mosque means mosquitoes to say that mosque means mosquito is baseless there are many people who try and say that mosque is derived from the Spanish word maska which means mosquito tell you frankly mosquito is a Spanish word it's not English word the English have taken from the Spanish word mosquito which is derived from Moscow which means a fly mosquito means a small fly and there is no connection between mosquito and mosque mosque is English word in Spanish the word is mosquito for mosque the translation for Masjid in Spanish is Mesquita and in French it is mosque so the English word mosque has been taken from the French word mosque which means Masjid and has become Musk so to say that mosque means mosquito it is totally baseless it has got no etymology it totally bases so in English if you use the word mosque for Masjid there is no problem at all and this is the English translation of the Arabic word Masjid and it does not mean mosquito hope that's the question"
