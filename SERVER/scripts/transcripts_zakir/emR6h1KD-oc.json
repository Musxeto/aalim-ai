  "title": "Is Using Modern Medicine instead of the Prophetic Medicine Kufr? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "next question from WhatsApp my name is Sayad haris I a medical student from India my question is regarding the traditional medicines advised by or done by the prophet are these methods told by the prophet legislative and if we believe more in modern medicine am I committing kuf because I'm not having full faith in the words of the Prophet the question posed by the brother is that a beloved Prophet has many Hadi is talking about the medicines it's known as and the prophet has various had talking about what will cure you what will not cure you talking about honey talking BL seed and various so the question posed by a Muslim who a medical student that if is it kuf if I practice something else if I don't practice the medicine and if I practice like maybe allopathy or the mainstream medicine so is it kuf is it wrong if I don't believe in the word of the prophets regarding the last part of the question is it wrong if I do not believe in the word of the yes it is wrong you have to believe in the word of prophet but that doesn't mean you have to practice that medicine also practicing the medicine is not F because whatever the prophet told about the medicine if you follow it's a Sunnah the prophet never said it's that you should take honey the prophet spoke about the benefits of honey the prophet spoke about the benefit of black seed that in this there is cure for every disease except death but that isn't mean it's a it isah it's Prophet spoke about the that if you use the and the prophet said if it wasn't too difficult I would have made it f for every Muslim to use theak before every Salah but he didn't do it so using so whatever the prophet it recommended whether it is whether it's cupping whether it's honey whether it's black seed all these are Sunnah it's not a f it's not fart to do it so but you saying you cannot say what the prophet said is wrong that is wrong you cannot say I don't believe in the Hadith that is Ku if it's a prophet said this and If you deny it then that is Ku you cannot deny that but it's not a must that you should follow it if you're practicing it now you said you're a doctor and there is an alpath medicine which may not follow the same what the prophet has said it's not wrong at all because Allah says in the Quran in chapter number 16 verse 43 and chapter number 21 vers number 7 if you don't know ask the personal knowledgeable so if you get sick who will you ask you'll ask a doctor so now you're following the guidance of the doctors in today's world he may be a non-muslim no problem and the prophet was very clear there is Hadith in which when people were hitting the plants and the prophet said what are you doing they hit the plants again the other plants and there used to be pollination the prophet don't do it so they didn't do it and that year the crop failed and then they realize that when they used to do those action it was mainly helping in pollination and the crop was good so the prophet said these are worldly matters in worldly matters it's not necessary you have to follow everything what I say in matters of Dean in religion yes you have to follow him blindly but matter of worldly things you may or may not follow him it's not compulsory so as far as medicine is concerned there is Alternative Medicine Science has advanced so there's no problem at all in you following what the modern s Faith but that doesn't mean you have to disagree with the Hadith in which the prophet has given treatment you can also use that you can do both together so if you practice general medicine or practice allopathy medicine which is not the same as there is no harm at all you're not doing a sin but see to it you don't criticize the Hadi in which the prophet has spoken regarding the cure for many of the disease hope that answer the question"
