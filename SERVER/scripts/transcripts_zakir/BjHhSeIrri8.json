  "title": "If Islam Propagates Forgiveness then why does it Permit Honour Killing? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Caroline I'm a journalist I've got a two-part question here does Islam propagate acts of forgiveness yes oh no does Islam propagate acts of forgiveness the question does Islam probably acts on forgiveness of course yes and every chapter every surah of the glorious quran begins with the formula bismillah ar-rahman rahim in the name of allah most gracious most merciful so why does it yes it second about the question the second part the question is why does it permit why does Islam permit honor killings honor killing yes what do you mean burner killing honor killing the right to avenge your brother's blood in the name of Allah it might be out of context but I just need to know if there's any place if I could honor killing me someone kills any human being to take revenge yes that's what do you mean yes because I've read a few books and a lot of the times people have said that they allowed to kill their brother or to kill somebody else because their brother has been killed by another human being this is a sort of good question that if Islam propagates act of forgiveness why does it permit honor killing welcome that's a very good question sister if you analyze this mission the Quran in surah Baqarah chap number two worse than 178 the HUD penalty the punishment of death on the basis of cases and Allah also says in the Quran in surah maidah chap number five was the more thirty-two if anyone kills any of the human being well there'd be Muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder all for creating mischief in the land it is as though yes killed all of humanity so as a general rule if any you mean being kills any of the human being it is as though yes kill the whole of humanity except under dual circumstances unless it is for murder or for creating mischief in the land now there are two exceptions where Islam gives permission where you can kill any human be number one is if that person has committed murder which comes in your scope of question honor killing number two is if is creating facade corruption in this land again this is not compulsory if someone kills someone it's not compulsory has to be killed Islam also says that if the relatives of the person who has been killed if they take blood money if they forgive the killer that person has skill can be forgiven but under normal circumstances if suppose if he's killed someone and if I want death on that because for that again the punishment is dead like as it's mentioned early in the early scriptures even in the Bible and I have fine and tooth for a tooth it keeps on continuing here what we realize that suppose I know if a human being who's killing other people innocent human being if I don't kill him he will keep on killing other human beings so that law is not only in Islam it is a law of most of the countries that if whom I said is done if someone has murdered someone in many countries he should be put to death or that life in prison will even in Islam that if he's killed someone if required he can be killed but the relatives of the person even can forgive the person if they want if they want they can forgive the murderer but if they want that if you P put to death then he'll be put to death and the second case where a person can be killed is if he's causing corruption in the land for example if someone is committing rape no rape and nothing but causing corruption in the land so in this case that person should be put to death because the sin is so hideous it is such a big crime that there is no other punishment but death penalty and I have asked this too may non-muslims that God forbid if someone day for mother and if you are made the judge and the rapist is born in front of you what punishment will give him and hundred person of the non-muslim they told me that we will put him to death some went to the extreme was saying we will torture him to death but why these double standards you know in America which happens to be one of the most advanced countries in the world according to the FBI statistics in 1990 every day on average one thousand seven hundred and fifty these cases of rape took place according to 1996 statistics US Department of Justice every 2713 cases of rape took place nineteen ninety one thousand 756 1996 2007 and thirteen maybe the Americans got more boiled that means every 32 second one rape is taking place in America we are here in this auditorium for the past about three hours already more than 300 rifts may have taken place in America so Islam as a system of a job which I mentioned my talk that when a man looks at a woman I should lower the gaze the woman should follow the Islamic is up which I mentioned earlier after that if any man commits rape he gets capital punishment even the American law says that seven years rigorous imprisonment for a rapist but most of the times is led free so when you ask even a non-muslim what punishment really give 100 percent sales will put him to death there was one American was a smart aleck in America told me read the socket first I will give him five years rigorous imprisonment I told him do you know the status of America out of those that commit rape after they imprison and after the less free more than 95 percent committed rape again so if you want your daughter and your mother to be raped again a most welcome I don't want that so he said if that vacation the first time it set up remember that so in such cases where this corruption of land like rape etc Islam give permission death penalty can even begin for that case hope the answer the question sister [Applause]"
