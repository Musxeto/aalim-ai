  "transcript": "what are the days of Doubt which you've mentioned earlier when a Muslim is not supposed to fast the death of doubt that's known as fasting on days of doubt is when you doubt whether it's the month of Ramadan or not and if you're in doubt yet to be on the safe side of a person fast whether before Ramadan starts and doubt you first after Ramadan has ended up doubt with the ramnath if you fast during the days of doubt it is prohibited as the Beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in the Hadith of trimedi book of fasting Hadith number 686 that when the moon is not seen and people doubt whether it's the last day of Shaban or the first day of Ramadan and they fast this is prohibited fasting because of Doubt is prohibited because people are doubted you know that moon has not been seen so maybe it's the last day of Shaban or the first day of Ramadan so why not fast it's preferable when in doubt why don't you fast which is private in Islam further it's mentioned bukhari verb number three in the book of fasting Hadith number one nine one four the Beloved Prophet Muslim said that it is prohibited to fast one or two days before Ramadan because of Doubt unless a person is used to keeping the Nava film fast is used to keeping the volunteer fast and it coincides me used to fasting on Monday and Thursday and the first two days before I'm done coincides or he is used to fasting every alternate day and coincides without that exception fasting on the day of Doubt is prohibited further it's mentioned volume number two book of fasting Hadith number two three two seven that once we were there at the day of sighting of the Moon and people doubted whether the moon was seen or not and there was division between the people and when goat was cut and it was given some people didn't have the meat because they are fasting so immediately when the Saba says that all those who fast on this day they have disobeyed Abul qasim Abul qasim are the name of sallam he was the father of qasim so it become the day of Eid if some people said saw the moon some people said no it's not sure and they felt that means they're fasting on the day of feed even this is of two types one is before Ramadan starts you know fasting the month of Shaban and when after Ramadan gets over fasting in the month of so both these are prohibited because you know what nears will make that I am fasting I don't know whether someone or not and you're fasting in doubt when a Muslim does an act or did something good you should be sure you cannot be in doubt and then fast in doubt and then after Salah it doesn't make sense and that's absolutely very clear I believe"
