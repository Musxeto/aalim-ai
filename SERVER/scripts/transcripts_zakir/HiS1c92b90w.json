  "transcript": "the next question from Mohamed Adel India my father left me when I was 18 years old and I had no one to look after me my mother left me when I was 11 years old I stayed at the paying guest and worked to survive today a hamdulillah I earned good amount of money to feed myself now father asked me to give money to him on monthly basis which will be around five to six thousand rupees per month should I give the money to my father and my father didn't take care of me whether the question that father left him at the age of eighteen mother left him at the age of eleven they did not take care of him and now we've got a good job be learning good money and father's asking monthly approximately five to six thousand rupees should he give him or not I do not know the reason why the father left you but even if I agree for the sake of argument hypothetically that he did not take care of you if he did not take care of you and if we did not do its duty that doesn't mean that you should not do your duty you as a good son should do your duty and taking care of the parent is a requirement that every human being every Muslim should take care of the parent when they grow up and Allah says in the Quran in surah fussilat chapter number 41 verse 24 that repel evil with good you may never know that the person of the enemy will become your friend and hear your father's not enemy is your father I agree with you need not take care of you but you have to do your duty and if you do your duty insha Allah you'll go to Jannah so according to me if your father's asking for five to six thousand rupees I would say that give him nine thousand give him ten thousand rupees give him more than one asking if I live given you if Allah has not given you and if you can afford fight on if I thousand or if you cannot yet you sacrifice your luxury and give money to your father inshallah you will be doing a great deed of charity and especially if you are doing to your father it is your requirement it is your duty it's your father so my suggestion to you is that if you ask me for five or six thousand rupees give you much more give him 10,000 rupees inshallah that will benefit you this one as well as ah"
