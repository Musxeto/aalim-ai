  "transcript": "by faith imam do pandemic and plague refer to the same thing pandemic by definition means it is different than epidemic an epidemic is a disease which become very prevalent in one particular locality if it gets more prevalent it's called an epidemic it spreads and it spreads to a locality maybe to one country or to three countries and it causes a lot of damage and death pandemic is something which is worldwide according to World Health Organization does not give exactly the number of countries for it to be called a pandemic but if it's prevalent in many countries across the world it is called s pandemic as far as plague is concerned playing is an epidemic it is one type of epidemic disease like as was told Alice mahalo sent the plague on the people of her own so plague is one type of Edie one type of epidemic for which a beloved prophet was a loss column said that anyone dies in play is called as a martyr and anyone during a plague whether he dies or whether he's infected and does not die or whether he is prevalent in the plague and doesn't get infected but he has faith in allah subhanaw taala and he believed that nothing happened to him except what is ordained by las manos Allah he gets the reward sob of a matter so this is specifically only for plague but some that the some scholars may say it may include other epidemics or other pandemics but what the hadith is specifically talking you only about Blake so so every plague is an epidemic but every epidemic is not a plague"
