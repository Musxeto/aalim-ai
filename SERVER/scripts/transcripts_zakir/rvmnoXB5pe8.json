  "title": "Is Not Hijaab Degrading for a Women? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good afternoon dr nike um my name is izzy westbury i'm the secretary here at the oxford union i have a very short question to ask um you talk about the hijab being something that serves to protect a woman surely it's extremely patronizing and degrading to prevent a woman from making that decision for herself how could you answer that what's the question sister i said in your speech you talk about the hijab being something that serves to protect a woman but how is it not extremely patronizing and degrading and not allowing the woman to make that decision herself sisters pose a very good question that when i say that hijab is required for a woman isn't it not degrading for the woman to patternize it isn't it degrading if you read the quran the quran and islam has prescribed hijab that means the woman should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and hands up to the wrist this is for the modesty and it is not only mentioned in the quran it is also mentioned in the bible if you read the bible in the first timothy chapter number two verse number nine it says that women should be dressed up with shame-facedness they should desktop with sobriety and should not wear braided hair or gold or purse it's further mentioned in the first corinthians chapter number 11 verse number 5 6. the woman that does not cover a head then she dishonors a head a head should be shaved off anyway i don't agree with this i'm just quoting you from the bible same way if you go to the vedas it says that the woman should cover the head so all the religious scriptures they talk about the woman covering their head it is for modesty it is not to degrade the woman and if you analyze those allegations made against me saying that dr zakir naik says that if they don't wear hijab you know that if you wear western clothes there are chances the woman will be raped it is a misquotation again what i said that if women were revealing clothes they have more chances of being raped what i was doing the same newspaper sunday time they spoke against me one year before on the march of ninth 2009 sunday time squared an article in britain one out of seven feel that the woman who were sexy revealing clothes she should be hit i'm sorry i don't agree with it this is the statistics that was given in the sunday times on the 9th of march 2009 that in britain one out of seven britishers believe that the women who were revealing and sexy clothes should be hit i disagree with this furthermore one more article came in 2005 in the same newspaper sunday times it said that 26 of the britishers they feel that wearing revealing clothes is partially or totally responsible for the rape so what i say that the more modestly are dressed up you are respected more so islam has prescribed the modest hijab for the woman not to degrade but to uplift her i do agree there may be cultural differences islam cannot force anyone to adopt it there are cultural differences for example i'll give an example that some societies what they feel that even looking at a woman is a modest some societies feel looking is no problem but touching a woman is a modest some of the societies feel shaking and is no problem some societies feel kissing no problem some societies feel doing anything as long as both agree is no problem different societies and different cultures have got different rules and regulations when i went to america while i was giving a talk one of the americans told me you eastern woman you're i'm modest i was shot so i said why do you call the eastern woman immodest he told me you eastern women you expose your belly so in america and western country exposing belly is a modesty in india exposing belly is not a modesty wearing shorts isn't modesty so what if you realize sister there's different culture the different system islam cannot force anyone to adopt it's clearly mentioned in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number two verse number 256 like rafiddine there is no compulsion religion but if some women want to adopt the hijab because they feel modest and they feel respected i feel no other woman should disagree and when i've been to uk i've seen hundreds and thousands of women who do cover their hair and who feel that they are uplifted because of this modesty hope to answer the question you"
