  "title": "Why are Ladies in Islam not Allowed to Divorce their Husbands? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good evening sir my name is simi my question is why are the other ladies not allowed to divorce their husbands in islam social as a question that why aren't the ladies allowed to divorce the husband as far as divorce is concerned sister broadly you can categorize divorce into five categories one is by mutual consent of the husband and wife both first category second category unilaterally by the will of the husband third category that if it is mentioned in the nikanama when a woman is marrying a man if she mentioned the contract by default the authority is given to the man in the quran why i'll come to it later on but in the nikanama since marriage is a marital contract a woman can put down any clause in marriage which is not prohibited in the quran she can even say that i do not want my husband to take a second wife because marrying more than one wife is not compulsive in islam if the boy agrees he marries otherwise they don't marry she finds the new boy and he finds the new girl but she can put the claws that i do not want you to take a second wife as long as i am alive but you cannot put the clause which is against the quran you can't put a clause saying i don't want you to offer prayer because offering salah is compulsory you can put a clause which is optional similarly she can put a clause that i too want to give unilateral divorce it's called as salakit office or isma third category fourth categories if she does not mention in the clause but yet she wants divorce she can request the husband i don't want to stay with you she can request the husband to give divorce that's called a scholar and the fifth category if the husband does not agree and if the husband ill-treats her she can go to the kazi she can go to the judge and she can take nikai fast that means nullification of the marriage if the husband treats her does not give her a right she can go to the judge and she can nullify the marriage so even a woman can take divorce but under normal circumstances the man has been given the authority why because in marriage the person who's the loser is the man not the woman the woman gains if you heard my talk last week on last saturday in the talk women's rights in islam subjugated or protected i mentioned that during marriage the woman is on the receiving side the quran says in surah nisa chapter four verse number four that give to the woman in marriage a marital gift in marriage it is the husband who gives to the would-be wife an amount of my head and my heart can be any amount so imagine before she's married it's the duty of the man duty of the father and the brother after she's married it's the duty of the husband and the son to look after lodging boarding clothing or financial aspects and if divorce takes place it is the duty of the parents to look after her if not the parents it's the duty of the society to look after her if not the society it's the duty of the islamic state to look after so she's financially secured if divorce takes place the man gives the divorce he loses them ahead but the woman she's on the receiving end now she has a chance to get married once you get married she gets new mare and the man when he has to marry another woman he has to give new mare if the full authority is given to the woman the woman keeps on marrying and divorcing then she will keep on gaining money who's the loser is the man almighty god even protects the man status others have to give a talk on man's rights in islam because if a divorce takes place man is more of a loser than a woman financially and otherwise woman gets protection from the family from the society from the state man doesn't so because of that allah almighty god has secured the man but yet if the woman wants she can mention the marathon contract she too can give divorce or she can request divorce from the husband called as kula or if the husband will treat she can go to a judge and she can nullify the marriage which is called as nikai fast hope that answers the question"
