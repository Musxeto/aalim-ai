  "transcript": "the fourth most common misconception in the minds of the non-muslim is Islam was spread by the sword what is the meaning of the word Islam Islam comes from the root word Salam which means peace it's also derived from the Arabic word s which means to submit your will to almighty God Islam in short means peace acquired by submitting a will to Almighty God so if I translate Islam was spread by the sword it means peace was spread by the sword it's contradictory how can peace be Spar By The Sword and we know that every human being in the world would not want peace to Prevail Islam is a religion of Peace its main aim and objective is to spread peace but every human being in this world would not want peace to Prevail that's the reason every country in the world has a police force this police force many a Time uses Force to maintain peace in that country they don't use Force to disrupt peace if the antisocial elements want to disrupt peace the police of the various countries they use Force to maintain peace in that country similarly in Islam Islam is against violence it's against fighting it's against using Force except as a last resort to maintain peace similarly Islam does give permission to use Force to let Justice and peace Prevail in that land"
