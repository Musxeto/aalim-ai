  "transcript": "let's analyze the prophecy in detail minutely book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 almighty God says I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee and I shall put my words into his mouth and he shall speak all that I command him let's take the prophecy and analyze it part by part first point is I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren the first point of the prophecy is that the prophet to come will be amongst the Brethren of Moses peace be upon him what is the meaning of the word brethren Brethren means the children of the brothers and we know from the Bible that Abraham peace be upon him had two sons the first son ISM peace be upon him who was the son from the second wife of prophet Abraham peace be upon him he was the son of hajra or Hagar the Second Son of Abraham peace be upon him was born approximately 17 years later his name was ishak or Isaac who was born to the first wife of Abraham peace be upon him that is Sarah may Allah be pleased with her so Abraham peace be upon him had two sons the children of both these Sons the children of ismile and the children of Isaac peace be upon them both they are Brethren unto one another they are the children of the brothers all the descendants of ishma they are Arabs and the descendants of Isaac are Jews that means the Jews and Arabs are Brethren unto one another so by analyzing the first point of the prophecy itself I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren that means the prophet should be a Brethren of Moses peace be upon Him Jesus Christ peace be upon Him wasn't a Brethren of Moses peace be upon him he was a Jew he was a descendant he was not a Brethren so the first point itself disqualifies all the Jews including Jesus Christ peace be upon him and we know that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him he was a descendant of ismaile peace be upon him that means he was a Brethren of the Jews including Moses peace be upon him so this first point of the prophecy that the prophet should be a Brethren the prophet that claimed prophethood after Isam from his descendant the first person was prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him furthermore if you analyze I shall raise them up a prophet from among thy Brethren like unto thee like Moses please be upon on him let us analyze whether Jesus is like Moses peace be upon them or whether the prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Moses peace be upon him I can list several similarities between Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them and several dissimilarities between Jesus and Moses peace be upon them Point number one Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them both had a mother and a father Jesus Christ peace be upon him had a mother but no father so Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them they are alike Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Moses peace be upon him and Jesus peace be upon Him is unlike Moses peace be upon him"
