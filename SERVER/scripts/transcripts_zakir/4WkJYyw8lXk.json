  "transcript": "what's your thoughts on children fasting the month of ramadan before they get to the age of puberty as i mentioned earlier it is not compulsory for a child who has not reached the age of puberty too fast it's not complexity they're exempted as the beloved prophet muslim said in hadith number 143 a beloved prophet said that the pen has been lifted up from three categories of people a child until he reaches puberty a sleeping person until he wakes up and a person who's insane until he becomes a sound mind so these three categories of people the beloved prophet said that the pen has been lifted that means it's not obligated on them too fast same as prayer also they are obliged but it's good to encourage our children to fast as early as possible though it's not compulsory and there's a hadith which is mentioned in say bihari volume number three in the book of fasting hadith number 1960 where the beloved prophet muslim he tells the people of ansar he sends the messenger and tells them to inform that those who are fasting they should continue fasting those who are not fasting should fast till the end of the day and after that the people the sahaba they said we fasted and we even asked our children to fast and we took them to the massages and if they cried we gave them toys or full so that keep themselves busy till the time of star that means this is how the sahabas they encourage the children to fast at an early age though it was not compulsory and this is a good habit but many a time that we see nowadays that many of the parents they discourage the children from fasting even if the child is enthusiastic and say down too fast many parents say at this young age it's not required don't fast they fail to realize that fasting at a young age will not cause them any harm in fact it will give them a training to fast when they reach puberty and allah says in the quran in surat harim chapter number 66 verse number 6 oh you believe save yourself and your families from the torment of hell fire whose fuel is men and stones allah is reminding the people that don't only save yourself even your children from the hellfire whose fuel is men and stones so it is good to encourage our children to fast at an early age and that's what we do in the school that we are running the islamic international school we encourage them to fast at an earlier even when they are in junior kg or in senior kg at the age of four five six to encourage them and at this age the age of four five six we say that the person who fasts the maximum in the class will get a gift will get a reward and that encourages them and when they reach standard first that is approximately the age of six alhamdulillah most of the children passed the full month and by the time they reached standard third that's about seven eight years almost all of them passed the full month of ramadan there's some compulsory so alhamdulillah and when they see other children fasting imagine most of the parents they tell them that it's not required but the children they force that we want to fast because of competition because of seeing their friends all of them fasting so if they don't fall they feel ashamed though it's not further than them but the atmosphere you create we don't tell them it is far too fast with atmosphere of competition the atmosphere of loving each other and loving the religion loving allah and as a soul so in this way alhamdulillah like it is said in hadith said mentioned in tirimedi that when a child reaches the age of 7 we should teach him to offer salah and at the age of 10 you can even use force so that means scholars say we can do the same thing even for fasting but we start at a much earlier age but it is not forced that we use love affection and gifts and rewards and alhamdulillah it has a tremendous effect on the children"
