  "title": "What is your Opinion Regarding the Extravagantly Luxurious Service (eg. Hotels) in Makkah?",
  "transcript": "uh I recently visited for umra and I have some observation so could you please tell me about this I find that uh oh there lot of uh luxurious type of thing is been pushup instead of a very neat and clean environment like lot of luxurious things the hotel charges fantastic like 800 R per day which any ordinary city in the world will not have that type of situation so Islamic is there any step taken to this extra luxuries and all that because every Muslim has right to go to this place and if the things are put to the right channel uh many people will take the advantage of this is there any concrete uh attention is given to this issues because there is lot of uh extravision expenses and other things which should be not there in a holy place like Mecca and uh even if you see in India there is a in any other religion they have the saying musaf or a place where people can say normal at very economical rates and all that so why don't you put some uh efforts to this he was asked the question that when he went for umra he found that the rates of per day in staying hotel is very exorbitant 800 yards which is very high brother let me tell you one thing I do agree the rates are only High during the season during the month of Hajj during Haj period is very expensive and during the month of Ramadan these two are the only time when the rates escalate well that's the time when more pilgrims come to the ho city of Makkah and Madina otherwise in offseason it is one of the cheapest in the world 800 R what we're talking about the peak season so the rates in hotels close to the Haram is one of the most expensive in the world and one of the cheapest in the world 800 is nothing what we talking about 800 is about festar Hotel so 800 R comes to about 10,000 rupees so if you take the rates of the festar hotel close to the Haram where the makah Madina in offseason it is the cheapest in the world cheapest in the world I'm telling you that you can even stay for 150 R 2,000 rupes no five you get even for th000 rupees off season 125 R I'm telling you that five hot but in season 2,000 3,000 Y which becomes the most expensive in the world your question should have been um should have been Hajj umra normally done in offseason except umra during Ramadan that time during the last 10 days it's sometimes even more expensive even than HJ season but during the other times of umra it is very cheap a poor person can even stay in a festar hotel during offseason if you want to do now coming to a question during H is expensive fail to realize that according to me after seeing the facility the Saudi government has given for Haj I'm seeing because of the Saudi government it is even possible for a very poor man to do Hajj the facility the Saudi government gives if you see the harine both the harmain the facility they have the toilets they have provided imagine more than 2 million people coming for Haj at one time during Ramadan and the facility they toilet they have put reti marble in toilet po people don't get to live in reti Marble in toilet they marble they escalators and they take only a few so as far as the airfare is concerned number one the government subsidize airfare now because the Saudi government subsidized the rate for the Saudi Alliance the other airlines for competition they're forced to subsidize so even the non-muslim airlines are subsidizing now why because Saudi Arabia started that so Saudi Arabian said that if you're coming for um for we give 25% discount sometime they give 40% discount now because Saudi Airlines does that the other airlines are forced to do it so they don't bother about the Muslims but if they don't do then they lose business so they say let the rate come down and we have more flights so they subsidized actually they're making business but if you normally have to go to Saudi Arabia it will cost you 29,000 rupees normal Fair up and down from Bombay during um and it cost 21,000 subsidized one3 so first point number one that fair is subsidized Point number two the facility given by government the tax the government takes for is negligible that subsidized as far as staying is concerned eating is very cheap eating you will get all types of food Mah very cheap Pakistani food this food that food fast food everything now staying what you're talking about the rates is the hotels very close to the Haram har now if your budget doesn't provide you you take a hotel which is far I know even during HJ season there are hotels which are costing 50 a day so whether you're staying close to the har whe five star hotel or small hotel even if you take close to the Herman the cost of the land is expensive the cost of hand is expensive so even if it's not a festar hotel is expensive if you stay in a hotel close to the Haram even if it's not F star if it's not, it will at least be 400 you understand because the land is expensive why the land is expensive because Goose to the Haram so the moment a poor man when he goes he can very well take a hotel which is half a kilometer away or 1 kilomet what's the problem and the facility of the government is so good that you can spend the full day in Haram without any problem so we should thank the facilities given by the government that it is even possible for a poor man to perform Hajj otherwise if there was no facilities only the air ticket because now you're going to H 50,000 Rupees you understand only the a ticket cost about 29 30,000 with the airport tax 30,000 it's because of the package so if you go in a group if you go as an individual it will be expensive if you have the money Allah has given you the money you can go as individual stay in a five star so there are trips going for H for one month so one month you're living lodging boarding everything for $30,000 Rupees is dirt cheap 1,000 a day you're paying actually for traveling internal jeda to Makkah to Madina and back where will you get 1,000 a day if you go to America and you want to spend 1,000 a day when you go to sodc trips they're so expensive so if you compare that with the Haram for 30 days average you are spending less than 1,000 rupees sometimes you're spending 800 rupees including traveling including eating including staying in a good hotel close to the Haram there are cheap TOS which will cost only hardly 600 rupees a day now 600 rupees a day for eating staying and traveling is very cheap in a foreign country it is mention in the Quran that when you're going for Hajj when you're going for Hajj you take some cloth in India which is not available there you can very well take that cloth sell it and the government gives you permission so while you're doing H many people do it free because they take stuff and they spend a few hours a day selling it and they recover the cost people even make money so that is no problem so in Haj if you cannot afford it you can even do business you can take some material and sell it then many people do it many of the people they get material so these are the facilities Allah in the Quran and by the government have to appreciate now to say that why do they Char doesn't make sense even a poor man can go and there are more poor people coming for than rich people more poor people are coming for from different parts of the world they do the saving and alhamdulillah have to thank so all the types of facilities there in the har where the Mak Madina big hotels are there cheap hotels are there there are jamat also there b jamat there are several so many MF there if you don't know about it that's your problem there are many MF not only in the Haram even in cities in Bombay the mfit is going to the dogs it just lying waken who's to blame we are to blame one thing is there that you have to realize that you go and tell the Saudi government why did you put m in the toilet they want to give you free you should go and tell the Saudi government why did you put itti marble in the toilets how many people live in itti marbles so alhamdulillah they want to serve the Hai because they feel that serving the gives you Bara now when you do a trip from jeda to Madina and back in the bus they charge you 130 which is not possible 150 R is only for going and coming how is it possible then I inquired they came to know there many rich people who say that whatever the cost is we'll pay half so when you paying 130 which for 3 Days going to Madina and coming back with the air condition bus the normal bus F when you go 150 how can 130 it doesn't make sense so when I inquired they told me that whatever what the cost is 50% is paid by rich people they say we want to subsidize it so if they want to subsidize it why go in air condition bus the rich people they want to spend their money in serving the hajis alhamdulillah so there's some rich man who is subsidizing some people come and tell me you know so cheap the expensive because the rich people in Raman what they say whatever the cost will pay half so if the cost is approximately 8,000 rupees or it is 6,000 rupees they say we'll pay half so you get 3,000 R it is Subs by somebody so when they want that let the hajis get facilities let the people who come for Ramadan get facility so are you objecting if you don't want it don't take it so don't go in the tour you can go individually the thing is that the facility given by the people out there alhamdulillah because they respect the hajis alhamdulillah we have to appreciate that and we have to say that mashallah you can stay in a good hotel also sometime at cheap rate sometime if you don't have the money you can stay in the cheapo or if you have the money you can stay in the season and explain about hope that answer the question now of AR uh he has dedicated a building and yeah and the people can go and stay free down there and I think even n of Hyderabad has done it maybe he's not aware adding more information he's right that n of Hyderabad that that time he used to give zaka to Saudi Arabia NAD they to send zakat they us to send money to Saudi Arabia now it is the opposite so they have got many of their own places to stay which is free but again that's limited so maybe the place room maybe 50 or 100 so booking is there so people are staying free there are many people live arod of Madras he has got his own place where people can go and stay their free there even AB has got even a has got there are many trusts which have got and they they give free some people charge nominal so depending upon if you want to can a there's a reason so many poor people can also perform alh Al hope that the question"
