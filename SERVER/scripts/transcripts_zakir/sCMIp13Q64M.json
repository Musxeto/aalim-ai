  "title": "Will there be a Uniformity of Faith in this World - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good afternoon Dr I got to know you yesterday and I try to watch some of your videos on YouTube and I try as much as possible to listen to you today when you speak so I respect your faith and being a veteran in the Fai so sir I'm not here to comp compete with you as a veterans and I'm not here to argue because I know this issue that we are actually talking about as let yes sir I'm not giving speech okay so the question I want to ask is that could there be a way that there is going to be a generation or this Our Generation that we are going to come to the position of uniformity of faith that's all thank you asked a very good question that is there going to be a time in our generation where there'll be uniformity of Faith yes there will be Quran says that when will we all believe in one faith today we know because people are misguiding and there have to be to know what is Tru you have to verify that's what I've come so we believe believe as I told you Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim unless he believes in Jesus Christ peace be upon Him does the church say you have to believe in Prophet Muhammad no so only where uniformity can come we believe in all the prophets of mentioned in the bible we only tell you take one step forward believe in Prophet Muhammad and Prophet Muhammad has been prophesized in the Bible in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 19 in the book of Isaiah chapter number 12 verse number 29 in the song of Salomon chapter number 5 verse number 16 he also prophet in the New Testament he prophesies in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 in the Gospel of John chapter number 15 verse number 16 in Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 11 in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 11 to4 I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you un all truth he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak so for uniformity there should be similarities so only way you can get uniform is by following the true teachings of Jesus Christ not the teaching of the church so if you study the Bible analytically and follow the Bible only not the church not putting words and trying to say Jesus said he's God never did he said that because of this wrong teaching of the church they can never be uniformity in Islam I cannot be a Muslim until I believe Jesus is a messenger until Adam is a messenger until Moses is a messenger I have to believe so uniformity is coming from Islam side not from the church and will it happen yes it will happen I ended my speech by quoting a verse of the Quran which is mentioned thce in Surah 9 verse number 33 in Surah fat 48 verse 28 and Surah chter 61 verse number [Music] n that Allah sent his messenger Prophet Muhammad with guidance and the of Truth so that it will pril over all the other religions all all theisms whether it be atheism communism socialism christianism Buddhism Hinduism Islam is distin to supersede all master them all how much the idol worshiper don't like it and enough is Allah a witness and the Hadith says there will be a time before the world ends for seven years Islam will rule the world for seven years where they happen after 5 years after 10 years after 50 years I don't know but there will be a time when the world will be very peaceful for 7 years that's the saying of the Prophet whether it happen after 5 years 10 years 30 years I don't know but going to happen hope answer the question brother do you believe that God is one do you believe God is one do you believe Jesus Is God or he's the messenger of God he's no God but no that means you didn't listen to my talk you heard the you heard my question answer with the earlier person and that's did you I heard it but didn't I tell you nowhere does Jesus said he's God nowhere correct correct there are two Lord one can be Lord or human being no problem but Lord has God know you know we call like how you go in UK UK to title you give Lord so and so so that Lord no problem you go to the court and you call the judge me Lord no problem so there are two types of Lord one is human being Lord one is God lord you call him human being you call him God I'm asking you in English language when you open the dictionary in English brother look at here English English language if you open the dictionary Lord has two meaning one is human being like the judge a respected person you call him Lord no problem the second meaning is God so are you talking Jesus Christ is a respected human being or is he God yeah um if you are talking about his Earthly work we can refer to him as Lord but there's also a Divinity dimension of him being Lord Lord overall that means you are just like the other people heard I gave you so many references my father's greater than all my father is greater than I I can of my own self do nothing I can of my own self do nothing Jesus Christ said I can do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek the will of my father all these verses clearly show that you was a human being he was not God so why do you want to give Divinity to him no problem thank you that means you don't want the world you don't want the world to unite you don't want the world to unite you are you are disuniting the world you are disuniting the world I have come here to unite the world people like you they disunite the world the Bible doesn't says God yet you want to say God so you are helping those people who don't want to unite the world I am a d no did Jesus said he's God neither in the Quran neither in the Bible yet Christian like you you want to disunite humanity I'm sorry to say you may respect me but I don't respect you because you are here to disunite the human being when Jesus is very clearly saying in the Bible in the Quran worship Allah my Lord and your yet to say Jesus is Lord thank you brother the most welcome next question sir thank you I told you I understand unless you don't change your statement you can go please can we have the next question please"
