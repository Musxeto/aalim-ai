  "title": "Can Repentance be Accepted if the Hadd Punishment is not executed? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya next question is is repentance accepted if the had punishment is not carried out on a person as I mentioned earlier that a person should realize that the Bounty of Allah subhana wa ta'ala his mercy and Grace is in abundance and if you commit a crime if it involves some other people then you have to restore the property back like if you have Rob then give the wealth back if you're taking something from someone give it back but if it is between you and Allah subhana tala a person should never be dissatisfied he should never think that Allah will not forgive whatever sin he may commit let it be the biggest sin if he repents sincerely as we mentioned the last episode Allah will forgive any sin but if he has done some harm to some other human being then he should try and undo it and Allah says in the Quran in fan chapter number 25 verse number 68 and as for those who do not invoke with Allah any other God or do not take any life of any other human being unless for a just cause or do not indulge in adultery and for those who do it for them there is a punishment and Allah continues in the next verses in Surah furan chap 25 verse number 17 as for those who believe and repent and do righteous Deeds Allah subh will change the evil thing that he has done the evil deed he has done to good so that's the mercy of Allah subhana wa tala so as far as the penalty is concerned if it is a person who himself knows that he has done a sin for example if he has an adultery so he should repent for Allah subhana tala and ask for forgiveness it is between him and Allah subhana tala and it's not requ that he should tell to the others because if it's told then the punishment would be there fur mentioned Hadi of M Vol number two book of punishment Hadith number 12 the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that stop committing sins major sins Etc and if you commit then you have to conceal it and ask for forgiveness from Allah subhana T you repent and if you disclose it then we will have to pass the Hat penalty that means if the sin is known to the sultan or the ruler or to a or to a judge then it becomes compulsory for that person that he has to pass death penalty that is thring to death if he had an adultery or any other sin which requires the death penalty but if it's not known and the person who has sinned if it involves some other human being he should try and undo it if it is involvement between him and Allah subhana taala then he should ask for forgiveness and ask for repentance and he should concealed it's not a requirement that the punishment of had should be given to the person for repentance but we have the examples of ma Malik who repented and did not mind being killed for sake of Allah subhana Allah forgive them and the prophet said that even if you distribute it in the people of Madina it would be sufficient for them forgiveness but as a general rule it's not a requirement that you have to pass the had penalty for repentance if you're exposed then the penalty is there if you're not exposed conceal it and ask for forgive foress from Allah subhana tala and you repent and inshallah Allah will forgive you"
