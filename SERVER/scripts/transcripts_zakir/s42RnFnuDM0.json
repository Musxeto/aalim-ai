  "transcript": "hi my name is Anna I want to ask what happens to non-muslims who have never been exposed to Islam and what if a non-muslim says that the miracles of Jesus are bigger than the ones that Muhammad performed sisters asked two questions basically what are non-muslim who says who has never been exposed to Islam what happens to them and secondly if a non-muslim comes and says that the Miracles of Isa Alam are greater what happens to them Point number one if a non-muslim comes and tells me that they have not been exposed to Islam Today in this world of science and technology is difficult maybe if you ask this question 50 years back it was possible today in this age of Science and Technology especially the media bombarding misconception about Islam you're exposed to Islam maybe the wrong Islam maybe pseudo Islam that Muslims are terrorist Muslims are fundamentalist Islam is a religion of killing it degrades the woman it subjugates the women they may be exposed to Islam but wrong Islam now what happens to a non-muslim who's not exposed to the right teachings of Islam I feel if a non-muslim hears something in the media or any human being hears something in the media he should not take it for granted the Quran says inah 49: number 6 whenever you get information check it up before you pass it on to the third person whenever you get information it is important that a person checks up whether the information is right or wrong as far as The Message of Islam is concerned what if a non-muslim may be living in an island maybe living in timbu or living somewhere where he doesn't have any knowledge of Islam first it's the duty of every Muslim to convey the message non-muslim irrespective whether we convey or not Allah says in the Quran in Surah fil chapter number 41 verse number 53 Allah says that soon we shall show them our signs in the furest regions of the horizons until it is clear to them that this is the truth Allah says that he will show the signs to every human being before the human being dies he will show his signs in the furest regions of the horizons until it is clear to them that this is the truth so Allah takes it up upon himself that he will convey this message to each and every human being whether he's born in a Muslim family or non-muslim family whether he's born in a Muslim land or non-muslim land Allah will give this message to every human being that's the reason there were some surveys done 1950 in two tribes now these two tribes the kapaku tribe and the Austrian aborigin these two tribes did not come in contact with modern civilization till as late as 1950 when the researchers went and tried to find out what was their way of life these people they believed that God was one they believed he alone should be worshiped they believe he did not beget anyone they did the Sada they did prostration for worshiping that God it was everything of Islam but a name so when no external influence comes on the human being that person submits his will to God that's the reason a beloved Prophet MMI wasallam said every child is born in every child is born B in the innate religion he is born as a Muslim our beloved Prophet mammi wasallam said every child is born as a Muslim Muslim means a person who submits his will to God later on that person may be influenced by his parents by his teachers by his Elders he may start doing fire worship he may start doing idol worship and then may deviate on the wrong track that the reason when a non-muslim accepts Islam the more appropriate word is rever he was a Muslim born as a Muslim he getss converted to a wrong religion comes back to the original faith that is Islam so the right word is reward so coming to your question every child if any child if you take three children one born to a Christian one born to a Jew one born to a Hindu isolate these three children completely from any external influence and when they grow up and you try and find out what is their way of life it will be nothing but Islam only after external influence they start deviating and worshiping wrong things and having wrong ideas this is scientifically proven furthermore sister where your second question is concerned that what if someone doesn't know Islam and thinks that Jesus Christ did Miracles I do agree Jesus Christ did Miracles but sister Miracle is not the test if you believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him if you read in the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 24 verse number 24 he says that for there shall arise many false Christ and false prophets and will do wonders and miracles and if it for possible shall deceive the very elect so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says Miracle is not the test there shall arise many false Christ and false prophets and shall do wonders and miracles and if it were possible shall deceive the elect that means Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says Miracle is not the test Miracle does not make a person a god Miracle does not make a person Superior because all the Miracles that were done by all the prophets were done by almighty God himself all the Miracles all the Miracles that by Moses The Parting of the sea when he threw the stick it became into snake it was done by almighty God all the Miracles that Isa Alam Jesus Christ peace be upon him did were done by almighty God same with Prophet Muhammad peace be of splitting of the moon were done by almighty God I would tell you that Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of almighty God we believe that he was the Messiah transited Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christians today do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers with God's permission the Christians and the Muslims we are going together but one may ask then where is The Parting of ways The Parting of ways is that most of the Christians believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was almighty God they believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him claim Divinity in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God always is worship me a sister you can point out any unequivocal statement any unig statement from any version of the Bible in which Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or where he says worship me I am ready to accept Christianity [Music] Today in fact in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself said it's mentioned the the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number 5 verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of almighty God anyone who says I seek not my will with the will of almighty God he's a Muslim Jesus Christ peace be upon us a Muslim he never claimed Divinity he never said that he was almighty God he clearly mentioned it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 24 he said that the words that you hear are not mine but my fathers who has sent me it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number three this is life eternal so that you may know that is one God and Jesus Christ who thou has sent it clearly mentioned that Jesus Christ was a messenger it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chap 19 verse number 16 to8 that a person approaches Jesus Christ peace be upon him and asks him that good Master what good things should I do so that I shall enter eternal life so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says why thou callest me good leave aside God g o why thou callest me good g o d for there is only one good and that is the Father in heaven and if thou want to enter eternal life you keep the Commandments Jesus Christ didn't say that if you want to enter eternal life if you want to go to paradise believe I'm God he didn't say that you believe that I died on the cross for your sins what he said if you want to enter eternal life if you want to enter Paradise you keep the Commandments and it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 that e men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles which God did by him and you are witnessed to it what does it say Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you witness to it regarding a question of Miracles what does the Bible say book of Acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you witness to it so all the credit goes to almighty God and Jesus Christ was a man all the Miracles were done were done through almighty God so all the Miracles all the messengers did were done by almighty God they came to testify there was one God but Jesus Christ also said in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 that I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak he shall glorify me now this prophecy is prophesizing no one but the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so if if you're a true Christian and if you believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Jesus Christ peace be upon him said I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all tro he shall not speak of himself all that he he shall he speak he shall glorify me this prophecy is prophesizing no one but the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so if you're a true Christian you should believe in the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him hope the answer the question sister [Applause]"
