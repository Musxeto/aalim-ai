  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum my name is sadik I a student from Kata India my question is I invested money on a Halal company's shares 3 months earlier but recently I checked that the company has become Haram because interest bearing debt to total assets has exceeded to 43.7 5% due to which the stock has become Haram but previously the stock was Halal what should I do the question posed by brother sadik that he invest in halal shares and maybe he has knowledge about how to invest in stock which a Shar compliant and when he invested and when he bought these shares three months earlier these shares were Halal but now when he checked up he came to know that the interest bearing Ratio or the debt ratio has increased to more than 43.75% so now what should he do first if you have heard my answers on how do you come to know whether the stocks you're purchasing of a particular company sh compliant or not and there are five categories the first is that the core activity should be Halal and then you should see to it that they're not involved in any any interest bearing activity as a company which is giving loan on interest Etc then the cash and and the debt ratio should be less and the any Haram activity should be less than 5% these these were discussed in detail so the brother may have checked and he realized after 3 months that debt ratio has increased to more than 43% and that makes the share what should he do he should immediately sell the share sell the share and invest in a Halal share but while investing see to it that there are two types of sharia compliant one is that the company itself has a Sharia board and it is Sharia compliant by Nature by Nature means it has a board so investing in Sharia compant shares which has a Sharia board is the best in Malaysia where I live there are many Sharia compliant shares and it is there in the stock itself it mentioned Sharia compliant Halal okay not Shar compliant in India there are very few which are basically which have a Sharia board Etc hardly any but even if it doesn't have a Sharia board it can can be Sharia compliant by Nature because it may not be a debt company it may not be taking loans the the core activity may not be Haram it may be dealing with maybe Pharmaceuticals so by Nature it can be so some companies by Nature if they don't have a Sharia board also it can remain Halal but some company can keep on changing like the one you said you invest in a company and and that company has got involved into debt you know so in this you have to keep on monitoring but the best is to invest in shares which has invest in companies which has a Sharia board the second best would be by Nature if it's Sharia compliant you know that the company will not involve in taking loans from the bank and by Nature it is such a company it is a strong company it's a big company and it's involve in products which are Halal and then the third would be the company which may keep on changing so it is preferable to avoid investing in companies which can't change because they have to keep on monitoring and then if it's Haram you have to sell it so why let you invest even for a small period whether it be a month or whether it be a week so best is to involve in companies which have a Sharia board as I mentioned second best is by nature if sh compliant but now the solution for that C2 sell it immediately if you want to continue investing in Sharia compliant sh see to it that you invest in a company which has a Sharia board or by Nature it is Sharia compliant hope that answer the question"
