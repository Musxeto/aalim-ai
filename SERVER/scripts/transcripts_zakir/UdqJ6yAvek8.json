  "title": "The Purpose of Dr Zakir Naikâ€™s Announcing of Charity and Showing Luxury",
  "transcript": "the next question asked on the WhatsApp is we want to know what was your purpose of posting your photos flying in a private jet plane and traveling in a bulletproof car with so many Security on the social media during your lecture toward to Nigeria in November 2023 is this not showing off an extravagance we love you for your dawa not for your luxury and extravagance this is a very important question is referring to my lecture tour which was for two weeks to Nigeria from 29th of October to the 10th of November it was for about two weeks and the lecture was very successful and I remember that I posted on the social media twice that I flew on a private jet plane from sokoto to Aline once and second time from Aline to Abuja and when I posted this on my social media on the Facebook on the Instagram Etc there were thousands of comments and alhamdulillah most of them saying mashallah may Allah reward you you're doing a great word may Allah bless you may Allah give you more nyama more than 99% of the comments were all positive there was a small few comments maybe 00 1% of the thousands of comments that came and number very few who did say that why are you posting that you're flying in a private jet plane isn't it extravagance what is the purpose and that the reason I chose this question when it when it was asked that Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 271 that when you give charity and you announce about the charity you have given it is good but when you let your charity reach to the poor people in secrecy it is better so Allah says when you give charity you can keep it silent like the had says when your right hand gives the left hand should not know it's good but that doesn't mean announcing is not allowed depending on your purpose if your purpose is to show off then announcing is not good but if your purpose is to encourage others when you give charity and when you announce and you encourage others it's good because your main ni is so that other people also join in charity other people get so if your reason for announcing your charity is to show off that okay I've given charity it's not good better is to keep quiet but if you're announcing so more people join so it is better to announce than to keep silent and that's the reason you may be aware that just the two weeks earlier I won the case against one of the politician the former deputy chief minister too of Penang I want to case against him when he defame me he wrote articles against me and the court of Malaysia awarded me 1.52 million rings as damages that's equal to $320,000 us equal to 2.7 CR Indian rupees what I did and he already gave me the money on the 7th of November and I donated the complete amount for the Palestinian cause the reason I announced is so that it encourages the others also to take part that I have done and others will for it wasn't to show off similarly now when you analize that I did post twice on two occasions that I traveled in a private jet plane if you know my talks I always talk about Simplicity they should not be extravagance they should not be unnecessary luxury if you talk about extra waging let me tell you I did not pay a single penny for this private private jet plane the host was flying in the private jet plane there already 13 seats so me and my family joined them if you wouldn't have joined them maybe you would have to pay for the flight ticket by going by a conventional or a commercial plane so to say that I spend extra is totally wrong I did not spend extra I saved money so it's not extra at all but why did I post it if you see that always say and I tell the people that see to it that your life should be simple even though you can afford a business class travel and economic class and I do that by Allah's Grace I can afford to travel in first class but what I tell the people you travel in economic Class A business class normally is four to six times more expensive than economic class if you TR an economic class with little bit discomfort it's not very bad you can give that amount in charity and that's what I do in my full life only on one occasion when there was an emergency I had to be to that City and there was no tickets available in economy I traveled only once in my full life in the last 30 years of my travel have I paid for a business class that's a different thing that when I'm called as a guest of the government and they give me a ticket in business class in first class I've traveled a lot I've been doing private jet play many times and empty number of times not that I asked for it the reason is because today the world has become a global village and you find that there's a trend that you see in the social media whether it be Facebook whether it be Instagram WhatsApp YouTube that people try and look for role models and we find that unfortunately most of the people that people follow they are that those who are not on the straight PA whether they be rock singers whether uh they be actors whether they may be dancers whether pop singers or maybe Sportsmen Etc so what we find that this trend is there so the reason at it is that alhamdulillah by the grace of Allah subhana wa tala in the post it alhamdulillah masallah that the grace of Allah subh when you find that normally these things happen with those celebrities you know which people look up to so here my reason mean was post it to see that Allah subhah wa ta'ala gives the N even to his servants so the main reason was not to show off the main reason was to tell to the world that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala when you work in the path of Allah subhana wa ta'ala when you strive in the path of Allah subhana wa ta'ala when you go to spread his message Allah not only gives you blessings in the Allah gives you in this world as Allah says in the Quran that if you stri for this this dun Allah says in Bak chapter number 2 verse number 200 that if you strive for this dun Allah will give you the dun but will not give you AK and Allah said that if you stri for Allah G so I'm just telling the world that I'm a d i have sacrificed my life for Allah subhana wa tala I'm doing it for but see the goodness of Allah subhana wa ta'ala see the N of Allah subhana wa ta'ala that inshallah inshallah Allah will give me inshah we pray for that we don't know but we pray for that but Allah is even giving me in this Dunya how many people in the world have traveled in a Jet Plane maybe 0 1% out of the 8 billion people that are there the percentage that may have traveled in a jet plane is surely 00 1% so imagine Allah we not doing for this I have never ever paid only once for a business class never paid for a first class though we can afford it Allah has given us the N so the reason is to show that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala even blesses those people who are striving the way what we have today is that we look up to role models and the best role model for the Muslim is mhammad Salli wasallam our beloved Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alhi wasallam is the best role model and after that the other ambas the second category of role model are the they are the second after theas mham number one then the other then we have the rash they are the second best then we have the saas these role models of the past then we have role models of the recent past then we have the role model which are living so when we look up the reason that we see today is that it happened in the past okay we know regarding the earlier answer that we know that Allah gave Victory to the people who are weak in the past what about today that happened maybe 1400 years ago 1,000 years ago maybe few thousand years ago talking about David and go talking about Battle of bad but Allah has given example even we know about the Taliban for more than 20 years the most richest country the most powerful country in the world they tried to destroy them they spent more than a trillion dollars but yet the Taliban were one of the weakest in the world they were victorious here you see that it is an example that people strive in the way of Allah subhana wa ta'ala we don't go for luxury we don't but Allah gives it so the purpose of mine was just to show the N that Allah has given to a person who's walking in his path and the reason I said that we traveled in a bulletproof car with Securities we could see that there were empty number of security in Nigeria not that someone going to attack me alhamdulillah people in Nigeria love me but this is a protocol that not only do do they give the protocols to the head of States Etc but even to die I remember when I went to Gambia the amount of respect that the president of Gambia gave me his main Chief protocol officer said that no one the protocol that you have got even the heads of T don't get I went to Indonesia and I could see that when I landed when I reached my hotel after every 50 m there was a policeman so from the time my destination where I landed to my destination that is the hotel there were hundreds or thousands of policemen on the street I was shocked never ever have I been in such a protocol that there are policemen every 25 50 Metter throughout for so many kilometers I was shocked so this is the love so this is the of Allah subhana tala to show to the world that you strive in the way of Allah subhana tala Allah gives you honor we have the celebrities you know these pop stars the singers the 1 million followers 5 million followers 10 million followers 20 million followers so Allah Allah subhana wa ta'ala also can give a DI millions of followers whether it be on the Facebook whether it be on the YouTube so when we say alhamdulillah that on my Facebook there are 23.7 million followers there is no English speaker religious speaker in the world whether it be a Hindu or a Christian or a Muslim that Allah has given more than 23 million followers and alhamdulillah it's a blessing from Allah subhana wa taala it is not to show off it is to show that you strive in the way of Allah subhana wa ta'ala Allah open the pathway so when I posted me flying a private jet plane which a small percentage 0 1% of the people in the world have done it or having a bulletproof car with so much security it's an honor it's a protocol so the reason was to show to the world that the honor that Allah gives you in this world and so it is to give an indication to the Muslims that you strive in the path of Allah subhana wa ta'ala you strive for Allah will give and this dun also so that was my only purpose that is the reason more than 99% of the comment said mashallah may Allah Grant you more they understood the reason there may be 0 1% of the people like the question oppos that what was the purpose they don't understand the hikma of Allah subhana tala because I always tell and I tell that you know a person should have a low profile and I tell that Allah subhana tal has blessed me Allah has blessed me even in this dun but in spite of that we on a low profile and I've told that many times in my lecture that I own a Toyota Inova car that is the maximum I said I cannot buy a more expensive car than this why because I feel above this will not be good it's not Haram Allah has blessed me when I am earning millions of ring and millions of real every year so eily I can afford a Mercedes or I can even afford a Rolls Roy the amount that Allah has blessed me but I own a Toyota Inova that's the maximum I think above this will not be good it's not right but we know that we started business in Qatar during the World Cup that is last year in 2022 and we started a luxury car company in Qatar for the World Cup and it happened to be the largest luxury rent car and by Allah's Grace we owned 134 luxury cars from the top models from Rolls-Royce Lamborghini Bentley Bentley Flying Spur Benta May back Mercedes 450 we had the POR alhamdulillah that is for business imagine the cheapest car that I had in my peace renter car that was there the cheapest car was three times more expensive than the car I own for my private use in NOA Toyota three times more expensive so much so that when I went to meet my daughter in I took the lowest car that is Mercedes E-Class E200 the cheapest car in my fleet because hiring outside I had to pay money it was available so I took the cheapest car and I thought to it that I travel in the lowest car if I'm using my car I could have traveled in the best of cars and now I've purchased a more cheaper car so that if I travel it should be a cheaper car but when a d comes and I made at a point that now since the World Cup is over the business is not really very lucrative but I yet maintained it so that there's no profit no loss but at the same time any D that comes to qar whether he be an Arabic D or English Dy if he is a Islamic worker these cars are complimentary and many times many D have come from different parts of the world we give them the best of cars not luxury car super luxury car they sit in a mayag they sit in a Bentley imagine hiring a Bentley or a mayback or a roll Roy for a day it is 9,000 r that is 25,000 of course for a normal person is it's extravagant but that's business we are catering to the multi-millionaire or the billionaire so that's a niche market but when a d comes I give him free for me it's costing me only a cost of the petrol because the car is there the driver is there if no one comes yet the car is there no cost so for me the cost is only of a petrol which may be 60 R maybe $15 so I give the best car to the D depending upon the D and they have never sat most of the D in these highend luxury cars so I want to honor them it is not for luxury extravagant it's because you're a d I give you free of course you cannot afford $25,000 a day it's too expensive your a ticket economic class would be cheaper than that from whichever part of the world you come to qar it will surely be less than $25,000 for one day and where there for one week we give them full so one of the reason that we have maintained this rent a car in qar is to give free service to the D of course traveling or using these super luxury cars like Rolls-Royce Lamborghini Bentley very few people have the thing but I personally don't sit in these cars though we own it it's the company is in the name of my son it's not in my name but I'm just giving an example we want to honor the D so similarly when people who own the Jet Plane I remember when a person had sent his jet plane in South Africa to collect me I said that instead of that cost of that you can give donation they say no no I give to celebrities what better Saab can I give than to give a d like you in the world so here Allah is giving his n so when we have these postings besides the hundreds of other posting this is just twice a couple of question each time to show to the world that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is blessing a person who works in his path it is an example for the people that this is the n Allah gives you in the as well as the D so it is just to show to the world that Allah subhana tala takes care of you you see to it that you don't be extravagant yourself in your life but Allah will yet give you luxury so it's a blessing that my children we have traveled in various countries in the world they have been in the best of hotels five star six star Seven Star 10 star hotel they have been there at the same time they have they have been to the low hotels we have trained them that they should be ready as a d to be prepared to lead a life a simple life that's the reason I've said many times that me personally for me and my wife our monthly expenditures only $500 only $500 so that we keep our lifestyle low but on for the cause of Allah subhana tala when we travel we see to it that we spend in the way of Allah tal and Allah is giving us so all this is this is because of the grace of Allah subhana tala so the main purpose of putting the post whether it be the private jet planes or the security or the bulletproof C is to show that Allah is blessing his servants and we thank Allah subhana wa ta'ala we are doing it for the but Allah gives you AK and this dun also hope this answer the question"
