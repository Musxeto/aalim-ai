  "title": "David Wood does not have the Calibre to Debate Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "the fourth question is from sohag ahmad sir please debate with david woods or say something to him as he says lot of rubbish things about you and other islamic scholars this person suhar gehma then few other muslim brothers have been continuously asking this question that oh why dr zakir naik not debating with david woodson and they keep on asking this question several times and i didn't think it was important but now finally i've taken the question to give them the reason first you have to understand that anyone that challenges the person it's not required that you should accept the challenge as far as you realize there are many non-muslims who are becoming famous just by trying to criticize a popular person generally it's a general rule whether muslim or non-muslim if he criticizes the popular personality or a celebrity that person becomes famous this is a common thing it's nothing new so because of that david woods one of the christians who has spoken against me and spoken against some of the other muslim scholars and tries to challenge them why i have not accepted such challenges the reason is that first of all we should not give publicity to such people that's the reason i didn't want to answer this question then i thought of answering the question without taking the name of david woods if you go to david wood's youtube you find that he has spoken against me and those videos that made against me get views more than a million or close to a million so we're giving him free publicity there was a time when i was involved in the dawah in my initial stages in the early 90s and the internet was new in the midline the internet were new and when i went to america in the mid 90s one of the first sites that was against muslims was answering islam and the person who used to run the site was joshin tex and that time we were new in the field of dawah and when anyone wrote against islam i have to go out of the way and reply to them anyone wrote against me as to reply to them and then i realized the moment we replied to them you have another 10 count of questions so what we realized that my positive work is being stopped if really that question is a logical question or a question that deserves a reply should be replied but these frivolous arguments at that time when i was new i told josh and cats that okay do you wanna debate with me you're writing against islam he said do you think i'm a fool to debate for dr zakir naik that was his reply so if you see in the initial stages of my dhawa in the late 90s in the early 2000s i had many debates and then i realized that debating is not the best it should be done when required but better is to talk about give lectures on similarities between sam and christianity similarity between islam and hinduism but when required yes and one of the best debaters in the world you know but then we realized that there were people who started challenging me and one such person was from usa again i'll tell you his name sam shamoon samsham and when i went to chicago i wanted i said send your guru and then i had a debate with his guru dr william campbell and when i accepted this debate i was called by the students of usa that dr william campbell wrote a book quran and bible in the light of science and he took out about 30 scientific errors in the quran and for eight years no muslim replied so this book was doing a great damage for the tawa of the muslims and no one replied so i took up the challenge i read the book and i went and debated with and alhamdulillah in chicago there were two groups among the muslims one group was against the debate what is this no one replied and now the zakir who is this young man coming from india how will he reply so have the muslims go against the debate and have the muslim word for alhamdulillah the debate took place in chicago and allah's help was there allah's mercy was there and for the very successful debate so much so that after that alhamdulillah william campbell who got a doctorate in writing a book against islam mashallah it lost its popularity later on then i made a policy that after my video started becoming popular then i had ruled i will only debate with those people who are popular then we realized that those people are not popular started challenging to become popular and i'll give you a very good example you know sheikh ahmed he debated with jimmy's forget and jamie swaggart that time was one of the most popular televangelists he was multiple times more popular than sheikh hamad many people told him don't go he will chew you and spit you but alhamdulillah had the help of allah and he gave a knockout to jimmy's forget we have another example he debated with anis rosh and his suraj wasn't known at all but when anee soros debated with sheikh hamadi that ahmad did that alhamdulillah won him lost stock and barrel but anis became popular so what we realized that when you debate with someone who's popular and an unpopular person debates with the popular person the unpopular person becomes famous overnight so why should we make the unpopular christian missionary that's popular so then i had a policy that anyone wants to debate with me should minimum have at least two percent of the audience that i have in my largest gathering and earlier i said that anyone who can gather 10 000 people individually for lecture i will debate after that there was a middle person who requested him to debate with srishidavishankar and you know shishiravishankar is one of the most famous hindu preachers in the world one of the most it comes in number one two and three and he has a large following he has addressed audience of twenty thousand fifty thousand alums i accepted the challenge and we had a debate in year 2006 in january in his hometown bangalore and allah's help was that a very successful debate the topic was concept of god in hinduism and islam in the light of sacred scriptures since 2006 there are many people who challenge me for a debate and when anyone challenges me i say that i don't waste my time there are hundreds of people who address large audiences they're very popular and my largest gathering that i have given a lecture is previously was in kerala then it was in krishan ganji bihar where more than a million people attended so two percent of a million is 20 000. so my criteria was i would not mind debating any non-muslim on any topic of comparative religion as long as he can gather minimum 20 000 people for his live lecture not a conference in conferences there are 20 30 speakers they might not have come for him particularly so if a person gives a solo lecture and if they can get audience of 20 000 people live not on the youtube not on the facebook twenty thousand live sitting then i don't mind debating and what i'm asking is not something which is difficult there are hundreds of hindu preachers in india who have audiences more than twenty thousand there are hundreds of christian missionaries who have audiences more than twenty thousand so i tell if people like sam shamoon or people like david woods want to have a debate let them become popular why do they want to ride on my bandwagon and if you can't get that gathering only thing you have to do is convince with your material any other christian preacher there are many franklin graham is there billy graham is there more cereal is there there are many there are 100 speakers that i know in christianity who have given live lectures to more than 20 000 people what you have to do is catch one of them and convince them that your material against me is logical and give it to them i will have a debate with them why should i make you famous overnight i heard one or two of his videos that zakin like is a joke it is what he's talking is rubbish but the moment i reply to him he becomes famous that's the reason i was avoiding handling this question because now the moment i take the name of david wood most of the people hearing me tonight may not be aware of david woods a small percentage maybe they will go and check he will become famous and let me tell you there are many other people there was adai by the name of muhammad hijab and he came to meet me malaysia last year and he's a fan of man he's a good guy he personally had a debate with david woods i have not seen the video i was supposed to watch but some of my colleagues saw it and they told that brother muhammad hijab he gave david woods a knockout so when others can do the job why should i waste my time that's the reason previously we used to reply on the internet now we don't because the moment you reply they'll give a counter reply and your work of positive dawah suffers so that's the reason anyone who wants to debate me this criteria is there give it to a celebrity give it to a famous personality he will not be a fool to debate with me today if someone gives the million dollar to shishir vishankar he will never agree to already bid with me again he knows that even if you give two million dollars to him he will not because he's a celebrity he will lose his following and you already lost many many people in that debate who were his followers who called him god they accepted islam so that's the reason i require david wood to convince any of these hundred christian missionaries who are popular who can have audience of more than 25 convince them if we cannot convince them why does he want to have a debate with him when he cannot convince his own christian brother that the material office is enough to answer my lectures why is he wasting his time these people are only riding on the popularity of other people otherwise he's unknown and i request the muslim brothers please don't waste your time please don't waste your time the person who asked me this question should have in fact known that brother muhammad hijab he had a debate with him and i already answered him so why should you make david wood popular so hope this answers the question and because i made this criteria that since 2006 in the last 14 years no one has ever wanted to debate me one of the fans of sadhguru told me will you debate satguru and satguru is a popular person is not as popular shankar but it's popular i don't okay i accept it i know he's popular okay if you want to debate with me i'm not interested in debating he wants to debate he wants to speak against islam wants to challenge me i'll accept it because if he challenges me and if allah's help is there and we present the truth and answer to all his illogical arguments but naturally he will lose his following so if people like sad guru or someone who's popular want to challenge on any topic of islam and comparative religion which i deal with i accept the challenge hope that answers the question"
