I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number five verse number 30. I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God is a Muslim so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him submitted his will to God he was a Muslim he never said he was God he's clearly mentioned in the Gospel of John Chapter 14 verse number 24 Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says that the words that you hear are not mine but my father who has sent me and it's clearly mentioned the book of Acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 even of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you are witness to it so Jesus Christ is a man a proof of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did Bam and you have witness to it so from the Bible you come to know that Jesus Christ was one of the most beloved messengers of almighty God we love him we respect him do we follow his teachings if you compare What DJ Sky peace be upon him said in the Bible I told that yesterday that we Muslims we follow more of the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Jesus Christ according to Gospel of Luke he was circumcised on that day we Muslim the circumcised most of the Christians Jesus Christ peace be upon him said you have to follow each and every law Gospel of Matthew chapter 5 verse number 17 everything of the Old Testament you can't bake one law or daughter as I mentioned in my speech it's mentioned in the book of Deuteronomy Chapter 14 verse number eight in the book of Isaiah chapter 65 verse two to five and the Book of Life tickets chapter number 11 verse number seven to eight that you should not have spoke we Muslim don't have poke but most of the Christians have spoke it's mentioned book of Ephesians chapter 5 verse number 18 Book of Proverbs chapter 20 verse number one you should not have alcohol Muslim don't have alcohol but Christians have alcohol so if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him when we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves so if you become a true Christian and truly follow the teachings of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ peace be upon him said in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number seven it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the Comfort I shall not come for if I go shall I send him it's mentioned the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for even the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide to unto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that dear shall speak he shall glorify me verbatim quotation from the Bible King James version so Jesus Christ is prophesying about the coming of the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him if you are a true Christian if you truly believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him you have to believe in the last and final messenger Prophet mama so if you're a true Christian you hope to answer the question sister thank you"
