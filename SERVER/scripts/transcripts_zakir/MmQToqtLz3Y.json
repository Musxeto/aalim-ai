  "title": "Is it Permissible for Muslim Children to play PUBG and other Video Games? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "India there is a very popular video game known as pubg pubg that is spreading all over the world and it has nowadays become an addiction to all people that everyone plays it continuously every day everyone plays it continuously every day mashallah recently the new updated version of this video game came out in which a person has to glorify ideas in the game to gain weapons and Power is it haram or sharik to play this kind of game or is it okay if any Muslim plays this kind of game in which we have to glorify idols a similar question is posed by Abdullah from New Jersey USA is it permissible to play video games our first answer the second question and then answer the first question as far as video games are concerned there is a revolution in the past few years and passed through the kids I remember when I was a teenager maybe about 35 years back there were video game Palace where we had to pay some money and we could for a few minutes maybe drive a car so those sort of video games which were there 30 35 years back not that I was a fan of video games but I did play a few times in my life so those are games which is for entertainment and I feel there is no problem at all but in the passage of time today we find that there is a revolution and there's a lot of changes that have come and when you read articles about the video games unfortunately most of these video games the reason is that many of these video games they are mixed with elements which are prohibited in Islam I'll give a few examples for example there are video games which in which there are a lot of killing and the more number of people you kill the more marks you get and you become a winner some of the killing the unnecessary it's murder and murder in Islam killing any innocent human being is the second major sin in Islam there are some video games which glorify witchcraft which is the third major sin in Islam there are some video games which are attacking Islam and the video game says that if you bomb Makkah then you get thousand points if you bought Madina then you get 500 points and there are some games which show that there is a non-muslim country fighting with the Muslim country and the Muslim country is normally the weaker country and if you defeat the Muslim country you win the game so these sorts of games which are building Islam and are criticizing Islam and against the prince of Islam all these are Haram there are many video games in which there is nudity today if you have most of the car racing game I'm told I read articles in between you'll find ladies coming which are not properly dressed they come in bikini they come instantly dressed clothes bodies most in all this is Haram there is Unity there is obscenity even in sports you find obsidity invariably not there just to make the game more popular you have games in which there is gambling they have dreamed with the drinking of alcohol so all these things the Haram even though you may not be drinking yourself physically but virtually if it's involving or Haram activity that game is Haram it takes the children away from Islam and unfortunately unfortunately there are many Muslim parents who willingly buy such game for the children he's not drinking what's the problem he's not killing anyone that just in a game these parents are actually taking the children away from Islam they are ruining their life if anyone will be a responsible is not the child or the parents and today if they want to get rid of the child or they want to keep the child quiet they give them the mobile phone so that you know the child is busy with the mobile phone and the parents can do what they want they can do they can do their work on the social media and what's happening they give mobile phone to a small child of four years five happy my child can operate the mobile you are ruining your child what is so great in handling a mobile when he grows up and required illegally know how to use it why give a mobile phone to a child and let him play this video again most of which are Haram so if you analyze today's video games majority they are involved most of them have got music the music is Haram in Islam they have got such sound effects so most of these games if you analyze and if you scrutinize majority maybe more than 80 percent more than 90 percent or maybe a larger number I haven't done a survey but but reading the reports they will lead to Haram activities directly and directly so such game surely should be prohibited and you should try and keep your children away from them I finally the first question was posed regarding a game called pubg pubg the full form of pubg if player unknown Battleground many people who play the game may not be knowing the full form anyway I don't play this game I just did a because of the news that for the last couple of weeks a lot of news has been coming regarding this pubg so I just went and checked up the background this game is one of the most popular game in the world today it was launched in March 2017 more than three years back the trial version and the full version was launched in December 2017 about two and a half years back and by the end of 2019 it had the maximum sale it sold till now it has sold more than 60 million games and only on the mobile there are 600 million downloads 600 million downloads that means somewhere close to eight percent of the world have downloaded it and among the children it would be somewhere close to more than one third of the children have one third or close to it have downloaded this and in this game this game mainly involves killing the more you kill the more points you get and you have to save yourself and if you are the last person alive you're the winner this game can be played solo by one percent can be played up to 100 people you can play alone you can play with your friends you can play online you can even play in groups of Two Three or fours then if your group survive your group is a winner it's an addiction and many of these video games including this pubg it takes a person away from Islam that besides that besides that if it is a time for Salah when the prayer call is there for Azan the child continues okay if no problem and he misses the Salah and there may be chances that he doesn't miss he will pray at the last moment when the Salah is just going to get Kaza just before the time for the next Salah he prays the previous Salah so all these things takes a person away from Allah this addiction is not only causing problem to Muslim children even though non-muslim children so much so that there are programs that have been created for the addiction of pubg but the question mainly is talking about the latest version of pubg was launched on the 28th of April 2020. about one and a half months ago and in this new version a person has to glorify idols or literally do idle worship in order to get weapons or get equipment which will help them to kill other people so this is going to the highest level murder is the second major sin in Islam Islam so of course it's totally Haram beside the other aspect of murder of music of nudity Etc ideal worship is the major sin it is promoting idle worship so surely we should see to it that the parents are very strict they should not only not give pubg should not give video game there may be some games which may be Halal entertainment per se if it doesn't bring the Sharia it is permitted there may be some video games which may not be having the elements or there may be some Sharia compliant video games that will be in the market but the best is avoid the general game unless you are sure that it is Sharia compliant it doesn't break any of the principles of Islam I require the Muslim parents not to be lazy and not to give them these games so that you know they can do their work without being disturbed you are ruining the life of children as well as your life because one of the ways for you to go to Jannah is the pious child praying for you so so this game published surely Haram previously the manifatwada faram now after the new version where there is glorifying the idols including idol worship it's totally Haram and I request the Muslim parents and the Muslim children stay away from it and don't play the game"
