  "title": "Mention Scientific Facts which are Mentioned in the Quran which Science has not yet Discovered it?",
  "transcript": "good evening again everyone uh it was amazing to see how much science that the glorious quran contained after your talk but in most of the examples from the quran which you gave it is very difficult to comprehend what the quran tells before actually the science discovers or invents that particular phenomenon for example you said in the honey there is healing of humanity in the quran and you mention it as it's about if a person is maybe say poison with a plan the honey of the plant should be taken so what is a use say of a almighty holy scripture talking about things which are only able to comprehend after the real invention is made by science so can you tell me now something from the quran which will be invented by science later or yet to be invented well that's a good question that i've mentioned many things about science indirectly saying all this foreign discovered earlier and if quran says something and after science has discovered so what's used can you tell me something which science hasn't discovered brother that's the reason the arabs were advanced in the field of astronomy why because they read the quran the quran has a lot of information on astronomy so when they read the quran they try and do more investigation they do more research and that's how they come to know quran is a telegraphic message this is the book of science only on one subject in medicine one subject only requires volumes so if that way the quran is this quran most of the human beings they don't like to read oh such a big book so if god almighty wrote in detail then even a big building you will require thousands of buildings to contain the message of the quran quran is telegraphic message so in telegraphic message many of the muslims they read the quran and they made advances in science that's the reason we find if you go back into history the muslims advanced in science and technology but you pose the question forget about the past what about today or what i've mentioned has been discovered earlier but many of them were discovered by muslims some by non-muslims some by europeans what about things which science hasn't discovered fine first i'll tell you those things which science hasn't established but yet there are high chances which quran has testified and i believe in it for example quran says in surah surah chapter number 42 verse number 29 that it's allah subhana wa tala who has created the creatures in heaven than the earth and has placed creatures in them the quran says there is life beside this earth today science hasn't proved there is life besides this earth scientists say there are high possibilities that life will be there besides this earth so they're sending rockets spaceships moon mass quran says there's life besides this earth i believe in it science may discover it tomorrow after five years after 10 years after 100 years quran says i believe in it today there are many hypothesis how the world will end it says that the sun will become big and the world will end the mountains will fall down the mountains will become smooth the ocean will swell up the world will enter into black hole many hypothesis many of these hypothesis is not all they match with the quran quran says in surah qayam chapter number 75 verse number 8 and 9 that the sun and the moon they will join together the sun will be buried in darkness if it's number 81 verses 1 2 and 3 it says that the stars will fall down and lose their luster the mountain will fall down to water ruin the ocean will swell up it's mentioned in surah infitar chapter number 82 verse number one and two and three again the ocean will swell up the stars will fall down similar to many of the hypothesis but quran says i believe in it quran further says in surah ambiya chapter number 21 was 104 we have created this creation we will destroy it and create a new creation science hasn't discovered that yet quran speaks about life after death science hasn't proved that yet quran speaks about heaven and hell science hasn't proved about that quran speaks about jinn today psychologists say extraterrestrial power there are some people who get possessed with jinns quran speaks about that quran speaks the first man on the earth what adam peace be upon him science hasn't proved that high possibility science will prove now you may ask me that brother zakir you give such a good talk on science and technology with hundred percent solid proof you believe in life after death you believe in jinn you believe in heaven and hell you're a doctor isn't this unscientific i said no brother i believe that it is scientific suppose whatever the quran has mentioned 80 percent has proved to be 100 correct i spoke about astronomy about geology motorcycle oceanography botany biology zoology so just hypothetically 80 percent what the quran has mentioned suppose has been proved to be 100 correct the remaining 20 percent is ambiguous neither right neither wrong not even 0.1 percent of that 20 percent which is ambiguous has been proved to be wrong there is not a single verse of the quran which can be proved false by established science hypothesis so my logic says when eighty percent is hundred percent correct and the remaining twenty percent is ambiguous but not even point one percent of the twenty percent proved wrong so my logic says that even the 20 percent inshallah will be correct if not today tomorrow after 50 years after 100 years after a thousand years allahu alam god knows they will prove their life after death they will prove there is in they will prove there is hell there is proof there is heaven and so on and so forth i can give another lecture on things which science has been proved but inshallah will prove hope that answers the question you"
