  "title": "Islam gave Rights to Women Before the Western Society - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "alhamdulillah foreign may peace mercy and blessings of Allah \nof almighty God beyond all of you the topic of this evening's talk is women's \nrights in Islam protected or subjugated   women's rights according to the Oxford \ndictionary ah those rights that promote   opposition of Social and legal equality of \nwomen with men Women rights according to also   dictionary means rights that promote a position \nof Social and legal equality of women with men   I'm not too much concerned about \nthe conclusions the modern ideas   and the categorical statements made by \nscientists and unexperienced armchair experts   as how a life should be led by a \nwoman I'm going to base my conclusions   on experience which has been proven by \nfacts because experience and holistic truth   is the sure test between the gold \nof truth and the glitter of theory   we have to check our intellect because \nmany a Time our mind can go astray indeed there was a time when the great minds of \nthat day they thought that the world was flat if we agree with how the Western media portrays \nthe women's rights in Islam we have no option   but to agree that the woman's rights in Islam \nthey are subjugated and they are not protected   the Western talk of women's liberalization is \nnothing but a disguised form of exploitation of   a body of deprivation of honor and degradation \nof soul the Western Society claiming to uplift   women have actually degraded her to a status of \nconcubines Mistresses and Society butterflies   which are employed as mere tools in the hands \nof sex marketeers and pleasure seekers which   are hidden behind in the colorful screen of art \nand culture Islam give women their due rights   1400 years ago in the jahelia it was known as the \ndays of ignorance Islam gave women the new rights if we go back into history and analyze when \nwe read the history of Babylonian civilization   at that time if a man committed murder instead \nof him being punished his wife was put to death when we read the history of the Greek civilization they had a mythological \nperson by the name of Pandora   who was a woman who was the cause \nof evil and Misfortune in society in the Greek civilization the women were used for \nsex and pleasure when we read the history of Roman   civilization when the Roman civilization reached \nits peak a man was permitted to even kill his wife   woman were used for sex and pleasure \nnudity and promiscuity was common   when we read the history of \nthe Egyptian civilization they considered the woman as a sign of the \ndevil when we read the Arab civilization   before the Quran was revealed very often when \na female child was born she was buried alive alhamdulillah praise be to Allah after the \nrevelation of the Quran and after the teachings   of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the last and \nfinal messenger of the great Allah the woman got   the due rights it uplifted the status of the women \nimagine in the days of ignorance it was known as   the Arabs were the most ignorant people of the \ntime the Quran the woman the god that you writes before we discuss the women's rights \nIslam I would like to point a few things Muslims today approximately they \nconstitute 20 to 25 percent of the   world population one-fifth to one-fourth \nof the world population today are Muslims   some Muslim societies they're close to Islam \nwhile the others they are far away from Islam if anyone wants to judge the woman's \nrights in Islam he should not judge   according to what Muslims do \nor what the Muslim Society does   the woman writes in Islam should be \nbased on the authentic sources of Islam   the authentic forces of Islam are the Glorious \nQuran the last and final revelation of almighty   God and the authentic Hadith of the last and \nfinal messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon   him so woman that's in Islam should only be \njudged and based on the authentic sources of   Islam the Glorious Quran and the authentic \nsayings of the Beloved Prophet Muhammad the quranic verses will never contract \namong themselves neither would the say   Hadith the Quran and the say Hadith then \nconfirmity they will never contract themselves just be fine that there are Muslim Scholars \nthey have difference of opinion in many aspects   of the women the main reason is that these \nScholars they quote one particular verse of   the Quran and neglect all the other verses of \nthe Quran the Quran should be read as a whole   and if we read the Quran as a whole \nmost of these differences will be solved the duty of every true Muslim with a man or \nwoman to seek the pleasure of Allah almighty God   the main aim should not be to get \nfamous or to satisfy one's own ego   the main aim of every Muslim whether man \nor woman is to seek the pleasure of Allah men and women in Islam they are equal \nbut equality does not mean identicality   the equal but they are not identical \ndepending upon the biological makeup   of the man and woman there are differences \ndepending upon the biological makeup of the   man and woman depending upon the physiological \nmakeup depending upon the psychological makeup   depending upon the physical makeup almighty \nGod Allah has given different roles   for men and women many a Time the exactly \nthe same they're identical and sometimes   they differ depending upon the biological \nbackground the physiological background the   psychological background the physical background \nhe is our creator he knows what is best for us I have divided my talk the \nwoman is actually Islam into six   broadheadings the spiritual rights of the women \nIslam the economic rights of the women in Islam   the social rights of the women in Islam \nthe educational rights of dominion Islam   the legal rights of domain Islam and \nthe political rights of domain in Islam"
