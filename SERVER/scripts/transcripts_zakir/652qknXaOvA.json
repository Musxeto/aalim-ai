  "title": "Media Controlled by Politicians is One of the Cause of Terrorism",
  "transcript": "one of the other cause is the media mainly that media which is controlled by the politicians we have to be careful of this and this media they can convert black to white day to night hero into a villain villain into hero and we see that very often if you see my tips I've been very such examples but in India it's fortunate that the more popular media is not controlled by the politicians and we find that this media really gave the true picture whether it be the Gujarat rights the media whether it be the newspaper the news channels they have really given a true picture now what's happening not hundred percent sometimes they get involved in news which is Sensational so when they get the news without checking up they give it it's Sensational they give it but as a whole we have to agree the media has been honest I'm talking about non-muslim media I'm not talking about the Muslim media and here we find that they were honest and they project in the real picture but what we have to be careful is of the media which is controlled by the politicians and as far as the Judiciary System is concerned in India the innocent citizen of India especially the Muslim victims we have faith in the Indian Judiciary System though some people say that they have blessed in the community but as a whole we know most of the judges their upright and they're honest we only hope that these people are not influenced by the politicians so far I know most of the judges they don't care much for the politicians if once the politicians get hold of the judicial system then God saved this country yet we have faith in the Judiciary System"
