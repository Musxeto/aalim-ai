  "transcript": "I am a research scholar in journalism at the osmania University and I have I we and our friends Sunday site called sakshitimes.com I have questions to you one I always knew that Quran is incomplete without hadees now you are referring to other scriptures also since you have referred to Bible Bible says anybody who denies Jesus Christ is the spirit of antichrist that is a prophecy and I also know that Hadith says that Muhammad had diabolical inspiration what should I conclude from this it will ask a question in which I have mentioned a few sentences he said that he knows that the Quran is incomplete without the Hadith and now he has heard other scriptures also that means if I quote the Bible that means you have to follow the Bible and he says the Bible says anyone who does not believe and deny Jesus Christ peace be upon him will go to hell etc etc so what are my comments Point number one the Quran is not incomplete without the hadees the Quran is complete by itself but to understand the Quran you have to go to the commentary of the Quran the commentary of the Quran is the Hadith that is the authentic saying of prophet Muhammad the Quran by itself is a details about it then you refer to the sayings the authentic sayings of Mama which we call asai Hadith not just because I quoted the other scriptures that does not mean I agree that all the other scriptures are the word of God please don't misunderstand me Quran Allah says in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter 3 verse number 64. come to Common terms has been us and you are coming to Common terms Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 13 verse number 38. and in every age have we sent a revelation Allah sent several Revelations several books by name only four dimension in the Quran the Torah the zaboor the Angel and the Quran the Torah is the Revelation which was given to Moses peace be upon him the Revelation which was given to David peace be upon him the Revelation which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him and Quran is the last and final Revelation which was given to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him now since all the previous Revelations came only for a particular group of people and they were meant to be followed in totality for a particular time period almighty God did not think it fit to preserve it in prista and purity but because Quran was the last and final Revelation Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 15 verse number nine we have revealed the Quran and we shall got it from corruption so Quran is the only religious book on the face of the Earth which is in its pure form I am not saying that even the scholars of comparative religion including William Moore who is one of the staunchiest critics of Islam being a Christian he said 200 years earlier that there is no religious book there is no religious book which has maintained its pure form for more than 1200 years now it is more than 1400 years like the Quran being a Christian being a staunchiest Critic of Islam he has to be truthful that Quran needs pure form now all the other religious scriptures have changed its form including the Bible I don't consider the Bible to be the word of God we Muslims believe in the wahi which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him the injil but the present Bible that we have brother this Bible it's a mixture it may contain words of God which match with the Quran I have got no problem in accepting you to the word of God it also contains the words of the prophets it contains a word of historians I am sorry to say it even contains pornography I can't quote it here I can't it even contains hundreds of contradictions scientific errors mathematical errors which I can't repeat here but I had a dialogue with Dr William Campbell he wrote a book against Islam the Quran and the Bible in the light of History and Science and he said the Quran has got 30 scientific errors I went to USA he's from Philadelphia and we had a debate in the year 2000 first April on the topic the Quran and the Bible alert of Science and I answered to all his allegations and when I pointed out 38 contradictions in the Bible he could not reply to them Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 79 Allah says vote to those who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from Allah to traffic with it for miserable price woe to those for what they write vote to those of what they earn so today's Bible if you know the word bible is not there in the Bible it comes from the Greek word biblos meaning a book of books and the scholars say there are many authors of the Bible not I the Christian Scholars so the present Bible I don't consider it to be the word of God similarly if you ask me can you consider Veda to be the word of God can you consider the Buddhist scripture of the word of God can you consider the parties reward of God what I feel maybe they were maybe they were not since there were many scriptures sent by Allah many books by name for a mention but there are many other like Su favor and several others so what I say may be Hindu scriptures may be word of God maybe Buddhist scriptures may be word of God maybe parsley scriptures were the word of God but even if they were they were meant for those people and for that time today you have to follow the last and final Revelation there's the Glorious Quran so any human being whether living in India in America in Canada in UK in Singapore in Saudi Arabia all the human beings in the world should follow the last and final Revelation the Glorious Quran and the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I am not saying Hindu scripture is the word of God even if it was it was meant for those people and for that time the Hindu Scholars agree that the scriptures have been changed the Buddhist Scholars agree that Buddhist scriptures have been changed all this call of their own religion except Islam they agree that the scriptures have gone changes down the line down the ages but even if I agree for sake of argument it is the word of God even if it's since the followers of that religion they believe it to be the word of God they should follow every letter every word of the scripture so if the Buddhists believe their scripted word of God then those believe they're scripture to be the word of God the Christians believe this gifted word of God so all your scriptures are saying you have to follow the teachings of the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so since you consider it to be the word of God I say maybe it is Mitchells so you have to believe in the last and final messenger as I mentioned in the Bible in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says I have many things to send to you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you into all truth he shall not speak of himself all that here shall speak he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me who is this person you rightly said that anyone who denies Jesus Christ peace be upon him will go to hell you said I agree with that statement I agree no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him and we have to say peace be upon him you may say Jesus I cannot say I have to say peace be upon him if I are the religious person if I do not add peace be upon him I'll be kicked out a Layman can do that I have to add peace be upon him so no muslim the Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of Allah We Believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern Christians not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blood and lepers is God's permission together but I know what you mean when you mean believe in Jesus Christ you mean what do you mean believe is God correct can you on the microphone when you say believe in Jesus Christ means God believe me the prophet I believe this statement that I am the way the truth and the life what does it mean it means that he is the Incarnate God whether as follow this question John chapter the same I will give you the reference I'll give you the reference also no problem what the reference John chapter 14 you can refer verse number I have the Bible I can tell you John Chapter 14 verse 16. not 16 first number six it's not 16. sorry Mr Nayak you don't have to teach me Bible you just tell whatever your misrepresentations will be answered in our side that's right brother you are not quoting you have the Bible in your bag correct you take out the Bible from your bag and your quoting Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number six it's not 16. [Applause] and you said that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he said that he was God I'll come to your question before I come to your question let me tell you one thing I've read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible but Jesus Christ peace Beyond himself says I'll say already said worship me if any Christian can point out to me a single unequivocal statement a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where he says worship me I am ready to accept Christianity Today [Applause] I am putting my head on the guillotine I am afraid of compiled religion you have read the Bible even I have studied the Bible you said that I should not teach you the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says seek ye the truth and the truth shall free you I will ensure I show you the truth and the truth shall for you today inshallah as I mentioned earlier the describes peace be upon himself says that I am God always says worship me in fact if read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says it's mentioned the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 he said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all the gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devils with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20. I with the Finger of God cast out Devils Gospel of John chapter number five verse number 30. I can of my own self do nothing either I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who say that seek not my will level of almighty God is a Muslim Jesus Christ peace before the Muslim he never claimed divinity it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 it says that amen of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by 1000 Miracles and signs which God did by him and you are witness to it a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and we were witness to it so the Bible clearly said that Jesus Christ peace be upon him as a man he was one of the mightiest messengers of God but not God there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God awaited worship me you quoted a verse to prove your point from Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number six which says where Jesus Christ peace before himself says that I am the way the truth and the life no man commit unto my father but through me now this is again coating out of context people pick up verses from the Quran and quote out of context to malign similarly Christian missionaries quote the Bible out of context I want to tell you a truth to you you can open the Bible if you doubt me open the Bible for the context go to verse number one Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number one says that why are you afraid Jesus Christ peace be upon himself if you have faith in God have faith in me in my father's Mansion there are many houses and I am going there to prepare a place for you Thou Art good he said don't you know where I go he said no then he says that show us the way where thou goest so then Jesus Christ peace be upon replies I am the way the truth and the life whenever show us the way to God then Jesus Christ peace replies I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto thy father but through me we agree at the time of the messenger every messenger was the way the truth and the life no man came unto God but through the way of that messenger at the time of Jesus I agree with the Bible that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was the way the truth and the life no man came unto almighty God but through the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him at the time of Moses Moses bought the way the truth and the life no man came unto almighty God but through the teachings of Moses peace be upon him but today Jesus Christ peace be upon him said I have many things to say unto you further he says in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14. I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now for even the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you onto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that here shall speak he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me at today's time at today's time the messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the way the truth and the life no man cometh to almighty God but through the teachings of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him since Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the last and final messenger in today's age irrespective whether a person is living in USA in Canada in UK in India in Saudi Arabia any part of the world for every human being today Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the way the truth and the life no man commit unto almighty God but through the teachings of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and this is what all the major scriptures say including the Bible so hope now you have been enlightened into the truth and hope inshallah you will come to the truth and truth shall for you foreign"
