  "transcript": "if everything is destined by allah and if i commit any sin then who is to blame if i am destined to commit a murder and then i commit a murder but naturally i will not be responsible for it it is allah who has destined it therefore he will be responsible then why should i be punished for this as far as the question of this god that is concerned it's a common question asked by muslims non-muslim about the qatar of allah and it's difficult to understand i'd like to give an example for people to know that allah has knowledge of the unseen he has knowledge of the future let me give an example that if in a classroom there is a teacher who teach of the students after one year has passed before the examination the teacher predicts that this child he will come first class first this child he'll get a second class this child c he will fail and once the examination takes place and when the results are out student a gets the first class first student b he gets a second class student c he fails now the question i would like to ask is that just because the teacher predicted that the student see would fail can the student see blame the teacher saying that because the teacher predicted that i will fail i have failed but national answer is no the teacher predicted the student a will get a first class first because he knew that the student was studious and he was intelligent so then be he was average student student see he used to pay hoki he used to bunk school he never used to study nerves to do the homework so based on that the teacher predicted that students he would fail but students he cannot blame the teacher because the teacher predicted i will fail therefore i failed the student himself is responsible similarly allah subhanahu wa tala has in my game for example when a human being comes at a crossroad there are five roads from which he can choose road one two three four five he has the free will he can choose any he chooses road three and that's already mentioned in the destiny that he will choose route three it is not because allah has mentioned he will choose wrote three that he has chosen root three it is because he will be choosing wrote three allah subhana wa tala writes in advance because he has almaged like how the teacher predicts in advance so allah knows this person has a choice he can choose any of the roads from the five roads available but he chooses three so allah knows in advance he will be choosing road three therefore he mentions in the color in the that he'll be choosing root three now once he goes to row three after some time he comes on another crossroad one two three he chooses row three now because he will be choosing wrote three allah knows in so he's mentioned that after some time he'll come at another crossroad and this particular person will choose again wrote three it is not because allah has mentioned in tagdir that he will choose row 3 that is choosing note three it is because he has chosen note 3 allah has written in advance it's a bit confusing but you realize that allah is in the game same way a person if he wants to earn his livelihood he has both choices either he can strive hard work hard and do on his job and earn that money or he can rob or he can steal the choices is this person prefers to steal now allah knows in advance that at the age of 25 he has option of working hard and earning honest living or stealing but this person steals so allah knows in advance he will be stealing therefore allah has written he will steal it is not because allah has written that he has stolen it is because he will be stealing allah in advance similarly if a person commits murder it's his choice he can either not commit murder or he can't commit murder choices and he commits murder who's to blame he's to blame so here we realize that allah is ill-megab so that's the reason there's a saying in urdu there's a very good couplet which says which means that make yourself so great that before allah writes the destiny he will ask you that what is your wish"
