  "transcript": "you've alluded to that in some of the beautiful hadiths you've mentioned just now but um what specific reason is it that Ramadan is called the month of forgiveness or is known as the month yes as I rightly mentioned earlier that a beloved Prophet Muslim said it's in a Hadith number three book of fasting Hadith number 1901 said that if anyone farts in the month of Ramadan with the proper intention with faith and asking for reward of Allah he will forgive all your persons and this message is further repeated in the Muslim Ahmed volume number three Hadith number 11524 where it's mentioned that any person who fast in the month of Ramadan with the proper intention seeking the reward of Allah he will have all his previous sins atoned and further it's mentioned inside Muslim world number one Hadith number 450 our beloved Prophet Muslim said that the time between the five prayers and the two jummas and from one Ramadan to the other is the time for expiration of your sins this is the time where you can have all your sins forgiven and a beloved Prophet Muslim also said as mentioned inside Muslim where I'm number four in the book of tawba said that Allah at night time a person who asked for forgiveness he forgive the sin for the sin he has committed to the day and Allah in the daytime he forgive the sin for a person who has forgiveness for the sini has committed night so this is the best month of forgiveness the month of Ramadan where you can easily have your sins forgiven because the Gates of Heaven open and the gates of hell are closed therefore it's called the month of forgiveness"
