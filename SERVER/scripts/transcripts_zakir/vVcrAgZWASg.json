  "transcript": "the next question from adil rashid from kashmir india i am a student of class 12th sir i have a friend who is a non-muslim and i am trying to explain to him islam since the 25th of may 2020. yesterday he asked a question but i could not give him the answer the question is that no religion says that if you do not follow god then you will be punished but in islam allah says if you do not obey me then allah will give you a strong punishment isn't allah egoistic sir my friend is very close to saying the shahada if you reply then he may accept islam soon inshallah the question posed by adil he's doing dhawa to one of his non-muslim friends and he's very close to accepting islam he asked the question that why in islam allah is so egoistic knows bella and he says that if you don't obey me i will punish you whereas in other religions god does not say that if you don't obey him you will be punished i disagree with a non-muslim friend in fact most of the religions say that if you don't obey god you will go to hell hinduism says that christianity says that and most of the religions but i do agree with you that islam is most strong allah in the quran is very firm and he says that if you do not obey the commandments if you associate partners with anyone else besides him it is shirk it is the biggest sin you will go to hellfire islam is more firm is more staunch i do agree with you let me give you an example and ask your question so that you understand better if there is a family who is staying in a tall building on the twentieth floor and if their family has a son who is about five years old six years old he wants to jump from the balcony of the 20th floor where he's staying and he tells his father i want to be superman and he wants to jump there's one father who says and tries to explain to us unlogically you will not be able to fly you are not a superman please don't jump the second father is that same example another father whose son says he wants to jump from the 20th floor he says don't jump from the 20th floor other punish you i will not allow you to go down to play you have a third type of a father same situation son wants to jump from the 20th floor wants to fly like a superman but this father he is more firm he says you dare even think of jumping i will slap you i will tie you and close you in your room if you think of even jumping and if you try jumping also i will lock you up in a room i am asking the question a normal child of the age of five and six who will listen to more the chances of him listening to the first father is more or chances muslims the second father is more or chances muslims the third father but natural the answer is that listening to the third father the chances that the son will not jump from the 20th floor is in the case of the third father because the third father is cruel to be kind he's very firm i will tie you up i will slap you i will lock you in the room the child will get scared you cannot say no i'll try to explain to him logically no he may not understand the second father says okay i will not allow you to go down to play so what the as long as i fly like a superman who wants to play but i will lock you in a room i will slap you i will tie you up it will scare the child now the third father loves this child more he is willing to go to any extreme proceed that he doesn't jump and kill himself similarly allah subhanahu wa almighty god in islam he is very clear-cut and sure that if the person does shirk if he associates partners with almighty god it is the biggest sin he will go to hell fire so if telling do not have alcohol do not have pork do not gamble do not do adultery all this is beneficial if you do you will go to hell so in islam allah uses three types of strategies in convincing the human beings number one is with reason and logic if you read the quran there are many verses saying that will you not then understand this book is for people of understanding that means talking to them logically some people will agree logically some verse of the quran allah says if you do this i will reward you i will give you jannah in which rivers will flow beneath your feet in which you'll have a lot of fruits to eat you will have the best of life giving you rewards sometimes the third strategy allah uses if you don't obey me i'll put you in hell fire i will punish you so there are three types of strategies used by allah almighty god in quran and in islam to convince the followers to follow the straight path whether a human being follows the straight path or not it makes no difference for allah it will not make him greater he is already the greatest but if you follow the commandment it will benefit the human being if he doesn't have alcohol he'll have good health if he doesn't gamble it will save him a lot of trouble you don't do adultery it will prevent them from several diseases it will let them lead a good happy family life so all these things what allah commands in the quran and in islam what a beloved prophet says in the sharia it is benefiting the human being not almighty god but almighty god loves this creature allah in islam is the most loving most kind most merciful therefore he wants his creation the human means to follow him that's the reason allah is very firm also trying to give you a warning that don't do all these wrong things otherwise it will be lost for you and he even tells them that you get punishment so this is for the benefit of the human beings that's the reason today in the world the religion that is followed most is islam in numbers and senses you may have more number of claiming that christians may be close to 2.7 billion or little bit more muslims are more than 2 billion in the world more than 26 but the percentage the number of human beings following in religion number one is islam most of the christians don't follow the religion the only name say christians so amongst the human beings the people that follow maximum the religion are the muslims it is the islamic religion why because the way allah uses the strategy of reason and logic islam is the most logical religion give the strategy of giving reward the reward that is mentioned in the quran about jannah the description of jannah is the best as compared to any other scripture at the same time warning them you will get punishment you will get held fire the description of hellfire in the quran is the worst as compared to all the scriptures so the strategy used by allah is the most logical most rewarding most punishing that's the reason the people that follow the maximum and religion is islam and according to a survey which was done in germany just about one year back the people that are the most satisfied and the most happy are the muslims because of this strategy hope this answer will convince your friend and i pray to allah that may he give hidayah to your friend and may except islam"
