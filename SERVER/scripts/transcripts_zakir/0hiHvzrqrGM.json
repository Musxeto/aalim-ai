  "title": "Can I Pray Isha at 2 am due to Difficult Working Hours? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "next question from mohammad shweb from dubai can i pray isha at 2 a.m due to difficult working hours as far as the time for isha is it is after the time for maghrib ends approximately depending upon different countries approximately one and a half hour after sunset it starts and is up to nist full that is up to midnight this is the time between which you should offer salah you cannot offer isha or any prayer before time or after the time expires so offering isha full that is midnight is prohibited since you're staying in dubai now i believe the maghrib time in dubai would be close to 7 pm and the sunrise is at 5 50 a.m in the morning so if you calculate from 7 pm when the sun sets up to 5 50 sunrise it's approximately 10 hours 50 minutes so the next full the midnight would be 5 hours 25 minutes after sunset which is 12 25 a.m so in dubai you can offer isha salah approximately one and a half hour after sunset that is from 8 30 up to 12 25 midnight in this full line you want to offer at 2 am in the morning it's not permissible and as far as the show is concerned the prophet said the more you delay before you sleep it is preferable but before this full line so if you are living in dubai you can offer your salah anytime between 8 30 pm up to 12 25 am you cannot offer after that or before that you are saying that you are working and you're doing a job and because you're busy it's difficult to pray isha on time this is not accepted at all and since you're living in dubai in uae which is a muslim country it is not possible that anyone can prevent you from offering isha salah on time irrespective whether you're working in a muslim company or non-muslim company you can always request them to give you a few minutes to offer your salah it is preferable you offer in jamaat go to the mosque and there are many mosques in dubai take a short break a few minutes no one can prevent you if someone prevents you go and complain to the authorities of dubai i'm sure inshallah they will reprimand your company no one can tell you that work is compulsory and can prevent you from offering salah especially in a muslim country especially in the country where majority are muslims especially in the gulf country in dubai i've been several times to dubai i spent several years in dubai you may be feeling shy very well go and tell your boss whichever company you are working in whether muslim or non-muslim and tell him i want to offer isha salah in the mosque he can never prevent you if he prevents you go and complain to the authorities of dubai inshallah they will put the person in the place"
