origin to the whatsapp number plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five before we start taking the questions i would like to speak for a few minutes on the berut explosion actions to be taken and lessons to be learned as many of you may be aware four days ago there was a massive explosion in beirut on tuesday on the 4th of august 2020 at six o'clock in the evening that's barrow time or 3 p.m gmt and in this massive explosion it was one of the greatest explosions in the recent time in which more than 150 people were killed and more than 5000 people were injured and more than 300 000 people became homeless according to the president of lebanon the cause of this massive explosion in berut was because of 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate that was stored in the barrowed port in warehouse number 12. and this 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate was stored about seven years ago in 2013 when a ship was traveling from gibraltar to mozambique and it halted on the buret port and there was a technical problem in that ship because of which it had to stop in beirut and the owner of the ship he abandoned the ship because of which a court order was taken where this 2750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate was stored at the b wrote port in warehouse number 12. actually this 2750 tonne it was supposed to be sold or disposed of even though several reminders were sent to the court and to the government by the port authorities for the last several years no action was taken this ammonium nitrate is actually used as a source of nitrogen for agriculture fertilizers it's also used along with fuel and oil for explosives for mining or in construction industry it has also been used by militants as an explosive actually this ammonium nitrate to store is very safe as long as you take precaution but if you do not take precautions over time it may absorb the moisture it may turn into a rock and it is very dangerous that it can be infamous according to the manager of the port of birot there was a request for repairing the door of warehouse 12 and because of which they were doing some welding to the door of the warehouse number 12 and after that he doesn't know according to reports we have come to know that there was a fire at the berut port at six o'clock lebanon time very close to warehouse number 12. and later on the roof of the warehouse number 12 caught fire at six o'clock lebanon time and few seconds later there were many explosions people thought it was fireworks and 30 seconds later there was an enormous massive explosion which ruined many structures and buildings around the vicinity of the port and the effects were four kilometers the windows of the international port of birot which is nine kilometers away from the site of explosion the windows were shattered 200 kilometers across the mediterranean sea the explosion could be heard in cyprus according to the reading they said the explosion was equal to 3.3 scale of earthquake it was massive and because of this explosion there was a crater created of 140 meters wide and very deep at the site of the warehouse where water accumulated and there was a ship which was closed which was blown to the dock because of the explosion and in this explosion more than 150 innocent human beings were killed more than five thousand people were injured according to the mayor of b road more than three hundred thousand people became homeless and the population of bureau is approximately 2 million so 15 of the population of beerud they became homeless and half to 1 million people directly indirectly were affected by this blast this was an accident it was negligence what action should be taken i'd request the muslims all over the world that the least we can do is pray to allah for the people who are affected by this blast and as we know more than 61 percent of the population of lebanon the muslims more than 52 percent of the population of bureau they're muslims and i pray to allah that may he forgive the muslims who have died in this blast and may grant them jannah and i pray to allah that may he eve the difficulties of the muslims and non-muslim families who have died in this blast may elevate and may he make it easy for the people who have been affected in this blast may he give shafa may cure the people who have been injured in this dust and may give shelter to the people who have become homeless and may allah is the suffering of all those people of lebanon who have been affected directly or indirectly in this blast the least the muslims can do is pray for the people affected by this blast the second thing we can do is we can support financially whatever we can to help the victims of this blast and alhamdulillah there are many charities muslims and non-muslim ngos in lebanon and in different parts of the world which have started collecting funds we have in america and europe and countries in different parts of the world and alhamdulillah i request the muslims that whatever your capacity is with the big or small whatever you can we should become part and try and support this noble cause with whatever amount that we can the third we can do is those people in lebanon or in beirut who have not been affected by this blast should support the people who have been affected by this blast there may be people of lebanon who may be less affected they can support the people who have been more affected we require volunteers at the ground level to help the people who are injured to help the people who have become homeless to help the people who may not have food to eat because of the situation that took place suddenly because of the massive explosion because of this blast whatever we can physically because of the pandemic which is there to cover 19 it may be difficult for the foreigners to enter lebanon but yet there are people who are trying whoever can physically support they should and last what we can do is try and spread this message that we should not be negligent about the information of the blast actions to be taken and the lessons to be learned what can we as muslims learn from this tragedy number one we should not be negligent this tragedy happened because of negligence we should see to it that we should be careful and we should take precautions wherever required for example we should see to it that in our home we have the kitchen many people keep the gas open unattended there may be someone who lights a fire and they can be explosion in the kitchen we keep and we store things inflammable in the wrong place which is wrong and we may not be careful in how we store the inflammable items all these are lessons to be learned that we have to be careful and we should not be negligent the second thing to be learnt is that we do not know when will be our last day of our life in this world normally many of the muslims we pray for the muslims all over the world that are suffering and i too every tahaju i pray for all the muslims in the world who are suffering and i particularly take the names of the people who are suffering more and i start with the people the muslims in china in shingan who are in concentration camps who have been persecuted who have been oppressed the muslims in burma india in the rakhine state many people have left their homes millions are staying as refugees in other countries i pray for them even the muslims of palestine the muslims of syria the muslims in yemen the muslims in afghanistan the muslims in kashmir the muslims of india that are being persecuted by the indian government the muslims in bangladesh and the list is wrong i take the names of the people who are more persecuted but generally we pray for all the muslims even the others which are being persecuted in different parts of the world we know that amongst the muslim countries in the world that are there maybe 25 percent are being persecuted on a great level because of the persecution maybe in china or maybe in burma or maybe in palestine or syria or yemen because of persecution because of war there may be another percentage that may be less persecuted or less oppressed there may be some living in a country where there may be very little problems for them and many times these people living in the countries where there is not a major problem may think and pray for the people for the muslims of other parts of the world but they may think that these people because of the war zone may die anytime but they may never think that even they too can face a calamity and what happened in beirut i am sure that almost all the people who may have been killed they may never have thought that that was going to be the last day of their life they might never have thought that they will never see the next day in the life so it's a lesson for us that irrespective whichever part of the world you're living in irrespective what is your age irrespective what in their status whether you're rich or poor whether you're healthy or sick you may never know when will be the last day of your life that's the reason a muslim normally should lead a life and should be prepared that maybe today is the last day of his life so what should we do we should take a lesson from this that we should be prepared to face our lord if we are to die today and for this we should see to it that we should do all of our eyes and stay away from the haram activities we should see to it that we believe in tahit that we pray five times a day that we do all the farah's and we stay away from the haram the major sins and the minor sins also if we are sure that we do all the farah's and if you are staying away from the major sins and we every day ask for forgiveness in our salah in then even though as we are human beings and we do sins we can always hope from allah that when we pray for forgiveness when we do stakfar inshallah allah will forgive us so if every day we offer salah and we ask for forgiveness for all the sins we are doing if allah forbid we have to die that day inshallah it will be a great blessing for us and inshallah there are high chances that we shall enter jannah so this is a lesson to be learned that we don't know how long will we live we should be prepared that we will die today at the same time we should plan for our future what we are going to do tomorrow maybe after a few weeks or a few months or few years this is what a moment a believer does he plans for the future but is prepared that he can die today he may not live to see tomorrow this is a lesson for us what happened in lebanon was accident it was negligence it can happen in any part of the world maybe we too can face a calamity and we prayed allah that may forgive our sins and may he make us pray for the victim throughout the world including the beirut blast and may we learn lesson from these incidents so that we can come close at all the first question on the whatsapp is from riyadh from bangladesh and he's asking the question why allah punishes people in the grave as there is a possibility that this person may get acquitted on the day of judgment similarly a person who is not punished in the grave may be found to be guilty on the day of judgment the question posed by riaz is that why does allah punish the person in the grave maybe on the day of judgment will be acquitted so won't it be injustice and maybe you will not punish a person in the grave and he may be held responsible on the day of judgment so isn't this wrong allah subhanahu wa allah says in the glorious quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 that kullu nafsin zaya katharmoth every soul shall have a taste of death and your final recompense will be on the day of judgment and anyone who is saved from the fire and is admitted into jannah into the garden has achieved the purpose of this life for this life is goods and chatters of deception here allah subhanahu ta'ala in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 is telling us that the final recompense will be on the day of judgment that means the final hisab kitab the final tally of the reward and punishment will be on the day of judgment that means if you have to get a reward you may get part in this dunya in this world part in the grave part in the hereafter or if you have to get some punishment you may get part in this world but in the grave part in thereafter but the year after is the final recompense the final tally of all these three put together would be what you deserve as a reward or as a punishment the question asked by riyaz that what if you are punished in the grave and on the day of judgement you are acquitted so won't it be injustice or if you are not given a punishment in the grave when you have a responsible day of judgment won't it be wrong what brother ryan is asking a question may be correct for a normal judge or if you and me are a judge where you are human beings he fails to realize that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is in do you think allah doesn't know what is the reward every human being deserves and what is a punishment every human being deserves for you and i who are normal human beings we may not be aware or if you and i are a judge then we will not know until we hear the lawyers and we know what's happened but allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala is the master of the day of judgement in my gap he has knowledge of the future he knows exactly what will a person deserve as a reward and what will a person deserve as a punishment and a beloved prophet muslim said that for an unbeliever whatever good deeds he does his reward will be in this dunya he will not get any reward in the akhirah in the life after death as for the punishment it may be part here part in the grave part in the hereafter as for the believers both the reward and the punishment can be part in this world part in the grave part in the hereafter so allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has allah knows that this person will get 50 points of punishment so he may give 10 point in this world 20 points in the grave and maybe 20 points in the akhirah it cannot be possible that the person receives 10 points punishment and allah will give 20 points punishment in the grave it's impossible allah is he has knowledge of the future he cannot do such a thing you and i the human being can do that so this question is logical for a human being but not for allah because he knows exactly what is the total punishment every human being will deserve what is the total reward that he deserve and all these three put together is the total punishment he deserves and that's the reason it's mentioned in the quran that on the day of judgement no one will object to the justice of allah neither the muslims neither the non-muslims even the kafir even the unbelievers even the non-muslims who would be put in the hell they will never say that they have got injustice they will only ask allah that why don't you give us one more chance and allah will say it is too late this was in brief the answer to the question the next question posed by mohsin munir from bradford from uk can you recommend any good urdu translation of the quran for my parents a similar question asked by mubina hashmi from pakistan i am a muslim and i want to read the urdu translation of the quran kindly recommend me a translation book aura of seed i normally read the english of the quran my urdu is weak as 5 reading is concerned but i did ask some of the people who are knowledgeable in the field of islam and they told me that one of the good translations in urdu language is asan rubayan by mawlana mohammad junagadhi it's also printed by the king fat printing press in madina saudi arabia and the second good translation urdu is te hero quran by sheikh luqman salafi who was the secretary of sheikh bin bas ramallah mella have mercy on him so these two are the good of the translation with authentic and inshallah if you read them you will benefit the next question is from from united kingdom is it allowed to have pension after one has retired from a government job as far as pension is concerned there is nothing wrong in receiving pension whether you are doing a government job or from a private company but the only point to be noted is that most of the pensions that are given whether by the government or whether by private companies they involve interest and ruba because most of the companies are government when the pension is directed from the salary of the employee along with a percentage given by the employer this money is kept in fixed deposit in banks on money instruments which earn interest and later on after you retire you start getting benefit from this as we know very well that interest is haram and allah clearly mentioned in the glorious quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and 279 that those who give up not the demands of rabbah of interest take notice of a war from allah interest is a major sin not only is it a major sin the quran says allah and his rasool will wage a war against you and in the book the khabar the major sins imam dhabi lists interest as the 12th major sin and the prophet peace be upon him said it's mentioned hadith that the lowest level of rabbah is like doing zina with your mother so because of this if that pension amount that you receive involves riba then you should try and take out that element of rabbi because you may not be involving yourself in durba but your employer may be so if someone is forcing remind you what you can do is you can calculate what is the principal amount which is from your salary what is the principal amount which your employer has put and what is the element of rubber so when you get this pension after you calculate if you get rid of this element of riba calculate the percentage it may be 10 percent 20 30 percent whatever the percentage percentages give this away in charity to the poor people for some noble cause because this riba has come involuntary to you voluntary taking repay and giving charity even that is haram but involuntary somebody is forcing you it is your money it is your right that the employer is giving you benefit but if it's involving with the principal amount the quran says you can keep the principal amount and give away the reba so that riba portion percentage from the pension if it is involving the interest should be given a charity but the best would be if the pension is from islamic source in the islamic country that are following the islamic sharia they put it in takasha which is an islamic based insurance or an islamic based sharia compliant pension fund in which everything is alarmed so if it's based on sharia principle you can keep the complete amount of pension if it's involving riba you get rid of that percentage and inshallah you can utilize the percentage which is free from rabbah we have on the facebook balaguani axel sudden baraboa paraveis ahmad may allah bless you i love you i love you too mubashira bike safe hassan sheikh sameer foreign to all of you and may allah bless you the next question is from abdullah muhammad from bangladesh is beat boxing allowed in islam first let us understand what is beat boxing beatboxing is a vocal percussion imitating the sound of the drum machine with your mouth your lips your tongue and your voice this is there since a couple of centuries ago it started since the 19th century though the word wasn't called as beatboxing originally beatboxing was imitating the drum machine and later on as time passed on they started imitating the other musical instruments and now lately almost all the instruments are imitated by the human vocal voice using the mouth the tongue the lips and it was made famous in the 20th century in the late 1960s by the beatles paul mccartney history tells us that even michael jackson made it famous and so on and so forth to come into the question that is beat boxing permitted in islam almost all the scholars they agree that musical instruments are haram in islam there are very few scholars that you may find lately on the past that have permitted the use of musical instruments there are various hadith which have prohibited musical instruments i'll just go to one which is very important it's mentioned in say bihari hadith number 5590 that a beloved prophet muslim said that there will be among my followers some who will make illegal intercourse that is in a adult and fornication wearing of silk drinking of alcoholic drinks and the use of musical instruments as lawful as halal this is one of the signs of the r before the day of judgment before the end of the world a prophet said this is a sign that there will be some people from his ummah who will make zinna adultery fornication wearing of silk drinking of alcohol and the use of musical instruments as halal indicating that using musical instruments is haram the prophet only permitted certain times the use of duff that's an open ended drum in eid or in weddings but generally all the other instruments are hara there are various sattvas since the musical instruments are haram a human being imitating the haram musical instrument according to scholars is also haram and when shaykh me was asked that is beat boxing permissible he clearly said even imitating the haram instrument the musical instruments with your mouth whether it be drums whether it be other instruments it is forbidden it is prohibited so beat boxing is not permissible for the muslims it is not allowed that a muslim should imitate the sound of the musical instrument whether it be drums whether it be other musical instruments whether sound this is haram and the muslims should abstain from it even listening to it and even involving in making sounds of haram musical instruments with your mouth the next question is from sadiq rahman from bangladesh i am an architect by profession can i design a temple or a church or any other non-muslim religious architecture also while designing a five-star hotel the client's requirement in most cases is to design a bar in it what should i do in such a case mentioned in the glorious quran in surah maidah chapter number five verse number two that help each other in bir and taqwa in righteousness and in good deeds but do not help one another in sin and in transgression so allah is very clear in the quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 2 that help each other in good deeds and in righteousness but do not help each other in sin and transgression shirk is major sin in islam allah says in the glorious quran in surah chapter number 4 verse number 48 and surah chapter number 4 116 that if allah pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of shirk idol worship he will never forgive if you ask for forgiveness before dying inshallah i'll forgive you but if you die as a mushrik allah will never forgive you so in the religious places of the non-muslim religious places in temples and churches but natural there is shirk there is idol worship so how can you design a temple or a place of worship of the non-muslim where other than allah subhanahu ta'ala's worship so in no way can you design or help in the construction of a place of worship of a non-muslim neither can you give donation neither can you support neither can you be an architect neither can you be a worker in the construction of any place of worship of the non-muslim regarding the second part of the question that in a five-star hotel can you design a bar all of us know that alcohol is prohibited in islam allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 5 verse number 90. oh you believe enamel come roll my suru most certainly in talk signatures and gambling dedication of stone divination of arrows rich subramany shaitan these are certain handiwork abstained from this handover that you may prosper since alcohol is prohibited you as a muslim cannot design a bar in which people have alcohol a bar is a place where people drink alcohol you cannot design it you can design a five-star hotel if your client forces you to design you said no i can design the complete five-star hotel but i cannot design the bar if he forces you then don't take the project because designing a bar is also haram it is prohibited the next question is from amman kumar aman kumar is a revert from bihar india he's asking a question i am from a hindu family i have converted to islam one and a half year ago after watching your video and of mawlana tariq jamil ji which was explained by a muslim friend of mine but my family does not know this and they are skeptical i tried to convince my family that the idol they worship is wrong but they don't believe it if i explain then they say that is the whole world in brackets hindus are they wrong and are you the only one who's right i also told them that it is okay you do not listen to me you read the hindu religious book it is written in it but they do not even read it and in the house of a hindu who worships murthy idols i feel that i have not done any shirk and that i have to go through a lot of hardships so i want you to tell me what to do lastly i would like to thank you for helping me recognize the truth and accepting islam i would like to thank you too brother aman kumar for coming to the straight path and accepting islam may allah reward you and may allah bless you and may allah grant to jannah as far as the question is concerned that when you tell to your family members and to your parents not to do idol worship they say that are all the other people in the world wrong are the hindus wrong you should tell them that whatever majority people do is not always correct many centuries ago most of the human being believed that the world was flat that does not mean that they are right today we know that the world is spherical so majority is not always correct people in the past thought that the light of the moon was its own light today we know after science is advanced that the light of the moon is not its own light it is a reflected light of the sun so just because majority people have a belief that does not mean that the majority are always right and if that is the argument that your family members are giving that majority a hindu that's the reason and they do idol worship therefore idol worship you have to tell your family members that in the world the people that practice maximum any religion number one in islam in census theoretically maybe christians are more but the people who practice any religion number one are muslims the number one religion which is practice maximum in the world is islam there are more than 2 billion muslims in the world more than 26 percent of the world population are muslims compared to hindus we are much more hindus are about 1.2 billion so if you are going on majority there are more muslims in the world than hindus so does it mean if that is what you believe that more people are correct then you should be a muslim as you ask the question that you are living in hindu family and they are not aware that you have accepted islam one and a half year back what should you do even though you are abstaining yourself from shirk my advice to you would be that slowly and with hikmah explain to your family about the haqq about the truth and reveal to them that you have accepted islam initially they may be angry they may be sad that they've accepted islam but that is the best because once you explain to them and reveal to them that you have accepted islam inshallah inshallah they will agree with what you have done it will be easier for you to practice your deen it will be also easier for you to convince them about islam and it will be easier for you to prove to them that what they are doing idle worship is wrong it's a shirk you can very well quote the scriptures you can give them my cassette on similarities between islam and hinduism where i've proved from their scriptures that i'd worship is wrong and in charlotte it will be easier for you to practice your deen and even get them to the straight path so my request to you is reveal to them islam with hikmah and continue your dawah with them inshallah that would be the best for you we have on the facebook sona islam abdulrahman mukul haq akash next question is from rf ansari from uttar pradesh india one of my non-muslim friends has asked me all religions are superstitious and false the truth lies in science which is constantly developing religion says that god is all-powerful merciful and all good if that is so then why do millions of children in the world suffer from hunger cold etc as the great russian writer dostoevsky asked in a famous novel brothers karamazov why does god who is said to be merciful not have mercy on them and give them food clothes shelter etc why is there so much poverty unemployment malnourishment sickness etc in the world if god is powerful and merciful why does he not abolish these and give everyone a decent life the question posed by the brother is that one of the non-muslim friends is saying that all religions are superstitious and they're false science is ultimate and always developing i agree with the brother that most of the religions they are superstitious and they are false but not all islam alhamdulillah is based on truth as far as science is concerned if you compare science with the religious scriptures of the various religions i do agree with you that most of the religious scriptures they will fail the test but if you compare modern science with quran you will find out that there is not a single verse in the glorious quran which is against any established signs there are more than 6000 verses in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about science and there are many scientific facts mentioned in the quran 1400 years ago which was discovered recently 30 years back 50 years back 100 years back 300 years back now who can tell us how come the glorious quran 1400 years ago mentioned about these facts in biology in zoology in oceanology in embryology in medicine in hydrology which we came to know recently 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back about water cycle that every living creature is made from water however the creation of the universe the big bang and hundreds of things which science came to know recently 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back 300 years back the quran mentioned 1400 years ago how can you justify this out of more than 6 000 verses of the glorious quran more than a thousand speak about science and not a single verse of the glorious quran is going against established science so if you compare quran with modern science alhamdulillah quran is far superior and science as you rightly said is developing and many things what the quran has mentioned which science hasn't confirmed yet but neither can it say it is wrong inshallah in the near future science fair even confirmed that so quran is far superior to science but i do agree if you compare with scriptures of other religions all the other scriptures besides the quran they will fail the test so quran is a book based on truth quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c-e but it's a book of signs s-i-g-n-s it's a book of ayats more than six thousand ayats are there signs are there or to which more than thousands speak about science coming to the last part of the question that why are millions of children in the world dying of hunger why is there suffering in the world why people are homeless why people are in pain and suffering the reply to this question is allah says in the quran in surah mulk chapter number 67 verse number two it's allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds this life in the world is a test for the hereafter allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has sent the human being on the face of the earth has sent us at the test for thereafter and allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 155 surely we will test you with something of fear and hunger with some loss of lives and goods and what you have earned through the toiling in the world and give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere that means allah is saying every human being will be tested with fear and hunger with the loss of goods and lives and your toils what you have worked hard and accumulated but give glad tidings to those who patiently persevere as i mentioned this life is a test for thereafter and allah subhanahu wa ta'ala tells different human beings in different ways allah cannot have the same paper the examination paper keeps on differing every year so allah test different people with different ways some with wealth some with health some with poverty some with diseases so allah is testing these people with hunger with fear with suffering do they yet have faith in allah there are some people who children are born handicapped the children are assumed they are innocent but it's a test for the parents allah tell different people in different ways and depending upon how will you react will you cause so this is a test allah is testing different people in different ways no way does it say that a person who will suffer in this world will go to hell nowhere does it say that people who are poor will fail in the test in fact it is easier for a poor man to go to jannah than a rich man allah is testing if we have summer if we have patience if we had will be successful in the hereafter so since this is the test the atheists will not be able to understand because they don't believe in the great allah but for a believer for a moment he realizes that this world the life that we lead in this world is a test for the hereafter and we are here to pass this test so with this way in our life your faith in allah if you follow the commandments of allah and obey what is mentioned in the glorious quran inshallah you will be successful in this world the next question posed by nader ahmad from bangladesh sir i am 20 years old and really inspired by you in the field of dawah when i tried to convey the message of allah to the hindus using the references of chandogya and swatha sathar upanishad and yajurveda that god is only one he has got no idols no images etc some hindus counter me by saying that they believe god is one but god has come to earth in different forms and different ways from age to age like shiva brahma vishnu etc but we worship all his forms how can i reply to them logically the brother has the question that when he tries to convince the hindus about the oneness of allah regarding monotheism they agree that god is one but they say that god has come in different forms like in the form of shiva brahma vishnu how do i reply to them what they are referring to is awtar hindus believe that almighty god has come down on the face of the earth in the form of atar now what is the meaning of the word is coming from sanskrit what au and meaning to descend down and here according to sansa's grammar it means that some possession of allah is descending down some thing possessed by god descending it cannot be god himself so anyone who says that author means god himself coming down is totally wrong it's against the rules of sanskrit it means allah has sent down someone so in the real context what they're talking is about messengers and that's what we believe that allah subhanahu ta'ala has sent 124 000 prophets on the face of the earth by name 25 ambition in the quran adam noah abraham moses jesus muhammad may peace be upon them all but a beloved prophet muslim said that allah wa ta'ala has sent down 124 000 prophets on the face of the earth maybe these people rama krishna they were prophets of god maybe though the name is not mentioned so i cannot say rama salam but maybe they are prophets but even if they were prophets of god they were sent only for those people and that time because all the messengers and prophets that came before the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him they were sent only for those people and for that time prophet muhammad peace be upon him because he was the last and final messenger he was sent for the whole of humanity so what we have to understand that the author they are talking about is the same concept as the messengers as prophets what we muslim believe so we have no objection that maybe ram was a prophet maybe krishna was the prophet maybe brahma the prophet we have no problem but they were prophets of god and they were not god themselves because the vedas clearly mentioned that in their way chapter number 32 verse number three and sitha in sanskrit means an image a photograph a painting a sculpture a statue an idol so nathan's of that god there is no prathima there is no painting there is no photograph there is no idea there is no sculpture there is no image so we have no problem in believing that these were messengers but surely they wanted almighty god so if you explain the concept of aftar inshallah you will be able to get them closer to islam the next question is from rizwan bashir from punjab pakistan sir i want to get into missionary work like sheikh ahmad didat to give dawa to the christians of pakistan please guide me how can i study the bible which points or verses of the bible are compulsory for thy to read and memorize whether israel from pakistan has asked a question that he wants to become like sheikh ahmad didaad man allah grant mercy to him men like random genes after those and he wants to do dawah to the christians of pakistan the best i would recommend to you is that you should read the booklets written by sheikh ahmad and he has written about 15 to 20 booklets they have been compiled in two volumes the choice volume one and choice volume two all put together there are approximately 50-20 booklets so if you read these booklets if you memorize them it will be very helpful for you to dawah to the christians there are various video cassettes available of adidas you can go on the internet you can go on the youtube you will find them available officially released by them for somewhere close to 80 to 90 videos you can watch them you can memorize them it will be really helpful for you besides sheikh dhida's books and video cassettes you can even go on my website zarknight.com which has a separate section called as international java training program when you go to the international training program there is a section only on christianity if you open that section and read you will find the common question asked by christians regarding islam 10 common questions how the christians tried to prove the divinity of jesus christ peace be upon him and so on and so forth the various questions the answers are given regarding which verses of the bible should you memorize for doing dawah with the christian the separate section in which is mentioned verses of the bible and we have given first maybe 15 20 verses of the bible then the next 15 20 verses of the bible maybe a couple of hundred verses if you memorize these few hundred verses from the bible you will also be able to debate the pope then we have given maybe 25 of the quran to memorize the next 25 the next 25 maybe a couple of hundred verses of the quran if you know this couple of hundred verses of the quran and memorize the couple of hundred verses of the bible inshallah you can even debate with the pope and if you read the complete section on christianity and memorize it and you can even see my video cassettes one of the good video cassettes is similarities between islam and christianity there's also a debate of mine with dr william campbell the quran in the bible in the light of science a debate of mine with pastor rokhandeen on was christ really crucified peace be upon him so if you see these videos and see these debates inshallah that will be very helpful for you to do dhawa with the christians of pakistan the next question is from muhammad farooq from chittagong bangladesh some of my muslim brothers complained about you that you proof quran is true by science as a result it is understood that quran has less status than science and science seems to distinguish between the truth and falsehood what is the opinion the comment made by the brother that when i try and prove quran with the help of science i am trying to prove that science is more superior to quran and that is totally false if any of you hear my video cassettes on quran modern science they'll come to know that i am comparing our avayastic the aztec of the muslims that is the quran with the yashtik of the non-muslim which is science and i said that quran is the last and final revelation of allah which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammed peace be upon him and in every age the quran has proved itself to be the word of god previously was the age of miracles and quran is the miracle of miracles then came the age of literature and poetry alhamdulillah muslim and non-muslim arabic scholars alike they claim the quran to be the best arabic literature available on the face of the earth but today is not the age of literature and poetry today is the age of science and technology and if you compare quran with modern science you will come to know that quran is far superior when i'm comparing quran with modern science i'm telling what science has come to know recently 30 years back 40 years back 50 years back 100 years back quran has mentioned 400 years ago for example quran mentions the creation of the universe in surah chapter number 21 do not the unbeliever see that the heaven and the earth will join together and we close them asunder this is similar to the big bang and the big bang says that our universe was one primary nebula there was the secondary separation of big bang which gave rise to galaxies the sun the stars including a planet earth and that's how the universe came into existence this was first described in 1973 by a couple of scientists for which they were nobel prize that is hardly 47 years back 50 years back imagine quran mentioned 1400 years ago the creation of the universe the big bang what we came to know 50 years back the quran mentioned 14 years ago so when i'm comparing the yastic of the atheist of the unbeliever of the non-muslim that is science with avaryastic the quran i say quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c-e but it's a book of signs it's a book of ayats and there are more than 6 000 ayats more than 6 000 signed in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about science and when we compare we come to know that our hashtag the glorious quran is far superior so when i'm comparing science with the glorious quran nowhere do i say that science is superior all what is mentioned in the quran 14 years back science has come to know recently so what i am trying to prove that our glorious quran the last and final revelation of allah subhanahu wa which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the ultimate book it is far superior than modern science so if you hear my lecture correctly and with attention you will come to know i am uplifting the status of the quran far superior to the state of the science in no way am i saying that science is more superior than the quran i am using dayastic science with avaya the quran and quran alhamdulillah excels and proves it is superior to science hope that answers the question next question from muhammad shwab from dubai can i pray isha at 2 a.m due to difficult working hours as far as the time for isha is it is after the time for magrib ends approximately depending upon different countries approximately one and a half hour after sunset it starts and is up to nest full length that is up to midnight this is the time between which you should offer salah you cannot offer isha or any prayer before time or after the time expires so offering isha afternoon full that is midnight is prohibited since you're staying in dubai now i believe the magnet time in dubai would be close to 7 pm and the sunrise is at 5 50 am in the morning so if you calculate from 7 pm when the sun sets up to 5 50 sunrise it's approximately 10 hours 50 minutes so the next full length the midnight would be 5 hours 25 minutes after sunset which is 12 25 am so in dubai you can offer isha salah approximately one and a half hour after sunset that is from 8 30 up to 12 25 midnight miss full line you want to offer at 2 am in the morning it's not permissible and as far as issa is concerned the prophet said the more you delay before you sleep it is preferable but before this full line so if you are living in dubai you can offer your salah anytime between 8 30 p.m up to 12 25 a.m you cannot offer after that or before that you are saying that you are working and you are doing a job and because you're busy difficult to pray on time this is not accepted at all and since you're living in dubai in uae which is a muslim country it is not possible that anyone can prevent you from offering isha salah on time irrespective whether you're working in a muslim company or non-muslim company you can always request them to give you a few minutes to offer your salah it is preferable you offer in jamaat go to the mosque and there are many mosques in dubai take a short break a few minutes no one can prevent you if someone prevents you go and complain to the authorities of dubai i'm sure inshallah they will reprimand your company no one can tell you that work is compulsory and can prevent you from offering salah especially in a muslim country especially in the country where majority are muslims especially in the gulf country in dubai i've been several times to dubai i've spent several years in dubai you may be feeling shy very well go and tell your boss whichever company you're working in whether muslim or non-muslim and tell him i want to offer isha salah in the mosque he can never prevent you if he prevents you go and complain to the authorities of dubai inshallah they will put the person in the place the next question is from maida from kashmir india how can one become punctual in offering salah this is a very good question that how can one become punctual and offering salah and according to me each and every muslim should be very punctual and should take care that they offer salah on time all the males all the muslim male should offer five times salah in jamaat in the mosque and see to it that they reach the mosque before akama so that they are in time how can you do it nowadays it's very easy you have several applications of prayers of salah you just go to the app store if you have iphone or go to the google store if you have an android and type prayer or sala and there are hundreds of apps available these apps give you a reminder at the time of salah and depending upon the app you can even change how many minutes before you want the alarm to go on or go off as far i'm concerned i take extra precaution that i should reach the masjid in time not only before kama but few minutes before so that i can even offer the sunnah salah what i do though i've got various apps i prefer keeping alarms and i keep minimum 3 alarms for every salah based on the aadhaan of every salah the five time salah i put an alarm of five minutes before the aadhaar time where i'm staying in putrajaya in malaysia this is the first alarm second alarm is at the time of aadhaan and the third alarm is few minutes late the first alarm is indication for me that whatever work i'm doing i should stop in the next few minutes maximum five minutes so that whatever work i'm doing i should wind it up and i see to it that i never pick up any calls once the first alarm begins to ring i do not take any other work i do not pick up calls this time is now dedicated to see to it that i reach in time for the most important appointment the most important appointment the point with allah it is salah so the first alarm is the indication for me that five minutes are left on i should wind up what am i doing i should not take any other new work the second alarm is on the dot when is the time for aadhaar at that time i leave everything and i go and do my wudu i go to the washroom i take about two minutes for that i do my wudu that takes another two minutes then the third alarm rings depending upon how much time i require to reach before the akama before every salah there is either two rakat or for a kasuna before there are sunnah before zora nasser there is four kasuna mokada and germa before maghrib and isha there are two two rakat so if there's two rakat i see to it i reach at least three minutes before karma because today two rakaat takes about two to three minutes i know the time i take from my house going my lift to the mosque exactly is three minutes i leave my house four or five minutes before because sometime the lift may take one minute to come up sometime two minutes most of the time the staff see to it that the lift has already arrived for me i reach on time so i leave five minutes plus three minutes before eight minutes before akama my bell rings if i have to offer two raka sunnah that is for the fajr time for the mongrenisha time for the zoho and assert time i have to pray four rakaats the alarm brings five plus six minutes eleven minutes before adan time or ten minute before that time so that i reach in time for my salah where i am living in putrajaya the akama time is 15 minutes after the azan time in most parts of the world it is 20 minutes so based on that i do my wudu exactly at the time of aadhaar i do my wudu i go to the washroom i prepare myself and if it's four o'clock i have to read immediately after voodoo i leave the alarm rings and i leave the house if i have to offer two raka salah that is for father time manisha i may have one or two minutes after doing the wudu when the alarm rings i leave so that i am in time to be punctual for the salah is very important see to it that before the karma starts you should reach the mosque you have to base the timing depending upon how far is the mosque from your home or from your office place you do the timing set the alarm and believe me you will find a world of a difference you will find the serenity in your life you will find the calmness the peace in your life offering salah in jamaat in the mosque on time and for a practicing muslim his full day revolves around salah times what time it depends upon the salah time what time he meets people depends upon salah time what time he gives appointments everything is related to salah that if i want to meet someone it should not last it's a lot time i'll give him okay come two hours before salah or one half before salah immediately after salah is over and my timetable is everything revolving around salah so salah is the most important deed that allah will ask you the first deed that allah will ask you on the day of judgment is your salah so being on time is very important i have alarm for these five compulsory salah as well as from my tahajid tajut is the most important kayamu lan along with with her is the most important salah after the fat salah that's one of them then is the torah sunnah before the father salah and many people come and tell me that brothers are here i pray four times four times allah on time but fajr i cannot get up what should i do so i asked the person that suppose you have an appointment they say that no we sleep in the night but we don't get up and we can't get up you know so it's not our fault i tell him that if you have an appointment early in the morning maybe one hour before the sun rise and their appointment is very important for a business and in that appointment there are high chances that you will earn a million dollar so will you be able to get up on time for the appointment he'll tell me if it's a million dollar i will not sleep the full night i said why a million dollar i don't mind staying away the full night so i tell him that our beloved prophet muslim said that the torah sunnah before the fajr sallah is more valuable than the earth and the wealth in it the earth and the wealth in it would be trillions and zillions of dollars so for a million dollar you not sleep the full night a prophet said two raka's sunnah before the fajr salah imagine what would be the value of the fajr salah so if you know the real essence of the salah and how valuable it is there is no question that you will not get up the problem is because you don't know the value you are very relaxed imagine if you have to go and meet the prime minister what will you do you will get up early you will reach before time you will be dressed up in the best of loads will you be late for the appointment with the prime minister and answers no allah compared to prime minister prime minister nothing if you have to meet the king what will you do the appointment with allah is the most important appointment of your life how can you be late so if you know that allah is the most powerful is the most wise is the most knowing he is billion trillion countless time better than the king or better than any prime minister of president in the world so if you have this faith if you have this belief inshallah inshallah you will see to it that you pray five times allah on time including a taj of salah and if you're punctual your full life will change it will be disciplined and alhamdulillah you will find the peace and serenity and sakena in your life the next question posed by brother abdul haq from tamilnadu india is dhawa compulsory yes dawah is a fardh it is compulsory allah subhana allah says in the glorious quran in surah al-assar chapter number 103 verse number one to three that by the token of time man is verily in a state of loss allah is taking the oath of time that man is verily in a state of loss except those who have faith those who do righteous deeds those who exert people to truth and those who exhort people to patience and perseverance this surah al-assar is the raheem it is the path to jannah it is the criteria for any human being to go to jannah and allah says in the surah surah al-assar that humankind is in loss is in khasarah except if you have four things number one is iman believe faith number two is righteous deeds i'm gonna solid heart number three is whatever inviting people exhorting people to truth that is doing dhawa and islam and number four is what was obvious inviting people to patience and constancy so for any human being to go to jannah minimum four criterias are required iman that is belief righteous deeds inviting people to truth dawa or islam and inviting people to patients and perseverance if any one of these four is missing you may be a very good muslim you may be 35 times a day you may have gone for hajj you may be giving zakat you may be fasting in the month of ramadan but if you don't do dhawa if you do not invite people to the haqq according to surya assad you shall not enter jannah if allah wants to forgive you and guide to jannah that is allah's prerogative but if you do not do dawah according to surial assad you shall not enter jannah according to imam shafi he said that if this surah alone was revealed it would have been sufficient for the hidayah for the guidance of humankind it's such a powerful surah and one of the criteria to go to jannah is tawa so dawa is compulsory it's not optional some people say it is no it's not foreign it is compulsory every muslim should do dhawa and allah subhanahu ta'ala says in the quran in surah al-imran surah number 3 at 110 it says say he muslims he had the best of people involved for mankind because you enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong and believe in allah allah is calling you akaira umma because the best of people because you enjoying what is good and forbid what is wrong and believe in allah if you do not enjoy what is good and if you do not forbid what is wrong if you do not do dawah you are not fit to be called as you aren't fit to be called as the best of people therefore doing dawah inviting non-muslims to the truth of islam is compulsory that's the reason allah called you allah also says in the glorious quran in surah fusillah chapter number that who is better in speech than one who invites people to the way of allah a woman who called me who is better in speech than one who invites to the way of thy lord who walks righteousness and says that i am a muslim the best profession according to the glorious quran is a person who invites people to the truth of allah who is a die the best profession for a muslim is a die what is the beloved prophet he was a messenger of allah he was adai so dhawa is compulsory and if you read the quran one third of the quran is talking about the non-muslims about the ali kitab about the jews and christians saying say to the one who rejects the faith say to the non-muslims allah says say o jews and christians so all this allah is telling you to tell them allah says kul 332 times in the quran tell them tell them tell who in a salah in the masjid the imam is reciting allah one and only now everyone in the mosque are muslims they believe allah is one so who is the imam telling imam is telling us muslim that when you go out of the mosque say to those who don't believe in one god that allah is one how many of us muslims do that the imam is reciting say to those who reject faith everyone in the mosque they have faith allah is telling the muslims to go and tell those non-muslims tell them allah saying say your people of the book say oh jews and christians allah says do not say trinity how many of us muslims follow the quran one third of the quran is telling you tell to the non-muslims tell to the alayki tell to the unbelievers how many was muslim to dhawa dawa is for the end it is one of the criteria to go to jannah if you do not do dawah under normal circumstances you shall not go to jannah if allah wants to forgive you as allah says allah will forgive any sin except the sin of shirk and allah wants to put you in jannah that's allah progressive but davas compulsory is for the end and every muslim should do dawah as much as possible it is the best profession hope that answers the question and during limited time you will have to end the session here inshallah we will meet next time at the same time inshallah also earlier at 11 15 at the time of malaysia gmt would be 3 10 next week inshallah live in my son would be joining so next time we'll meet for the program ask dr sakir and his son farik till then assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi"
