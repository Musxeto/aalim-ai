  "transcript": "we will take the last question muhammad bilal he says i am a veterinarian from feslabad pakistan if allah knows which sin i will be committing in the future why does he not stop me allah says in the glorious quran chapter 67 verse number two it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you are good in deeds so this life it is a test for the hereafter and allah he does know what sins you are going to commit in the future so why does he not stop you this life is a test for the hereafter and we human beings we have been given a free will we human beings we are a unique creation allah subhana tala already created the angels who do not have a free will we human beings we are a unique creation and i would like to give you a simple example during an examination while the students they are appearing for the examination the teacher passes by one of the students and the teacher notices that the student has written the answer for question number one wrong if the teacher wants she can correct the student during the examination that the answer to question number one it is wrong and correct the answer the correct answer so and so the teacher can do that but it will be unjust upon the other students the other students they will think why did i toil why did i put in so much effort if i knew that the teacher will help during the examination so even though the teacher knows the answer the teacher has to be just in this situation and should not help the student because it is an examination similarly this life it is a test for the hereafter even though allah knows that we'll be committing sins allah he has given us a free will because this is a test and based upon our deeds we will either enter paradise or we will enter hellfire and even if a person he commits sins the door of repentance it is open even if a person commits sins he can very well ask repentance from allah and inshallah allah he will forgive him and there are four criteria for repentance the first is that you should stop the act immediately the second is a sincere repentance from allah subhana tala the third is that if you've taken something from someone and if you can return it you should return it for example if you've robbed something you should return it and the fourth is that you should make a strong resolution that you will not return to the sin again so you should follow these criteria of repentance and if you are sincere repentance from allah he will forgive you"
