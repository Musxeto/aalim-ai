  "transcript": "what did the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam prefer to eat breaking his fast it's mentioned the Hadi of ab volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2349 it's mentioned that Prophet M wasallam when to break his fast he us to have fresh dates fresh dates and if he did not find fresh dates he us to have right dates and if that wasn't available he used to have water so the best is to have fresh date that is son of the Prophet if you can't find fresh date then you can have right dates if you can't find right date then have water if you can't find water than any food that's available you can break your fast and if you can't find any food or if you're Midway traveling then at least you break the fast with the intention you intend in your heart that you've broken the fast and as soon as you find food you can have it Subhan Allah hopefully we won't be in that situation these days one never knows doct is what's the best thing to announce whilst you're breaking the fast the Dua or the prayer or any announcement which is uh specific for breaking the fast many Muslims they say many duas before they put the food in their mouth and all these Dua that is there of Breaking the fast most of them they are or they unauthentic they the authentic Dua while breaking the fast is of sun Abu da volume number two book of fasting Hadith number number 2350 in which the prophet recited let's mention inshallah which means that the thirst has been quenched the veins have been moistened and the reward is certain if Allah Wills now though this do authentic some of them say this Dua before they put the food in their mouth before they break the fast which by meaning itself it doesn't make sense this Dua is supposed to be said after you put the food in the mouth the right thing is before you put the food in the mount you have to say bah that was a practice of our beloved prophet wasallam and after he ate the dates and water or he ate food and he had water then this Dua makes sense inah which means my thirst has been quenched only when you have water can your thirst been quenched so how can you say this Dua before you break the fast only after you break the fast and you had dates and you had the fruits or you had the food and then you had water and you say that my thirst had been quenched and my veins have moistened and the reward is certain inshallah and there are various other of prophet wasallam so as far as the Dua immediately before breaking the fast Say bah and after breaking when your thirst is quenched you have to read this Dua but there are other Hadith it's mentioned Inn ma volume number three Hadith number 1752 that the Beloved Prophet said that the Dua of three people are never unanswered mean they're always answered that is the Dua the supplication of a just ruler and Imam the Dua of a person who fast until he breaks his fast and the Dua of an oppressed the same message repeated Inn ma volume number three Hadith number 1753 that a person who fasts his Dua accepted when he breaks his fast so before breaking the fast you can do any Dua you can pray to Allah subhana ta'ala your own language in the Arabic any Dua you can ask from Allah ask for forgiveness ask for supplication whatever you feel you can ask this is the best time before breaking the fast"
