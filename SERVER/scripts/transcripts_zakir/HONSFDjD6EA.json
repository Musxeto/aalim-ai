  "transcript": "uh sir we are still on this 11th century i want to say something on this that as you told that uh as you told that there is something fishy in the proof that's why they didn't prove put the proof i got this fish on the net uh they recite to the inion.com ini.net that have been banned actually but i got one page in that that there were two pictures displayed on that one was the actor who acted as osama bin laden in the film displayed to all another was osama bin laden and the title was any fool with two eyes can see easily that these two persons are not same that are the proof well america put it before that another thing my question is that i'm working in hl we are given a handbook which contains do's and don'ts on the top page of the handbook there's written bhagavad-gita you of we are having is correct or not thank you our request again from the audience and the volunteers we prefer questions from non-muslims so that let's clarify the misconception and then come to the muslims they may be attending several programs as such i normally prefer giving a chance to the non-muslim they may not be having this chance regularly to ask any question on islam the brother i suppose the question before that he made a comment that there was a fish on the net and he saw that one proof was authentic and the original osama bin laden was false again this fish could also be fishy so i'm not gonna be one-sided ah and that proof you got is correct even that could be cooked up by somebody who's enemy of america so i don't believe on that fish also so you have to be neutral i cannot be biased and start judging saying ah brother you are right you know the proof they gave her that also could have been cooked up that's what we have in talaka you know teleka telegraph the audio clusters and video cassettes so all this is a gimmick of media see i am a man of the media we know if you want we can change very easy to change something on the media is very easy i can make you say what you have not said also that's a field so it's very easy so let's keep the media aside again that also i don't agree what is right or wrong there's no proof at all now coming to your question what the brother quoted the shlok from bhagavad-gita chapter number four for the brother quoted he didn't give the quraysh it's from bhagavad-gita chapter number four that whenever there's adharam there is violence there is anarchy in the world almighty god he comes and he takes the form of awtar and he sees to it that this whatever anarchy whatever trouble whatever chaos is there in the world he comes to finish that thing by taking the form of atar is it right do we agree the difference what we say as muslims what we muslims say that almighty god he sends his messenger whenever people deviate from the truth he keeps on sending messenger that allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 13 verse number seven well equally common heart and to every nation have we sent a messenger guide allah says in the quran there is not a nation or a tribe whom we have not sent a one or a guide what we say that almighty god sent messengers like adam moses jesus muhammad peace be upon them all all of them were messengers of almighty god the hindus believe in the author almighty god he takes forms we say messengers they say almighty god takes forms that's the difference the difference is they say almighty god comes down himself in taking form which we disagree with christianity disagrees islam disagrees what we agree is somewhat similar though it's a difference of chalk and cheese but what we say almighty god sends messengers these are chosen people of almighty god to guide the people to the truth and the last and final messenger that came on the face of the earth was prophet muhammad peace be upon him and allah sent several revelations several revelation by name four are mentioned if you have something like the old testament something like the new testament we muslims say this is the last testament this is the last testament of almighty god"
