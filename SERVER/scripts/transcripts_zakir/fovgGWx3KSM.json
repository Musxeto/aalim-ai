  "title": "Is there any mention of 'the seven day' weekly cycle-order of creation in the Quran? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh good evening Dr sir I am Raja working as executive coming from Chennai before putting my question I will tell an example then I will put a question scientists invented a lot of instruments for human beings for example Alexander Graham Bell invented telephone but at the time of Alexander Graham Bell a phone is different model but in our modern 21st century we are using mobile we are sending emails internet clippings pictures all over the globe what I am telling is whichever the man made some person can change but one thing I understand though I'm a spiritual person the weekly cycle that is the seven days of the week it's uniformly followed all over the globe whether it is India or Afghanistan or USA or Germany or Europe Middle East Africa whatever it is around 60 billion people following the weekly cycle that is seven days Sunday to Saturday uh I think Dr G this seven days weekly cycle is not created by a human being I understood the weekly cycle is created by the almighty creator my question is now I am putting these seven days cycle is written in al-kitab and another sub question is is there is any order of creation mentioned in Al-Quran that's all we'll ask the question that normally when we invent a human being invents if the example of Alexander Graham Bell who invented telephone But as time keeps on passing it keeps on changing and now we have mobile phone which is different but these are human creations but the weekly cycle that we have throughout the world is a creation of almighty God it's made by almighty God therefore it is followed throughout the world he wants to know that about this creation of the world is it mentioned in the Quran brother let me tell you one thing that I do agree with you human beings when they do something they invent it keeps on evolving keeps on improving unlike god god is perfect he creates something he can make it perfect or he may reveal in stages because to the creation which has created form you know understand for example he sent many Messengers the first message of Adam peace be upon him and he kept on sending messages 124 000 Messengers then last is Prophet promise peace be upon he revealed many messages many books some of the previous books are mentioned the Quran and the final one is the Quran not that almighty God did not know about the Quran that time the human means could not grasp the message so depending upon the level of the human being he kept on sending a revelation when he found they could grasp it he sent the last and final Revelation and sent the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon me now coming to your question of the weekly cycle seven days followed same throughout the world you said from Sunday to Saturday the seven weekly cycle is there throughout the world but it's not identical if you go to a Muslim country Sunday is not a holiday Friday is a holiday so it is not from Sunday to Saturday it is Friday to Thursday but seven days are there but 17 cycle is the same but the days May differ which is a day for Holiday Etc and similarly if you read the Bible the Bible too speaks about seven days about the creation even the Jewish scriptures speak about that even the Quran speaks about that even the Hadith speaks about that Quran mentions in several places that almighty God he created the world in six days in six epochs what is mentioned in the Quran and the other scriptures on the face of it it's the same but if you go into details that the world of a difference the way Quran speaks is more scientific what the other scriptures speak it may not be that scientific for example the Bible too speaks about the creation of the universe it says almighty God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh day that means god requires rest Quran also says almighty God created the world in six days but doesn't say God rested on seven days why because Quran says in Surah chapter number two verse number 255 in Ayatul Kursi Allah that is eternal he's all powerful he's one no Slumber can seize him nor does he require rest so almighty God does not require sleep he does not require rest so where is the question of him resting so a lot of the portions match but not everything if we say God requires rest means he's like you and me human being requires rest almighty God does not require rest so here we differ what is mentioned in the Bible it talks about 6 24 hour periods six days of 24 hours which scientists say the universe could not have been made in six days or 24 hours so scientists disagree with the narration mentioned in the Old Testament in the Bible as far as the Quran the Quran doesn't mention any way that almighty God created in 624 days the Arabic word Yom the plural is ayam mentioned in the Quran has got two meanings one meaning of your means uh normal 24 a day like how we have and the other meaning is a period it can be of any length like an epoch and scientists have got no problem accepting that the Universe was created in six epochs in six long periods maybe million years or millions of years there's no problem so here we differ as far as the creation the Quran has got hundreds of verses which talk about creation I can give a talk on that time does not permit me I'll just mention a few samples I said what does Quran speak about creation it speaks empty number of things but most of the things what Quran has mentioned we did not know at that time when the Quran was revealed when the Quran was revealed 14 years ago these things were unknown for example today when we ask a scientist he will tell you when we ask him how did universe come into existence so he will tell you that initially there was a primary nebula then there was a secondary separation a big bang which gave rise to galaxies the Stars the planets the Sun as well as the earth on which we live this was discovered by a couple of scientists about 35 to 40 years before and this they called as the Big Bang now what was discovered 40 years ago with the scientist today called as big bang is mentioned in the Quran more than 14 years ago in foreign speaks about the creation of the universe and nutshell that the heavens and the Earth were joined together and we clothed them asunder today what the scientists speak about the creation and calling it The Big Bang is already mentioned in the Quran 14 years ago previously we thought that the earth on which we live was flat just about few hundred years back we came to know when Sir Francis Drake in 1577 when he sailed around the Earth he proved that the Earth was spherical Quran mentioned this 1400 years ago one of its meanings and expands and the Earth is an expands the other meaning is derived from the Arabic which means an egg it does not refer to a normal leg it specifically refers to the Egg of an ostrich and we know that the world is not completely round like a ball it is certain from the pole and if we analyze the shape of an egg of an ostrich that two is geospherical in shape imagine the Quran speaks about the geospherical shape of the Earth for 10 years ago we thought the light of the moon was its own light recently we came to know in science 100 years back 200 years back that the light of the moon is not its own light but it's a reflected light puran mentions this 14 years ago Khan chapter number 25 verse number 61. that almighty God has created the constellations in the sky and placed therein a lamp the sun having its own light and the moon having reflected light or borrowed light Arabic word used for the Moonlight is munir anur which means borrowed light or affected light but for the sun light it's called as siraj Diya meaning a torch a blazing lamb a shining Glory indicating the light of the sun is its own light in this way there are many verses in the Quran which talks about the creation talk about astronomy when I was in school I'd learned that the sun though it revolved it did not rotate about its own axis it was stationary chapter number 21 was number 33. it's Allah who has created the night and the day the Sun and the Moon each one traveling in orbit with its own motion the Quran says the Sun and the Moon besides revolving they also rotate about The Onassis and today after science the advance we have come to know that we can have the image of the sun on the table top and we find that the sun has got black spots and it takes about 25 days for these black spots to complete one rotation indicating that sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one rotation in this way Quran speaks about the sky as a protective ceiling in foreign speaks about the first state of matter that is plasma the Quran says in Surah chapter number 51 verse 47 that we have created the vastness the expanding Universe which we came to know recently so in this way the Quran speaks about creation in several places but the point to be noted is that unlike other scriptures even they are the scriptures The Vedas the Bible the other scriptures they do speak about creation Now many of the verses what they speak about creation they match with science but many of the verses also go against established science but as far as the Quran is concerned the Quran contains more than six thousand verses or to which more than a thousand speak about science and not a single verse of the Quran goes against established science the difference between the Quran and the other scripture is that not a single verse of the Quran goes against established science it may go against scientific hypothesis which take u-turns but not a single verse goes against establish science that's the reason the Quran is a unique book and we say it is the only revelation of almighty God the only religious scripture which has been maintained in its pure form and is uncorrupted that's the reason even if you apply the test of science to all the religious scriptures all of them fail the test except the Quran Quran is the only religious scripture on the face of the Earth which will pass the test of science [Applause]"
