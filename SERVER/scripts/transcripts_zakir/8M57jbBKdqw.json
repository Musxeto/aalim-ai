  "transcript": "The moment you can compare Allah to anyone in this world, he's not God. If someone comes and tells me that you know almighty God is thousand times stronger than Arnold Swashnar, you might have heard the name of Anand Swashnar. You know he got the title Mr. Universe, Mr. World supposed to be the strongest man in the world in the universe. If someone says Almighty God is thousand times stronger than Anus Swashinger, the moment you can compare Allah to anyone in this world, whether it be Anus Swashinger, whether it be Dharas Singh, whether it be King Kong, whether it be a thousand times, whether it be a million times, the moment you can compare anyone to Almighty God, he's not God. There's nothing like him. This is a four-line definition of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala given in the glorious Quran which is the cornerstone of the Quran which is the cornerstone of Islam and alhamdulillah Allah says in the Quran in surah Imran chapter number three verse number 64 say oh people of the book come to common terms as between us and you which is the first term Allah ill that we worship none but Allah. This verse of the Quran surah Imran 3 verse number 64 according to me is the master key for dawa. When you want to talk to any non-Muslim regarding Islam, Allah says come to common terms as us and you. Amongst all the common terms, the most important is Allahillah that we worship them but Allah that we associate partner with him that we erect not among ourselves lords and patrons other than Allah. If then they turn back say bear witness that we are Muslims bowing to Allah. This is the master key for dawa. When you want to talk about Islam to a non-Muslim, come to common terms as between us and you. You can start with anything. You can talk about science. You can talk about literature. But until you do not talk about about Allah subhananaa tala, your dawa is useless. You may convince him not to have alcohol, not to have poke, not to cheat. But if you do not remove the shik from his life, your dawa is useless. And I've given a separate talk on this that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala all the major religions is mentioned in the scripture. Even though the scriptures have been changed in the changed form, the true concept of Allah is there. So when you get this, you compare with the Quran and tell your non-Muslim friends to believe in the true God. Allah says in the Quran in surah nisa ch 4 verse number 48 and surah nisa ch 4 verse number 116 that if Allah pleases he may forgive any sin but he never forgives the sin of shik of assorted associating partners with god or joining other gods with god shik is the biggest sin in Islam associating partners with Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is the biggest sin in Islam and if a person dies as a mushri without asking for forgiveness he will never enter Jenna. Other sins if Allah please he may forgive but the sin if you die as a mushri without coming back to the true path Allah will never forgive you. Allah says in the Quran in surah Hajj chapter number 22 verse number 73 that all those who you worship all those who you worship besides Allah if you gather all of them to create the fly you will not be able to do it and Allah continues and if the fly snatches away something you can't even get it back so all those who you worship idols and all the other false god if all of them got together to create a fly they will not be able to do it and Allah continues if the fly snatches away something you can't even get it back feeble are those who petition and feeble are those who you petition therefore shik is the biggest sin in Islam and that is the cornerstone of Islam the first pillar of Islam"
