  "title": "Why should a Menstruating Women make up for the Fardh Fasts she could not keep - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign regarding the situation of a woman who is on her period or menses she is Forgiven or she is let off from having to do the prayer and she doesn't have to make up the prayer at a later date as we've learned in previous Series in this show um what is the case with fasting is it the same as far as fasting is concerned if a lady is having a menstrual periods according to Hadith which is mentioned in say buhari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1951 she said when she was asked this question that do we have to make up for the fast or less the fast break for menstruating so she said that when we used to fast and when we used to have our menstruations during the month of Ramadan she has to say that Ramadan when we had a menstruation the prophet asked us to make up for the fast but did not ask us to make up for the Salah So based on the ruling of Muslim which was narrated to us my wife so making up for the prayer is not a requirement but making up for the fast is a requirement so if a woman has a menstrual cycle or postnatal bleeding she cannot continue with the fast the fast breaks if she has in between in the day she'll have to break the fast or even if the menstruation starts just a few minutes before sunset he'll have to break the fast the fast is not valid but if menstruation stops just before Fajr then she can keep the fast but if the menstruation stops just a few minutes after Fajr she cannot keep the fast and she will have to make up the fast later on after Ramadan the reason why the fasting breaks when a woman has a menstrual period or postnatal bleeding is because a lot of blood flows out does not want to overburden the woman so it's a Grace of Allah he does not want to make it difficult because when blood flows out and then after that if you say that you should not take a nourishment you should not take food it's an overburdening so because of that Allah has excused the woman that she need not fast but she has to make up later on the reason she has to make up the fast later on which she does not have to do in Salah because Salah is supposed to be prayed every day of your life minimum five times a day so there's no question once she misses maybe for five days Six Days Seven Days whatever it is when will she make up because she's supposed to offer Salah every day of her life but fasting is only compulsory in the month of Ramadan so if she misses for seven days in the month of Ramadan she can very well compensate for it after the month is over therefore according to my thinking according to my understanding that is told that the woman should not make up for hasala if she misses during menstrual period but she has to make up for the first wish she missile doing"
