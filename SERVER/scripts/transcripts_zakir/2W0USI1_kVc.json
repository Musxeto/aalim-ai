  "title": "Reply to Critics Who Say Quran Mentions that Where ever you Find a Khaafir you Kill him",
  "transcript": "and we find that certain verses of the quran are called out of context and one of the most famous verse of the quran in which the critic they try and say that o quran says wherever you find a non-muslim you kill him and one of the famous critics of india as you know arun shuri he wrote a book called the world of fatwa and he writes in his book and he quotes the quran in surah alba chapter number nine verse number five he says the quran says wherever you find a kaafir into bracket hindu into brackets hindu wherever you find the kafir into bracket hindu you kill him you wait for him in every study gem of four so imagine if on common hindu i know sunindu reads this quran says that whether you find the hindu kill him then immediately there will be a reaction he will start going against islam so the problem is that selected few people for their own ulterior motives because of their writing then he wrote the book the world of fatwa and he quotes the same verse which has been called by orientalist surat chapter number nine verse number five giving reference after verse number five he jumps to verse number seven directly any intelligent person will know why because verse number six has the key the reply to the allegation in context if you read foreign the first few verses speaks about a peace treaty between the muslims and the mushriks of makkah this peace treaty was relatively broken by the mushriks of makkah so by the time almighty god reaches verse number five he says that in the battlefield that wherever you find your enemy kafir means unbeliever enemy wherever you find the enemy you kill him in the battlefield if anyone quotes out of context it will sound absurd imagine a few decades earlier there was a war between usa and vietnam and if the army general of usa or the president of usa tells american soldiers in the battlefield that my soldiers don't get scared wherever you find the vietnamese kill him it is to boost up the mortar but today if someone quotes that the president of america said that wherever you find the vietnamese kill him you will make him sound like a butcher it's out of context and but naturally any army general to boost up the morale he will give moral support to soldiers so similarly when almighty god says in the quran to the believers that when the enemies come to kill you don't get scared to kill them so what's harm in it and the next verse verse number six says that if the unbelievers if they seek asylum it does not let them go it says if they seek asylum if they seek peace escort them to a place of security so that they may hear the word of allah the quran does not say if the enemy wants peace let them go the quran says escort them to a place of security today the most generous army general the maximum will tell a soldier that if the enemy wants peace let them go which army general will say that escort them to a place of security but this is what quran says if you read in context you come to know the real message of the quran"
