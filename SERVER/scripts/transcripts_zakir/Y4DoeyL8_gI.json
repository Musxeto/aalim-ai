  "title": "Reading the Quran has Its Sawaab Independent of Applying It - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "point to be noted is that one is Saab for reading the Quran the other is Saab for implementing the Quran if you read Arabic and you don't understand Arabic how can you implement on the message of the Quran whether if you read in English or Udu or Bangla the language you understand the best you may get a minute a small percentage of Saab for reading it but if you implement on the message you'll get multiple times of Saab So reading Saab is one thing in which you get more in Arabic but implementing is one thing if you read the Quran with translation and you implement on the message that you abstain from the things which are Haram and do the things which are commanded by Allah subhana tala surely the Saab is multiple times more even than reading in Arabic so the best I would say is that if you don't understand Arabic as a language the best is you read the Arabic Quran in Arabic and also read the translation it is the best you're killing two birds with one stone so that you get the Saab for reading also and you also get the Saab for implementing the message of Allah subhana tala"
