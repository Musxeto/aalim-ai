  "transcript": "We human beings we are one of the best creations of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and we are unique as compared to most of the other creation. Allah has given us a free will. We can obey him or we can disobey him. We are unique unlike most of the other creations. Human beings have got a free will. And if after Allah has given us a free will, if you obey him, you become on a higher level, higher status. But if you don't obey him, you go to the law. And Allah subhanana wa ta'ala says in chapter number 95 verse number four that we have created the human beings in the best of molds and this life that we lead it is a test for the hereafter. Allah says in surah mulk chapter number 67 verse number two it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good indeeds. So this life that we are undergoing in this world it is a test for the hereafter. Allah says Allah has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds. Allah says in surah alan chapter number three verse number 185 every soul shall have a taste of death and the final recompense will be on the day of judgment and anyone who has been saved from the hellfire and enters Jenna the garden he would have achieved the objective of this world for this world is nothing but mere chatles of deception. It is further mentioned in the Quran in surah bakra chapter number two verse number 155. Allah says surely we will test you with something of fear or hunger with loss of goods or lies or fruits of toils and give glad tidings to the person who is patiently perseverance. So this life for the human beings is a test for the hereafter. Allah will test you with fear or with hunger or with loss of goods or loss of lives or loss of toils of fruits of your toils. But give glad tide to the person who is patiently perseverance. Allah says in the Quran in surah Nahal chapter number 16 verse number 71 that Allah gives more sustainance to some as compared to the others. Allah says in suraham chapter number 6 verse number 165 Allah gives gifts more to some as compared to the others to test them. Allah says in surah anfal chapter number 88 verse number 28 that your wealth and your children are a test for you. Allah says in surah tagabun chapter number 64 verse number 14 that some amongst your wives and our children are your enemies. Allah is saying that some of your wives and your children are your enemies. Allah is testing you with wealth and children. Allah says in surah an kabud chapter number 29 verse number two that it is Allah who will come to know who is false and who is true amongst you. This life that we lead it's a test for the hereafter. And Allah has showed us the path to salvation. Allah has shown us the rahad. Allah says in surah als chapter number 103 verse number 1 to3 that by the token of time man is verily in a state of loss except those who have faith, those who have righteous deed, those who exalt people to truth and those who exalt people to patience and perseverance. These are the minimum four criteria for any human being to go to Jenna. This is known as the path to salvation."
