  "title": "Fasting during Menses or Post Natal Bleeding - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the point of view of a woman who is undergoing menstration postnatal bleeding is it prohibited or optional for them to fast to start with as far as the women who are undergoing the menstrual cycles or Postal bleeding according to our beloved Prophet wasallam it's mentioned in s bukari also in say Muslim that it is forbidden for a woman to fast who is bleeding due to menual cycle or post Nal bleeding so it is not optional it is forbidden and the reason is because when the blood flows out in a lady in a woman she loses a lot of blood and on top of that if she fast it will not be good for her health so Allah subhana wa taala it is his Mercy that he has Exempted them and made it compulsory not to fast otherwise it may be damaging for the health and Allah subhana wa ta'ala does not want to overburden any of the human beings so that's the reason they are Exempted from fasting and even in the middle of the day if the menstration begins they have to break their fast even if it begins a few minutes before Sunset they have to break the fast but they have to compensate later on but if they're undergoing the menstrual period And if the period stops just before faj even if they do not have a bath they can start their fast but if it ends even a few minutes after fa they cannot fast they have to break the fast and they have to compensate later on okay okay the next query really is regarding a woman who is pregnant or is nursing breastfeeding nursing rearing the children why they exempt it according to the words of the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 that if a person is ill and traveling he can make up his prescribed periods of day of fasting later on so most of the fukas most of the scholars they say that these women who are pregnant and breastfeeding they come under the category of those who are ill so therefore if they want they can abstain from fasting but there are clearcut say in which the prophet has Exempted these women from fasting mention in MA Hadith number 1667 that a beloved Prophet says the obligation for a person to fast and part of the prayer has been lifted from a traveler and the obligation for fasting has been lifted from a lady who's pregnant and with breastfeeding our beloved Prophet M wasallam also said it's mentioned in in the book of fasting had number 2- 74 that Allah subhana wa taala has relieved The Traveler from fasting and half his prayer and Allah subhah wa ta'ala has relieved the pregnant woman and the woman whose breastfeeding from fasting So based on these two also it's clearcut that the pregnant women and the women who are breastfeeding they have been Exempted and The Logical reason that one can think is because when a lady she's pregnant or she's breastfeeding the food she eats is not only for herself it's for herself as well as the baby she's carrying or the baby she's feeding so but natural if her fasting makes it difficult for her or become difficult for a baby then she's Exempted from fasting but if she's in the early stage of pregnancy and if she feels or she's breastfeeding and if she feels that fasting will not cause any damage to her health and will not cause a damage to the baby then she should fast if she has a doubt if she can do it with hardship as long as there's no damage to herself to her health and the baby she has option to fast not too fast but if it's causing damage to her health or the baby it becomes Haram for her to fast because Allah subhana ta'ala does not want to lay a burden more than what a person can bear and in this regard that is the reason Allah has Exempted them later on when they're healthy and they stop breastfeeding or when the pregnancy ends after postn bleeding then they have to make up for the F they have missed before the next Ramadan"
