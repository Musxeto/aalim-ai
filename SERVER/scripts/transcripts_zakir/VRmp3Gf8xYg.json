  "title": "Famous Bollywood Actor Sushant Singh committed Suicide due to Depression. What is Islamic Solution?",
  "transcript": "from Mohammed Akbar from Bangalore India recently the topic depression was trending in the Indian social media after the death of the famous Bollywood actor sushant singh rajput he was found dead hanging from the ceiling fan in his home and had reportedly been suffering from depression for about six months it is alleged that he committed suicide but the investigation is under way I have following questions on depression after seeing various social media post on it number one is depression a disease many people say it is a disease and the common example given is the postpartum depression which some women experience after giving birth to a baby number two if a person commits suicide due to depression then will it be considered a sin as committing suicide is considered Haram in Islam and the third question is posed this what is the Islamic view of depression and how to deal with it this is a similar question on a similar topic asked by show one from Bangladesh a famous Bollywood non-muslim actor named sushant singh rajput committed suicide a few days ago people all over the world including Muslims posting and sharing on social media may his soul rest in peace this is surely an indirect prayer for that person that may God grant Anjana please doctor say something about this a question on a similar topic by sohail azim from India Allah says in the Quran he does not lay a burden on a person greater than he or she can bear then why do people where the Muslims are non-muslims why do they commit suicide replying to all these questions would require more than one and a half I predict where more than one complete session I will try an untrained brief as much as I can let me confess to you that I was absolutely ignorant about this Bollywood actor sushant singh rajput I'm hearing with him for the first time and when I received this question for my team in the morning I google then I read and I came to know that sushant singh rajput was a very famous Bollywood actor and he committed suicide by hanging six days ago last Sunday on the 14th of June 2020 and according to investigation the police fear that he was suffering from depression for the past several months and they can be various causes that there was rivalry in his profession various reasons but he did commit suicide by hanging and unfortunately there are few hundred celebrity or maybe a thousand or more throughout the world through thousand toured the world who are looked upon by tens of millions of people throughout the world and we know that many of the actresses and actors as well as many fingers they are considered to be as ideal by many of the human me throughout the world and they think and they strive to become like them as though if they achieve what doctor has achieved or what the thing has achieved they will achieve the objective of their life thinking that that is the best goal not knowing that many of these celebrities to a great extent their depression and actually they don't have a very peaceful and happy life it is only the glamour that you see on the screen and unfortunately many of the human beings they followed them blindly and they spend their full life to become like them hardly not even 1% of those people trying achieved even a small percentage of what these celebrities have achieved the main purpose that the thing they'll achieve happiness is totally a misconception let me give you an example there was an article that came more than two months back on the Daily Mail of UK on the 11th of April 2020 about two months back and it gave a report of a survey that was done in the man heme University in Germany by a group of German psychologists and they did a survey that which of groups of the people they are happy and this survey they interviewed 67 thousand five hundred and sixty-two people and this sample is very large normally they survey a couple of hundred or a couple of thousand but here they interviewed 67 thousand five hundred sixty-two people and they wanted to know who are the people who are the most satisfied the survey was were the people are most satisfied with life and in the survey they said that people who believe in a God or believe in religion were more happy than the people who did not believe in religion so the least happy or the least satisfied amongst all the human beings in the world they were they taste and the survey was an in-depth and it says that among religious people the people following which religion are the most satisfied and this survey said number one were the Muslims the people who followed Islam the Muslims was the most satisfied people in the world followed by Christianity followed by Buddhism and last was Hinduism among the religious people they felt that the Muslims the gap between the Muslims and the she was very washed not that the Christian were close second the Muslim was the most satisfied and today free and life the people that are looked down upon maximum amongst any religion it is Islam the religion which is maximum spoken against in the media today is Islam the religion which is criticized maximum is Islam the people who had is the most in the world are the Muslims the people who oppress the most today in the world are the Muslims the maximum negative factor by the media and all over the world the society is against Muslims and Islam in spite of this the survey said and this survey wasn't done by Muslims it wasn't men on machines this survey said that Muslims were the most satisfied people in the world because they believed in oneness and the major factor for their happiness and satisfaction was tawheed because the concept of God in Islam the tawheed that there's no God worthy of worship except Allah and no one deserves to be worship and the one who's all-powerful all-knowing all-wise is Allah Almighty God so because of this concept and the Muslims as a whole they are the most most practicing amongst all religious people in numbers Christian maybe more who say we are Christians maybe about 2 and 1/2 to 3 billion but the Muslims are 2 billion but the percentage of Muslims practicing is much higher than any other religious group and because of the oneness this group of psychologists they rated them the highest so al hamdulillah and this survey also said that the least rate of depression amongst any people among the Muslims and the least rate of suicide amongst any people are the Muslims and the survey was then men on Muslims so coming to it we come to know that Islam has the solution to the problems of humankind coming to the basic question that the first question oppose that is depression a disease and if someone commit suicide is it Haram and what is Islam a solution for it for depression and for committing suicide regarding is depression a disease depression is mainly a mental disorder this is a variant definition but it is not a disease that you get due to a germ or a bacteria or a virus it's a mental disorder and the reason for this mental disorder are various one of the reasons for depression it can be due to hormonal changes it can be due to some enzymes that has been secreted by the brain but the common cause is due to a personality trait and the most common is environmental environmental that trace of it tells us that in India the majority of the people that that do suicide is mainly because of economic reasons and you find a large number of farmers they commit suicide then you have people due to being dissatisfied because of their job because of rivalry in the profession people commit suicide there are students at a young age because of the depression of exams they commit suicide and according to the medical research today by the Mayo Clinic they say that amongst the outpatient department who come for cure of depression about 2% of people commit suicide among the inpatient department who admit themself in hospital girl of depression about 4% commit suicide and on a whole amongst the depressed people amongst the men 7% commercial said amongst women only 1% coming to your question about the postpartum depression yeah as I said there are hormonal changes in the woman the demonstration due to postpartum after delivery and this can be the cause of depression but the suicide rate due to depression amongst the women is much less but among the people who commit suicide according to statistics 60% of the people who commit suicide they commit suicide because of a mental disorder and among these mental disorder one of the highest rate into depression so maybe one-third or little bit more than one-third cases of this suicide those who commit suicide maybe due to depression as I said there are various of the reasons regarding the second question that is it Haram to commit suicide because of depression any other reason yes in Islam committing suicide is a major sin accounting mammoth Bobby in his book al Kabeer the major sin he says committing suicide is the twenty-ninth biggest sin in Islam and Allah says in the Quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 was limit 29 and was number 30 that all those who kill themselves Allah will put them into the Hellfire and the hadith of the beloved prophet Musa al-salaam it's mentioned in that it's of tirmidhi worry number 4 I did number 2 0 4 4 that a beloved prophet musa alehsalaam said that if anyone kills himself for with iron ore with instrument or with a knife a la semana Allah we put with the Hellfire and he kept on stabbing himself with the same instrument and then this continues if someone committed suicide by taking poison Allah subhana Allah will make him do that thing taking poison in Hellfire continuously so committing suicide is a major sin and it is haram in Islam regarding the third part of the question by the first questioner that what is the Islamic solution for this the Islamic solution for depression and suicide is Allah says in the Quran in surah Radha chapter 13 verse number 28 verily in the remembrance of Allah will hearts find satisfaction so the survey which people are the most satisfied in the Muslim because the Muslim knows that readily in the remembrance of Allah will the hearts find satisfaction so this is the solution for depression and for suicide and Allah also says in the Quran in surah Baqarah chapter 2 was from 195 they do not make your own hand in the cause of your own destruction that is saying that committing suicide in ceramic and my father may Allah grant him till now he was one of the first Muslim psychiatrists in India and he was also the president of the psychiatry in in Association and he's to always say that the best treatment for a depressed person finds ID it is the Quran you read the Quran is understanding and inshallah your depression will be solved and there are treatments of depression you can take antidepressant one is a psychotherapy talking that semester instead of talking you let a lot auch to you if Allah talks to you he is the best cure in the world who I sha feels the one who can cure he is the belt daughter is the best psychiatrist so let allah talk to you that will be the best growth and the third is the ECT electroconvulsive therapy where you put and you give shocks but the best is the therapy that no psychiatric talk to you one to one and the best talking in Medan is Malala so the best solution is reading the Quran with understanding with translation I have given the talk on the topic what is the purpose of life and in this talk have described that every human being has a center some people are mainly society center what will the society think about me so they're more bothered about what will the friends and the society thing about me through their time to satisfied Society some people are neighborhood center they are more involved in trying to prove that they're better than the neighbor some people are family-centered they are more bothered about their parents some people think that what the parent says everything so the main purpose of life is to satisfy the mother some people purpose of life is to satisfy the father so even if the mother speeches against Quran and Sunna if he's a Muslim he will say no following the mother is important not to yell I think that yes obeying the mother is important but if the mother speaks against Al and in the Rasul at that time you don't listen to her but that that person is mother centered so you only want to satisfy his mother even though she goes on he's aligned is reference some people have other centered some people are children centered they are so much bothered that they want to see to it that the children are successful or they want to make the children maybe a celebrity or maybe a doctor so whatever the children say they will follow hook or by crook they want to satisfy them but a true Muslim a true moment if the person who is Allah centered his life should be revolving around the commandments of Allah the teachings of Allah and his are solely a beloved posthumous ensemble if he's Allah centered and that what was a beloved prophet and the Sabbath and the whole Farish in him they always when they did any did this to wonder will Allah be happy or not they are least bothered whether it will be against them or not will it be again with their family or not the first criteria was will align his life will be happy or not so a true Muslim should be Allah centered if you are Allah centered and if you are centered around the teaching of glorious quran and the fae hadith of a beloved for muscle assalam inshallah you can never be depressed and as I said depression is different from feeling grief or sad a person can be sad if he goes awesome business or if he if you had a death in the family but depression is a medical terminology if that thing continues for two weeks or more it's called a depression so if someone dies our beloved porcelain himself you can maximum grieve for three days that also in limitation you cannot go overboard all these are teachings are for profit because they love Allah follow Allah so if you follow the teachings of the Quran inshallah there is no question of you to be depressed because Quran has the solution to the problems of depression the depression mainly comes is because of the anxiety because you're always trying to satisfy maybe a neighbor or maybe line to satisfy someone else else in the society so best solution is the Quran and I've also given a talk on Quran the path to happiness and in that I've said that there are various types of happiness one is the false happiness which a person can get if we have alcohol or if he has drugs it's a fake happiness just maybe for a few minutes or for a few hours then secondly that temporary happiness we want to become rich and you may become rich but then after that what you may want to become actor and you become and after that what but the real true happiness is everlasting happiness that can only be achieved his agenda and Allah says in the Quran in surah in quran chapter 3 verse number 95 that Kunlun of since I cut remote every soul shall have a taste of that and the final recompense is on the day of judgement and anyone who is safe from the Hellfire and enters the Jannah has achieved the objective of this world for this world is nothing but mere chattels of deception so the main objective of a Muslim is ultimate goal ultimate happiness is Jenna and before you Jill Jenna the part - Jenna is also happiness what you lead in this life so the service the survey done in the Magnum University in Germany by the non-muslim German psychologist there what a satisfaction the satisfaction that you have even though the Muslims are ill-treated they are pressed yet we find that they have faith in Allah so because of that their satisfaction level is very high they happiness level is very high and we find that the percentage of depression in the Muslim is the least the percentage of suicide is the least and a person who's more close to a lioness or soon who follows more of the Quran and the Sunnah he may have whatever problems in this world he will not get depressed there is no question of committing suicide because the Muslim knows its immediacy and the Muslim knows that this life is a test for Hereafter and Allah says in the Quran is removed chap number 67 number two illogical ethyl maltol hiya it is Allah who has created death and life to test which of you would indeed come to the second question that many people after the actor sushant singh rajput died many people said that may his soul rest in peace and many Muslim said that so can a Muslim say that doesn't me that doesn't it mean that we are saying that may go to Jannah when any human being dies the best thing to say is in le lion origin from him we come from Allah we come from God we come and to him we return and to Almighty God we return even a Muslim dies you can say that even if a non-muslim that you can say that and once there was that procession going off for Jew and the Prophet stood up when he thought that dead body passing so the SAP I said but he our soul Allah this is a Jew we see yes but he so you mean B and as we know that from Allah Vika and to allow really done so the best thing that you can save an enormous limb life even L alive in origin from him become and to him be returned for the Muslim ears you can pray for that I can pray for a Jenna but for non-muslim from him we come and train with them and the third question about the question that when Allah says in the Quran that Allah does not lay on anyone a burden greater than you can bear so the people are depressed because the burden so is in this again the verse of the Quran what the question is referring to is the verse of the quran which in the last verse of surah Baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 26 may Allah says in the starting of the worst Allah does not lay on any human being a burden greater than he or she can bear later on the same worse it can do and we pray to allah our lord lay not on us Ramanna lay not on us a burden greater than we can bear so in allah has already said in the starting of the worse allah will not lay on us a burden greater than we can bear so why have you praying to allah lay not on us a burden greater than you can bear here the mousseline say that allah does not lay on anyone a burden greater than he or she can bear but what the human beings themselves they lay on them a burden it is like we are digging your own grave so if the human being goes out of the way - oh brother himself or to dig his own grave and that's not the fault of Allah - Allah so here we find that in depression it is the human being who doesn't know the value of life he get depressed some people they main centre is money so if they grow sad business they get depressed and they commit suicide money is not everything in life for some people mainly that they want to be very good in profession and if professionally they are they do not excel very well they get depressed they may commit suicide some people want to pass the examination and if they fail they commit suicide so they are actually putting on themselves a burden greater than they can bear so it's not a las fault it is your fault if you fail in examination that's not the end of life if you cannot earn a lot of money that's not the end of life in fact the Prophet said it is easier for a poor man to go to Jannah than a rich man because it is more easy for a poor man to follow the commands of the glorious quran the nourishment so in fact you'd be happy so your main thing is your perception and your values and what is the center so if you know what is your center in sha Allah you'll be success in real life there will not be any question of depression and there will not be any question of community society hope I once said in brief as I said this requires us to deal with and you can hear my talk on what is the purpose of life and my talk on Quran the path to happens inshallah this really more details on the subject"
