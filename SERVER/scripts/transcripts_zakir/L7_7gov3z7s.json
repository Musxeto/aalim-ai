Recite of what we have revealed to thee by inspiration and establish prayers salah for verily salah prayers restrains you from shameful and unjust deed. The second pillar of Islam mentioned in the last and final revelation Quran is salah that established salah. It restrains you from shameful and unjust deed. There's a talk I've given salah the programming towards righteousness. It's a one and a half hour talk which give details from the Quran and the say hadith that how does salah programs you towards righteousness and keeps you on the straight path. The third pillar of Islam it is zakat. Every rich Muslim who has a saving of more than the nisab level 85 g of gold he or she should give 2.5% of that saving every lunar year in charity. It's called a zakat. If every rich human being in the world gives zakat, poverty will be eradicated from this world. There will not be a single human being who will die of hunger. And the categories to whom you can give zakat is mentioned in surah tba chapter number 9 verse number 60. There are eight categories. The first is fkara a poor person who has a saving of more than the nisab level sorry who has a saving of less than the nisab level less than 85 g of gold. Number two is masakin a needy person. Number three is a person who collects the zakat you can give a salary from that. Number four is those whose hearts are coming towards Islam. Use zakat money. If you know a person will accept Islam if you influence him you can use it. The category is those whose hearts are coming to Islam. Number five a person who's a debtor. Number six freeing of slaves. Number seven, jihadi striving and struggling in the way of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala. And 10th is sabil a wayfairer a traveler. These are the eight categories mentioned in the Quran whom you can give zakat. The fourth pillar of Islam mentioned in the last and final revelation from Allah subhana wa t'ala. It is psalm that is fasting. Every adult Muslim who is healthy, he should fast in the month of Salah and who's not traveling fast in the month of Ramadan from dawn till sunset. He should abstain from food, drink and sex from dawn till the sunset. And Allah says in the Quran in surah bakar chapter 2 verse number 183 that Ramadan was that fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-restraint. The main reason of fasting is to increase your tawa to increase your god consciousness to increase your piety. Today the psychologist they tell us that if you can control your hunger you can control almost all your desires. So we are being trained I call fasting I call Ramadan as a annual overhauling like you know if you allow me to call the human being the machine it requires servicing. So Ramadan is one month servicing every year you know to let the machine come to the top level we increase our tawa we increase our god consciousness we increase our piety and I've given a separate talk on this Ramadan a date with Dr. Zak it has got a 64 episodes all details of how Ramadan is beneficial for us. And the fifth pillar of Islam is Hajj. Every adult Muslim who has the health and the means to perform Hajj, there is pilgrimage to the holy city of Makkah Mina Arafat in the month of Hajj during the dates compulsory at least once in his lifetime. Hajj is the biggest annual gathering in the world where about 4 million people gather in in Mecca, Mina, Arafat. 4 million people from different parts of the world from USA, from Canada, from UK, from Saudi Arabia, from India, from Pakistan, from Malaysia, from Indonesia. The men are dressed up in two pieces of unsewn white cloth on the command of Alama. Here we are. Oh my lord, here we are. It is the biggest annual gathering in the world. You cannot make out the person next to you, whether he's a king or a popper. All of them two pieces of unsewn white cloth. It increases the brotherhood."
