  "transcript": "my name is Muhammad Niza I just recently graduated from Medical College so my question is regarding the Haram about touching the dog so when I listen to your answer the saliva is Haram probably due to the rabies you said about Hydrophobia so now recently we know there is vaccine produced against rabies so what is your answer to it foreign that I gave one of the reasons that why we should not just type the dog and I said that licks the body and one of the reason that can be the reason and I gave that the saliva has sold in germs and ribs Etc he being a doctor is saying that now we have a rabies vaccine you know so what is your reply brother when you jump from the second floor what will happen when you fracture your leg you go to the hospital you have treatment for the factored leg will you jump from the second floor no why you're a doctor will you die chances are less second for you and I but you'll break a bone so will you jump or you can go to The Prostitute maybe you will get STD is there treatment for STD STD sexually attachment disease gonorrhea treatment is there not AIDS yes yes will you go if you have diabetes okay we'll give you insulin will you have extra sugar prevention is better than cure you're a doctor I am also a doctor so will you tell your doctor do everything I am a doctor I will give you injection so when the when the patient comes with rabies no problem go to the dogs take more bites I will keep on give you injection what will the patient tell you what will the person tell you're a good doctor patient will tell you the doctor wants to make money they're first telling okay so prevention is better than cure so in Islam is the solution the solution is stay away from it don't take vaccine might want to get injected with the disease and then take a medicine best if prevention is better than cure hope that answers the question thank you"
