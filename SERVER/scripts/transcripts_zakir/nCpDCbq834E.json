  "transcript": "the next question my name is raj what is the meaning of jihad many people they have a misconception and they think that jihad is any war for by any muslim whether it be for any reason whether it be for land whether it be for wealth whether it be for race jihad does not mean any war fought by any muslim whether it be for land whether it be for wealth whether it be for race jihad is derived from the arabic word jahada which means to strive which means to struggle jihad also means to strive and struggle against one's own evil inclation jihad also means to strive and struggle to make the society better jihad also means to strive and struggle in self-defense in the battlefield so jihad basically means to strive to struggle for example if a student is striving and struggling to pass in the examination in arabic we would say that he is doing jihad many people have a misconception that jihad can only be done by muslims this misconception can easily be removed just by quoting two words of the glorious quran allah subhana wa says chapter number 31 verse number 14 what was saying and we have enjoined upon man kindness to his parents and if the parents they do jihad strive and struggle to make you worship others besides allah subhana wa tala then do not obey them but yet live with them with love and compassion allah subhanallah clearly says in surah luqman chapter number 31 verse number 14 and 15 that if the parents they do jihad strive and struggle to make you worship others beside allah then do not obey them now this type of jihad is fisabili shaitaan a similar verse in the glorious quran in surah chapter 29 verse number 8 that if the parents they do jihad strive and struggle to make you worship others beside allah then do not obey them so here the glorious quran is talking about non-muslim parents doing jihad striving and struggling to make their children worship others beside allah this type of jihad is jihad fisabili shaytan jihad in the part of the satan what we muslims should do is jihad allah jihad in the way of allah but normally when the term jihad is used it is taken for granted that it is jihad when the term jihad is used if it is used separately or individually it is taken for granted that it is jihad fee so jihad basically means to strive for struggle one type of jihad is qatar that is fighting in the way of allah but jihad does not basically mean a war and if you look at the lifestyle of prophet muhammad peace be upon him the first 13 years of prophethood there were several verses that were revealed talking about jihad but the prophet peace be upon him he never fought physically fighting it was later on when the prophet peace be upon him went to madina there the wars took place and allah says in the glorious quran in surah chapter 29 verse number 69 and those who strive in our way we shall surely open up their pathways when this verse was revealed there was no war physical war that took place and one verse of the glorious quran is sufficient to prove that killing any innocent human being is as if you have killed the whole of humanity allah says in the glorious quran surah chapter number 5 verse number 32 that if anyone kills any human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as if he has killed the whole of humanity and if anyone saves any human being it is as if he has saved the whole of humanity so killing any innocent human being is completely prohibited in islam and even according to imam dahabi he writes in his book al-khabar 70 major sins wherein he lists the major sins and he says that murder it is the second major sin in islam so killing any innocent human being it is completely prohibited in islam this misconception regarding the word jihad previously it wasn't on the top of the charts but the media depending how the media it portrays islam these misconceptions arise in the minds of the non-muslims"
