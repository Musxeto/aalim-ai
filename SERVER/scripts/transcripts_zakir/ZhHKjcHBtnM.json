  "transcript": "as we discussed yesterday that one of the criteria an important Criterion for a person fast to be accepted is the ni it is the intention and the intention is that the fast should only be for Allah subhana wa tala and no one else so if a non-muslim if unbeliever who does not believe in Allah subhana wa tala where is the question of him doing the Nia doing the intention of fasting for Allah subhana tala so that's the reason it is not required for unbeliever to fast if he fast without the intention it will just be like anything else it will not be an act of worship it not be a fast as is considered in Islam so therefore the ni the intention is very important so for unbeliever any act of worship until he has Faith until he believes until he believes that there is only one Allah subhana wa tala unless he says the muham that there's no God but Allah and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the messenger of Allah all acts of worship that used this for the hereafter"
