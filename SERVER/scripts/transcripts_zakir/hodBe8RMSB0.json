  "transcript": "what is the meaning of alif l as far as the meaning of the words Al if Lam me Etc is concerned these words are known as they're known as broken letters and they occur in several suras of the Quran sometime they occur in single like s in Surah s chapter 38 as Sur chapter 50 as noon in suram chapter 68 sometime it occurs in Tools in pairs like tah Surah Taha chapter number 20 in chapter 27 as Yasin Sur Yassin chapter 36 sometimes it occurs in combination of three and the three combination mentioned in the Quran one occurs 6 time five times the other twice it's 13 times that occurs in combination of three one combination is Al L me it's Sur Bak chapter number two Surah Iman chapter number three and Surah number 29 30 3132 it occurs in the combination of Al Lam ra from Surah unus chapter number 10 to Surah hij chapter number 15 five times it even occurs as me in Sur sh chapter number 26 as well as Surah number 28 it occurs in the combination of four letters Al if L me raw and other combinations it even occurs twice in combination of five so in short there are five combinations single double three letter four letter five letter totally there are 29 times that are in the Quran equal to the Arabic letters Al if ba 29 times counting even Hamza there are various reasons that people have said why do these broken letters several reasons and many books have been written volumes have written some say these are the symbols of Allah subhana wa tala some say the abbrevation like noon is for n that is light some say they are signatures of Allah subhana wa tala some say they're used for rhyming some say they have got numerical values some say they have been used for calling the attention attracting the attention of the prophet and Prophet used it for the other human various reasons but the best amongst them I feel is the view which is also of abak with him for example we know what the body is made up of whatever components the body has the same elements and components are present in the earth in lesser or greater quantity we know you know the constituents of the human being you can buy it from the market you can put water but you can't give life that is the secret similarly Allah subhana wa ta'ala uses these letters and tells to the Arabs the Arab at that time they were proud of the language and Arabic was at it speak so Allah says Al l y these are your letters with your letters have produced the Quran he challenges them to produce somewhat similar to the Quran and this challenge is given in several places in Sur chapter number 52 verse number 34 that produce a book like the Quran Allah repeats a message in Sur is chapter number 17 verse number 88 Allah says produce a recital like the Quran then Allah makes the challenge a bit easier and says in Surah HUD chapter number 11 verse number 13 that Allah challenges that can you produce 10 suras like the Quran Allah further simplifies the challenge in Surah unus chapter number 10 verse number 38 that produce a single Surah like the Quran Allah makes it simplified further in Surah Bak CH 2 verse number 23 and 24 where Allah says that if you end doubt as what we have revealed to our servant Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him then produce aah somewhat similar to it and call forth your helpers and Witnesses if the any besides Allah if your doubts are but true but if you cannot do it and of ass you cannot do it then fear the fire whose fuel shall be men in Stones which is prepared for those who reject Faith so this is a challenge Allah says to the Arabs who were proud of the language this is your letters Al Lam me a b c d from your letters I've created the Quran he challenges try and produce a Surah somewhat similar to the Quran so this is the closest explanation that I feel is right it's a challenge Allah is giving and that the reason moment these broken letters uh mentioned in the Quran immediately after that there is some attribute of the Quran mentioned after that so I feel this is explanation I feel is the closest to the meanings of the broken letters and allaham"
