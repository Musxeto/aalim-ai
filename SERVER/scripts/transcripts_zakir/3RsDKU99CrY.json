  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum my name is muhammad rashid a bangladeshi currently i'm working in malaysia how to explain to non-muslim friends that they should not have alcohol allah subhana wa tala says most certainly intoxicants and gambling while unsolvable as lab dedication of stones divine nation of arrows shaitaan are an abomination from satan's handiwork abstain from such handiwork that you may prosper alcohol it is clearly prohibited in islam and alcohol is even prohibited in the bible it's mentioned in the book of proverbs chapter number 20 verse number one wine is a mocker strong drink is raging and whosoever is deceived there by is not wise it is mentioned the book of ephesians chapter number 5 verse number 18 and be not drunk with wine so the bible it clearly prohibits having alcohol but unfortunately many of the christians they yet have alcohol the bible and the glorious quran they clearly prohibit the consumption of alcohol we human beings we have an inhibitory center this inhibitory center it prevents us from doing things that we think are wrong for example when we want to go to the washroom our inhibitory center will prevent us from doing so in public our inhibitory center will prevent us from using abusive and foul language against our elders against our parents so the inhibitory center prevents us from doing things that are wrong when a person has alcohol his inhibitory center itself is inhibited this is precisely the reason that people when they are in the state of intoxication they tend to use abusive and foul language they use abusive language when they are talking to the elders many of them they even urinate in their clothes because the inhibitory center itself it is inhibited and when a person is in the state of intoxication he can commit several crimes for example rape according to the u.s department of justice in the year 1996 alone every day no less than 2713 case of rapes took place every 32 second one woman was raped and the majority of the people who committed this act of rape they were in the state of intoxication according to statistics eight percent of the americans they are involved in incest incest having sexual relations with your close relatives that means one out of 12 americans they are involved in incest and majority of the cases of incest they happen in the state of intoxication when the person has consumed alcohol many people they argue and they say that you know i am just a social drinker i only have one or two pegs every person when he starts having alcohol initially he's a social drinker no person he drinks alcohol to become a drunkard every person initially he's a social drinker he keeps on drinking and then eventually he becomes a drunkard and no person who drinks alcohol can say that i have never been intoxicated drinking alcohol it has a huge impact on your mind and there are various diseases that you can get due to the consumption of alcohol for example various types of cancer cancer of the head cancer of the neck cancer of the bowels and you can get various other diseases for example usefulness gastritis pancreatis hepatitis all these diseases you can get due to the consumption of alcohol alcohol can also cause hypertension and it can cause various skin diseases so there are various diseases that you can get due to the consumption of alcohol that's the reason we should try to abstain from having alcohol and our blood prophet muhammad peace be upon him said it is mentioned in sunnah maja volume number three chapter number 30 book of intoxicants hadees number 3372 that alcohol it is the mother of all evils and it is the most shameful act so even the hadees of our beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him they clearly say that we should not have alcohol furthermore it's mentioned in volume number three chapter number 30 book of intoxicants there are ten categories of people who are cursed by allah the one who deals with alcohol even he is cursed by allah the one who distills it the ones for whom it is distilled the one who buys it the one who sells it the one who drinks it the one who buys it for someone else the one who transports it so 10 categories of people they are cursed by allah subhana tala those people who deal with alcohol even the one who serves alcohol so we should totally abstain from the consumption of alcohol and many people they say that alcoholism it is a disease if alcoholism is a disease it is the only disease that is sold in bottles advertise in the newspapers in the magazines on radio broadcast stations on television channels it is the only disease that causes violent deaths on highways destroys family lives it is the only disease that has no germ or vital cause alcoholism it is not a disease but it is satan's handiwork abstain from it that you may prosper"
