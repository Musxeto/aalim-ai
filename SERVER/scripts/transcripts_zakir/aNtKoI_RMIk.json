  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum sir my name is naeem i am a college student from bangladesh my question is is satan responsible for all human mistakes [Music] shall bear the burden of another soul so each and every human being he is responsible for his or her actions and we know the story of iblees wherein he was so righteous that he was raised to the levels of the angels and when allah subhanahu ta'ala commanded the angels to bow down to adam peace be upon him iblees refused and he said that i have been created from fire and adam has been created from clay so i am superior to adam peace be upon him so this was the moment where in satan he deviated and he asked for respite from allah subhana wa and this is mentioned in the glorious quran in surah araf chapter number 7 verse number 14 to 17 wherein he tells allah subhana wa ta'ala that give me respite till the day of judgment and i will misguide all the human beings i will come from their front from behind them from their right and from their left so allah subhana wa tala accepted this request of iblees of satan and he always wants to tempt and whisper into the hearts of human beings so we human beings we are responsible for our actions satan he is merely whispering into the hearts and into the minds of human beings satan he is not holding our hand he is not forcing us and telling us to do something wrong he is merely whispering but it is we who are doing the wrong deeds it is we who are responsible for our actions so satan is merely whispering and we human beings we are responsible for our actions that's the reason whenever we get any evil thought we should immediately recite a shaytan a regime i seek refuge in allah from satan the accursed"
