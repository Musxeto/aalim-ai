  "title": "How to Interpret the Religious Scriptures Correctly - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh good evening doctor uh my name is Chong nin I'm a student from iukl so I have two questions actually but I'll ask the second one if the organizer permits later so my first question is okay uh just now in your talk earlier you were talking about uh Brotherhood un Unity so it sounds like a potential solution for religious Harmony between uh the many major faiths in this world so so the big the biggest problem I I think about is like uh Christianity there are many different sex different religious uh I mean uh different sections different interpretations by prates and humans So based on this human factor that tends to misinterpret a religion derating from the main uh text the main content of a religion what is your solution or your response to this uh problem or to this biggest obstacle to Brotherhood Unity the brother ask a good question that we find in some religion I give the example of Christianity that people interpret the scripture differently therefore you have different sexs Etc and that's what brings diversity so what is the solution whether the solution is that you go back to the scripture and if the interpretation differs and by the different interpretation there a contradiction then you choose that interpretation which there's no contradiction for example you just heard the earlier brother when he asked that why can't a man from alab marry and everyone agrees that you can marry from woman from alab so I gave my reasoning that if I believe that you can marry any alab Mary Sheila so there will be contradiction in the Quran because one verse of the Quran says you cannot marry a mushika and people who worship Jesus Christ peace be upon him are doing sh that's what the Quran says so I come up with an answer in which there is is no contradiction so any logical person who hears both the anwers will agree with my answer more or any answer in which there's no contradiction same with the earlier person who said I believe Jesus a Son of God so if you believe Jesus peace be upon him a Son of God Adam a Son of God arra is Son of God Israel is Son of God do you give the same status as Jesus he says no so people say something but they don't mean it so when there the differ interpretation I say then why do you give so much respect to Jesus and not to the other prophets what they are saying actually begotten son and when they say begotten I say that word has been removed from the Bible so when you study when you do analytical study analogical study come to the truth as Jesus Christ peace be upon said in the Bible seeking the truth and truth shall Fe you Gospel of John so when you're doing research you easily come to know which is the correct one but if you follow blindly the church or a particular scholar blindly without checking right or wrong then you come into a problem so that's the reason when you read a commentary of any Scripture what you have to see how logical it is and how well it is connected and you have to take the scripture as a whole not only one verse out of context if you take one verse out of context and interpret it you have to take the scripture as a whole so when you take as a whole and that commentary which fulfills the requirement is the correct one so this has to be done with study brother and then you realize that which is the correct translation and interpretation of the scripture hope that answer the question"
