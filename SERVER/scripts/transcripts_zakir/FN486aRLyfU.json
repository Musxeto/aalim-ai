  "title": "Dr Zakirâ€™s Views on Erdogan converting Hagia Sophia from a Museum to a Mosque?",
  "transcript": "the first question is from hitab west bengal india is it permissible to convert a church or a temple into a mosque after that area is conquered by the muslims and a similar question of the same categories asked by munir from london uk what are your views regarding erdogan the president of turkey converting the hagia sofia from the status of a museum to that of a mosque there are two questions asked by the brothers the first question is that is it permissible in islam to convert a church or a temple or house of worship of a non-muslim to a mosque after that land is conquered by the muslims the reply to this is yes there are several hadith and there are several references that it is permissible to convert the house of worship of the non-muslims to a mosque if the muslim wants to after they conquer the land but regarding those places of worship where there is a contract with the non-muslims for example if a non-muslim has a contract with muslims and they have a treaty that accept you as our rulers or if the non-muslim they surrender and they agree to be under the rulership of the muslims then these non-muslims are called as me so as far as non-muslims who are the me who are protected by the muslim rulers in this there's a special condition and a treaty that their lives will be protected by the muslim ruler the house will be protected their place of worship be protected so in such a case where there's a contract between the muslim ruler or they have surrendered to the muslim ruler or they have invited them to take over from the ruler which is unjust and if there is a contract and there is no war in these cases they are called as me and the non-muslim they have to pay a jazzy after protection under this condition the muslims are supposed to protect the lives of the non-muslims their homes as well as their house of worship but they cannot build new house of worship which belong to non-muslims they cannot expand it but they can keep it and here the muslims will not touch the house of worship of the non-muslims but if the muslims conquer the land in this case it is perfectly permissible for the muslims to convert it into a mosque as far as the second question is concerned that what are my views regarding the issue that has taken place today and we know that the court has given the verdict and arizona the president of turkey has said that the hegel sofia which was a museum would be reverted back to a mosque let me first give you a brief regarding the history of hagia sophia so that people are unaware will know about it and then i will give my views as far as i thank you for sophia is concerned it's a monument which is there for about 1500 years it was built by emperor justly in one in 537 ce it took about few years for him to build and it was a cathedral of the greek orthodox and it remained a cathedral for several centuries in 1204 during the fourth crusaders they converted the greek orthodox cathedral into a roman catholic church until 1261. so initially for 667 years it was a greek orthodox cathedral then after that for 57 years from 1204 to 1261 for 57 years it was the roman catholic church again later on when the christian byzantines came to power it was again converted back into a greek authors cathedral until the ottoman rulers until sultan muhammad he conquered constantinople in 1453 then it was converted into a mosque so since 537 up to 1453 for more than 900 years it remained a greek authors cathedral then for a few years it was the roman catholic church then went back to become a greek orthodox cathedral and it was the largest church in the world where it was built the biggest in-house covering and the dome was the largest it remained larger for a thousand years until 1500 when a new church was made in 1453 sultan muhammad he conquers constantinople and then there are documents available that he purchases the hegel sofia and after purchasing it he converts it into a mosque it remains a mosque till 1931 until mustafa kamal took he takes over turkey and it declares it as a secular state for four years it was closed and he passes the verdict in 1934 that the mosque should be converted into a museum and since 1935 till today 2020 july that's the 11th of july it remained a museum until today and all these years for about 85 years there were many cases saying that why is the sofia a museum declared it that this is a sign of secularism that we want to make it into a museum it will not be a church will not be a mosque and since that there were many cases that have been filed that it is wrong that it was converted into a museum and recently the council in turkey the highest administrative court it passed a resolution that it was illegal for mustafa kamal atar turk to convert into a museum and today mashaallah the court of turkey has given a verdict and i said that it was illegal for ataturk to convert it into a museum and alhamdulillah after the court verdict he signed a resolution that this structure hagia sophia which was earlier a church then became a mosque than a museum it will be transferred from the department of tourism and it will go to the department of religious authority of turkey now this has created a lot of controversy and today if you read the newspapers and the media they are disagreeing with the decision taken by turkey by the turkish government by erdogan and you find right from usa trump russia greece all of them condemning it is wrong unesco many non-muslim organizations and you find the media that they disagreed they have been threatened and said it is wrong but the saddest part what i read in the media that there were many muslim countries and many so-called muslim dies and muslim scholars from the western countries said what turkey did and what erdogan did is wrong and to support their claim they said that we know in history that allah be pleased with him he was asked to pray in jerusalem he did not pray he said if he prayed there people make a mosque and then he paid somewhere else and the masjid aqsa was made and all this is about how we encourage and have a relationship and they quoted the verse of the quran chapter 22 verse number 40 saying it is not permitted to destroy synagogues or the church and quran is against it and i was shocked to read the views of many of the muslim dies from the western countries and from the arab world saying it is wrong what are my views regarding what turkey did is correct or not or what other country is right or wrong as far as my views are concerned the hadith quoted and the incidents quoted by the muslims regarding hazard allah be pleased with him that he did not pray and he paid somewhere else and there were treaties between muslims and others that your lives are saved and your places of worship are saved and muslim will not enter your places of worship all these references are when there is the treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims as i mentioned in the first answer to the first question that can a holy place a church or a temple be converted to a mosque after it is conquered the answer is yes only if there is a treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims or if the non-muslims surrender or they are demis non-muslim living under the law of the muslim rule islamic rule that is the only condition where the muslims give them security and they are paying a jaziah as far as when the utman rulers when they conquered constantinople it was a conquest it was a war so it is wrong to give examples of a treaty between the muslims and non-muslims and say that same way turkey should manage it's totally wrong so if there is a conquest if there is a war under the muslims rule and this is a common law all over the world we find so many non-muslim rulers when they conquer the land they occupy the mosque many of them demolish the mosque you have example of the crusaders the best example is spain there were hundreds of mosques and most of them were either converted to churches or they were made into museums or they were destroyed hardly you find there was not a muslim who could openly give the assad why don't people object to that so this was the normal law that once you conquer that becomes your land so once it becomes the land you have a right to do what you want to do later on after world war one world war ii then the geneva convention all that is later on so before that the rule was once you conquer a land it becomes part of your land and you can do what you feel is right so based on that this was the conquest done by and in the conquest they have a right to keep the house of worship to convert into a mosque it is right and you find several examples in fact if you read the hadith of the prophet muslim i'll give you one incidence which i don't want to give it but to reply to these muslims who are attacking turkey and attacking that if we read the seer of the prophet we know in the fear of the prophet when muhammad sallallahu migrated to madina and later on he came back to makkah during fateh makkah what did he do when he came back with about 10 000 sahabas and it was a victory the first thing he did was he went to kaaba which was the house of worship of the non-muslims there were 360 idols in kaaba he went in the kaaba and recited the verse of the quran from surah israel chapter number 17 verse number 81 which says when truth is falsehood falsehood perishes for falsehood is by its need to perish and he destroyed all the idols imagine today if the non-muslims object and say what they did is wrong will the muslims agree to them it was a house of worship of the non-muslims right or wrong yes but it was a conquest though it was a bloodless conquest it was the easy thing once they ruled the land they destroyed the idols and that is in islamic history so do you want to say what prophet muhammad is wrong and many may not be aware that makkah is also mentioned in the bible if you read the bible in the book of psalms chapter number 84 verse number 5-7 it says blessed are those people who traveled to the valley of bakka and the same bakka the word is also mentioned in the quran in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 96 which says the first place of worship the first house of worship of allah was bakka same word what the quran mentioned from is also mentioned in the christian bible imagine today the christians say that makkah belongs to the christian and the muslims should give it to them will the muslims believe will the muslims agree and says no imagine someone comes with a bright idea that let us convert the haram into a museum will the muslims believe will the muslims agree and the answer is no so what you have to realize at that time this was the law and at that time you see the theory of the prophet what did he do what happened today many of the muslims are being influenced by the western culture because they're staying in western countries they want to change the islamic history they want to give a ruling they quote verses from the quran and the verse of the quran that was quoted of surah chapter number 22 verse number 40 we say that quran says that house of worship should not be destroyed there is no verse in the quran saying that it is a misunderstanding if you want to know the real context start from verse number one before surah chapter number 24 verse number 39 says that you are permitted to fight against those non-muslims who have done wrong and allah will aid you and protect you this is the first verse of the quran giving permission for the muslims when they migrate from makkah to madina to fight against the non-muslims first first then verse number 40 of hajj chapter 22 says that and those who leave their homes because they say that our lord is one allah is one and it continues that if allah wouldn't have checked one force with the other then the churches and the synagogues and the mosque where the name of allah is taken would have been destroyed it doesn't say that it is not permitted to destroy it's telling that allah number it is giving permission for the muslims to fight against the non-muslims who have done wrong who have done transgression and then it says that those muslims who leave their home because they believe in tahit believe in one god allah is there to protect you and then it says if allah wouldn't have checked one group against the other then the places of worship like the synagogue like the church like the mosque that would have been destroyed giving indication doesn't say that you cannot destroy for knowing the real meaning go to the tafasid and if you read kurubi kurupi says very clearly that what i said in the reply to the first answer that if there is a treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims if the non-muslims become dimi under the rule of the muslim rulers if they agree that the muslims are the rulers or if they surrender and there's no conquest and if they are paying jazya if they are paying attacks for protection it becomes the duty of the muslims to protect the lives of the non-muslim the demi to protect their homes and protect the house of worship but again kurumi says you cannot build a new house of worship for the non-muslim because it is sin but what is there it can remain they cannot expand it also so if there is a treaty or if the non-muslims are surrendered in this case yes you cannot occupy it you protect the house of worship but cannot build a new one cannot expand it but in conquest if there is a war and if the conqueror is there then it is the right of the muslim ruler to do what he wants because that becomes part of his land so please don't quote some hadees which is out of context and there are several hadith of the beloved party muslim where he stole the sabbath that go and destroy the idols several he has told khalid bin walid malala be pleased with him go and destroy the idols there are several he has allah be pleased with him go and destroy the idols there are several several hadith in bukhari in muslim himself destroyed the idols in makkah so please i would like to request the muslims that by giving answers a general comment muslim who may not be aware of the context will agree with the views given by such scholars which is totally wrong is there any scholar islamic scholar who can deny that the prophet broke the idols is there an islamic scholar who can deny that the prophet told him allah will be with them the fourth caliph of islam khalid bin wales be prisoners and many of the sabbath then go and deface the idols there is one more hadith in bukhari and muslim it's mentioned in say bihari hadith number 3020 as well as a muslim hadith number 2476 where jared abdullah may allah be pleased with him one of the sabbaths he says that the prophet peace be upon him he called me and he told me that will you relieve for me the dul khalsa what is guruharsa tulkhasa was the place of worship of the non-muslims in yemen it was also called the kaabatul yaminya kaabatul yaminya means the kaaba of the yemen and in it there were idols he said will you do a favor for me will you destroy it for me then jared may abdullah may allah be pleased with him he takes with him 150 horsemen and he burns down that house of worship it's a hadith in bukhari and muslim i don't want to tell this but it is there that means the prophet commanded not only to destroy the idols he even asked them to destroy the place of worship so when the muslims are conquering and when they rule that land it is permitted even to destroy the place of worship now this if you say quran says you should not destroy churches and synagogues do you think the prophet went against the quran the context is wrong that is when there is the treaty between the muslims and the non-muslims when they are dimi when they are under the rule of the muslim but generally it is affirmed to destroy the idols if the muslim conquers the land and if there are ideas it becomes the father and you have several examples of saba doing that it is umpteen number of hadees are there so to try and misguide telling that it is not permissible is totally wrong but destroying the temples or the house of worship is not a firm but if required if it's causing a problem for the muslim ummah the prophet has commanded that so how can you say it's not permitted so what i would like to say that many a times muslims living in the western country or even some of the muslims in the arab land you know trying to be soft to the non-muslims and trying that they are the one who will support them they are the one who are going to fund them etc they are going to protect them many a time they give verdict which is against the quran and the sunnah be careful if you are going to go against our muslim brother erdogan the president of turkey or against a muslim country there are hardly few people today muslim leaders who can really try and revive the sunnah and as i said in my earlier answer that i don't know of any muslim leader which is anywhere close to muhammad sallallahu sallam or any claims to the whole farashadin the way they ruled or how they were political leaders nowhere close not even one person now if one muslim brother is doing something which is there which is permitted why are the muslims against him so as far as my view is concerned alhamdulillah what turkey did is completely correct and if you agree that muhammad sultan he purchased the mosque today we know there are hundreds and thousands of churches in different parts of the world in the western countries in uk in europe and america which have been purchased by the muslim organizations if you say that after you purchase you can't make it into the mosque that means the muslim living in the western country will have to give up all these mosques to the church if few centuries back emperor sultan muhammad purchases buys with his own money and that was one of the reasons so here we're not talking about conquest it is purchased we are not talking about war it's permitted after war you can convert it here he purchased it there are documents so the court in turkey said seeing at the documents if there was a case filed that what right does kamala tatur have to convert into a museum the highest authority in turkey it's a legal verdict said what is done by that is wrong now what is bothering usa or russia or greece how can the object how can they interfere in the personal affairs of turkey a muslim country and why are the other muslims supporting the non-muslims it is totally wrong as far as i am concerned whatever turkey did is correct it is permitted in islam it is muslim alhamdulillah it was a mosque for several years it was purchased if i don't support them now i'll have to tell all the thousands of mosque in the european country and in usa and in canada which have been purchased from the church authorities even they have to give them up so please allah clearly says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number four verse number 135 that yeah you allah or you believe stand out for justice as truth to allah even if it be against yourself against your parents against relative whether rich or poor allah protects both so please if a muslim has the guts to do something which is close to quran sunnah it's the duty as muslims that we should support him and we should encourage him hope that answers the question"
