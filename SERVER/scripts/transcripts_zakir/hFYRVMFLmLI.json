  "title": "Can we Read the Quran Despite our Incapability of Understanding its Covert Meaning? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the instruction manual is still most of the sex most of the leaders they say if I don't read it with understanding the meaning May differ you may not be able to read between the lines this is what is Zahir the battle meaning is not for you okay so I want your reply in brief what can be the reason why they are stopping people to read with meaning let me ask them a good question and they say they want my replant brief that many of the religious leaders especially the Muslims of different groups of different organization of different sects they say you should not read the Quran with understanding there's a hidden meaning and there is meaning which is just on the face of it you do not know the heading mean therefore you should not read and the reply of this in brief of giving a talk Al-Quran should it builds the understanding with the question answers which is approximately three hours because I've been for three and a half hours but to make it three hours we cut some of the questions to make it compact to make it in three hours that will be in brief I'll try to give a highlight of the brief or the brief of the brief that Allah says in the Quran in knowledge in four different places in the same Surah in Surah chapter number 54 verse number 17 verse number 22 verse number 32 40 Allah says that we have made the Quran easy for you to understand then which of you shall not receive admonition we have made the Quran easy for you to memorize so when Allah says we have made the Quran easy for you to understand who will not receive admonition so do you have to believe these so-called alims or so-called leaders or so-called great people Allah the Creator the author of the Quran says to understand why don't you receive guidance from it that some of the verses of the Quran have got established meanings some have got meaning which are difficult to understand but if you analyze that most of the verse of the Quran they're simple for example now what community do you require do you require commentary on this say the Allah is one and only one and a half that's all different but will the meaning change you know knowing the background is good you can know the background but by knowing the background the meaning will not change you may come to know when it was revealed why it was revealed that's all additional information but the basic message will not change so most of the verses of the Quran they have got established meaning there are certain books of the Quran which have got unestablished meaning now these verses of the Quran which have got unestablished meaning they meaning in detail is given somewhere else in the Quran or in the say Hadith the certain verses of the Quran which may require more explanation you have to go for cross-reference the best reference of the Quran is the Quran itself if you go to other words you get the detail answer or you may have to go to say Hadith if you don't know or if you have doubt ask a person knowledgeable so when you have certain things which are doubtful in the Quran then you may go and ask an expert but things like an expert while leading the tasty of the Quran if you come across certain things which you may feel I've got multiple meanings then you can go to a specialist and this is a small percentage but there are people who various arguments that why you should not read the Quran with understanding and they give argument I'll just give a couple of the things I quoted in my talk the rest you can see maybe talk I said there are people who give the example if you have a kacha license a tempeh license and if you have an accident the police will give you less punishment if you have permanent license if your pakka license and then if you Bank have an accident the police will give you double punishment therefore if you read the Quran and then if you sin then gone Allah you big punishment don't read the Quran then if you do sin then less punishment very good logic and I have argument of agreeing the way I debate is like the thing in martial arts which always tell that if opponent is very beefy tries to punch you at yourself use this power to throw him over whether it be Judo whether it be Aikido we use his power to throw him over so you go inhale Direction in the same direction if he comes to punja side step and throw him over so this is using his Force agreeing for example someone says two plate is equal to five okay fine take two rupees take two rupees give me five rupees take two thousand take two thousand give me five thousand take two light take two like give me five lakh so what I say if I agree with you for sake of argument that if you have a license then pay license and if you bang up a car then maybe the police will find you one thousand rupees a permanent license and if you bang up that other police will find two thousand rupees but I tell the chances in a span of five years that if your pakka license will bang up the highest months so at the end of five ways you pay two thousand rupees but if you ever catch your life you don't know that the car you don't know and if the temperature keep on driving the chance will bang up the car is 50 times so under five years you end up paying fifty thousand fine so is it preferable fifty thousand five or two thousand fine so you have to sometimes agree with them and prove them logically they're wrong and various examples and I've given one more incidence that first time an automobiles came in India no one knew how to drive so the company along with the car they've been supplied the driver of Hyderabad he buys the car so along with the car the company gave him a driver so one day in the morning he tells the driver that today morning I would take my wife become cyber for shopping keep the car ready so he says the car is out of order he said I want the car in order immediately so driver tells him to put the car back in working condition I require 10 kgs of honey 30 liters of milk 20 kg of ghee pierogi Asal ghee and 40 kgs of rice gives him 10 kg of honey 20 kg of ghee 30 liters of milk and 40 kgs of pure basmati rice he takes it and gives it to his wife and within a few minutes a car is in working condition I am asking a question today for driver if he tells you requires 10 kg of honey what will you do what will you do you kick him out of the job you may not be a mechanic you may not be a mechanic may not know how to repair a car but you have the basic knowledge the car runs on petrol on diesel on gas it doesn't run on ghee basmati rice so even though you're not a mechanic you have the basic knowledge of a car you may not know how to drive so similarly you may not be a scholar of the Quran but if every Muslim has the basic knowledge of the Quran no alarm will take you for a ride all these so-called leaders they will not take you for a ride so at least have the basic knowledge of the Quran so if you have the basic knowledge read the Quran with understanding Allah says that the Quran has been sent to you it is easy for you to understand so why aren't we reading you read in the language you understand the best and for more details report to my video I said all Quran through the brilliant understanding of the answers the question"
