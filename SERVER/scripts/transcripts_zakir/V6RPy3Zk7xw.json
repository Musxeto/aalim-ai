  "transcript": "before we discuss the concept of God in Christianity Christianity claims to be the largest followed religion in the world there are 2.38 billion Christians who claim to be Christians in the world but most of them do not believe in the teachings of Bible so in sensus form they are the largest but in following they are very less following the scriptures very less but senses you know instead of saying I don't belong to religion they say Christian men in the Western World so in this way there are 2.38 billion about 30 to 31% of the world population who claim to be Christian practicing would be a small percentage less than half whether 20 30 we don't know before we discuss the concept of in Christianity I would like to make some points clear that Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of almighty God we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christians today do not believe we believe that he healed those born blind and lepers with God's permission we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission the Christians and Muslims we are going together one may ask then where is The Parting of way The Parting of way is that most of the Christians they believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him claim Divinity many of the Christians think that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was God in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement from anywhere in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God always way he say worship me if any Christian can quote to me from anywhere in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or where he says worship me I Dr Zak Nik I'm ready to except chanity today I am not speaking on behalf of my other Muslim brothers and sisters I'm a stud of comparative religion I'm ready to put my head on the guillotine I repeat I challenge any Christian to point out a single unequivocal statement a single unambiguous statement where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God always says worship me I'm ready to accept Krishan now in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him said it's me the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number five verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God he's a Muslim Jesus Christ peace be upon him was a Muslim he was one of the mightiest messengers of God after I take his name I have to add peace be upon himam I have to show respect we Muslims we respect Jesus Christ peace be upon him more than the Christians we follow him more than the Christians Jesus Christ peace be upon him never claim Divinity in fact he said it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17 to 20 think not that I have come to destroy the law of the prophets I have not come to destroy but to fulfill not one jot or tit shall pass away from the law until all be fulfilled and anyone who teaches you to break one of the least of The Commandments he'll be called least in the kingdom of heaven and whoever teaches to keep the Commandments he'll be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees in no way shall you enter eternal life in no way shall you enter Paradise this is the ver btim quotation from King James version Gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 7 to 20 that means if you want to enter Paradise you have to be better than the scribes than the Pharisees you have to be better than the Jews you have to follow the all the Commandments What Moses said God is one he has got no images and worship him alone it is further mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 24 the words that you hear are not mine but my fathers who has sent me so Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says in the Gospel of John chapter number 14: 24 the words that you here are not mine but my fathers who has sent me it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number three Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says this is life eternal so that you may know there is only one God and Jesus Christ whom DA has sent it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 19 verse number 16 and 17 one of the person comes to Jesus Christ peace be upon him and tells him good Master what good things shall I do so that I shall attain eternal life life and Jesus Christ peace be upon Him replies why thou callest me good there is only one good and that is almighty God and if you want to enter eternal life if you want to go to paradise you keep the Commandments Jesus Christ peace be upon him did not say that if you want to go to paradise if you want to go to heaven you believe I'm God he never said that you believe that I died for your sins on the cross no where does they say this he said keep the Commandments and the Commandments are the same believing in one God and worshiping him alone who has got no images it's mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 here Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him amongst you and you are witness to it a man approved of God Jesus Christ peace be upon him a man approved of God amongst You by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in your midst very clearly it says in the Bible he was a man a messenger of almighty God he never claimed Divinity and when he was asked that which is the first of the Commandment he replies in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 Israel the Lord our God is one Lord so if you read the Bible you should understand the correct concept of God in Christianity If You observe the Christians you may not get the correct concept of God in Christianity you'll get misguided to understand the concept of God in Christianity you have to read the Bible and I'm quoting from the Bible from my memory from my god-given computer and I say if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Christ we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves because we love Jesus more than the Christians after every time we take his name we say peace be upon him if you read the Bible the Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number 8 and Book of Leviticus chapter number 17 verse number 14 not to have poke but the Christians have poke we Muslims don't have poke so we are following more of the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him that the reason I say we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves the Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter number 5 verse number 18 do not be drunk with wine it's mentioned in the Book of Proverbs Chapter number 20 verse number one do not drink wine Quran says in Sur ma 5 verse number 190 don't have alcohol we Muslims are more Christian and the Christians because we are following the teachings of Jesus Christ more than the Christians according to the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him was circumcised on the E day all the Muslims are circumcised but most of the Christians are not circumcised that's the reason I say if Christian means following the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him then we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves"
