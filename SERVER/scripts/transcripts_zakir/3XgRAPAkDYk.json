  "transcript": "the next question from tanweed Alam from New York USA should the fasting of three days a month to be done on Aya mulbid 13 14th and 15th or any three days of the month the question posed by tanwin Alam from New York USA is that the three days that I have to fast every month should it be done only on the yam will be the 13th 14th and 15th of the month or it can be done any three days of the month what is the meaning of Aya mulbid ayam is the plural of Yom Dev means white so ayamul bid means the white days these days refer to the days when the moon is at the brightest when it is a full moon so in the lunar calendar the 13th 14th and 15th the day of the lunar calendar when the moon is the brightest then the Moon is a full moon it is called as Aya mulbid the white days or the days when the night is the brightest or the Moon is the brightest so I am will beat the days are 13th 14th and 15th of the lunar calendar recommended that the Muslims should fasten three days then Hadith mentioned in say bukhari and say Muslim remote said that my close friend referred to Prophet Muslim has asked me to do three things every day till the end of my life and I keep on doing it till the end of my life and those are fasting three days every month So based on this we come to know the prophet Muslim recommended that you should fast three days every month there are other Hadith mentioned in say Muslim that when one lady companion asks with her that did the prophet fast three days every month she said yes which of the day did he fast she said it did not matter which day it was there is that sometimes the prophet fasted in the beginning of the month sometime in the middle of the month sometime towards the end of the month Hadith which is mentioned in that the prophet said that anyone who fasts three days every month of his life it is as though he has fasted for his full lifetime and the 13th 14th and 15th of the month he said that the prophet told him that if we have to fast any day than a month fast on the 13th 14th and 15th of the month based on this we come to know that the prophet recommended that a Muslim should fast three days every month and the best it is mustab that you fast on the ayam will Beed the 13th 14th and 15th so the best the most recommended is that fast three days every month and fast on the 13th 14th and 15th but if you cannot fast on the 13th 14th or 15th maybe because the ladies may be having the menstrual cycle or a person may be traveling or he may be having a guest if we fast any other days also it is acceptable because there are other Hadith we say that you can fast on any of the three days so the better adoption is fast on the three days but for any reason you cannot fast on these three days the 13th 14th the 15th if you fast any other days no problem whether you fast conjectively all three together or you fast with a break both accepted as long as the first three days but the upswell the best is on imlp and what did the prophet mean when he said if you fast three days in a month as though you have fasted for a full lifetime because a prophet says that every good deed is multiplied by 10. so if you fast three days in a month actually fasting 30 days in a month that's the full month and if you fast three days every month of your life it is as though you are fasted for the full lifetime so this is the multiplication of the factor by 10 that's what it meant so if you fast three days in the yamul bid that is the best regarding ayamul bid because most of us follow the solar calendar we are not aware of the lunar calendar and the lunar calendar is followed in few countries among the Muslim countries mainly the gulf countries so there you follow the calendar no problem but the question can be asked that do we have to see the moon normally people are more particular about seeing the moon themselves with the eyes during Ramadan and during Hajj people are more particular but even the calendar that you have normally that the Muslim countries follow it is scientifically and quite accurate but because it's a Sharia requirement for these two occasions for Ramadan starting off Ramadan ending of Ramadan and for the starting of Hajj that you should see it with your eyes it's a Sharia requirement otherwise even following fayam will be the normal calendar that you have ayam will be this not the same throughout the world depending upon the moon so it may vary by one day or two different parts of the world like today it's already 13th of the lunar month in the Gulf countries but in Malaysia it is not Malaysia at its 12th so I'll be fasting from tomorrow inshallah but those who are staying in the Gulf countries and those today is the 13th for people living in Malaysia other parts of the world it is tomorrow sometimes it may even differ by two days so it is preferable to fast on the 13th 14th 15th if there's a difficulty even any other days would do hope to answer the question"
