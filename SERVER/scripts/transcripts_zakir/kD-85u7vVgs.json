  "transcript": "just some a little question or it could be just a clarification regarding the historical significance from the Quran regarding the pre- dawn meal before the Quran stipulated exactly how it should be taken how did the sahabah the companions of the Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam start and begin the fast before the Quran gave the exact details of the timings of s Etc the sahab that I'm the prophet before the quranic verse of Surah Bak 2 verse number 87 was revealed they used to follow what was practiced earlier by the by the people of the book and that you get from various records from the Hadith Etc and at that time they were supposed to have the ifar immediately after Sunset and once they went to sleep they could not have any meal then they had to fast the complete next day and they could only have the meal next day after sunset so this was a practice that was follow earlier and there's a Hadith which is mentioned in say bukari book of fasting Hadith number 1915 where it mentions about a sahaba by the name of alari and he comes one day to the house at the time ofar after doing a lot of hard work and he tells his wife that I'm hungry please can I have some food forar so the wife says there's no food in the house I will go and get from outside so when she goes out to get food because this sah pleased with him he was very tired so before the wife comes back he goes to sleep sleep or takes him so by the time the wife comes back and she sees the husband sleeping she says oh what a disappointment now he can't have the meal so when he gets up next day he could not have the food and he had to fast the whole next day and by the time evening comes he faints so they took the matter to the prophet and told him what had happened and after that the verse of the Quran Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 187 was revealed that you can approach your wife and eat and drink until the white thread of dawn is differentiated from the black thread so then were the rules laid down that means you could eat the full night and then the veres again fast till the night falls Mally sunset so before this ver was reveal the action of the fast fall different they could have only one meal immediately after Sunset and once they sleep they could not have again until this ver of Sur Bak chapter 2 was7 was revealed and that's what we follow today"
