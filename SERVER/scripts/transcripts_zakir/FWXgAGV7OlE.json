  "transcript": "Allah gives the solution for happiness and the best is if you read the book 70 major sin hadith of the prophet that there are seven major sins Abbas says may Allah be pleased with him 70 is more closer to seven 70 major sin and this are the major dos and don'ts Allah says in the Quran you stay away from major sins Allah will forgive your minor sins I'll just point out a few of the major dos and don'ts Time is limited. Number one is number one is dos and don'ts in the kabay dos and don'ts are mixed means if you do shik it is the biggest sin. So number one do is believing in Allah and the biggest sin is shik associating partners with Allah subhana wa tala. So in chapter 4 verse 48. So in Isisa chapter 4 116. Allah may forgive any sin if he pleases. But the sin of he'll never forgive the number to do it is salah your prayers. And our beloved prophet said the difference between im and kuf is salah. The person the thing that differentiates a m and a kafir a muslim and a non-Muslim is salah. Number three is zakat. Every rich person who has a saving of more than the nisab level of 85 grams of gold should give 2.5% in charity every lunar year. Number four is fasting in the month of Ramadan. Abstaining from food, drink and sex from dawn up to sunset in the month of Ramadan. Hajj if you have the means perform Hajj. Next is obeying and respecting your parents. Surra 17:23 says that if one or both of your parents reach old age don't say off to them amongst the thing which is haram first again shik if you do dawa if you don't remove the shake from the mind of a non-Muslim your dawa is useless number two today the biggest killer of happiness you have wars all over the world you have America Afghanistan killing hundreds of thousands of people, attacking Iraq, weapons of mass destruction, fabrication, killing millions. What is Israel doing in Gaza? More than 45,000 people killed. Most of them are children and women. That's also recorded. Not recorded, multiple times more. More than 100,000 seriously injured. What's happening in Roindia? What's happening in Bangladesh? Shina killed thousands of Muslims. What's happening in India? Muslims are being lynched. What's happening in China? One solution. Allah says in surah Maida chapter 5 verse number 32, if anyone kills any other human being, unless it be for murder or corruption, it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity. And if anyone saves an human being, he saved the whole of humanity. If any Muslim or non-Muslim kills any other innocent Muslim or non-Muslim, it is as though you have killed the whole of humanity. If this worse every human being follows, terrorism will be eradicated from this world. And if you save a human being, you are saving the whole of humanity. Number three, black magic. Number four, zena, adultery, fornication. Allah says in surah chapter number 17 verse number 32, come not close to adultery or fornication because it's an evil opening other roads to evil. Next is ribba. In the major sin, fornication is number 10 in Imm Abdhabi's book of Kabar. Number 12 is ribba. Allah says in surah bakar chapter 2 verse number 278 and 279, if you give up not your demands of interest of ribba, take notice of a war from Allah and hisul. If you have alcohol, Allah doesn't wage a war against you. If you take ribba, give or take ribba, Allah will wage a war against you. Do you have the guts or the capacity to fight Allah and his and Allah says alcohol is prohibited in 5 verse number 90 oh you believe oh you believe most certainly toxic innoc and gambling dedication of stone divination of arrows these are Satan's handiwork abstain from it that you may prosper this was in brief about dos and don'ts the solution for happiness. I would like to end my speech with the same verse of the Quran. I started surah alsar chapter number 103 verse number 123 which says Man is very in a state of floss except those who have faith, those who have righteous deed, those who exalt people to truth and those who exalt people to patience and pursuits."
