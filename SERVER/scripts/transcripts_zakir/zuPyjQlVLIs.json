  "transcript": "the first question posed by Brother Ibrahim was political and social stability Dr Zakir n how should Muslims in Bangladesh navigate the political instability and ensure they adhere to Islamic principles in the process what advice do you have for Muslims in Bangladesh facing social and political unrest as far as political and social stability is concerned the best is to follow the guidelines of the Glorious Quran and authentic Hadith there is no better book than the Quran than the authentic Hadi in terms of politics in terms of stability social and political stability the best book on politics is the Glorious Quran and the Hadith and the best people that ruled a state was the time of prophet Muhammad Salli wasallam at the at the time of the khif abak Omar Ali so if you ask me what is the best for Bangladesh is to follow Quran and Sunnah the way the prophet and the kashid ruled the state at that time that is the best example there nothing better than that and it describ in detail in the Quran and the but natural you cannot implement it overnight so my advice to you would be as far as political and social stability is concerned that today see in the world I cannot point out a single Muslim country which is following Sharia as a whole but there are certain aspects in which certain things are more adhered to Quran and Sunnah as compared to other things so look around the Muslim country that you have and see how well they are ruling the country since Bangladesh and Pakistan separated from India on the basis of religion on the basis of Islam it is mandatory that the country should make Quran as the Constitution Pakistan separated of course the ni may be good but today when we look at it and we realize Pakistan is the only country in the world that we know besides Israel that are split in the name of religion of course Bangladesh was earlier called as isak pistan and this was West Pakistan so I feel that Bangladesh they split on the basis of religion they should make Quran the Constitution unfortunately after the father of the previous prime minister she was a dictator she fled after the protest started ha muj rman he was not Islamic he was more of a secular person and he made the country a secular so initially East Pakistan was part of Pakistan then they fought again for the freedom for what they already got the freedom from India they made a new country in the name of Islam so you cannot make a country in the name of Islam and then make it a secular country it is absurd so number one Bangladesh should not be made as a secular country it should be made an Islamic country and they should follow the constitution of the Quran and the and they should have the social and the political system as for the Quran in if you do that inshah you'll be successful now comeing to the point that as I told there is no country in the world today that is following Sharia 100% but that doesn't mean it will not happen Allah subhana wa tala promises in the Quran in no less than three different places in Surah 9 vers number 33 in Surah fat 48:28 and Surah saf vers number n Allah says that Allah sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of Truth so that it will prevail over all the other religions over all the other ISS how much the mus don't like it in two places Allah says that how much the mus don't like it th worshippers don't like it and one place Allah says and enough is Allah the witness so Allah is promising in the last and final Revelation the Quran that this Dean will prevail over all the other religions over all the other isms whether it be christianism Hinduism Buddhism Judaism socialism atheism communism Islam is destined to supersede all overcome them all wi how don't like it so this de is going to Prevail and there are very say had talking about it that before the end of the world the Muslim will rule the world ask for the Quran and say had for S years so whether Bangladesh follows the Quran or not a time will come that the full world will be ruled by Quran and so my advice to you is that if you want to politically solve the problem of Bangladesh see to it you follow the Quran and the sayth don't follow what was done by muj made a secular country you fought for your religion for your dean and now you're betraying your own Dean so number one is Rule it according to the Quran and Sunnah and inshallah there'll be social stability and political stability"
