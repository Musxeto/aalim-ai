  "transcript": "a lot of people are concerned about this I know I am myself how do we know what are the indications and how do we know whether repentance is accepted what are the indications the indication as far as for a repentance to be acceptable Allah number one is that you do not commit the same sin again and your good deeds keep on increasing and a bad Deeds keep on decreasing this is number one sign that Allah has accepted the repentance number two that you have the fear of Allah number three is that you regret to Allah and you keep on asking his forgiveness number four is that you're humble and you always address him in humility so these are the four signs which show that your repentance has been accepted Allah the signs of non-acceptance of the tawba repentance is deficiency in the person's repentance and he remembers the pleasures of the sins and he gets preoccupied and continuing the sin that's number one number two he for sure that his friends will be accepted as though he has got immunity and he's immune to it I'm sure he'll be forgiven that's number two number three is that his eyes don't cry and his heart is hardened number four there's no increase in the good activities that he's doing no increase in the Good Deeds and a beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in say Muslim volume number four in the book of repentance Hadith number 6621 that if the people do not commit any sins Allah will wipe them out and replace with the people who commit sin and who ask for forgiveness so that Allah can forgive them now here if you understand this Hadith it will look very odd that does allowed us to do sin if you don't do sun Allah will remove you what it means that there are some people who may do sin and who may ask for forgiveness and repent and may come true that Allah and the good deed will increase and this on the other hand some people do good deed and they have a conceit they're so proud of themselves and that will take them to the Hellfire so Allah says that if there's a group of people who don't do sin Allah will replace them with the people who do sin so that they will ask for forgiveness and Allah will forgive them that means you should have humility so these are the signs for not acceptance of ethoba may Allah continue to accept repentance"
