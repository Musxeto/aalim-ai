people of Bangladesh love you a lot please visit us soon inshallah similar question asked by our bow gave me true Autopia how to starch the link comparative religion please advise similar question asked by new Nabil Ahmed India masha'Allah same question from across the world from India you are from Manila area from Ethiopia and again from India new Nabil Emeth from India I am a medical experiment from childhood I wanted to be a doctor but after seeing your lectures and debates my dream has been changed I heard that after watching shake a medidas lecture you chose to become a preacher and alhamdulillah he has inspired you you inspire me now my dream has changed I want to be like you and want to spread this lovely message to all the Manatee but I know this work is not easy so what advice you want to give me and many Muslim you too have a dream like me similar question asked by saying Abdullah Hyderabad India what should I do to be a student I have only picked up five similar questions believe me such questions I earn hundreds if I read only will take us so I have just clubbed all the questions so that I'll try and answer all together they're similar question the basic question asked by these five people are is that they want to be my student number one they want to be a dye number two they want to study comparative religion as far as being a student of mine personally on a personal level I don't have any student yes I have taken our training programs in the past and there are deep students of mine but on a personal level because of my busy schedule because I'm actively involved in Dawa etcetera like there are many of the scholars and dyes they have got halakha etc I don't have one-to-one regular meeting I mainly have on the social media on the satellite channel where a hundred millions are watching as far as training personnel is concerned I have done only for the our training program on a big level one day half a day many but for a few days put together I have been to training programs for the students in India one was the first fit of the our training programme which I did in the mid 90s and the late 90s and I'm in the second phase of the our training programme both this training programme had about 20 students then in 1999 I did the first international Nava training program where we selected 20 students from different parts of the world from different parts of the world and we had thousands of applications those we felt deserved more we selected 20 and after 1999 after 16 and a half years we had in November 1999 again in January February 2016 after about 16 and a half year I had the second international our training program and the purpose of the second international the out-earning program was and was for a longer duration it was updated it was for about 45 days the actual working day for 33 it was five days a week two days holidays in between with a lot of homework so total cost was for about 45 days and it was updated and one of the reason was that when we did the second international now or any program in Bombay we've got people after receiving thousands of application we call people you know we had from Malaysia itself maximum we had six people true from Singapore one from Japan one from Holland one from the UK and from different parts of the world from India we are from China and this training program I recorded in a very high format we recorded it with 14 cameras of four came 8k cameras so that once we recorded once we edited it would be for the next 50 60 years so the main purpose of this was besides training this this 20 people which was the smaller aim the bigger aim was having it recorded updating my notes so that we can make it public unfortunately this this tau training program took place in January and February and ended in the end of February and the other thing sessions continued even later after that within a couple of months I had to leave India and then you know there was allegation against me in July 2016 and the organization was banned in neverhood 2016 because of that if you could not have the program edited could not have it uploaded but hamdulillah as I mentioned earlier that in the beginning of Ramadan we had the complete new website of mind by the address zakir naik calm and it is yet and the process of more material is being added on it but there's a complete new section to it which is called as international our training program IDT p and this international doubt any program was supposed to be launched in the mid rom man but because i started having these sessions life sessions I could not give time to it but inshallah in the next four to eight weeks inshallah whether towards the end of this month June or before the end of July inshallah inshallah the internationals our training program will be launched on our website it's a different it's a different website altogether it will be part of my main website and in this international dawah training program all the notes of the dowa training program on Islam on comparative religion will be uploaded it's thousands of pages these notes the Dower training program is more of a technique based rather than knowledge-based most of the training programs give knowledge but don't give technique this training program is more of technique based even though it's not knowledge but it it has about a thousand pages and if you do online inshallah it may not have the same effect as doing the training program directly with me but yet inshallah if you do it online it will have approximately 15 percent of impact of doing the course with me directly the videos are not edited Allah knows best when will be edited but as soon as time permits or when we have the facility it may take two years three years four years I don't know we will have even the video is uploaded when the video is uploaded and the notes according to me it will be approximately thirty percent effective as effective as doing the post directly but the reason I had the notes prepared and uploaded and the video is also inshallah will be done because for a trainer to have this material and then have a training session of having twenty Muslim students following the notes following the video and just being a supervisor then insha'Allah it will have 50 percent impact if all the same notes are given and if the videos are shown and there is a supervisor to supervise you know amongst the students who did mashallah in the first phase in the second phase mashallah I'm happy to tell you that in in the in the first phase mashallah there were at least few people who who were qualified to become trainers and and maybe about 50 percent are doing Dawa and yet continue mashallah in the second phase mashallah the the number of people reacted that way is much more than the first phase and Masha more people are thinking of qualified to be trainers than in the first phase the second phase was more effective it had more information and inshallah one is the video is prepared if we have a supervisor amongst menu any of one of my students and if the notes forgiven and if the video is played I need to provide with the homework the way it is inshallah it will have 50% impact because if a person just attending my program conducts on his own according to me the impact was 10 percent if he had the notes impact or something bus in that city because he may not be able to explain the same way as me he may not be able to add the point he may not be able to demonstrate the techniques so then I thought that having the notes having the video and having a trainer would be the best so inshallah very soon in the next maybe four to eight weeks our international outer any program will be uploaded on my website so to become a student would be very difficult would be and when I did the training about four years back I told that this may be the last training program I am doing unless Allah wills it to be because of the busy schedule because in the training that time though the training is for 45 days I spend about your 60 days now 60 they stopping calm activities and at that time I slept sometimes one are sometime 45 minutes my average sleeping I told you is 3 and 1/2 hours now in Bombay it was 3 as but in the training session it was about one and half hour you know at times I spent 10 12 13 14 as on the stage starting morning 8 o'clock ending night early morning 2 o'clock next day you know because of doing personal training etc it has a lot of impact it has a lot of effort that goes in in this two-month work of at least three months is done so stop all there the activity that there isn't I don't think so I'll be having any tone training program like that in future in my life but inshallah when the website is ready when the video ad in when the website inshallah even having 15% the impact is a great deal I was inspired by shimonita and Shake amethy that mashallah I've taken many training programs and he conducted even tumult reining program one one training program one day program and then in the 90s when he met me he told me son who trained you did I train you and I had talked to do that out it's bad by shaking with me that I saw a video cassette but personally one-to-one training yes I spend time with him farewell as you know but cleaning in a session I said no because he knows who brand-new a lot radio he said anyone who has the passion and the zeal to become a knight allah will become a day and angry with him totally he said wasting time in training program is a waste of time I don't know agree with him completely but I do know that most of the training program done most of the people are not that effective but a hundred that is the reason we learnt the good thing from the training program and even the negative factor and when I made my training program I saw many of the other training programs then I changed it and from the Lilla all our training programs were effective but it is time-consuming it is difficult so the best thing what she does rightly said it is Allah subhanAllah who makes your day and then this training program our main focuses there three points in the training program and I'm telling you so that you pick it up number one if if Allah helps you none can overcome you Allah says in the Quran in surah marij and chap number three was the 160 that if Allah helps you none can welcome you if Allah forsakes you who is there then you can help you so let the believers put their trust in Allah so number one it having faith in Allah Allah should help you number two Allah says in surah anka booth chapter number 29 was the mass exterior i've do jihad in the way of allah subhanaw taala j as feasible in allah allah will open up his pathways for you you have to type you have to struggle if you struggle allah has to open a path up your pathways if you struggle and allah does not open up your pathway don't blame allah blame yourselves you are struggling wasn't enough so here in this training program we hammer in the student that have faith in Allah only Allah is the one who can make you an effective die no one else number two we show them how to strive we show them how can you work hard and get results in a short span I have students who have done the DM MBBS mm d DM highest and and he said that even in my team exam I did not strive so much as I learned in this our training program we show them about discipline and we show the results the homework we give them maybe a month in any one they cannot do but in the doubt any program they can finish in two days or one day alhamdulillah number three is technique Allah says in the Quran in surah in health chapter 16 verse 43 and so I am be a chapter number 21 was number 7 first I look holistically in unilateral if you don't know as the person who's knowledgeable so in this training program we touch on the third part the technique but we have a stress number one is Allah cell number two is driving third is technique and we show techniques of public speaking and asked today science tells us that the impact of a lecture that you give a person giving a public lecture the matter he speaks in the lecture carries only seven percentage of weight age 93 person is presentation skills how do you modulate your eye-to-eye contact in the gestures how do you structure a lecture the opening the conclusion all they think Irene 93 percent so in this training program we we give you the fishing line we will give you the fish fish is given little bit we give you the fishing line how to do research in preparing a lecture how to be effective how to quote when you quote it has a bigger impact than just saying you know Allah says in the Quran giving the reference Kang the bigger weight giving the reference of the scriptures then we tell you that all the verses of the Quran important but if you memorize these 25 verses there are D versus the more required for Dhamma then we give them another 25 verses of Quran then another 25 then F welcome by the time we complete the course he knows a couple of hundred verses by heart along with the translation then we tell the people it is preferable to know the answers of the more common questions asked than to know more number of answers of questions which are uncommon Lea's so we give them a set of questions the twenty most common question asked by non-muslims then we give another set of questions twenty most common questions asked by non-muslim which have some knowledge of Islam then we give them set of question ten common question as by Christian missionaries ten common questions as by Hindus about Islam and so on and so forth we give them ready-made answers of more than hundred questions these are and how our answer should be given and we tell them when you are giving an answer it should touch four categories it should touch from the Quran and hadith Islamic perspective it should touch comparative religion quotation from from the non-muslim maybe from the Bible from the way that number three giving answers with scientific knowledge and number four with reason and logic we have to touch all four you may never know what will convince the non-muslim so in this way we we tell them the technique we give them structured answer of the most common question which will work al hamdulillah with more than 90 percent 95 percent non-muslim then we tell them that surely there'll be some people who will count the question so how to handle cost recount the question is another technique so in this turn our training program we teach about the basics of Islam also it is not knowledge based but we tell them then we teach them the basics of Hinduism then the basics of Judaism and of Christianity the major world religions then about atheism and in this way we give them the key points and I'm telling this because this question is asked many times to me and amongst maybe a couple of hundred thousand question I have been asked to me a few hundred are only on this and how to do the how to become as I want to be a student so personally to become I would love to make everyone personally because when I teach I myself improve my my knowledge and my skills but believe me so much committed as it is mp3 Anna for the day it is difficult so my request to you is that joins in our to any program it is online absolutely free wait for the wait for the note to come you will can do it and believe me no one taught me Shady's has inspired me no one taught me public speaking it was just my passion of Dawa that I did it and a vanilla at least you have something now so see to it that you with it now also if you go to the website there I had common questions available and further there you can start from today don't wait till iddp starts yet there is enough information on my website presently which is on comparative religion so if you want a comparative religion then we give them the important verses of the Bible memorize you don't have to memorize the full Bible Bible is three times as voluminous as the Quran we give them memorize these 20 verses of the Bible you then later on another twenty verses another twenty maybe with a set of sixty same diversity of the Bible you can even debate with the Pope you don't have to memorize the full Bible then we give us of the way that's to talk to Hindu then we give verses how to how to convince atheist then we tell how to do them on the social media how do the on the stage is the different technique how to do dava offstage the different technique how to Dava one-to-one is the different technique how do thou on the print media the different technique how to do that one the social media the different technique every social media this pros and cons Facebook has the different advantages compared to the Instagram as compared to the YouTube as compared to the Twitter each has an advantage disadvantage I have done a full session one day only on social media but now in for in in four years time all the statistics have changed social media that once a lot so you have to keep a die has to be up-to-date so the best is you go to my website immediately today inshaallah in the next four to six weeks seven weeks the iddp will be knowing that would take if you read it if you dedicate full day of yours it will take forty days to go to it and do it if you a few hours a day it will take you a few months or maybe a year and inshallah we have the life session in the life sessions you can ask questions not necessary that a question would be entertained because we have everyday ten years of thousand everyday literally about twenty-five to thirty thousand questions coming I am answering only thirty my data bank of questions to be answered as increased as I told you earlier that out of three four thousand questions by the team they forward to me maybe 100 150 from that I select about 40 50 I keep it I'm I'm only able to answer 20 25 so every everyday in my data bank the question to be answer is every session it including another 25 and yet the majority of the question have not been read by my team the most expensive part of this session is the quite a selecting question answer session that is an ordeal which 25 questions should be selected to be answered out of the 25 thousand is a team is working on it and spending every session approximately eight hours on which question is we selected and we are presenting it so this was in brief how can you don't have to be a personal student of mine you can go on the website how you can learn about comparative religion from the website and the various technique I just give you a synopsis of the synopsis you go on the website insha'Allah it will take you few hundreds of hours to go through it and to read it once the video is available it would be more beneficial even without the video insha'Allah you can learn a lot"
