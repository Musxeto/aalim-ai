  "transcript": "Dr Zaman London UK I am inspired by a logic can we husband and wife pray regular Salah in jamaat at home under this lockdown situation yes because the lockdown situation you cannot go to the mosque so it is recommended highly recommended or rather offered for the gents at least that they should offer the five times Salah in Jama in congregation at home if you have fully get all the family together if you are only alone with your wife then see to it that you pray with jamaat it is not preferable it is for to pray in jamaat but when you pray in jamaat with your wife your wife stands behind you she does not stand in the same room as you you are the Imam a wife stood behind you exactly behind you in the next row if you have a family of many children and and your wife Etc then the second row will be of your sons or maybe your father whoever is there and the third row will be of the lady there will be three Euro but if you and your wife is there you should pray it is preferable you being a gentle you should pray in jamaat Allah said that you get 27 times 25 times so my recommendation is yes you should pray praying"
