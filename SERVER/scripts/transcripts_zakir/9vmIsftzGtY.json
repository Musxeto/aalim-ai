  "title": "Bearing of Allah's Attribute of Grace on our Fate - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "one of the attributes of Allah subhana wa ta'ala is the grace and the Beloved Prophet mallam said it's mentioned in sah Muslim volume number four Hadith number 6765 where the Prophet said that do the right things do the best Deeds to the best of your ability and be happy do the right things to the best of ability and be happy for no one can enter Jenna only on the basis of his deeds so one of the sahabas asked that what about you Allah so the prophet said not even I I cannot enter Jenna unless with the mercy of Allah subhana wa tala and his grace unless his grace and mercy and his forgiveness envelop me I cannot enter jenah so here we realize that without the grace of Allah subhana tala no one can enter jenah and Allah subhana tal says in the Quran in Sur Anam chapter number 6 verse 160 Allah says that if you do any good deeds I will multiply it 10 times into your account and if you do any evil dided I will only count it as once for Allah he does not do anything wrong so here we realize that if any good deed you do Allah subh says in the Quran he will multiply it minimum 10 times into your account if you do any evil deed he'll count as one that means if everyone was accounted one point for his good deed and one point for the evil deed without multiplication of the Good Deeds not a single human being would have entered Jenna it is the grace of Allah subhana wa ta'ala that he multiplies your good deeds and gives you multiple times more reward that you shall go to jenah that does not mean that Deeds aren't important Deeds are very important but the grace is more important without the grace of Allah you cannot enter Jenna Allah multiplies but your Deeds also should be there if your deed is there don't even multiply if your Deeds are zero and if you multiply with even million times it will be useless so Deeds are also important but without the grace of Allah subhana wa ta'ala no human being can enter Paradise so because of his quality attribute of being merciful kind forgiving loving and Grace all these are manifested in the cre Allah subhana wa ta'ala and one of the attributes is also supreme justice and Allah subhana wa ta'ala he has in G before person is born he knows that after a person is born whether he'll do good deeds or bad Deeds whether he listen to The Commandments of Allah subhana wa tala or will disobey he knows he even knows whether the person will go to Janam or jna whether he'll go to hell or Paradise he knows but if Allah subhana wa ta'ala moment a person is born or before he's born he puts him in heaven person deserves heaven and puts the person in Hell who deserves hell the people who have been put in heaven they may not object they may say fine alhamdulillah we have been put into heav no problem but surely those people who have been put in hell they will object that how come you haven't let us lead our life and without a test you have put us in hell so because Allah subhana wa ta'ala is just Allah says in the Quran in Surah NAA chapter number four verse number 14 Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is never unjust in the least degree that's the reason Allah subhah wa ta'ala lets the people live in this world and if you follow the Commandments of Allah subhana wa tala you pass the test otherwise you fail the test and people may ask that one of the pillars of Iman the last pillar is is Destiny and Allah says in the Quran in Surah s chapter number 32 verse number 12 Allah says all these people who will go to hell on the day of judgment they will never object to the justice of Allah subhana wa taala they will say all these Sinners they will bow their head down and say please forgive us they will agree with the Lord they will say please give us one more chance so that we can go again in the world and that time we will surely be Believers but Allah knows that even if he forgives them and puts them back into this world but natural he'll have to wash out the memory of what they have seen of the hell Allah is sure that they'll again commit the same mistake and this is mentioned in the Quran in Sur Anam chapter number six verse number 28 that if these people were again sent in the world they would repeat the same mistakes because they are liars so Allah knows in his Divine wisdom that these people even if he sends them again if the memory is washed out of what they seen of the hell they will do the same mistakes"
