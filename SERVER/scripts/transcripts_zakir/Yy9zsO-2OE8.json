  "transcript": "let's move on to the next question relates to the science behind the benefits of fasting there are some people and I want to know whether they're right or not who say that fasting actually has some harmful effects on a person psychological social physical Etc is that correct several researches have been done by many scientists F5 fasting is concerned and what effect does it have in various aspects of demon body and scientists will tell us that when a person takes in food it increases the metabolism of the body when the food intake is reduced or when a person fasts the body metabolism rate goes down by about 22 percent and if you fast continuously for several days or for a month then this stabilizes at a lower rate so the body metabolism rate is reduced by fasting further the research done on various groups of male and female Muslims who had fasted and it showed that there was a slight reduction in the body weight but there was an increase in the glucose level as far as all the other things are concerned it remained constant whether it was the testosterone or the cortic cell whether it was sodium potassium urea whether it was cholesterol whether it was HDL hydrants and lipoprotein whether it was LDL low density lipoprotein whether it was TG the triglyceride all these the body levels remain the same the fasting did not have any effect on them except it increased the glucose level and there was a slight reduction in weight when another research was conducted in Iran where some men fasted for about 17 hours for over 30 days in the month of ramnan it showed that it had no effect on the male reproductive hormone on the testosterone and it had no effect on the hpta as well as on the thyroid hormones there were several research is conducted there was also a research there was a study made which was called as increase in oxidation in the month of Ramadan on healthy women a way for maintaining the weight weight maintenance and it showed that during fasting there was no change as far as the physiology of the body was concerned the weight was same and all the functions were the same fasting increases the fat oxidation and decreases the carbohydrate oxidation and you have to realize that we have to let the Physicians of the Western World they should know that they should note the levels of bilirubin and glucose while fasting the further studies conducted that fasting increases the mucosa developed B lymphocyte cell responsiveness but did not show a change in the building for the responsiveness of the rumored arthritis and the health volunteers but in fasting it increased the longevity of the life increases lifespan of many researchers conducting animals it increases lifespan further research was conducted on the lactating woman when they fasted the fasting did not increase or decrease there was no change in the milk volume as well as the content of the milk the glucose level was the same the fat concentration was the same the lactose content was the same there was no change per se as far as the lactating mothers were concerned the research is done regarding fasting's effect on military women as well as the reproductive cycle and when the research was done there was no change whatsoever there wasn't any change in the menstrual cycle in fasting or there was no negative effect no positive effect so it is wrong to say that fasting has ill effect there are many benefits which we discussed earlier but there are certain positive points that fasting has helped in certain diseases for example rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis it helps and what we realized that researchers were done that on animals when they are sick they don't prefer having any food same thing with the children when children get sick they don't prefer having food it is the family members who force them to have food and research has shown that when food is taken when a person is sick it prevents them from getting well early it hampers the immune system so when a person fasts when you're seriously ill it helps them to recover faster that's the reason now we find that there are many treatments with include fasting for various diseases which are followed by the Western world because when a person fast his body gets fresh and the toxins are removed from the body so it helps them to recover faster and fasting is also good to change the behavior pattern and if a person is addicted or a person is alcoholic as I mentioned earlier or is a chain smoker if he fast it's a good point that he can stop it throughout his life and people who habituated to things like tea coffee junk food when they fast and they stay away from it when they taste buds they don't have for the full month the taste buds don't crave for that and when they have healthy food they start liking it so it's a good time to stay away from junk food if you can do it for one month you can do it throughout your life yes and there are certain diseases for example insulin dependent diabetes a person who's suffering from insulin dependent diabetes you should not fast because you have ketosis normally the ketones are used as a source of energy but if a person has insulin dependent diabetes he's unable to use this so therefore person who has insulin dependent I believe they should not fast but naturally if he takes insulin and fuss and with the medical advice it's fine but the other type of Diabetes which is more common non-insulin dependent diabetes fasting is helpful for that and as I mentioned earlier it's helpful in various diseases like cardiovascular disease asthma arthritis digestive strike diseases in lupus in skin disease you can name a list of diseases in which fasting is of good benefit I think it would be really interesting to know I mean this research has it been done by Muslims or non-muslims these researchers have been done by both Muslim and non-muslims and there are hundreds of non-muslim scientists who have done research on fasting so it's not only the Muslims more of their own Muslims do research and fasting but there are even Muslims for example if you read the book fasting a way of life by Alan cot he writes that fasting is all together it gives rest to the digestive tract as well as a central nervous system for the whole body and he's a non-muslim there was a research on my Indian doctor by the name of Dr Shanti rangwani and she says that when a person fasts there is no intake of food so the toxins are created by the food that you eat so no new toxin is created and whatever toxin is there present in the body from before it gets excreted from the body so fasting is a very good method of exceeding all the toxins from the body and it purifies the body system Muslim that is in the University Hospital in ammani Jordan and he did a research on a group of men and women they were 42 men and 26 women and the research was done that they fasted and the changes in the body was noted and they found out that there was a slight reduction in weight and there was an increase in the glucose level but as far as the other components are concerned testosterone cortisol sodium potassium urea all of them remain the same there was no change as per in the body called except the glucose they will increase and the reduction in the weight of the human being there were several researchers done men on Muslims those a group of non-muslim scientists who did research in Africa foreign research that people who were starving because of famine and they lived in the same refugee camp some people who had food and some people were starving but those who were starving they had less chances of having tuberculosis as well as malaria so fasting increase the difference mechanism against tuberculosis malaria so it's Allah's Mercy alhamdulillah can you believe because they were starving it prevented them from having tuberculosis as well as malaria the research is done by non-muslims they show that fasting increases the longevity increase the lifespan and it has a reversal on the aging process do the research done by a Muslim Scientist by the name of tatosa mccandil in the Howard University Muslim but in a non-muslim country non-muslim City and he did a research on patients suffering from cancer and he tried to find out what way do the cells function especially the killer cells which attack the cancer cells and he did accounting just before they started fasting and then he again did accounting on the 25th day of Ramadan then 28 there from then and he found that there was a marked difference after 21 days and 28 days the number of cells the killer cells they increased and these cells they attack the cancer cells and it shows that even the immunity increased the defense mechanism of the human being because of fasting it increased and then the research again done in the same patients and it found out that the T cells which are normally required for the defense immunity of the human being they increased our gate level and T cells are merely responsible when anyone has a disease they are mainly the soldiers or they are called the major general of the army that you have they are the T cells and they go and they see to it any disease is there it goes and try and destroy the disease and AIDS is the disease which mainly attacks these T cells therefore it's known as acquired immune deficiencies syndrome so when you fast this has increase and the immunity of the human means increase I would like to mention one more research done by a European non-muslim by the name of Dr Jeffrey and what he says that fasting is not only known by human beings fasting is even done by the animals and the plants and give the example animals that live in cold countries during heavy snowfalls they stay separately and they don't eat and they're going to have an issue and there are examples of animals like frog which go in hibernation and here they don't need they fast and he gave the example in his book that even the trees in winter when they don't get water they're fasting but the moment later when spring comes you'll find that the tree is filled up with colorful leaves with flowers with fruits and he suggested that every human being every year should at least fast for 40 days and we know that it's worth for every Muslim to fast in the month of Ramadan there's approximately 30 days and further if you keep the six days of fasting in shawwal that makes 36 Days so Allah and our Prophet has already given us this Guidance with the non-muslim European has given us recently so the many research children men on Muslims on fasting and it's very beneficial for the human body Dr Zakir most of the research that you've mentioned I suspect a lot of the other research we haven't had time to mention today was done relatively recently um was this knowledge the scientific knowledge available for the Muslims in history after the earlier Muslims are concerned some of the facts were known some were not known not in the same way as we have come to know by at first today and I'll give you the reason why later now the main question is concerned that were they aware about these aspects of fasting in a different way may not be in the same way as we know today that reminds me I read a book by Maulana Abul Hassan he writes in his book and he gives incidents at the time of Khalifa Arun Rashid and there he gives a dialogue between the Christian physician of Khalifa harun Rashid and a Muslim by the name of Ali bin Hussain bin wakid and this Christian physician of Khalifa Rashid he says that the Quran is considered to be a book of Sciences and we know the two types of Sciences science of the body science of the Soul so what does your Quran speak about medical science so early been Hussein been working he said that Allah in half hours of the Quran he combines both these Sciences when he says chapter number seven verse number 31 eat and drink but do not waste in excess likes not the people who waste then the Christian Center says but what did your Prophet Muhammad say about medicine so he said that he is mentioned that the stomach is the main house of diseases and prevention is the best thing for ailment in provision is Lam said it's mentioned in number four Hadith number 3349 the prophet said the son of Adam does not fill a vessel more worse more evil than the stomach a few muscles are sufficient to keep him on his feet if he has to eat more one third of the stomach can be a food month or drink and one third should be for his breath so then that Christian physician said that means when you had the guidance of your Allah and Prophet Muhammad we did not require jolliness he was a very famous non-muslim physician of that time so what the prophet Allah say is a telegraphic message which we have done research today with the prophet also already has given a nutshell the message before and in that same book he mentions and gives the example of another non-muslim scientist who is an American he says that every human being with the poor or Rich he should fast for some days every year it will keep him healthy and then he says that Islam is the best religion which has made it compulsory on the follows too fast and he said that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was the best physician who has prescribed fasting and he said that there's no better healthy way than fasting and after that taravi in which you have to do some exercise according to him which helps in digestion so if you realize that the non-muslims appreciated the region of Islam after doing research though many of the Muslims are aware about the medical benefits of fasting but we Muslims we don't fast for these medical benefits we fast for sake of Allah for the pledge of Allah we don't fast for the medical benefits these medical benefits are ancillary yeah or they may be the maybe three decisions maybe the desert our main Biryani our main meal course is a pleasure of Allah which we discussed in the objective of fasting we don't fast for medical benefits even if these medical benefits were not there we Muslim would have fasted but as what do we do for Allah Allah gives us back in return so all that that we do it actually benefits Us in various ways in this world as well as nahara but we Muslims don't fast for these medical benefits these are just bonuses that we get irrespectively that we get or not yet would fast for the second last one yeah that's good so when you listen to The Commandments of Allah look at his life and Implement those things immediately you get some benefit in this world subhanallah"
