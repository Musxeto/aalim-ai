  "transcript": "can you get vaccinated during fasting this question is from techstar Javed from YouTube as far as injections are concerned when you're fasting the ruling is that you cannot take injections which are containing nutrients for example you cannot take injection of glucose it contains nutrients but taking injections we do not contain nutrients it is permissible vaccination but natural doesn't contain any nutrients so if you take vaccination while you're fasting your fasting does not break"
