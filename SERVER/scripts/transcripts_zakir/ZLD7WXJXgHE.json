  "title": "Practising Judo with Females - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalam Alum I am aan musak from India age 22 years old I am a male Muslim who practices Judo in my training group I am the only male and therefore I often have to practice with female Partners it is important to note that the female participants including myself wear uniforms that cover our entire bodies and they also wear hijab given these circumstances is it permissible in Islam for me to continue training in this manner brother aan mushak from India says that he goes for training classes and he learning Judo but the classes he goes has all females he's the only male in that class and while practicing he has to practice Judo with the female partners and he saying that they they're in full they're completely covered they hijab may be wearing clothes is it permissible or not number one intermingling of sexes is not permitted in Islam and you're talking about Judo I know cases in which there are all male students learning Judo and one female wants to join Ive heard the first time in my life I'm hearing that there are all female Judo students and a male wants to join I've never heard that also Muslim first time I'm hearing I want to ask the question question that in your city isn't there any classes of Judo or martial arts which are only males is absurd I've never heard an India that only female that're also Judo so Point number one is that there should not be intering of sexes and especially in Judo there is not only intermingling there is physical contact Judo is one type of martial art in which there is excessive physical contact you have to hold the partner you have to throw the partner over imagine you're holding a little and and because even I've done martial arts I've done Judo I've done karate I've done taond I know you have to catch the uniform and throw your partner over imagine you're catching a woman and throwing her over how can you ask such a question that can I practice Judo with a female if you're asking can I study in coeducation also it is wrong but you asking me can I practice Judo any she catches you and she's throwing you you're touching her and touching and is not permitted in Islam intering is not permitted you're touching you have to touch you may have to touch the hand touch the body catch the uniform and throw them over no way it is totally Haram there is no out of doubt my request to you would be immediately stop it immediately from today from now onwards and see that if you want to learn martial arts join a class which is exclusively only of males they should not be meing and if you don't have Judo you can take one you can do the various Ms available it will keep you fit inshallah but see to it that you avoid intermingling of sexes hope the answer the question"
