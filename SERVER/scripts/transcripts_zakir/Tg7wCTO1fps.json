  "title": "Should a Traveler End his Fast of Ramadhaan Following the Country of Origin or Destination?",
  "transcript": "Dr Zakia if a person starts fasting one country he then travels to a second country in that country their month has started two days after his country of origin should he end his fast according to the country that he's traveled to this would mean of course that he would end up fasting 31 or even 32 days is this correct for him to do that as far as a person who starts fasting in one country and when he travels to another country and that country has started maybe two days late and if he continues and he ends his month of Ramadan According to second country where he has traveled it may be that he may end up fasting 31 days or 32 days so should he fast till the end of that country or should he continue with the country of origin and when they finish the Ramadan they should finish as far as this question is concerned as Allah's Prophet has clearly mentioned in thei ofari volume number three book of fasting Hadith number 19 1907 and 19 1909 that a prophet said that when you see the new moon you start fasting and when you see the new moon you stop fasting So based on this but natural and another Hadith ofi book of fasting Hadith number 697 the Beloved Prophet said the fast is the day you all fast and the breaking of the fast is the day when you all break the Fast and the day of sacrifice is the day when you all sacrifice indicating it should be done in congregation it should be in jamama it can't be done individually so because the person when he shifts from one country to another country he should follow the rules and regulations as the people of that country where he's staying in so if he stays in a country where they start fasting early he should start fasting early with them and if he goes to a country where the fasting is delayed the month of Ramadan is delayed by two days he should continue with them even if he has to fast one or two days more he has to continue doing that because he has to be with the jamama he has to be with the people it cannot be that the other people are fasting and he's not fasting he should maintain the jamama that as what the people are doing in the country where he living he should continue doing that even if he has to fast one or two days more I know the month of Ramadan either has 29 days or 30 days but since he has to Hadith that the fast is the day when all the people fast and the breaking of the fast is the day when all the people break the fast so you should continue and break the fast only when all the people break even if he has to fast one or two days more and similarly if a person when he starts fasting and if he travels to another country and maybe the sunset is about 2 hours late so he has to Fast 2 hours more he can't say the country of origin the sun was setting at at 6:00 and here it is setting at 8:00 so I will Fast 2 hours less no the same way as far as setting of the moon is concerned he has to do extra days if it's the vice versa if a person starts fasting if a person starts the month of Ramadan in a country and then goes to a country which has already started the month of Ramadan two days earlier than the country of origin or one day earlier than the country of origin in this case also he has to continue fasting with the people of that area even though he may have to fast one day less maybe he'll have to fast only 28 days but in this case since a month cannot be 28 days he has to celebrate Eid with the people of that country but later on he should compensate for the fast he has missed because the month of Ramadan cannot have 28 days so if both the countries where he started and ended both have got 30 days and if he fasted for 28 days then he has to compensate two days but if the country of origin had 29 days or the country of to which has travel has 29 days then he has the option of only fasting for 29 days then he has to make up only one fast but he has to complete at least 29 or 30 days depending upon the country of origin and destination"
