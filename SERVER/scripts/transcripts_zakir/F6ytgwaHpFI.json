  "transcript": "my name is Sal ha I'm a singer just wondering about the difference in Islam and Christianity about death and resurrection of Jesus peace be upon him this is as a question what is the difference in Islam and Christianity regarding the death and the relation of Jesus Christ peace be upon him as I did mention a little bit in my speech that in Islam the Quran mentions in surah nisa chapter number 4 was the 158 that allah subhanho wa taala almighty God raised Jesus Christ peace be upon him alive so we believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he did not die he was raised up alive the same thing if you read in the Bible I've given a talk and had a debate that was Christ really crucified and we believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was not crucified even from the Bible I can prove that but that requires time so what we believe that even the bible does not mention that jesus christ peace be upon him died on the cross but the difference in the reading of the common christians they said that jesus christ peace be upon him was crucified for that you can see my debate was Christ really crucified as far as the Second Coming is concerned we Muslims believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him will come again on the face of the earth which is also believed by the Christians we believe he's going to come again the reason we believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him has been raised up alive is because he is the only messenger of allah subhana wa ta'ala of Almighty God whose followers as a whole mistook that he claimed divinity his only messenger so because this follows as a whole they are a misunderstanding that Jesus Christ peace be upon him claimed divinity that the reason Almighty God has raised him up alive and in his second coming it's mentioned in the Quran in surah mida chap number five was from 116 he will say and he will tell almighty God you be my witness I never told them to worship me but I said oh Allah worship Allah rock your abukuma who's my Lord and your Lord and similarly it's mentioned if reads the gospel it's mentioned the gospel in the second coming Jesus Christ peace be upon him many people will say Oh Lord did we not do one other miracles in your name so Jesus Christ will say a man of iniquity he sinful people you depart from here I don't even know you so Jesus Christ peace be upon him any second coming he will come to testify that he never claimed divinity but he was the messenger of Almighty God open answers a question [Applause]"
