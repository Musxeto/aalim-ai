  "title": "How to prove to an Atheist that the Quran is God's word? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "anyone who believes in god will immediately agree if he's unbiased with what i've said in the last one hour he'll have to agree that the quran is from god but what about a person who does not believe in god himself if a person does not believe in god where is the question of quran being a word of god so now we have dealt with the majority of the people but yet there is a large percentage who are atheist who do not believe in god himself how do we deal with them when i meet an atheist and if you say that it does not believe in god the first thing i do is i congratulate that atheist now you may wonder that why is zakir congratulating an atheist the reason i am congratulating him is because most of the human beings they are doing blind belief most of the christians the christians because the father is a christian he's hindu because father is hindu some of them are muslims because their father are muslim they aren't thinking this person he's thinking he may be coming from a religious background but he may not agree that the god which his parents are worshipping is what to be called as god the reason i congratulate the atheist is because he has said the first part of the islamic shahada islamic creed there is no god the only thing i have to do is prove to him illallah but allah which i shall do inshallah to the other non-muslims [Applause] to the other non-muslims first i have to prove to him that the god is worshiping is false so half the time i wished in trying to prove that the god is worshiping is false here half my job is done only thing left for me is allah and then mohammed rasool allah but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon the messenger of allah now this atheist he rejects god because he has the wrong concept of god now anyone who says he does not believe in god first i'll ask him what is the definition of god for anyone to reject anything he should know its definition for example if i say this is a pen for you to say it is not a pen you should know the definition of pen if you don't know the definition of pen you cannot say this is not a pen is it clear do you agree with me or not if i say this is a pen for you to say it is not a pen you have to know the definition of pen otherwise you cannot logically say it's not a pen there was a smart person he said no brother i know that's a book so even if i don't know the definition of a pen i can say it's not a pen i know it's a book so why should i know the definition of pen so i said fine do you know that's a book he says yes i say this this is a kitab if he said no it's not a kitab he knows the definition of book but does not know a definition of kitab kitab in arabic and urdu means a book if i say this is a pen knowing definition of a pen is more important than knowing what is this same way if a person says there is no god i'll first ask him what is the definition of god the definition they give is when they see that a god there is a lie or god can be defeated the god he can be killed so when we hear all the stories of god telling a lie or god can be defeated a god can be killed a god can die a god requires to eat so they reject the god who are they rejecting they're rejecting the false gods similarly someone if he believes that islam is a religion of terrorism islam is a merciless religion islam is the unscientific religion islam is religion which does not give rights to the woman and he rejects this islam i say even i reject such islam because i know that islam is a merciful religion islam it's a scientific religion islam has human rights islam has women rights so what do i do i tell him the islam you believe and you reject it should be rejected but true islam is then i present to him the true islam similarly when these people are rejecting the false god we have to present to them what is the true god and the best definition of almighty god of allah given in the quran is from surah class chapter number 112 verse number one to four which says say he is allah and only allah allah the absolute eternal he begets not no is begotten there is nothing like him this is a foreign definition of allah any person saying that so-and-so person is god if that person fits in this four line definition we muslims have got no objection and accepting that person is god the first is kul wallawad says allah and only second is allah allah the absolute internal military he begets not know he's begotten there's nothing like him there are many people who say that brajnesh he's almighty god let us put this bhagavan dashnesh to the test of surah class there's a person who asked me no question at the time that brother zakir the hindus do not believe in bhagavad-gita i never said that hindus believe bhagavad-gita should be god i've read the hindu scriptures nowhere does hindu scripture say bhagavad-gita is god i said some human beings some people believe bhagwan used to be god let us put this bhagavad-gita to the test of surah class the first is say is allah and only was bhagavan rajneesh one and only was he the only man who claimed divinity there are hundreds who have claimed divinity and in this country alone there are thousands who have claimed that they were gods he's not the only one but the rajneesh bhakt will say no he is one and only is unique let's go to the next test the absolute eternal was rajneesh absolutely eternal we know from the autobiography of rajneesh he says that he was suffering from asthma from chronic back ache from diabetes mellitus imagine almighty god suffering from asthma chronic back ache diabetes mellitus third test is he begets not know he's begotten we know bhagavan rashnesh he was born in madhya pradesh and later on in 1981 he goes to america and takes thousands of americans for a ride and in the state of oregon he starts his village called as rashnishpuram later on the american government they arrest him and they put him behind bars and rajnish he alleges that the american government they slow poisoned me in the prison imagine almighty god being so poisoned later on the american government the king of the country he comes back to india and goes back to the city of puna where he has a center which is now called as osho commune and when you go to the center if you go to samadhi it is mentioned there on a samadhi bhagavan dashnesh osho never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990 never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990 they forgot to mention on samadhi that he was not given visas to more than 21 countries of the world almighty god coming to visit the world and requires visas and the arc bishop of greece said that if we don't remove rajneesh out of this country we'll burn his house and the house of his disciple and the last test that nothing like him is so stringent that no one besides the true almighty god can pass the moment you can compare god to anyone in this world to anyone in the universe he is not god walam yakullah there's nothing like him suppose someone says that almighty god is a thousand times stronger than anna schwarzenegger you may have heard the name of anis foshenger the person who got the title mr world the strongest man in the world mr universe the strongest man in the universe if someone says that almighty god is thousand times stronger than anish washington the moment you can compare god to anything in this world whether it be anus forshnagar whether it be dara singh whether it be king kong whether it be a thousand times a million times the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god walam yakulla kufana there's nothing like him you know bhagavan rajneesh got white clothes he had a beard he had two eyes like human beings one nose two hands the moment you can compare god to anything in this world he is not god well otherwise allah says in the quran in surah israel chapter number 17 verse 110. say call upon him by whichever name you call upon him to him belong the most beautiful names you can call allah by any name but it should be a beautiful name it should not conject a mental picture it should be a name given by himself and this message besides being mentioned in surah chapter 17 verse 7 and 10 it's also mentioned in surah chapter number that to allah belong the most beautiful names"
