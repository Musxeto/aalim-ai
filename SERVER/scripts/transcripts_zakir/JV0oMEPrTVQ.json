  "title": "Can a Studentâ€™s Loan with Interest be taken in the West as the Fees are Exorbitant - Fariq Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is sara and i work as a senior sales consultant in london in the west in order to study a degree course you can take student loans as the yearly fees are extremely high for one to pay hence it is easier to take a student loan student loan in the west does consist of interest however the condition of paying back the student loan is to earn more than 25 000 pounds a year otherwise you don't have to pay it back and after 30 years or if a person dies this loan will be written off is it still okay otherwise muslims would not be able to study or attend a university as you have to take loan in order to be educated what should one do allah subhanahu wa allah says in the glorious quran surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and 279 a oh you believe fear allah and give up your demands afriba if you are believers if you do not do so fa then will be harambe so be prepared that allah and his messenger will wage a war against you so riba it is completely prohibited in islam dealing in riba it is haram in islam and according to imam al-habib he writes in his book i'll combine the 70 major sins he says that riba it is the 12th major sin in islam so dealing in riba it is completely prohibited it is haram now as you have asked in your question regarding a student loan and you only have to repay this loan if you earn more than 25 000 pounds a year even in this situation you cannot agree with this contract even if you know that you will not earn more than 25 000 pounds a year yet you cannot agree with this contract because you are agreeing that in this situation you will pay riba you will deal in rabbah so this is completely prohibited in islam i am aware that there are certain western so-called scholars who say that it is permitted to take a student loan to take a home loan to take a house loan even if it involves indirba but the verse of the glorious quran it is clear in the prohibition of dealing with rabbah and dealing in riba it is a major sin so we should abstain from dealing in rubber and if you want to study so there are other solutions the first is that you can apply for scholarship the second is that you can take a loan from an islamic sharia compliant bank the third is that you approach an islamic organization who will finance your education or who will give you a loan for your education but in no way should you take riba and many a times you know that if you deal in riba in this world you will get a lot of benefit it will be lucrative for example if you take this loan the student loan it may be for example for medicine and then later on you'll become a doctor and you'll earn a lot of money you will have so much respect but what is the point of this money when it is haram what is the point of this money when in the akra you will be among the losers and it is a test from allah allah subhana wa tala test different people in different ways for example he may show them that they have a good offer to deal with riba but it is a test for this person in this situation will he yet deal in rabbi or no so this is very important that we need to abstain from all the things that are haram and inshallah you have other solutions like scholarship you can take a loan from an islamic bank a sharia compliant bank or you can approach an islamic organization who will give you a loan so these are the options but in no way should deal and involve in rabbah because riba it is clearly prohibited in islam and it is from among the major sins so no one should take it lightly so you should totally abstain from dealing in rubber"
