  "transcript": "the next question from marine from kashmir india can women read the quran during memphis there's a different opinion where the woman can read the quran during mixes unanimously all the fukahas all the scholars agree that the woman during menses cannot touch the musa of the quran cannot touch the copy of the quran this is unanimously agreed upon all the scholars also unanimously agree that women during the menstrual period they can recite and if that dua contains a few words of the quran or a small section of the quran like bismillah or in the level it is permissible there's no difference between this the difference of opinion is in that can the woman recite the quran during menstruation most of the for most of the scholars they say that women cannot read the quran during menstruation and the reason is based on menstruation is like janaba like major ceremonial impurity major ceremony imperative means after a section intercourse so after nightfall or where there's emission after the second intercourse it's called as janaba so these scholars say that menstruation is like janamba and they quote hadith may allah that the prophet said that during menstruation the woman and during janaba both men and women they should not recite the quran now this hadith according to most of the muhaddisin it is so this hadith in which the prophet said that the woman during menstruation and during janaba male and female both they should not recite the quran in the dai fadeed so you cannot base your fatwa on this so based on this according to the maliki school of thought the women are permitted to recite the quran during the menstruation especially if they are doing gifts of the quran if they are students and imagine the menstruation can last for four days five days seven days two weeks for longer period and imagine you are away from the quran even one view of imam ahmed humble is that a woman can read during menstruation the glorious quran and sheikh natalia he believes in this view of imam ahmed namal that a woman during menstruation can recite the quran and even shaykh shahkhani he agrees that a woman can recite the quran during menstruation but naturally here the woman can only recite what they know from memory because they cannot touch the quran but now alhamdulillah if they have to touch they can touch with gloves or they can have some wood or a box in between etc but alhamdulillah lately since the last several years we have got quran on a digital platform and all of them agree that if you read the quran from a mobile or from ipad or on the computer a woman in menstruation can read from a mobile the quran can't touch the mobile can't touch the ipad can't touch the tablet can't touch the computer this ruling that women touching the moosa is not applicable here because it's the digital format so even though all the scholars agree that women cannot write the quran during menstruation but according to imam malik and one view of imam number and some others their view is that women can read the quran during menstruation but she should not touch it but naturally if she has a mobile or a tablet there's no problem from that she can read she can recite and i also agree with this view of imam malik and imam abnetimiya as well as imam shakani that women during menstruation candidate the quran but they should not touch the quran and best now is to read from the mobile or from an app application or tablet and inshaallah so that during these few days whether it be four days five days 10 days 15 days they can be in touch with the quran and but naturally they can also read the translation of the quran they can read the other aspects the fasting etc hope that answers the question"
