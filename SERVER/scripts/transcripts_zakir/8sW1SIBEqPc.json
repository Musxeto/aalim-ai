  "transcript": "the next question on the WhatsApp my name is raan I'm a student from Bangladesh my question is many atheists claim that can Allah create a stone that he cannot lift I generally answer them by saying that this question is illogical and self-contradictory but they say that Allah is transcendent and he's not bound by any contradictions since he is not bound by any contradictions so why he can't create a stone that he cannot lift so how to answer this question and this is a common question asked even in the times of when I was in school that can God create anything and everything and we say yes can God destroy anything and everything and we say yes so can God create a stone which you cannot destroy and you're stuck if you say yes also you're wrong if you say know also you're wrong and similar question can God create anything and everything we say yes can God lift anything and everything we said yes so can he create a stone which he cannot lift so these questions actually as you rightly said they illogical because for example if I say that there is a tall short man it doesn't have any meaning you can either have a tall man or a short man or you can have a medium man you can't have a tall short man it's meaningless for example if I say that there's a fat thin man either have a fat man or a thin man you can't have a fat thin man because it's meaningless so similarly Allah subhana wa ta'ala only does Godly things he does not do ungodly things like creating a stone which you cannot LIF like Allah subhana ta'ala he does not lie because to lie is against the concept of Allah subhana tala Allah Allah says in the Quran he's never unjust Allah subhana tal cannot do Justice Allah says in Surah 4 ver number 40 he is never unjust in the least degree furthermore Allah says that Allah subhana tala never forgets Allah says inah chapter number 20 verse number 52 Allah never forgets so Allah cannot forget it is against the the benevolence of Allah subhana tal to forget so here we say that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is all powerful and Allah subhana wa ta'ala cannot do ungodly things Allah subhana wa ta'ala only does Godly things he doesn't do ungodly things that's the reason Allah subhana wa ta'ala is the highest and we learn from the S of the prophet and the incident which increases our IM hope the answer this question"
