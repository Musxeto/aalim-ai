  "transcript": "Muslims we give respect to the Quran alhamdulillah but many of us they go beyond the limit they give so much respect that they forget for what purpose the Quran was revealed you know we keep the Quran on the topmost Shelf alhamdulillah they keep it so much on top that's difficult to reach and the Quran catches dust you the Quran is a book of guidance it's a guide book you know suppose if you are studying you know it's kept at a shelf which you can reach the easiest you won't keep it on top very difficult I take a stool to get it down so Quran is a book which should be referred every day it should be handy and many of us Muslims you know we tie the Quran in a pure silk cloth and then we tie a knot on it suppose if you want to read the Quran you start thinking okay 5 minutes to open the Quran 5 minutes again to tie the Quran 10 minutes the thought of you opening the Quran and again tying it will be a deterent and if you have 10 minutes that's if you have 10 minutes time you know to open the Quran close 10 minutes so better not read the Quran see we have to respect the Quran but the main respect is in the heart I'm not against keeping the Quran on top don't get me wrong but see to it that it is accessible it's easily available for guidance"
