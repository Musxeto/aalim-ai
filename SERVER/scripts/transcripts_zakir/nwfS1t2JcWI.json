  "transcript": "my name is nato raymond i work in dubai as a salesman now my question is just on fasting i just want to know how somebody can control himself by fasting from morning up to in the evening we know very well that jesus himself fasted for 40 days and yet to say that muslims are more christians than christians themselves we are asking the question that muslims we fast from dawn to sunset and jesus christ peace be upon him fasted for 40 days you say that 40 days there is no mention of jesus christ peace be upon him fasting for 40 days in the quran and even the christians when they fast they don't fast like the muslims do they have a different sort of fasting depending on which sect you belong to some sect for fasting you're not having non-veg some say they've only boiled food so there are different sects in christianity which fast in different ways i don't know if any second christianity will fast for 40 days if they fast they may have okay no non-veg only vegetables that that type of fasting some fasting is only having boiled food that they're fasting there are different types in different sects but i don't know of any sects in christianity which fast like the muslims or neither like they fast for 40 days continuously like the way you're saying hope to answer the question brother"
