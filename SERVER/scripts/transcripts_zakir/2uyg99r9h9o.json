  "title": "Is Islam meant only for those individuals who are Spiritually Advanced? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Arjun jaira I'm 19 years old different people are at different levels of spiritual level and refinement and understanding I think Islam is for people who are already quite Advanced at the spiritual understanding not everybody can follow its teachings meaningfully comparing it to a school I mean people are like At first 100 seconds and the 10th Islam is like ninth standard curriculum so am I right Islam is only for those are already spiritually advanced brother asked a very good question that when we compare all the religions Islam is at a higher level advanced level like in a school the other religion may be kindergarten first standard Islam is ninth and 10th at the higher level is he right I do agree with you agree as well disagree agree that yes Islam is for those who are spiritually high but that does not mean a person who is not spiritually Advanced he cannot enter Islam I disagree with that why because normally for everyone anyone who enters School if you enter English school the first thing he learns is what he learned the alphabet of that language suppose he's entering school which is English medium School in Nursery he will learn a b c d correct so in Islam even if a person is not spiritually high when he enters School the minimum he should follow is tahit the basic ABCD of English language is comparable to tahit of any religion means believing in one God so what I was describing earlier when our sick brother asked the question about the concept of God that is the basic and that basic is present in every religion but unfortunately those people who are the religious leaders they don't want people to follow that because if they follow that who will follow the religious leaders if everyone starts worshiping one God then all these religious leader will not be required there's no intermediately required in all the other religions you require intermediary upon death a priest a guru here it is direct between you and your creator so all the religions have the same basic message which is then Islam but unfortunately the religious leaders they don't want the followers to know this they want to keep them away because if they enter the school finally they will submit their will to God submit the will to God means become Muslims and then these intermediary they will lose the job you know they'll have to close their shops down so that's the reason otherwise all the religious scriptures even though they have been changed almighty God he got only one religion for all the human beings but by the passage of time the scriptures kept on changing even after the scriptures have changed they have been interpolations there have been Fabrications there have been concoctions yet in the remnants of all the religious scriptures you find the message of taheed of one God that idol worship is prohibited you worship him there may be other contradictory remarks also but if you search for the truth and you find so what I say irrespective the moment you realize that there's a Creator which I shall discuss tomorrow in detail then you realize what is the purpose of your life and then the initial nursery and the kindergarten off every spiritual aspect every religion is believe in one God and he alone deserves worship so anyone who's not even spiritually Advanced the moment he wants to thank his creator he submits his will and the person who submits his will he is called as a Muslim hope that answers the question [Applause]"
