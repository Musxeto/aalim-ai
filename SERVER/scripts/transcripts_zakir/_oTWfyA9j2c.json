  "transcript": "the first question is from abdul kareem puna india what is the meaning of zakatul fitr can it be given to any poor person and can we give it as money the second question similar from muhammad said from ghana which is the best time to give zakatul fitter so zakat fitter means the arabic word zakat means to purify and fitter means the breaking of fast so zakat fitter means purification of the breaking of fast and this has to be given by every muslim unless he or she is extremely poor or extremely mis-keen without any provision this zakatul fitter cannot be given to any muslim it is specifically given to only those muslims who are extremely poor who are extremely needy and who don't have any provision a beloved prophet muslim said that give one sa of wheat or wheat grain to two people that means for one person zakat wither is half of wheat of wheat cream and the prophet said give one sa of dates of bali for one person now one is approximately three kilos so zakat fitter is one and a half kilo of wheat or wheat grain per person or it is three kilos of barley or dates or oats or rice or similar per person zakatul fitter can only be given in the form of food it cannot be given in the form of money it has to be in the form of food but you can give to an organization which collects zakat fitter and delivers it to the extremely poor and the needy people this is possible but directly to the poor person money is not accepted you can give an organization who are organized and they see to it that at the right time they give this to the poor people the causal fitter should be given before you pray the salah and can be given two days before isallah that means it should be given in these 48 hours the earliest you can give as the hadith says that some of the sabbath gave two days before so in this 48 hours the zakatul frittata should be given and if you give it after the it's salah it is not acceptable it will be counted as normal sapka but not a zakatil feather the kaathral feather especially purification of your fasting so this has to be given just before the salah so that those who are extremely poor extremely needy and who don't have any provision at least during each day they have the food so that they can have a comfortable eat this zakatul fitter it is compulsory and as i said that it should be given in food and maximum 48 hours before the itself and it should be preferably given in the area where you are staying and if you are giving money you have to calculate what is the cost of the thing equivalent that much money you can give to an organization which sees to it that before they sala they will give it to the right people who are extremely poor or extremely needy"
