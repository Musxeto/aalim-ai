  "transcript": "let's look at some of the prerequisites of Salah the computer it needs to be programmed only once because it does not have a free will but since we human beings we have a free will we need to be programmed regularly because of the amount of wrong things that happen around us for example alcoholism bribing cheating drug addiction molestation fornication teasing robbing Etc so therefore we need to be programmed regularly and the computer it does not have a free will therefore it needs to be programmed only once and many people say that why can't we offer Salah only once why we have to offer Salah five times a day like how for a healthy body minimum three meals a day is required similarly for a spiritual Soul a person has to offer Salah minimum five times a day and the Jews they offer prayers three times a day which is mentioned in the Book of Daniel chapter number 6 verse number 10 we Muslims we have to offer Salah five times a day and it is a commandment of almighty God given to the Muslims and it is mentioned in several places in the Glorious Quran in Surah HUD chter number 11 vers number 114 Surah is chter number 17 vers 78 Surah T number 20 verse number 130 as well as in Surah room CH number 30 vers 17 and 18 these few verses they command the Muslims they have to offer Salah minimum five times a day and the five Salah that we Muslim offer are and is the first is the fer that is offered immediately after the break of dawn until just before Sunrise the next is a zar that can be offered after the Sun reaches the highest point from the decline of the sun until the the midpoint between noon and sunset the third is ass that can be offered immediately after the time of Zar until sunset the fourth is a m that is offered immediately after Sunset until the end of Twilight and the fifth is the ISA that is offered immediately after Twilight until just before midnight so these are the five Salah that we Muslim offer during the day and before we Muslims we offer Salah we remove our Footwear and it is the Commandment of almighty God given to Moses peace be upon him which is mentioned in the Glorious Quran in chter number 20 verse number 11 and 12 and when Moses he approached the valley of Tua he heard a voice oh Moses indeed I'm your lord so take off thy shoes of thy feet for thou art in the sacred Valley of Tua and a similar message is mentioned in the Bible it mentioned in the book of Exodus chapter number 3 verse number 5 draw KN hither take off thy shoes of thy feet for thou art on sacred grounds and a similar message is repeated in the book of Acts chapter number 7 verse number 3 put off thy shoes of thy feet for thou art on sacred grounds and we Muslims we are given the option of removing our Footwear or wearing our Footwear it is mentioned in Sur Abu da volume 1 book of Salah chapter number 240 Hadith number 652 the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that be different from the Jews for they for their prayers always remove their Footwear a similar message is mentioned Abu da volume 1 book of Salah chapter number 240 Hadith number 653 on the authority of his father said that his grandfather said that he had seen the prophet peace be upon Him offering Salah both with Footwear as well as without a footwear so we Muslims we can offer with our Footwear as well as without a footwear but when we offer with our Footwear we have to see to it that we clean the souls and why do we remove our Footwear or why when we offer with our Footwear we clean the souls because we are clean and hygienic people we want our place of worship to be clean"
