  "transcript": "and our beloved Prophet wasam said that this world for the believer is like a prison yeah and for the unbeliever it is like paradise so there was a poor Jew who approached haani the famous scholar who wrote the Shar of s bukari at his time when and when he was walking in the marketplace you know on his mule with his big inro so this poor Jew comes and catches his mule and says your Prophet said this that this world is a prison for the believer and for the unbeliever it's Paradise it's Paradise I'm a poor man my clothes are Tor tattered you're so rich you're having all the luxury how can you explain to me this Hadith of your Prophet so said that I know what awaits for a believer in the Hereafter Paradise that's right and if you compare Paradise to any human being living in this world he may be the richest man he may be the king but compared to the Life in Paradise which is million times better this is like a prison if he knows the hell is going to go in even it's the poorest man here yet this will be paradise compared to herea so if you understand this Hadith that life is a test then you will not strive to acquire wealth or power or stus you strive to get benefit in the that's it that's right"
