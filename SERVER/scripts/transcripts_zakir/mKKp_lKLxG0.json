  "transcript": "Dr zakya perhaps you could shed some light on the issue of why it is that the uh Muslims of the world are not United as regards to the fasting and the celebration of and as far as Muslims throughout the world being united in starting the month of Ramadan anding the month of Ramadan and celebrating Eid there are Scholars which are divided there's one group of Scholars who say that throughout the world you should follow the timings of Makkah if Makkah starts the month of Ramadan everyone throughout the world should follow Ramadan if Makkah ends Ramadan then everyone throughout the world should end Ramadan or if Makkah celebrates he then everyone else in the world should celebrate he and this is the view even of shik Bin Bas when a person asked him that he was a Saudi who traveled to Spain and he said that I have been fasting according to the calendar of Makkah and Makkah if they started fasting I started fasting in Spain according to Makkah and ended fasting according to Makkah and celebrity is according to Makkah is it right and Sh bin said there's no problem it is right because Makkah is a holy city but the other group of Scholars they disagree and they say that the timings should be according to the area there should be time zones as Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 185 that if you site the moon so those who site the moon those who witness the moon or those are present at home in the month they should fast and ab Prophet also said mentioned say bukari number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1 1907 and 1909 the prophet said that when you see the new moon of Ramadan then you start your fast and when you see the new moon of shaal then you end the fast so based on this the people of that area should see the moon and if that area is common it may be one city it may be a full country or a couple of countries together that is right truly and Sh says that you cannot have that all together you cannot have all the Muslims in the world fasting together and he also says that even according to Scientific evidence even according to astronomical evidence it's not possible that all the Muslims throughout the world can fast on one day because the moon cannot be cited all together on one day they has to be difference so it's illogical to say that we should fast all together and the Beloved Prophet malli wasallam said it's mentioned in thi book of fasting number 697 that the fast is when you all fast and the breaking of fast is when you all break the Fast and the day of sacrifice is an all the people sacrifice so as long as people of that area they fast it is sufficient that is fasting and when people of that area that locality that city or country if they break the fast then break the fast because as we see that there is no difference of opinion as far as the timings of sun is concerned as far as starting of the each day as far as when the day starts and the day ends there's no difference of opinion it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah bakar chapter number two verse number 187 it says that eat and drink until the white thread of dawn is distinguished from the black thread and fast till the night falls until the sun sets so here in E part of the world the sun sets earlier that does not mean because in Malaysia the sun sets earlier in Bombay I will end my fast earlier so that mean the people in Mak also should end it early and if in the the Western World the sun sets a bit late I'll also end my fast late there unanimous agreement throughout the world that you have to follow the timing of the sun according to your local timing if the sun sets in your area then you stop fasting and you can eat if the dawn breaks in your area then you stop eating and you start fasting there's no difference opinion so as we follow the sun we should even follow the moon the same way imagine if we celebrate Eid if the new moon of shaah is cited in Makkah and you celebrate Eid maybe in America in the west the moon may have been SED one day earlier that means they have to celebrate e one day later and in Pakistan or India the new moon will be SED one or two days later so does it mean that they have to celebrate Eid in the month of Raman and imagine those people if they for Makkah timing they'll have to fast even on the day of Eid in America where the moon maybe it seen Monday earlier that mean they will have to fast on the day of Eid which is Haram Prophet said you cannot fast on the day of ID so here we realize that we have to follow the same rule as we follow for the timings of the sun otherwise there'll be a big chaos and it will not be practically possible and many people who say that you know how is it possible that you know Muslims in different parts of the world have we on different days it's normal we are used to having different timings in the Sun the morning time when it's daytime in India it is night time in America we don't say how is it night time there and daytime here when it's night time here it's daytime there we don't say oh what a stupid thing that people are un united because that's the way it is the timings of the sun differ and the timings of the Sun in the full world it differs by 24 hours 0 minute to 24 hours it depends upon which longitude is your area if it is the same longitude the timing would be same and the world is divided to 360° 360 longitudes each longitude it differs by 4 minutes so if you travel by 15 longitudes then there'll be difference of one so 360 mtip 4 comes to 1,440 minutes that's equal to one full day so the world is divided into time zones now just for the betterment for ease what we do that though India has got more than 15 Dees longitude yet the time is coming they take a center point and they say whether it's Bombay or Gujarat one end of India or whether it's Asam the other end of India the breath yet they follow the same timing they take the central time but in countries like USA the width is much more it is more than 30° the timing defer than more than 2 hours but they have approximately four time zones the time in Los Angeles is 2 hours earlier than the time in New York so it differs so there it will be imagined person form from New York to Los Angeles and he wonders that they're there two hours earlier but this is how the time zon are divided and people are living with it the same way people fail to realize that as far as scientific evidence for moon is concerned the new moon can differ by one or two days it is scientific it's not possible that the new moon can occur throughout the world on the same day it's not possible it is unscientific and I had just spoken to scientist who was specialized in the field of astronomy just London had been there and he told me that one or two days is common sometimes it can even be a difference of three days sighting the moon one part of the world to the other part of the world it can be a different even of three days and once in a blue moon it can even go up to 4 days it may happen at don't once thousand years I don't know he gave some calculation which I understand but normally differing by one or two days is common it is scientific the new moon cannot be cited on the same day throughout the world how the Sun cannot rise on the same day throughout the world so here people fail to realize that celebrating same day throughout the world will be unscientific and it will be un Islamic also because when you have to have two witnesses to site only when two Witnesses site as the Beloved Prophet said can the people of the area celebrate what we can have for convenience people in a few cities then one area of setting the moon or one full country can have one common area of sighting the moon or a couple of countries if they close and fall in the same area they can have but throughout the world it's not possible and it is not even scientific so agree with and when they say that it's not possible to have cting of moon through the world on the same day"
