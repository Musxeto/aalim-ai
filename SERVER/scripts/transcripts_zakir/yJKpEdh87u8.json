  "title": "Fasting on the Day of Arafah Expiates the Sins of Previous Year and Next Year... Fariq Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum my name is sayad ashfaq ahmad i am from gulbarga karnataka india i am studying mbbs in bangalore fasting on the day of arafah expiates the sins of the previous year and the coming year suppose if a person fasts and does sins intentionally in the upcoming year because he knows that my sins for the upcoming year are forgiven will those sins also be forgiven or only the sins which are made by mistake allah abdullah prophet muhammad peace be upon him said it is mentioned in sahih muslim volume 3 hadees number 2747 that the one who fasts on the day of arfa it is an expiation for the previous year since as well as the coming year since so fasting on the day of arafah is an expiation for the sins and the fasting on this day of arafah it is meant only for those people who are not performing hajj and the scholars they say that the expiation of the sins it refers to the minor sins whereas the major sins they require sincere repentance from allah for that particular sin the minor sins they can get washed away while doing wudhu between the two salah between jummah and jummah fasting on the day of arafah etc but the major sins they require sincere repentance from allah now if a person plans that because allah subhanahu ta'ala will forgive my sins of the upcoming year i will commit since throughout the year then there are high chances that allah subhanahu ta'ala he will not forgive his sins because he's planning it and he's doing these sins intentionally thinking that allah he will forgive his sins he's taking it for granted so there are high chances that his sins they will not be forgiven it refers to those sins that are done by mistake or even those sins that may be done intentionally but a person does not do it with the intention of committing the sins because allah subhana wa tala will forgive him and taking it for granted so we should never take it for granted and no one can give guarantee that his fast is accepted by allah so if we do not know whether our fast is accepted or no how will we know whether our sins are forgiven so no one knows whether it's fast is acceptable in the sight of allah and hence he will not know whether his sins are forgiven or not so we should never plan and do it in such a way that in the upcoming year because our sins are going to be forgiven we'll commit as many sins as possible"
