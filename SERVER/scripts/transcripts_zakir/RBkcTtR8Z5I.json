  "transcript": "some of the critics they say that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him knows billah he attributed the Quran to almighty God because he wanted to unite the Arabs it's known as the Arab Unity and Liberation Theory the various theories propounded by the critics and orientalists there is not a single verse in the Quran which singles out and speaks exclusively of the Arab Unity not a single verse exclusively talking about the unity or the liberation of the Arabs the Quran has the concept of ummah that's the nation of the Holy mankind and the criteria for any human being to be superior to any other human being it's not caste it's not color it's not wealth it's not sex but it is taqwa and this is mentioned in the Quran in Suraj chapter number 49 verse number 13 of Allah says kind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you Indonesians and tribes so that you may recognize one another not that you may despise one another and the most honored in the sight of Allah is the person who has taqwa the criteria for judgment in the sight of Allah it's not cast color creed sex wealth but it is God Consciousness it's piety it's righteousness there are many verses in the Quran in order to stand for truthfulness it even says you can do that even if you have to go against royalties they can be dispute between the father and son with a husband and wife even better relatives if you're a fight for the truth Allah says in the Quran chapter number 9 verse number 24. say whether it be for others foreign s all your brothers or your spouses all relatives the business in which you deal the house in which you live Allah says that if you love all these eight things your fathers your sons your brothers your spouses your relatives the businesses which you deal those in which you live the wealthy ever must Allah continues if you love all these things and doing Jihad striving away of Allah Allah says wait until Allah brings his decision to you until Allah brings his destruction to you and Allah guides not the fastest people so if the prophet wanted Unity amongst the Arabs why did he mention such a verse in the Quran strongly and be not divided so here the prophet is talking about the unity of the Believers he's not talking about the unity of the Arabs and if you wanted to unite the Arabs he could have easily taken the leadership and become the leader and the king and United Arabs easily there are verses in the Quran which are contrary to this Theory it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter 3 verse number 43 it says and behold the angel said oh Mary in Allah that Allah has chosen thee and purified thee and purified thee above the woman of all Nations imagine the Quran says that Mary the mother of Jesus peace be upon him who was a Jewish she is chosen as the woman above all the women in the world if we wanted Unity among the Arabs he could have chosen his mother our wife or his daughter any Arab woman as the woman above all the nations but he goes out of the way to say Mother Mary who was the mother of Jesus peace be upon Him is the woman chosen above the woman of all Nations and the reason is it's immediately mentioned the next verse in Surah Imran chapter 3 verse 45. that it is nothing but an inspiration from almighty God he has no choice he has no choice to agree or disagree because this is from Allah so surely there are various other verses in the Quran several times including Surah chapter 2 47 which says that don't you remember the favors which we have bestowed on the children of Israel on money Israel so all these verses of the Quran if Prophet Muhammad knows billah he was the author of the Quran God forbid then why should he mentioned"
