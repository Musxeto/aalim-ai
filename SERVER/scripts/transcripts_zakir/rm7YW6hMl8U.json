  "title": "How do we Know our Repentance is Accepted by Allah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "how do we know what are the indications and how do we know whether repentance is accepted what are the indications the indication as far as for repentance to be acceptable number one is that you do not commit the same sin again and your good deeds keep on increasing and a bad deed keeps on decreasing this is number one sign that allah has accepted the repentance number two that you have the fear of allah number three is that you regret to allah and you keep on asking his forgiveness number four is that you're humble and you always address him in humility so these are the four signs which show that your repentance has been accepted by lasalla the signs of non-acceptance of the tawbah repentance is deficiency in the person's repentance and he remembers the pleasures of the sins and he gets preoccupied and continuing the sin that's number one number two he's so sure that the dependence will be accepted as though he has got immunity and he's immune to it and surely he'll be forgiven that's number two number three is that his eyes don't cry and his heart is hardened number four there's no increase in the good activities that he's doing no increase in the good deeds and i believe what prophet muhammad said it's mentioned in say muslim one number four in the book of repentance hadith number 6621 that if the people do not commit any sins allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will wipe them out and replace with the people who commit sin and who ask for forgiveness so that allah can forgive them now here if you understand this hadith it will look very odd that does allah want us to listen if you don't do sin allah will remove you what it means that there are some people who may do sin and who may ask for forgiveness and repent and make them closer to allah and the good deed will increase and these people go to jannah on the other hand some people do good deed and they have a conceit they're so proud of themselves and that will take them to the hell fire so allah says that if there's a group of people who don't do sin allah will replace them with the people who do sin so that they will ask for forgiveness and allah will forgive them that means you should have humility so these are the signs for not acceptance of faith continue to accept repentance on october dr zakiyah there is another question which i have which is just to end this particular session this particular show and that is is there any limitation to the sins that allah can accept our tawba for as far as allah's forgiveness is concerned at most is concerned every surah every chapter of the glorious quran it begins with the beautiful in formula name of allah most gracious most merciful every surah except for chapter number 9 and allah's mother says in the quran in surah chapter 39 verse 53 that all my servants who have transgressed against their souls despair not the mercy of allah for allah can forgive all sins allah is of forgiving and most merciful yeah allah says that whatever your sin may be allah he can forgive any of your sins as long as you repent if you repent the right way and you fast forgiveness allah will inshallah forgive you and a beloved partner said it's mentioned say hadith hadith number 4251 the beloved prophet said that every son of adam he commits sin and the best is the person who repents if you commit sin no problem but if you repent then you're the best person repentance is very important express hadith hadith number three five four zero your beloved prophet said that allah says o son of adam you may do any sin and i'll forgive all your sins even if your sins reach to the clouds in the sky i will forgive them you ask me for mercy and i will forgive you it's for the mission hadith of say muslim hadith number 6246 with the beloved prophet muslim said that allah says even if you do sin day and night and ask for forgiveness i will forgive you you ask me from pardon and i will forgive you it's mentioned say bihari number eight hadith number five nine nine nine there were some prisoners of war who were released mainly children and women and one lady she searches for a son and she cannot find a son the moment she sees any child she best feeds the child then another child she sees she breastfeed the child finally she finds her own child so the prophet asked the sahabas that when this woman finds her son even if he has done a sin then will she throw the sun in the fire they said no wa allah loves his servants even if they commit sin more than the lady loves the child so based on this realize allah is willing to forgive any of your sin as long as repent and just the last quotation allah says in the quran and surah nisa chapter number 4 verse num 48 that if allah subhanahu ta'ala pleases he can forgive any sin but the sin of shirk he'll never forgive here it means that if a person does shirk and repents before he dies before the death rattle inshallah allah will forgive even the son of sheikh if he repents and comes to the straight path and believes in one allah believes in tahit allah will even forgive him the son of shirk which is the biggest sin but if he dies as a mushrik after he dies allah says here that he will not forgive the sin of any other sin if he wishes he may forgive but the sin of sheikh he'll never forgive sheikh is the biggest sin so from here we come to know that allah is the most merciful and willing to forgive the sins of his servants"
