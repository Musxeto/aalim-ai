  "transcript": "hello good evening sir i'm sadia akram i'm a first year student of business management studies my question is that you said that muslim girls are prohibited the professions of acting modeling and dancing does the same apply for men muslim men this is the question that i said that profession would exhibit the body like dancing like modeling film acting is it private for men also in these cases of film acting modeling if it goes against the quran and sharia it is prohibited for example a muslim man you know models for some suit as long as there's nothing haram in that ad it's permitted if something haram if she models for black dog whiskey you know or champagne or alcohol it's haram similarly if he's acting if an acting is showing that he's a non-muslim doing idol worship haram you know many of the muslim actors they behave like non-muslim and they do shirk haram let them be anyone let them be the best actor in the world his acting will take him to jahannam his acting will take him to jannam but he's acting and doing a good role not running after women you know running around trees if all this nonsense is the hijab is broken it's haram otherwise simple thing without any haram activity not breaking the hijab following the quran and sunnah making films which are islamic which will get a person closer towards jannah to others it's perfectly fine so as long as what they are doing acting and modeling if it comes within the purview of the islamic sharia it's permitted other than hope that answers the question thank you you"
