  "transcript": "so i am having a question this question is being framed by my professor i am a student of first year computer science and my sir is teaching me physics his name is rajiv bhatt and i am from ng acharya dk marathi college chimbu he is convinced by all the i mean to say what what misconceptions regarding islam was there he's accepted that it is a misconception so he is not only convinced by his last point that is ruthlessly killing off a good during bhakra if you heard your question correctly your prophet wants to know that can we have non-veg from the hindu scripture that's the question i mean to say the ruthless killing of a goat the ruthless he believes that you are killing a goat directly from the slowly slowly from the from the neck brother asked the question why ruthlessly killing he agrees with killing of the goat but why ruthless killing is this question yeah fine so he's convinced that you can have non-veg but he's asking why do the muslims they torture the animal before killing yeah there's one jataka of attack the animal dies why is it slowly torturing the other discussion a similar discussion going on between a sikh and a muslim and the sacred the same question you muslims you are merciless you are ruthless you all kill the animals slowly and torture the animal to death we seek one jatka of attack and the animal dies so the muslim replied no we muslims we are attacked from the front we are masho you think you are a coward you are boswill you attack from behind anyway this is not the real reason why we muslim ruzabiha this was his wisdom his igma this is not the real reason why we muslim to zabiyah the reason we muslim to zabihah that islam is slaughtering is when we do zabiya we cut the throat and the vessels of the neck and the windpipe without damaging the spinal cord because if the spinal cord is damaged then there'll be cardiac arrest and the nerve going to the heart will be severed and the blood will immediately stagnate now when we cut the throat and the windpipe and the vessel of the neck without damaging spinal cord the heart is yet pumping and majority of the blood it flows out of the body today science tells us that blood is a very good media of germs and bacteria so we muslims be hygienic we want to let the blood flow out of the body when the blood flows out of the body even the toxins and the germs and the bacteria that contained in the blood flows out of the body there are less chances of having diseases when we have that meat furthermore when we cut the throat and the windpipe and the vessel of the neck the nerve which is responsible for feeling of the pain going to the brain is also severe so the animal does not feel pain the animal kicks and breathes it is due to the gush of the flow of the blood outside the body the kicking and rivering is not due to pain it is due to the muscle contraction and relaxation so the animal dies a peaceful death in the method of stunning very often the animal dies a painful death after us so the islamic method of slaughtering is far more humane and furthermore if you slaughter the animal by the islamic zabiya method the mutton and the meat remains fresh for a longer time because it does not have blood hope that answers the question you"
