  "title": "Many Muslims are Satisfied with Giving Outward Respect to the Glorious Quran - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Muslims we give respect to the Quran alhamdulillah but many of us they go beyond the limit they give so much respect that they forget for what purpose the Quran was revealed you know we keep the Quran on the topmost Shelf alhamdulillah they keep it so much on top that difficult to reach and the Quran catches dust you the Quran is a book of guidance it's a guide book you know suppose if you are studying the guide book is normally at a shelf which is reachable you know it's kept at a shelf which you can reach the easiest you won't keep it on top very difficult I take a stool to get it down so Quran is a book which should be referred every day it should be handy and many of us Muslims you know we tie the Quran in a pure silk cloth and then we tie not on it suppose if you want to read the Quran you start thinking okay 5 minutes to open the Quran 5 minutes again to tie the Quran 10 minutes the thought of you opening the Quran and again tying it will be a deterrent and if you have 10 minutes if you have 10 minutes time you know to open the Quran close 10 minutes so better not read the Quran see we have to respect the Quran but the main respect is in the heart I'm not against keeping the Quran on top don't get me wrong but see to it that it is accessible it's easily available for guidance you know many of us Muslims before touching the Quran we scrutinize a thousand things as though it's an RDX bomb Quran wearing shoes can I touch the Quran can I read the Quran while standing can I read it in the office all these things they prevent you from reading the Quran we scrutinize the Quran as though it's an RDX bomb going to explode the Quran is a book of guidance that's the reason many of us Indians object to know the Arabs Mah the way they treat the Quran they give respect but as though it's a guide it's available we Muslims give it on topmost shelf you know in India it's catching dust and rarely will we find people when they have 5 minutes 10 minutes they refer to the Quran that is you know we have to have that frame of mind and then we have to see 10 things we can't be in shoes we can't stand and we have to have a hat over your head etc etc see many things are good but don't make life so difficult that the main purpose of the Quran is for guidance he defeated it and very often if you go to the gulf countries you know many of the Arabs and they come for Salah a few minutes before you find them taking the Quran and reading in India rarely will you find find that and suppose someone is Reading in the first row and someone takes the Quran reads in the second row there'll be a person who object how can you read the Quran in the second row the back is facing the Quran Haram and if you have to sit in the mosque and suppose at your home or in the mosque if by mistake if you happen to read the Quran while you're back facing K you'll get F Haram you know you can't read the Quran with your back facing the back faing the Caba I've been to Haram several times in Makkah several times you know they have this Quran they have the H classes you know and the student sit in rul many of the backs face the Quran of the other student who carrying Quran in the hand and many of time the teacher is facing the Caba and the students back facing the Caba so where do they get this from which was of the Quran which Hadith I don't know so we have to love the Quran we have to respect but we have to know that the main reason the Quran was revealed was for hi was for guidance once there was a Indian Imam very good Kari he went to Saudi Arabia and because he was famous it was M time so they told the kar they told the Imam IM you lead the Salah so the Indian Imam he goes and he leads the Salah from M he decides and he finishes the Salah and when he finishes the Salah one Saudi Smiles at him so then he asks that what's the problem was there any problem in makat so the Saudi told him no Kat was wonderful I was only wondering that when you recited Surah Yu you put yuam in the well but before you complete the Salah why didn't you get him out of the well this anecdote would be understood only by those people who read the Quran with understanding those who don't read the Quran with understanding will not be able to understand this anecdote the Saudi was telling him if you read Sur yusu it speaks about the story ofam that how he was betrayed by his brothers and his brother put him in the well and later Caravan comes and yam has got out of the well so the Saudi tells him that you recited very well but in your Salah you put yam in the well but at least before ending the Salah you should have bought him out of the well that means we start the Surah from anywhere and we end it anywhere without realizing have we completed the meaning or not we Muslims we have several excuses for not reading the Quran with understanding and we always give excuses for not reading we have the time to read books volumes memorize them but the Glorious Quran which is the last and final Revelation Allah subhana wa taala unfortunately we don't take out time to read the message of our cre Allah subhana wa ta'ala"
