  "transcript": "ask a question that he is a student of comparative religion alhamdulillah may Allah reward you he say that if you keep away from this labels like head gear and beard it helps you to spread Islam more according to you everyone has a right to the opinion brother fortunately I happen to be in this field I'm not aware how much dawa you do but alhamdulillah I travel throughout the world this head gear doesn't come in my way at all give me one example if you a d that the head gear comes in between your way if you are not a d if you're are materialistic ah if a non-muslim comes to know I'm a Muslim he will not come to my shop if you are a materialistic person temporarily you may think it's a loss but you say you're a student of compartive religion you live with J Etc brother I'm a fulltime Dy alhamdulillah give me one example in your experience in which the Headway will come in your way alhamdulillah it helps me it helps me break the barriers see the thing is that there may be situation in which you may not know how to handle it so Quran says in Surah n 16:43 that if you do not possess the knowledge ask of those who possess the knowledge go to an expert and he will show you how to solve the problem don't take a decision which is wrong yes brother what's the problem I'll solve it see actually you are you are a full-time Dy we are not a full-time Dy we are doing a business along with that I would like to do this work when I'm sitting in my office I talk to my employee people also I talk to them alhamdulillah at least one or two I could make them even convinced but the thing is that what I have found even gutis and even those people when they see you see my colleague one colleague is having a beard they don't approach him when they don't bring him closer but when I go to them and I talk to them I find that people are listening to me so that's what I found it is more easier for me to spread it brother has given an example that he has his colleagues and he's not a fulltime D like me now he's changed first he said a compartive religion now he say he's not a fulltime d no one is stopping you from being a fulltime it's the best profession better than a medical doctor also I was a medical doctor I left my profession for a better profession Quran says in 41 verse number 33 it says who is better in speech than one who invites the people to the way of their lord Works righteousness and says I'm the first to bow my will to Allah subhana wa ta'ala the best profession is a profession of d brother before I became a full-time Li I was a student in a medical college and majority of my colleagues were non-muslims cutter very strong against the Muslim and yet they may be allergic to a person having a beard wearing a cap but alhamdulillah they love me because I use hikma Quran says you know how to do da in 16 125 invite all to the way of th Lord with Will them and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best most gracious you have to use your hikma going to Da and if you use your hikma the cap and the beard can never come in your way you can tell your non-muslim friend that you know I have come to know of a Muslim alhamdulillah who has a beard tell me you know there's a young boy you know young boy by the name of Zak he says he can speak to non Muslim he's very comfortable he wears a cap he Sports a beard he's comfortable you can give my cassettes if I don't have the time to meet them personally you can give the cassette it does wonders I don't live with the non-muslim alhamdulillah but these cassettes they have done wonders you are talking about convincing one person alhamdulillah by Allah's Grace hundreds and thousands have been convinced by the talks alhamdulillah so it is only your misconception it's your inferiority complex that if you say Islam is the best religion why are you afraid to identify yourself as Muslim I'll give you an example there's elderly gentleman who's very old who's very feeble who's saying I have got the water secret to strength if you drink this water you'll live 100 years more you will be a strong man and this old man one foot is in the grave he wants to sell his bottle of water for 100 rupees will anyone buy I have got a bottle of water costing 100 rupees if you drink this you will live for 100 years more you'll become the strongest man in the world will you believe in him will you believe in him yes or no why the person one foot is in the grave if the water can give him strength why does he drink it himself so if you are spreading Islam and you're afraid to call yourself Muslims how come you're following the best religion you are a hypocrite I'm sorry to say if you're afraid to call yourself a Muslim and you say Islam is the best religion that means you're a hypocrite will any logical person buy the water of an old man whose one foot is in the grave and who says that this water if you drink you will live for 100 Years you'll be the strongest man it's hypocrisy alhamdulillah even we meet non-muslims and it does wonder when I pass the Customs the non-muslims and they see alhamdulillah they respect me oh you're the same man who comes on the cable TV they give me red carpet treatment they know I'm spreading Islam people may not know about the other Muslims who keep a beard and a cap but they know me very well they respect me I don't have to bribe I don't have to bribe alhamdulillah they respect me Allah open up the pathways if you're apologetic if you have infity complex if there's something wrong in your heart that means you're agreeing with a non-muslim that those who keep a beard they are wrong what do you have to do you start growing a beard and tell your non-muslim friend see previously used to respect me because I didn't have a beard you didn't like the people who had a beard from today I'm going to start growing up inshallah inshallah and then you tell them that see brother I'm the same I'm the same man I'm the same man who has a beard and wear a cap now has my nature changed and you don't change your nature improve alhamdulillah and you give them an example see brother you know you have a misconception that the beard and the cap the people wearing a beard and a cap they are wrong people they are G they not see I've lived with you for so many years in this few weeks inshallah from now when you support a beard you will tell your non-muslim friend I have a beard I'm wearing a cap has my nature changed alhamdulillah it will open up your Pathways and you'll be able to do more da hope that answer the question"
