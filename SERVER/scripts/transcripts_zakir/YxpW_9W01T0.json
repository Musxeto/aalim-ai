  "title": "Why are the Muslims not Allowed to Sing Vande Maataram? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "and she is a student her question is why are the Muslims not allowed to sing Vande mataram this is the question that why are Muslims not allowed to say Vande mataram before I give the answer this is a common question why are Muslims not allowed to say Vande mataram which was even asked in the press conference beginning of the conference by the Press media before answering that I would like to tell you that even the Hindus even they should not say Vande mataram because if you know the song written by pumpkin means I bow down to my motherland one day mataram it occurs thrive in the full song and as I mentioned earlier according to the Veda it's clearly mentioned India chapter number 32 verse number three and upanishad chapter number 4 number 19 of that God there is no prathima there is no image there is no photograph there is no picture there is no portrait there is no sculpture there is no Idol so where is the question of worshiping the land so any Hindu who has knowledge of his Veda will never agree with Vande mataram if he does not know scripture he may say it but if we know scriptures well there are three lines three stanzas whenever it says Vande mataram I bow down I worship to my motherland he is going against his Veda as far as the Muslims are concerned there are 12 lines which again is the Quran and the say Hadith thrive it says that I bow down to remember the land which is prohibited in Islam we only bow to our great Allah we Muslims as long as the law of the land does not go against the law of the Creator we are for the country we love the country [Music] we want to support the country we want to upbring the country if required for the truth we are ready to die for the country but we are not ready to worship the country because we worship only Allah he alone requires to be worshiped and this land who is the creator of this land Allah almighty God so why should we worship the creation worship the Creator not the creation and furthermore there are stanzas in Vande mataram talking about Divine giving attributes talking about Lakshmi talking about Durga all these things they go against the concept of the Quran that's the reason and if you go back to history this became a political issue just a couple of years back you know it was written in 1800 and 60s or 70s it was more of a political motif and today they want to make a political gimmick not realizing it is going against their own religion this song one day mataram is going against their own religion so my advice is not only Muslims my advice to the Hindus is that even you don't say Vande mataram [Applause]"
