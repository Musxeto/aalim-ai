  "transcript": "next question from noshad ahmad assalamualaikum sir is using credit card halal if you are talking about the conventional credit card where where the bank gives you permission that you can utilize x amount of money depending upon your credit card that is bronze level silver level gold level depending upon the amount some give you two thousand dollars some give ten thousand dollars some give forty thousand dollars depending upon the level and this money that you utilize you have to give within one or two months and if you give that then there is no interest if you give above that then there is an exorbitant interest which goes to up to maybe three percent a month that is 36 anywhere from two to three percent a month that is 24 to 36 percent a year which is exorbitant and i know there are some scholars who say that if you are using a credit card as long as you see to it you pay within the stipulated time within the one month or two month frame and no interest that's permitted i disagree with it it is totally haram the moment you take a credit card from a conventional bank you are signing a document saying that if you do not pay it in time you will give rabbah signing a document that you will pay reprisal war against you so even using a credit card with the intention that you will not take longer than the time permitted i know majority of the muslims living in western countries in america and european countries in uk have a credit card from a conventional bank majority unfortunately i know there are scholars of the western country that need permission it is 100 percent totally haram all the major scholars whether it be what i mean whether it be sheikh bin mas majority have said even having a credit card of conventional bank is haram because you are signing and who can give guarantee that you'll always pay on time you're a human being you can make a mistake if once also you forget to pay on time it is haram allan is a full vegetable is too even if you pay on time regularly only signing a document is haram so using a credit card of a conventional bank it's totally haram i'm aware there are some scholars that have been permission i disagree with them what you can do is you can have a credit card from islamic bank if it's islamic bank you can have a credit card the other what you can do is have a debit card debit card means the money is already in your account that you're not signing a document saying that you pay interest so debit card in a conventional bank is permitted credit card in a conventional bank as haram however credit card and islamic bank is permitted because it works on the islamic principles on the sharia basis there is no report involved in this so the best option is have a credit card islamic bank the second option is have a debit card in a conventional bank which does not attract any interest but credit card in a conventional bank of haram it's a major sin it is equivalent to doing zina with your mother that's what a prophet said it is clearly mentioned in muslim hadith number 2259 that there are 73 levels of riba the lowest level is doing dinner with your mother and it's clearly mentioned in the quran in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 270 279 that if you give up not the demands of rabbi take notice of a war from allah and ever soul so request all the muslims in any part of the world if you have a credit card from any of the conventional bank please today itself if not today tomorrow please discontinue it open an islamic bank if you don't have islamic bank convert it into a debit card debit card is permissible when there is no reminder hope the answer the question"
