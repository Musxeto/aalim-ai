  "transcript": "now dr zakir on to the second category of people we're talking about exemptions can you list or mention all of the different categories of people that are exempted from fasting during the month of ramadan there are in total according to me 13 categories of people who are exempted from fasting the first is if the person is unbeliever if is a non-muslim number two if he or she is a minor number three if the person is insane number four if it's a lady and she is menstruating she she's not fast number five if she has her post-natal bleeding she's exempted from fasting number six if she's pregnant then she's exempted number seven if she's breastfeeding she's exempted number eight if the person is ill or sick he or she is exempted number nine if the person is disabled number 10 that if the person is very elderly has reached a very old age number 11 if the person is traveling number 12 if the person is taking part in jihad or a fight in the cause of allah and number 13 under compulsion under compulsion if someone forces and if the person doesn't fast he or she is exempted these are in short the 13 categories in which a person is exempted from fasting excellent now i think we need to discuss each category on its own merits dr zakir do all of the people that you've mentioned in the exempted categories have to make up their fast later on out of the 13 categories which i mentioned the first three categories they don't have to make up their fast later on that is a non-muslim that's a person who is a minor and a person who is insane out of the remaining 10 categories two categories a person who is disabled for long and a person who is very elderly these two people also don't have to make up for their fast but they have to pay ransom the feeding of a poor person for every fast they missed as far as the other eight categories are concerned the moment the condition in which they are it gets reversed then they have to make up for the fastest they missed for example in their categories are the menstruating lady moment she finishes the menstruation then she should make up for a fast as soon as possible before the next ramadan a woman who is in the period of personal bleeding the moment it gets over he has to fast if a lady is pregnant the moment the pregnancy gets over and the post natal bidding gets over then she has to fast if a lady the fourth category if she's breastfeeding after the breastfeeding is over then she has to fast or a person is sick the moment he gets healthy he or she has to fast similarly a person who's travelling moment he finishes travelling he has to fast and a person who's taking part in jihad fighting in the cause of allah moment the fight gets over here she has to fast similarly a person who's in compulsion and is not fasting the moment the compulsion is removed he or she has to fast but naturally all these have to be done before the next ramadan"
