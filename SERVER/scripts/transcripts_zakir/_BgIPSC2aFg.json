  "transcript": "the next question i am from india himachal pradesh my name is muhammad irfan and i'm studying right now can allah subhanahu ta'ala forgive a non-muslim who died committing shirk but all his life he did good deeds i would like to give you an example when you appear for the 10th grade examination you have to pass in certain subjects for example you have to pass in four subjects english science maths and history if you fail in any one of these four subjects you will not pass the tenth grade even if you get hundred out of hundred in three subjects but in one subject you fail you will not pass in the tenth grade so to pass the tenth grade you need to minimum pass in four subjects allah subhana wa tala says in the glorious quran chapter 123 verse number one two three by time in verily man is in a state of loss except for those who believe solihard and righteous deeds what was exhort people towards truth that is doing dawah whatever i saw this suburb exhort people towards patience and perseverance so for a person to enter jannah there are minimum four criteria that are required the first is iman that is belief the second is amino solid that is righteous deeds the third is exhorting people towards truth that is doing dhawa the fourth is exalting people towards patience and perseverance so minimum four criteria are required for a person to enter jannah if anyone is missing under normal circumstances a person he will not enter jannah you may offer salah five times a day you may give zakah but if you do not do dawah under normal circumstances you will not enter jannah if allah subhanahu ta'ala wants to forgive you it is allah's prerogative as allah subhana wa tala says in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse and 48 and surah nisa chapter number 4 verse 116 allah that if allah pleases he may forgive any sin but the sin of shirk he will never forgive so the biggest thing in islam is associating partners with allah now there are many people who say that you know non-muslims they do so many good deeds they do so many righteous deeds so why will allah not forgive them the non-muslims they do righteous deeds they do good deeds for example the non-muslims they give charity even though they may give a million dollars in charity that is only one part of the various righteous deeds the most important is recognizing your creator allah if you cannot recognize your creator allah subhanahu wa what is the point of being good to his creation allah subhana wa tala he has given us human beings so much the house the shelter that we live in the food if you do not get food for a few days for a month you will die if you do not get water for a few days you will die how many of us have thanked allah subhana tala for the food for the water if you do not get air for half an hour for one hour you will die how many of us have thanked allah for all of these blessings so the non-muslims even though they may do certain good deeds for example charity etc being good to others being good to their neighbors the most important thing is recognizing your creator allah subhana wa tala being grateful to him being thankful to him and the most important among the righteous deeds is offering salah so you have to believe in one god alone and you cannot associate partners with allah"
