  "transcript": "the concept of God in Christianity before I discuss the concept of God in Christianity I would like to make a few points clear Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messenger of God We Believe believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern Christians today do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind and lepos with God's permission the Christians and the Muslims we are going together but one may ask then where is The Parting of way The Parting of way is that most of thean Christians believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was almighty God and he claimed Divinity in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or he say worship me that if any Christian can point out a single unequivocal statement from any wasse of the Bible which is said by Jesus Christ peace be upon himself where he says that I I am God or where he says worship me I zakin Nik am ready to accept Christianity Today I not speaking on behalf of my other Muslim brothers because this is my field of comparative religion I'm ready to put my head on the guillotine if any Christian can point out from any version of the Bible a single unequivocal verse in the Bible a single unambigous verse in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself say that I am God or where he says worship me I'm ready to accept Christianity in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon him said it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number 5 verse number I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God is a Muslim Jesus Christ peace be upon Him according to the Bible you as a Muslim he submitted a will to God he never claimed Divinity and he clearly mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 17 to 20 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said think not that I I have come to destroy the law of the prophets I have come not to destroy but to fulfill and until the Heaven and the Earth pass away not one jot or tit will pass away from the law until all be fulfilled and whosoever shall break one of the least Commandments and teach men should do so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall keep the Commandments and teach the same will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees in no way shall you enter the kingdom of Heaven this is a Verbatim quotation from the King James version Gospel of Matthew chapter number 5 verse number 7 to2 that means if you want to go to paradise you have to be better than the Jews and you have to follow all the Commandments what is mentioned in the Old Testament so all what I said in the Old Testament that God is one you don't have to make images have to be followed by the Christians if they want to go to heaven Jesus Christ peace be upon him never claimed Divinity in fact he said it's mentioned the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 24 he says the words that you hear are not mine but my fathers who have sent me it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 17 verse number three Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says this is life eternal so that you may know one true God and Jesus Christ who thou has sent it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 19: 16 and 17 once a man approaches Jesus Christ peace be upon him and tells him good Master what good things should I do so that I will enter eternal life so that I'll go to to Paradise so Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says why thou callest me good there's only one good that is almighty God and if thou want to enter eternal life you keep the Commandments he never said that you believe that I died on the cross for your sins he never said that you believe I'm God I'll go to paradise if you want to enter eternal life if you want to go to paradise you keep the Commandments clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 e men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you are witnessed to it a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you witness to it when Jesus Christ PE be born last that which is the first of the Commandment he repeated worb him what was said by Moses peace be upon him it's mentioned in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 where Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says it's the Hebrew quotation which means here Israel the Lord our God is one Lord so if you read the Bible you should understand the concept of God in Christianity which will help you increase the Brotherhood between the Christians the Muslims the Hindus and the Jews"
