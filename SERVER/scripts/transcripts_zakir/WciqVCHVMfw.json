  "transcript": "I consider this my a great Ramadan gift the opportunity of seeing you in Flesh and Blood after 15 years of watching so many of your shows on YouTube so real owner sir and I wish you a a great stay in musket and a very successful and enjoyable stay and success in your mission here uh so I have a small clarification I need from you what's your good name brother my name is pradeep my name is pradeep I'm a marketing professional working in Oman and Muscat yeah so my question is I just want a clarification uh this is something that's been uh percolating in my mind uh I've heard you say that Islam is about submitting to his will sorry Islam is about submitting to God's will correct God sorry God's will God's will yes yes so in that context this whole concept of offering Dua a prayer supplication to God asking him for something whether it's blessings or good health or whatever isn't that strictly speaking against the concept of submitting to his will because if you have submitted to his will then he decides and you accept whatever it and keep going but once you're asking him that is not just in Islam in any faith even even as a Hindu when I feel that when asking God for something it is in a way it is I'm not really completely submitted myself to it I just want your clarification on this matter people asked a very good question thank you brother brother pradeep is one of the uh one of uh one of my proof that I said in my lecture that most of the non-muslims here my talk they love me I'd like to thank you for the pradeep thank you thank you so much do you be watching me for 15 years and he's happy to see me live and he asked a question that Islam means submitting your will and a Muslim is a person who submits his will to Allah so his question is that when we ask Dua from Allah so isn't it contradictory that we are going against his will and the answer is no brother submitting the will means Allah has given you certain guidelines few do's and don'ts everything else is optional you know people think oh Islam is very strict thousands of do's and thousands of don'ts no no only few do's and few don'ts for this you should live in tahit among the major do's and don'ts there is a book called written by imama Dhabi the 70 major sins which includes even the major Faraz so these 70 are the major Dooms and don'ts then there are minor do's and don'ts major dudes me the major Farah is offering Salah giving zakat doing Hajj is not to take interest you should not gamble you should not have alcohol you should not bribe so these are the major do's and don'ts and the remaining is optional you can become a doctor you can become an engineer you can become a guy you can become a lawyer you can become engineer if I do the Dua to Allah make me a die am I going against Allah's will no yes if I say oh Allah make me a robber then there's a problem because Allah says you should not rob so if your Dua is going against the guidelines of the Quran then I agree with you you are going against the Commandment of Allah so you cannot do a Dua for doing something Haram you cannot do Dua that I want to become alcoholic you cannot do a Dua they want to become mazani I want to become adulteress you can do Dua doctor engineer lawyer Allah so your Dua if it's against the don'ts then it is wrong if your Dua are not to do with the father I want to do what I don't want to offer Salah it's not accepted so do you understand brother so if you do certain Dua very few Dua it will go against the will of Allah and I don't know of any Muslim maybe few years if they're not in the right state of mind but the other thing which are okay I want to be rich no problem you can do Dua which may not be very good but you can do anything which is muba for example you want to get a job in a good company you can do Allah so your Dua is not going against the concept of submitting your will it only goes if you do something which is against the Commandment of Allah hope they answer the question [Applause] thank you so much thank you so much that was very enlightening thank you anything else better you have any other question no no that a lot of questions but uh not now for the non-muslim we have exception the brother said one at a time but for non-muslim they can ask a second question if you have any questions you're most welcome maybe I'll show in uh sorry maybe your next show will come your next speech at uh SQ if you want to be enough but any any doubt if you have any clarification regarding Islam anything you feel which is wrong in Islam this is the opportunity [Applause]"
