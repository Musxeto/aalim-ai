  "title": "Prophesies of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) in the Jewish Scriptures - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "let's discuss the prophecy of muslim in the jewish and the christian scriptures the jewish and the christian scriptures we know that the bible is divided with old testament and the new testament the bible according to the catholics has 73 books according to the protestants they have thrown out seven books as apocrypha doubtful from the old testament so total bible contains 66 books so the new testament of the catholics and the protestants contained 27 books but the old testament of the catholics contains 46 books of the petition it contains 39 books the old testament speaks about the stories about the prophets that came before jesus christ peace be upon him and the new testament speaks about the life and the times of jesus christ peace be upon him we'll first discuss the prophecy of muhammad in the jewish scriptures it's mentioned in the old testament in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 it says almighty god says i shall raise them for profit from among their brethren like unto thee and i shall put my words into his mouth and he shall speak all that i command him this prophecy says i shall raise them for profit from among their brethren likened to thee like moses peace be upon him so the christians they say that this prophecy refers to no one but prophet jesus christ peace be upon him and when we ask them why does it refer to jesus christ peace be upon him they tell us because the prophecy says the prophet to come should be like moses peace be upon him and jesus christ peace be upon him was like moses peace be upon him and when we ask them how are they alike they tell us that moses and jesus peace be upon them both of them were prophets of god and both of them were jew that's why this prophecy is talking about jesus christ peace be upon him if these two are the only criteria if these two are the only criteria for the fulfillment of the prophecy that he should be a jew and he should be a prophet of god then all the prophets mentioned in the bible after moses peace be upon him fulfill this prophecy for example prophet solomon ezekiel isaiah daniel hossia joel john the baptist peace be upon them all all of them were prophets of god and all of them were jew all of them fulfilled the prophecy if we analyze we come to know that this prophecy befits no one better than the last and final messenger prophet muhammed let's analyze what does the prophet say the prophecy says i shall raise them for prophet from among their brethren like unto thee like unto moses peace be upon him if we analyze moses and muhammad peace be upon them both of them were born naturally but jesus christ peace be upon him he was not born naturally he was born without any male intervention and this is mentioned in the quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 45-47 and is also mentioned in the bible in the gospel of matthew chapter number 1 verse number 18 and the gospel of luke chapter number 1 verse number 35 that he was born without any male intervention he was born miraculously therefore prophet muhammed peace be upon him is like prophet moses peace be upon him and prophet jesus is unlike prophet moses peace be upon them further if we analyze prophet muhammad and prophet moses peace be upon them both of them were married and they had children but according to the bible jesus christ peace be upon him he was not married and he had no children so jesus is unlike moses and muhammad is like moses peace be upon them all further if we analyze prophet moses and prophet muhammad peace be upon them both of them they died a natural death but prophet jesus christ peace be upon him he did not have a natural death according the quran we believe that jesus christ peace be upon him he was raised up alive surrender chapter number four verse number 157 and 158 he did not die we believe even if you read the christian bible correctly even upon the christian bible we can prove he did not die he was not crucified but the christians think that jesus christ peace be upon him he died on the cross he was crucified for more details regarding this topic referred to my video cassette and the debate was christ crucified but even if you agree for sake of argument what they say is right we have to agree that jesus christ peace be upon him he did not have a natural death according to the christian reading of the bible which is not correct they believe it had on the cross it was not a natural death we believe he was raised up alive both ways we agree he did not have a natural death therefore jesus christ peace be upon him is not like moses peace be upon him and prophet muhammad peace be upon him is like moses peace be upon him further if he analyzed prophet moses and prophet muhammad peace be upon them both of them brought new laws but according to the bible jesus christ peace be upon him did not get a new law it's mentioned the gospel of matthew chapter number 5 verse number 17-18 jesus christ peace be upon him says think not that i have come to destroy the law of the prophets i have come not to destroy but to fulfill further if we analyze muhammad and moses peace be upon them besides being prophets of god they were even worldly kings that means they could give the punishment of life and that to the person who deserved it they could give the punishment of death to the person reserved it where prophet jesus peace be upon him he could not do that and it's mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 18 verse number 36 jesus christ peace be upon him says my kingdom is not of this world and further if we analyze moses and muhammad peace be upon them both of them their people they accepted them as prophets of god as a whole but jesus christ peace be upon him his people as a whole they did not accept him as a prophet it's mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 1 verse number 11 that they all foster so here when we analyze we come to know that moses and muhammad peace be upon them are alike and moses and jesus peace be upon them they are unlikely so this prophecy refers to no one but prophet muhammad peace be upon him the prophecy further says i shall raise them for prophet from among the high brethren and we know that the arabs are the cousins of the jews moses was the jew mama allah sallam was an arab peace be upon them both so arabs and jews are cousins furthermore the prophecy says i shall raise them a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and i shall put my words into his mouth and he shall say all that i command him we know that muhammad sallallahu salaam used to get the vahi from allah subhana with allah and used to repeat verbatim whatever was evil to him it was as though words were put to in his mouth and if you repeat whatever almighty god is to say so this prophecy refers to no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammed the next verse further says in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 19. it says that if you hearken not unto my words i will require of thee or i will take revenge that means all those who do not harken unto the words of this messenger to come prophet muslim almighty god will take revenge it's further mentioned the book of isaiah chapter number 29 verse number 12 it says that the book shall be given to him who is not learned the book shall be given to a prophet who is not learned and when it is said read this i pray thee he will say i am not learned and we know that when the first wahi came to muhammad sallallahu salaam and like archangel gabriel said ikra read a beloved prophet muhammad replied which means i have not learned it this is the verb fulfillment of the prophecy of the book of isaiah chapter 29 verse number 12 that when the book is given to the person who is unlearned we know prophet muhammad unlettered he was me and when it would be said to him read he will say i am not learned and that's what he said prophet muhammed peace be upon him is also mentioned by name in the old testament it's mentioned in the song of solomon chapter number 5 which means his mouth is more sweet he is altogether lovely he is my beloved he is my friend or daughters of jerusalem they have translated muhammad as altogether lovely but in the semitic languages like arabic or hebrew they add him as a respect like to elo god that elohim for respect so to the name of muhammad they added muhammad for respect peace be upon him so he is mentioned by name in the original manuscript but now when we read it's translated to altogether lovely"
