  "transcript": "i welcome all the viewers of the peach tv network the phd of english the ph.d urdu the peach tv bangla and the peach tv chinese as well as my four social media platforms which are the facebook the youtube the instagram and twitter i welcome all the viewers with islamic greetings may peace mercy and blessings of allah with allah be on all of you and i welcome you to the second part of this program ask dr zakir and his son farik i would like to thank for handling the first few questions and from here on inshallah i will handle the balanced questions inshallah in this program you are most welcome to ask any questions on islamic comparative religion or any questions that a non-muslim or atheist may oppose you regarding islam and you are unable to reply you can also ask any questions that arise in the media regarding misconception about islam or the attacking islam answers regarding reason logic and scientific explanation regarding islamic teachings this is the opportunity you can ask questions on any of my four social media platforms but the best and the most appropriate would be sending a text message on whatsapp and you can mention your question in brief along with your name your profession the city and country of origin to the whatsapp number plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five i repeat plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five the first question that has come on the whatsapp which has been selected by my group first question is from brother yusuf ghana what are the basic guidelines in islam for choosing a spouse a similar question is asked by najiba afghanistan i am a 16-year old girl how can we love someone in an islamic way before marriage and a similar question asked by abdullah mohsin from dubai uae if it is not too personal can we know how did you select a life partner the first question posed by the brother that what are the guidelines regarding choosing a life partner or a spouse in islam our beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned say bihari verb number seven hadith number five zero nine zero as well as in say muslim volume number four hadith number three six three five it is a muthafic alike it's hadith present in buhari as well as in say muslim it's mentioned abu hurairah may allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet peace be upon him said that women are chosen in marriage for four things the wealth the lineage or nobility beauty and religion chooser for the religion here in this hadith a beloved prophet says that women in marriage are chosen for four things wealth lineage nobility third is beauty and fourth is religion and the best is religion that means choose the woman who is religious here we come to know that the maximum importance that should be given is to the religion because all the earlier three criteria which people normally look for in marriage it is limited and mainly for this dunya for example wealth wealth is something which can maybe get you some luxury in this world but may not be beneficial in the akhirah as the beloved prophet said it is more difficult for a rich man to go to general than a poor man but it's not haram to have wealth but it is not the major criteria to look for the second is lineage looking at the lineage of the family it's good but that is not the main it is mainly for the dunya you may say you're coming from a very good family from a noble family the third criteria is beauty which is again limited only to this world beauty is something which you may get tired of in few days a few weeks or a year the best and everlasting mainly for the akhirah as well as for the dunya is religion it is the deen and if i was to pay any weightage in choosing this is my own opinion that if a boy wants to choose a girl 90 to 95 percent should be for the dean for the religion because that will get him akhira as well as the dunya yes as far as the wealth is concerned if a boy wants to marry a girl then what youth is the wealth of the girl to that boy a good boy who has his own self-respect but nacho would not like to live on the money of the woman of the wife so irrespective whether the girl is rich or what difference would it make him and even if he's going to use that is only for this dunya the lineage may or may not help that will not really count much the beauty as i said is subjective as long as the wife is not repulsive so maybe you can give about three or four points or three or four percent weightage to the beauty as long as you know repulsive the deen is the maximum 90 to 95 percent of the waiter should be given to the deen if it's a boy choosing a girl if a girl is choosing a boy then wealth may carry certain weight because if the girl is used to having certain comfort in life but natural she cannot marry a boy who's living on the street so if it's a girl marrying a boy then the wealth may have certain weightage maybe maybe about 10 marks the lineage may be one percent and the handsomeness of the boy as long as he's not repulsive but naturally because you want to live with the spouse for the full life you should be satisfied but mentally if you make up a mind you know if you really it's all in your mind any girl can seem to be beautiful it's in your mind so the handsomeness or the beauty carries a smaller percentage so for the man the religion i would say would carry 1995 percent marks and for the woman when she's looking for a spouse maybe would carry approximately 85 percent mark the religion the deen which is the most important anyway this percentage is from my side it is not from the hadith is very clear that the most important is the religion that's it this is my percentage regarding the second question posed by the sister that can we have an islamic love before marriage regarding the love before marriage that we have nowadays in the modern society in the western society but natural it is haram there is no lbw lbw in the cricket you have like before wicked lbw is loved before wedding so the way we have in the western culture where their girlfriend boyfriend and they want to test each other they go out to a park and they go out for a movie they sit in the last bench of the theater or they want to enjoy they go for dinner and they talk and they may go to hotel and sleep overnight all these things is haram in islam yes you can while selecting a life partner have interview along with the mahram if a boy is going to look at a girl then maybe the boy sister is there or the girl's father is there along with the maram but nacho you can ask questions you can interview for few minutes or half an hour for one hour there's no limit you can have one meeting two meeting no problem to understand because you're going to spend the full life with the girl and the girl with the boy but going out alone and being in seclusion you know the shaytan in there the prophet said that if there are two names alone the third person is the devil so in the islamic way yes you can interview but the love before marriage what we have in the normal sense in the western world it is prohibited islamic way yes you can have for example you may know the girl may know of a boy who is islamic who is very religious who has haithakwa who prays five times sallah in the mosque and is a die and the girl may want to have a good life partner so islamically what she does is that she proposes to the boy who she thinks is religious through her father or through a brother or the parents of the girl go and meet the parents of the boy and in the islamic way it's possible this sort of love because you like the religious values and the deen in the boy it is permissible islamically if you go ahead following the rules and regulation not breaking the sharia it is possible in this way if you want to call it love before marriage because you like the religious aspects in the boy or the boy like religious aspects in the girl in this way not breaking any rules of the islamic sharia then you can call it a sort of love before marriage islamically but saying to it that you don't break any of the rules of the sharia as far as the third question posed to me is that if it's not too personal the brother would like to know that how did i select my life partner and as many of you may be aware that i met sheikh ahmadis in 1987 the first time when i was 22 years old i was impressed by him and that's how i got involved in the field of dawa and my life became more islamic previously i was an average muslim praying five times a day fasting and doing what normal muslims should do but the dawah came into my life after i met shakhma diddad and once i started doing dawah and my last grace alhamdulillah i realized that i was good in debating i was good and convincing so i thought as far as choosing a life partner for me inshallah inshallah no problem any girl i marry i will be able to convince her maybe in a few weeks or a few months or no problem the girl i'll be able to convince this was in the initial stages when i was no wise when i didn't have much knowledge but naturally later on as the years passed i realized that very important reading the hadith of the prophet and knowing the other aspects of islam that choosing a life partner is very important and at that time i thought that the right age for a muslim boy to get married is 25 that was my idea that time now also now it may be a little bit earlier so at that time i thought that 25 years is the best time for a person to get married when he finishes his graduation and he can marry and at the age of 25 when i started to look for a girl and realizing having more knowledge of the deen reading the hadith and the quranic verses my criteria was based on the hadith of the prophet muslim which is in bukhari and muslim that while choosing a girl you look for four things first is the wealth second is the lineage the nobility third is the beauty fourth is the deen and the best is the deen you should choose a girl for deen and this hadith was ingrained in my mind and decided i want to marry a girl who is as religious as possible more religious than me that was my aim to get a girl who is in the field of dawah and religious so i told my sister that look out for a girl and my only criteria number one is deen regarding wealth the poorer she's better for me because i don't want to use any of her wealth lineage doesn't matter and beauty she should not be repulsive that was my requirement and with this requirement i told my sister that she should find for me a life partner and believe me for two years she hunted and she may have searched many girls and unfortunately not a single one did she pass not a single of the girl who she thought and who she interviewed ever passed even the prelims later on we got information that there is a muslim a muslim girl in a neighboring city puna which is 160 kilometers from bombay where i lived and we came to know that she was the head the president of a ladies islamic dava organization and i went along with my sister and my mother and i went to puna i traveled all the way i drove for a few hours and i went to pune and that's how the first time i met my wife and that time she wasn't aware and we met her and he spoke to us spoke to her mother my mother was there and my sister was there her mother was there she was there and later on when we went back then we sent the proposal and then we had a formal meeting the first was wasn't a formal meeting just we went and we met through one of our common friends and when we had the formal meeting we had for a few hours and alhamdulillah she was the first girl i met or i interviewed or i interacted to be my would be wife and alhamdulillah the first was the best and allah blessed me masha'allah was the wonderful wife and alhamdulillah i consider it to be one of the best gifts that allah has given me besides the iman that allah has given me the best gift that allah gave me is my wife and she was from puna and in the first interview itself it was nearly finalized then we had another meeting my basic criteria was that she should be religious and she should be a die these were the two criteria religious and die and i could not find a girl better than her at that time already more than 27 years has passed for our marriage at that time i could not find anyone better at my knowledge and alhamdulillah this was the only criteria the remaining was not at all important but alhamdulillah even though i wasn't looking for beauty mashallah allah gave me a beautiful advice and as i said that beauty is in your mind and alhamdulillah and many people used to ask me that now you're giving so many ass for dhawa maybe you know about nine ten hours for dawah once you get married you'll have to give time to your wife how will you be able to manage both so one of the reasons that i married a girl who is a dia so that it's a venn diagram most of a time would overlap so when i gave approximately five hours tour in a day maybe three hours was discussing dawah and then we started an islamic organization ladies wing in my organization research foundation the moment we got married first thing we did was started a lady's wing and she was the president of the ladies wing of islam research foundation so my main criteria was only deem and dawa and but natural in the interview the question asked was based on about what is the concept of purpose of life and other things so basically these two are the criteria allah blessed me and the best blessing for adai is to have a righteous and supporting life partner for a die the wife can make the life of a die hell i know many guys who are very good days but after marriage the dawah has been ruined because of the spouse allah has blessed me masha'allah and i consider my wife to be the best wife in the world that's what i consider alhamdulillah and i thank allah for giving me a spouse who was righteous and because of her after marriage my dhawa increased multiple times and kept on increasing more and more to the level now alhamdulillah allah blessed me and therefore choosing a life partner is very important and as the prophet said look for a life partner who is religious look for deen in her the other criteria are not at all important most important is religious and virtuous hope this answers the question the second question from muhammad yunus mumbai india mashaallah you have a family of daesh what would be the criteria you would look for while selecting a life partner for your son farik considering he is also die brother muhammad yunus has posed the question that what would i look for a life partner if i have to choose a life partner for my son farik who's a die number one the choice will depend on my son not on me because my son would be leading a life with his wife he should select the right one but natural i being a father can give guidelines because of experience if i was to guide my son and you're already aware of the criteria and we discussed this many times alhamdulillah love you on the same wavelength and the reason is because of my wife whatever my son today is and my daughters maximum credit you could say 80 or more goes to my wife and i post this question very often that when is the latest you would like to plan for the future of your son so some people say you know i would like to plan maybe when my son goes to university or my daughter goes to university some people say when she would go to college some would say in school some would say i would plan for my children when they enter nursery but the islamic method is and the islamic criteria is that the latest you plan not the earliest latest is when you select a life partner when you select a life partner then you are planning how would you want your children so i wanted my children to become dice that's the reason i selected adaya i wanted them to be religious that's the reason i selected religious girl and today most of the people think that my children are dying alhamdulillah ahead in the field of dawah and islam alhamdulillah is because of me if percentage-wise i have to give marks out 80 percent is due to my wife alhamdulillah my guideline is there my support is there everything is there but the credit goes to my wife now coming to the question what are the criteria that i would see or look for in a life partner for my son fairy kosaday as i mentioned in my early answer a beloved prophet muslim said number seven hadith number five zero nine zero and the same hadith is repeated and say muslim word number four hadith number three six three five abu huraira male 1 said that prophet muhammad peace be upon him said that women are chosen for four things in marriage when you marry a woman you look for four things wealth lineage nobility beauty and religion choose her for her religion so the prophet said though people look for four things in a life partner while choosing a woman for marriage wealth lineage beauty and religion choose her for religion the best is religion and as i mentioned earlier that i would tell my son that while choosing a life partner see to it that you give 95 percent vintage to religion the other three are time bound mainly for worldly things religion hadeem and for this world and allah says in the quran that if you seek for this world allah will give you this world but not the akhirah if you seek for hera allah will give you akhra in this world as far as the wealth is concerned i would not like my son to use the wealth of his wife for the living he should be a man he should look after himself he is the kawam so what difference does it make whether the girl is rich or poor so as far as the wealth is concerned there is no weightage at all only thing we should be careful that poorer she is the better it is the richer she is it is difficult but if she is extremely rich then you have to be careful if she is extremely rich and used to that luxury of life she may be a billionaire's daughter then i would say be careful unless a dean is 100 out of 100 then maybe she would not care for the wealth that she has but otherwise if she's too wealthy you have to be careful you may not be able to take care of her so poorer the better so the weightage for the wealth is zero but only be careful that she's not extremely rich if she's poor the better if she's normal also no problem rich also no problem but not too rich or excessively rich point number two the lineage or the family i would say that makes no difference but if you're coming from a very religious family it may carry a very small maybe half percent weightage according to me if it is good but whether it is or not the deen is more important some people from the very good family may not be good we have the examples of children of the ambias of messengers who are mushriks we have examples of children of mushriks who became messengers so we have both these examples so lineage is important but not that much i would hardly give any attention to that maybe half percent as far as beauty she should not be repulsive but natural my son should like her and beauty differs it's in the eye of the beholder and everything is in the mind so i would say okay you can give about maybe three or four percent marks of beauty 95 minimum should be for thee this is what i would guide him and this is what i believe even he believes regarding the criteria and the requirement but natural the basic requirements that a muslim should be in the criteria i would have eight criteria which are compulsory number one she should be a practicing muslima following islam as per the glorious quran and the say hadith and she should do all the pharah's i repeat the first criteria and the most important is she should be a practicing muslim who follows islam as per the teachings of the glorious quran and the say hadith and she should do all the farah all the faraz means all she should have tahid she should pray five times a day she should give zakat if she has to give she should fast in the month of ramadan if she has to do her she should do it hijab and all these can speak for us together number two she should abstain from all the haram activities all the major sins all the minor sins as much as possible but natural if it's one or two minor sin no human being can say that he does not sin at all but abstain from all the major sins abstain from all these things if possible almost all number three she should be virtuous and do as much as mustahab as much as sunnah of the beloved prophet muslim third is a virtuous girl who follows as much as sunnah of the prophet does as much as mustahab what is recommended in that is level should be high believe in taheed besides the five times salah she should offer the taj salah she should pray the sun at the moment she should give charity besides the first zakat besides fasting in the month of ramadan she should fast the day of arafah fast the first nine of zillaja the three days of mauram nine ten eleven she should keep the sixth fast of shawwal she should fast three days ayam will beat every month she should fast on monday and thursday and so on and so forth as much as of the muslim as possible as much as virtues as possible and this you can speak for us together on the third point alone the fourth point is she should have the passion for dawah and spreading the message of islam amongst the muslims and almost passion for dawah and spreading the islamic teachings fourth point fifth point she should encourage and support her husband that is my son for doing dawah completely that means she should support in all the dhawa activities of my son she should completely support and encourage and help him in all of our activities for number six she should be willing to lead a simple life which is non-luxurious inshallah my son's life is quite comfortable but if required for the sake of islam she should be able to sacrifice all comforts seventh she should be fluent in english because my son is so indonesia and he would want her to be fluent in english the eighth is she should be willing to settle militia or wherever my son would shift but his plans are to stay and live in malaysia so she should be willing to settle in malaysia these are the eight compulsory criteria if i would mention the criteria for selecting life partner for my son as far as the criteria which are very important but not compulsory number one would be i would want her to be fluent in fosa arabic the classical arabic the arabic of the quran she should be fluent in that the reason is that i would want my children to be friends in arabic my son knows arabic fluently for sir i would want his wife to know so that the children are fluent in english in arabic both number two she should be adaya she should propagate islam to the non-muslims and the muslims number three she should have a bachelor's degree in any of the islamic studies whether it be islamic studies in general or in sharia or in quran or in hadith these are preferable not compulsory if little bit is less or more no problem but preferable the third is bachelors in islamic studies the fourth is i would also want her to be a hafez my son is halfway don't want to be office so the children also have this and being half is is preferable for rijawa number five she should be associated with an islamic organization and number six that she should have watched many of the english speaking dies so that she knows what is dawa and what is the surrounding atmosphere so these are the six additional points which are not compulsory but preferable if one is missing or a little bit less doesn't matter but there are eight compulsory points and there are six highly recommended preferable points that i would look for in a life partner for my son these are the main criteria the addition of course is there that there are many additional points for example the culture should match and the other things are there you can't expect a chinese to live with an african can if the first eight criteria are 95 and above in marks and even the additional 0.6 are very good then the other things can be compromised the culture differs between the people so these things are which are secondary and tertiary but the first compulsory points have mentioned eight then the six points and then other points are later on so this was in brief what i would look for in life partner for my son fari hope that answers the question we have on the facebook vani imran hussein many are saying i love you i love you too they're doing to us for me i do watch for you too and may allah grant all of you generals inshallah on the youtube nadra mehas tahir hussain great man young blood bless all of you the third question is from saiful hussein annoy i am rubell from bangladesh my question is i have a savings account which provides me interest and i want to give it to the poor people is it possible a similar question is posed by farnas fatima can we give interest money in charity a similar question from hasa abubakar sir i have a bank account which has interest could i remove the interest amount without taking it from the account but giving from other source what can i do with this interest from the question posed by these three questioners it is clear that they realize that interest in rabbi's haram and allah mentions the word riba in the quran no that is them eight times and allah clearly mentions in surah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and 279 that if you give up not your demands foreign for interest then take notice of a war from allah and israel riba is a major sin in islam and according to imam adhabi he places riba interest as 12th major sin in islam our beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned muslim hadith number 2259 a beloved prophet muslim said there are 73 levels or 17 types of rabbah and the lowest level is equivalent to doing zina with your mother it's a say hadith the lowest level of riba is like doing dinner with your mother that's what a beloved prophet said and allah says that if you give up not your demands of ribba of interest take notice of a war from allah and israel there is hardly any sin you can find in the quran the hadith in which allah says allah will wage a war against you if you indulge in that sin imagine it is such a grievous hideous sin regarding the question posed by all three questioners that what to do with the interest money can be given charity can i take out from the bank and given charity can i keep the money in the bank and give from outside equivalent amount in charity as far as taking interest money and giving a charity if you have to take the interest money and give in charity before giving you have to take so taking ripe haram so even if you take riba and give in charity even that hara the moment you take interest you are waging a war against rasul so there is no question of taking even taking the riba and giving in charities haram you have already done that by giving in charity you are lowering the degree but yet the haram act is done if you ask me the question i did not know till today rabbi's haram and i already have interest what to do that's a separate question but if someone says i'll keep the money in the bank and i'll give the interest to the poor people i would ask counter question and i've asked this question to many i know there are some scholars who say that no problem keep it in the bank take the money and give it in charity it's permitted i disagree with these scholars totally i would like to ask them that if i ask you that can i deal in drugs in cocaine brown sugar or can i open alcohol factory and i invest one million dollar and full hundred percent profit i get more than a million dollar a year i give that full seven and a half crore indian rupees in charity is it permissible hundred percent will say no i said why it's haram if that is haram having alcohol or dealing in alcohol or in drugs it is the nineteenth major sin in the book of imam dhabi khabar majes and riba is 12th mages in so when you can give me permission for 12th the higher sin mind to giving me permission for the lower sin and imagine when you deal in alcohol though it's a major sin a doesn't wage a war against you but when you are dealing in riba whether giving or taking allah and a rasool is waging a word against you when you are giving me permission to take the profit of interest money and given charity and no problem you should also give me permission to have an alcohol company 100 are given charity let me deal in drugs cocaine brown sugar no scholar will give you permission to deal in cocaine and say 100 you can give in charity because it's haram finn of city same thing in ribba when you're dealing in rubber it is spoiling the society i've given a full talk on interest-free economy promulgated by the glorious quran it makes a poor man more poor and allah and israel is the war so according to me taking interest and giving a charity also there may be a situation that today you have come to know it is haram and you already have interest money what to do that i can answer but if you say i'll keep on continuing keeping in the bank and take the interest and given charity that is totally haram allah and the school will wager war against you it is totally prohibited if you did not know till now and today you have come to know then what can you do with the money that can be understood and many scholars give you an option for example sheikh bin baza said that this money you can give in paying debts of the other people but naturally all the scholars say that the interest money you cannot utilize for yourself though you cannot take interest but if it's the last resort it has come due to unwillingness for example there is pension in the pension without your permission they keep it in some interest based investment it's coming without your willingness that's a different question or you have someone in your job or your company it comes indirectly in which you have no control but you cannot yourself open a saving account or a fixed deposit and then give the money charity no that's not permitted if you did and you say i will never do it again then i can tell you what can you do with the money number one you can give it to the debtors those who want it number two you can use it for building toilets or bathrooms number three you can give in charity to the poor people but you can't give it in charity to your dependents you can't give it to your son or your daughter they are your dependents you can't give to your mother and father they are dependent in short you cannot give it to those people who you will inherit from in short and neither can you give it to those people which is your duty to take care of them you cannot give it to someone who you're supposed to take care of you can give it to a third party who is not under your care but as far as debt is concerned according to sheikh mithyamya you can even give to those people who are under your care whether it be your son whether it be a father because that is not your liability your liability to take care of the day-to-day living so if your father or if your son or if your daughter is in debt you can use your zakat money for them also normal zakat you can't use for a dependent but for debt you can similarly this money what you have which unwillingly came to you you can use this interest money for paying the debt even of your dependent or anyone else you can use it for poor people or not your dependents you can use for charity or for building toilets but see to it that you do not continue indulging in the ripple because allah is very clear-cut that if you want to repent there are minimum five things that you should do number one agree it is wrong so now you have agreed that rabbi is wrong okay number two stop it immediately that means if you change your account you can't sell continue you have to stop that account put in a current account if you think it is a requirement to have a bank account okay i have a current account i lived in india we live in non-muslim countries and you can have a current account kind account doesn't involve the buy talk see to it that you open account in which there is no rebar some accounts have river open a current account which is absolutely free of rama because when you open a savings account you're signing you're giving them permission to use your money and give you reba if you open a fixed deposit then you're giving them permission to use your money and they're giving you about that's totally haram so if you have an account which is fixed deposit or if ever savings account convert it to a riba free current account then what money you have you can give it in the ways that i've told you regarding if you have money in the bank and you have outside money yes you can swap it no problem but see to it but you cannot continue with that account even that's wrong what you have to do you have to come out of that account and open a current account if you feel that keeping money in your house is difficult it is not safe you can keep in the bank or you may have to involve in making transaction by cheque which may be a legal requirement open a current account which is absolutely free from it but best is to open an islamic bank and current account next best is if there's no islamic bank in your country or in the area where you're living second best is you can open a conventional bank but see to it it is the current account free from briber what rebar you had because of your ignorance that you can give in charity to the poor people it is permissible next question from noshad ahmad assalamualaikum sir is using credit card halal if you're talking about the conventional credit card where where the bank gives you permission that you can utilize x amount of money depending upon the credit card that is bronze level silver level gold level depending upon the amount some give you two thousand dollars some give ten thousand dollars something forty thousand dollars depending upon the level and this money that you utilize you have to give within one or two months and if you give that then there is no interest if you give above that then there is an exorbitant interest which goes to up to maybe three percent a month that is 36 anywhere from two to three percent a month that is 24 to 36 percent a year which is exorbitant and i know there are some scholars who say that if you are using a credit card as long as you see to it you pay within the stipulated time within the one month or two month frame and no interest that's permitted i disagree with it it is totally haram the moment you take a credit card from a conventional bank you are signing a document saying that if you do not pay it in time you will give rabbah signing a document that you will peripheral swara allah and his rasool will reject against you so even using a credit card with the intention that you will not take longer than the time permitted i know majority of the muslims living in western countries in america and european countries in uk have a credit card from a conventional majority unfortunately i know there are scholars of the western country that need permission it is hundred percent totally haram all the major scholars whether it be what i mean whether it be checkbook majority have said even having a credit card of conventional bank is haram because you're signing and who can give guarantee that you'll always pay on time you're a human being you can make a mistake if once also you forget to pay on time it is haram a land is a true vegetable needs to even if you pay on time regularly only signing a document is haram so using a credit card of a conventional bank it's totally haram i am aware there are some scholars that are getting permission i disagree with them what you can do is you can have a credit card from islamic bank if it's islamic bank you can have a credit card the other what you can do is have a debit card debit card means the money is already in your account that you're not signing a document saying that you pay interest so debit card in a conventional bank is permitted credit card in a conventional bank is haram however credit card in the islamic bank is permitted because it works on the islamic principles on the sharia basis there is no repair involved with this so the best option is have a credit card islamic bank the second option is have a debit card in a conventional bank which does not attract any interest but credit card in a conventional bank of haram it's a major sin it is equivalent to doing zina with your mother that's what a prophet said it is clearly mentioned in muslim hadith number 2259 that there are 73 levels of riba the lowest level is doing zina with your mother and it's clearly mentioned in the quran in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 278 279 that if you give up not a demands of rabbi take notice of a war from allah and if your soul so i request all the muslims in any part of the world if you have a credit card from any of the conventional bank please today itself if not today tomorrow please discontinue it open an islamic bank if you don't have islamic bank convert it into a debit card debit card is permissible when there is no reminder war hope that answers the question you have on the facebook amino din adam shafa yet ma moon i love you sir i love you too sam shaheed heart heart heart to you too for me may allah bless you and give you the good in this world a salman khan we have many people even on the youtube you saw samsung asad munir love you sir i love you too rafae farhat afrin father islam foreign there's a question from syed hassan on the youtube assalamualaikum dr zakir naik how are you i am syed from hyderabad india civil engineer by profession my question is if one ship ram is enough for one household for sacrifice the question is that if one ram or one ship or one goat sufficient for sacrifice for one family is permitted if you have the capacity and you want to sacrifice very well even sacrificing one goat or one sheep or one ram and the prophet did that for the full family sufficient if you have the capacity and if you are wealthy and if you want to give one goat or one sheep per person even that is permissible or you can take a cow and that can take care of seven people in the household but the basic question is yes one goat or one sheep on either other the tenth of or the three days following that ayam with a shriek any of these four days preferable but natural is the first your need you can sacrifice one goat is sufficient for the complete family the next question hamis issa ali from tanzania east africa i am a great fan of you and i'm learning a lot from you may allah bless you and your family and reward you jannah my question is i took my bachelor's degrees last year in 2019 from the government university through government students loan because of my economic conditions and then i came to realize that i will have to pay it back with interest after being employed so what should i do to make up for this major sin please help brother hummus has asked a question that unknowingly he took a loan for his education degree his bachelor's degree and then later on he realized that this loan has to be repaid back along with interest what should he do now if you have taken a loan knowingly which you did not knowingly and now you realize it's a major sin the best is to repent and as i mentioned earlier that if you have to repent first you have to agree that what you have done is wrong agree reba is wrong number two stop it number three repent and ask forgiveness to allah number four don't do it again and number five undo it if you can so now that you have taken a loan unknowingly inshallah all the more than allah will forgive you even if you take knowingly you want to ask for forgiveness to can and unleaven inshallah forgive you you agree it is wrong if you have taken knowingly also stop it don't do it in future ask for forgiveness undo if you can now that you have done it unknowingly yet alhamdulillah you have to stop it you have to agree it is wrong not to do it in future ask for forgiveness and undo if you can now that you have taken a loan how can you undo it of course you can stop it if you can agree it is wrong which you have done also see it you don't do it again and inshallah you won't do it again how can you undo it now that you've taken a loan and you have to repay it the best is what you have to do take that same amount of loan from islamic bank and give it to the conventional loan that you have taken suppose they have taken a loan of x amount and you have to give x plus y back so take x plus y from the islamic bank on the islamic principles based on the sharia and give it and immediately stop that law over finish what you have to pay principal amount and interest take from the islamic bank give it and then repay slowly after you get a job to the islamic bank number one if there's no islamic bank in your vicinity in your country in your city the next option is that you can take from zakat money from your relatives and as i said that one of the criteria for zakat there are eight categories where the card can be given one category according to surah tabah chapter number nine verse number 60 is gary mundetter if you're a debtor if you have taken a loan you can take zakat money from your relatives from your friends no problem you can even take zakat from a person who you are dependent of zakat in the category of focara or needy cannot be given but and the category of gary moon yes because it is not the duty of the person who you are dependent on to take care of your loan so you can take even from your father or from your mother or from your son or from your daughter it is permitted according to shaykh nathamiya you can't take so even from your dependent and closely you can take the card and give it to the convention loan that you have taken the third option is last if you don't have islamic bank you don't have relatives go to your friends if your friends have no zakat to give the last resort is that you ask for forgiveness the moment you earn money if there is a time period that you keep on paying one one thousand or maybe a small percentage you keep on paying much more than what you're required and finish the loan as soon as possible so that you can stay away from it and you can save yourself from online reversal so these are the various options available as for forgiveness inshallah will forgive you the next question is from hassan yusuf from kennedy mangalore the brother asked two questions is it allowed to make health insurance for the people who are permanently sick especially in countries like india where poor muslims and sometimes even middle class muslims cannot afford to pay the hospital bills the second part is can a muslim person use his bank interest amount to make health insurance for the very needy muslims in india brother sun has asked basically two questions number one is that can you make medical insurance for the poor people or the middle class people who cannot pay the hospital bills and can use the interest money for this as far as medical insurance is concerned any insurance whether it be medical insurance whether it be health insurance whether the insurance of the car insurance per se is permitted but since most of the insurance whether it be life insurance or health insurance or car insurance most of the insurance in the world today are related or involved with riba interest that insurance become haram so any insurance whether life insurance or medical insurance or car insurance or insurance of any property if it is linked with riba that you have to give a premium and they collect premium from hundreds and thousands of people they put that money in an interest-based investment or a bank and they get the interest money and then they collect the interest money and whoever goes in laws they paid if it is involving interest or riba that type of insurance is haram the other alternative that you have is the islamic insurance called as takafa so if you're doing takaful whether for life insurance or for medical insurance or for insurance of your property this is permitted so takaful in the kafir what they do is they take your money and they invest in a sharia compliant business or a sharia compliant instrument which is rubber free it's not involving inter whatever extra money they get they see to it that they spend it on the policies of the insurance however somebody has an accident or whoever dies or was hospital so takaful is permitted islamic medical insurance is permitted islamic life insurance is permitted islamic insurance of the car is permitted of the property properties permitted but riba based insurance medical insurance life insurance haram come to the second question that can i use my interest money for buying insurance for the poor people as i said earlier if you are using interest money and keeping in the bank continuously and then giving that money in charity or buying medical insurance it is haram because to buy medical insurance from that interest money you have to take interest first as i mentioned earlier giving interest and taking interest both is haram allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 278 and 279 that if you give up not your demands of riba of interest take notice of over from allah and his result so if you're going to keep in the bank and every year take interest and given charity or buying insurance for the poor people it's haram you are doing a bigger major sin than them but if you came to know today that interest is haram and now if you have that money interest money then very well you can give in charity you can even buy insurance for the poor people but continuously keeping the money in the riba-based bank is haram if you stop that account and now you have that money what to do with it yes you can utilize it for the poor people for building toilets for giving the debts or even for buying medical insurance for them let me give you one additional information regarding medical insurance now when you have medical insurance most of the medical insurance insure you for your hospital bills not for your normal day-to-day checkup with the doctor so only if you are admitted in hospital will the insurance company pay the bills but if you have a normal if you are sick and if you go to a normal doctor in outdoor patient department they will not take care of your medical bills they'll only take care of a medicable if you admit it but natural they will not take care if you admit it for pregnancy it doesn't come in the policy normally if you are admitted for certain things which are common or cataract they've not come to the policy it only takes place you know mainly an accident or other diseases which are not common so you have to be very careful when you read the contract of the medical insurance so if you are taking care only of hospital bills the chances you will be hospitalized with a very small percentage that's the reason you pay a small percentage of the policy if the policy says that they will take care of hundred thousand rupees of hospital bill you have to pay a small percentage but will never take care of your day-to-day visit to the doctors i had consulted one of the takafl companies in malaysia and malaysia is very advanced in islamic banking alhamdulillah one of the few countries which is advanced in islamic banking in malaysia there are islamic full-fledged banks also or most of the conventional bank also have islamic window i prefer a full-fledged islamic bank than a conventional bank with islamic window i consulted one the carful company in malaysia and other said that they give insurance but only if you admitted now how many of the people admitted to hospital when i was trying to free for the insurance option for the staff and i ask them that what for they cover 100 medical bills even if they go for normal checkup then the policy was so expensive it was more than 50 percent about 60 percent of the expenses that you're claiming you'll have to pay every year that is too much that means if you're asking for a policy of over ten thousand ingot that is one point seven lakh rupees then they're asking for sixty percent six thousand ringgit a year for 1.7 lakh you have to pay more than one lakh rupees what is the use of the policy so be very careful that for these medical insurance that's only certain types of diseases and when you admit to the hospital certain types of disease is not covered you have to be careful read very carefully it may be helpful may not be helpful it's mainly helpful that if a government has a policy that employee should be ensured then it's helpful but otherwise many a time it doesn't take care of your normal medical expenses only in critical condition we admit to the hospital it takes care of that hope that answers the question the next question posed by abdul kareem from lahore pakistan if all the muslims believe in the same quran and the same hadith then why are there four madhabs and why do they differ this is a very important question and a very sensitive question the brother pulls the question that if the muslims believe in the same quran and believe in the same hadith then why are there four madhabs and why do they differ i do agree that as far as the ellison novel jamaat is concerned major chunk of the muslims all of us believe in the same quran we believe in the same hadith we believe after the quran is the bukhari the most important then say muslim is there then you're following the quran these four are the main collection of the quran and the unanimous agreement between this the quran and the quran number one after the quran is bukhari then muslim and then the other four books regarding the question that why are there four madhabs and why do they differ as far as the four popular madhav that we have today and we follow the four ms that may allah have mercy on them all i love all these foe mars i respect them all and i really pray follow them may allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala grant the mercy and may allah put all of them in general let me correct you first that these for madahip they came to explain to the muslim ummah islam in detail let me tell you that they don't differ always they differ rarely more than 90 to 95 percent all the former type are the same they may differ in some issues may be minor issues as far as the major issues are concerned about salah we have to prefer time regarding zakat recounting hajj all these four they are same in the minute aspects of salah or if hajj they may differ here and there but there are minor differences it's not a major difference at all it is not worth fighting over it so let me tell you that 90 to 95 percent of all these four months are the same exactly they may differ in small issues and very few all these four imas they said that if you find any of me fatwa any of my verdict which goes against allah and this rasool which goes against quran and say hadith then you throw mafat on the wall so all these four mars they were great scholars and they came to explain the deen to us regarding why do they differ if we follow the same quran and the same idea this is a very important question and this question troubled me for many years alhamdulillah has blessed me that i have met many scholars from all this for motherhood and i interacted with many of them many hours and i spent time with them and i posed the same question why did they differ and the reply they gave was there some less satisfying some more satisfying but there's no convincing replies for the masses and alhamdulillah the laughter meeting these scholars from all this foreign my vision of islam and the differences alhamdulillah expanded a lot allah clearly mentioned the quran in surah imran chapter 3 verse 103. hold to the rope of allah strongly and be not divided we muslims are supposed to hold to the rope of allah that the glorious quran and the sahada and all its ejima all the alistar novel jamaat the muslims who believe in the quran and the say hadith then why are the differences to explain to a common man i will give you some examples and always believe in explaining people by giving examples which they understand i would like to ask a simple question to the people who know english what is the spelling of the word color can you guess give the reply you can give the reply whatsapp you can give the reply on the facebook you can give the reply on the youtube what is the spelling of color i'm not getting any reply what is the spelling of color what is the spelling of color some may say the spelling of color is c-o-l-o-u-r some may say the spelling of color is c-o-l-o-r which is correct a person who is very worse with english will tell you that the first spelling is the spelling of british english c-o-l-o-u-r is the british spelling for the word color c-o-l-o-r is the american spelling for the word color i'm asking the question which is correct c-o-l-o-u-r or c-o-l-o-r and again you'll have different opinion some will say c-o-l-o-u-r is correct if he's a british some will say c-o-l-o-r if he's an american some may say both are correct but even if they differ you never find them fighting over this issue the mediever a british i will say c-o-l-o-u-r is correct i am an indian we were ruled by the britishers and quite a large portion of the world was ruled by the predictions so all those who were ruled by the britishers and we were british colonies we will follow british english and we will say the spelling of karate c-o-l-o-u-r the american will say c-o-l-o-r we agree to both a britisher would prefer c-o-l-o-u-r but if someone says c-o-l-o-r fine we agree to differ same with the american he will say c-o-l-o-r but he agrees he believes that is better but he agrees with c-o-l-o-u-r also similarly this is just an example i've given you how do you pronounce o-f-t-e-n how do you pronounce o-f-t-e-n some will say often some will say often previously it was often then it became often now new people are saying often is correct t is not silent it should be pronounced some say t sign and then the big debate for that but we realize that both are correct in their own ways similarly these schools of thought four that we have actually there were many tens and hundreds of imams and scholars these four imam abu hanifah may allah have mercy on them all mella grant them genetic phrase to all they were more popular or maybe their students made them popular there were many other imams many other sheikhs many other scholars but these four their teachings became more popular maybe the students made it more popular and that's how we have these four major motherhypes but all these four great scholars and for emma's they never came to bring a division in the muslim ummah they explained their point of view because if it's very clear-cut in the quran there is no problem at all if it's taken another the different comes when there is a difference opinion now why is there a difference of opinion i will discuss that previously i have to think okay fine you know maybe the difference is some people say hadith some people say that's the difference that is not the real answer that may be in some cases after meeting so many fukahas and scholars of the different motherhood i have come with this example of the spelling or the example of pronunciation so similarly these motherhood differ what is the major reason according to my study there is usually that in areas where it is not very clear-cut quran says alcoholism there is no fick in it allah says hara it's sarah so no one will differ allowed or not allah everything where there is difference in understanding the quran or the hadith etc then they fixed that so as far as usual effect is concerned there are different criteria for giving your ruling on fake some may have five criteria some may have six some may have seven some may have nine some may have even ten i will not discuss in detail time does not permit and difficult for common men to understand i'll just give a few examples for a better understanding number one difference is difference in the criteria as far as the first two criteria are concerned it is the same number one criteria in all madhav all schools of thought it is quran number one there is no difference in it number two is the mothawater hadith all the schools of thought believe that number two criteria for fish there are various different classifications of hadith one of the classifications is depending upon the narrators the chain of narrators mutavat means a hadith in which there are various chains of narrators in every generation that means that hadith has been narrated by various many sahabahs who heard the prophet say that then the next generation turbine there were many tabains who repeated that hadith then the tabetaba and many repeated hadith so in every generation there are various many narrators so in one of the classification of hadith it is based on narrators it is maybe a single chain of hadith then this hadith one narrator is there at any one stage only one narrator for example the very famous hadid the first hadith of say bukhari umar your actions are based on your intention all you find this hadith in bukhari in muslim in various books but there's only one sabbah narrated it so if any of the stages where the stage of sabbah or the taba i know that any of the stages of narration if any of the stages have only one narrator comment in all the hadith it becomes so there are various chain of narrators but all the narrators end to omar radhila 1 and then umara de lava narrated what the prophet said so it becomes it may be a mashup hadith there may be two or three narrators and it keeps on various categories the highest category is muthavatir that means several narrators at every stage that means every stage have many narrators number is not there has to be more than four or five every stage some are 20 some are 30 at every stage so number one is the quran number two is the muthavat all the schools of thought agree that the number two highest category of evidence after the quran is the mutawater third category onwards the third criteria of evidence differs in different schools of thought some have five criteria some are six some are seven some have ten criteria in some schools of thought the third criteria highest criteria of evidence is even as long as it's a say hadith even ahad no problem it can be a massive it is the third house and some school of thought no no no the third after the muthavata hadees is the orf is the custom that if the people of madina did this act it is the custom it is the third hat higher than even some will say no it is chaos analogy so different schools of thought have different criteria in order first two is the same the third may be some may analogy other group the fourth becomes the fourth becomes custom in some schools of thought so from the third onward it differs so based on this difference some may prefer custom as a higher so if it is not there in the quran if it's not they are mutable hadith it is in hadith the other says it is so i will not believe i will give more importance custom more importance so the differences arise in what you give more importance to do you give importance more to or for the custom do you give more importance to chaos analogy or do you give more importance to others from third level it keeps on differing in different schools of thought so because of that what you give more importance to differs that's how the ruling differs but all these rulings are minor what we have to understand that we have to respect the ruling of all the four schools of thought because all the four schools of thought are based on quran they are based on hadith but the level of importance may differ some schools of thought say they may have a criteria if you are talking about salah it should be a mutavater hadees because salah the prophet made in public almost all the sabbas saw him so if you give about salah hadith though it is sahih i will not follow if it is salah it has to be evidence for muthavat other than not follow that is their thinking you may agree may not agree you may say no it's hadith one sabbah reported it it is sufficient for me it says hadith fulfills the criteria of sahih it is sufficient for me other schools are saying no if it's other matter i will believe in a hazard but sallah such important thing profit paid every day five times a day it should be a mutawatara difference of opinion so how do you differ so the third and the fourth and the fifth level of criteria after the first two differs this is the reason why the major difference is there in the four schools of thought it may be difficult for people to understand number two the difference may also be that you may differ that whether it's a say hadith or not some may say this is the lowest level of say hadid some will say no it is so therefore this is not a huja it's not an evidence for saying something is further or something is haram it may have other values so the muhadi sin may differ and when they differ the referred mind with some messages asan some may says hassan is the lowest category of sahih classifying hadith on the basis of whether they decide for mozu is another classification say hadith itself there are ten types of sahaja then comes then comes modu time will not probably go into details so the second type of difference of opinion in fick besides the criteria is whether the hadith say or life third may be different in understanding the hadith for example the hadith of the prophet muslim that after the prophet stood and he kept his hands where they were so some schools of thought i am not mentioning their names purposely some schools of thought say the prophet kept his hand on his chest before he went to ruku the hand was on the chest so after roku when they get up they keep them on the chest the other i must say no before starting the salah where was the hand the hands were at the side so when they get up from roku they keep the hands on the sides so here you understand that the difference is because understanding the hadith all of them agree that but one fukah agrees this hadith refers to where were the hands before going to ruku the other focus agree that it was before starting salah so different in interpreting the hadith so one is because of criteria which is the major difference number two is that difference in whether it's a psyosis number three in understanding the hadith similarly there can be a difference in understanding the quranic verse also for example the verse of the quran says that when the movement touches your udu breaks so one focal agrees the physical touch breaks the arabic word is masa coming from the word lama has got two meaning arabic one means the sexual touch one means a physical touch so one focal takes it as a physical touch and this physical touch breaks the other focus says no it means sexual touch so physical type does not break so the difference is that they're in understanding the meaning of the verse of the quran so because of the differences where there will be difference in criteria whether it be difference in whether they say or if hadith whether it's a difference in understanding the hadith whether the difference in understanding the voice of the quran because of this the differences are there and these differences are minor we should not fight over it what we find today that because of these issues there are some people who just study for a few months or few years and they start saying that okay my freak is the best and is the only right one which is wrong all these are great us we love them all respect them all even they among themselves when they defer they respected they agreed with the other view what they said my view i think is absurd it is better that doesn't mean you are wrong but today most of you are wrong i'm right what i say even i am right to say i am only right is a big problem or you can say i think this is observed this is better that you can say but today what we have no i am only right you are wrong because of that there is tension and there is fighting we muslims should be united these are petty issues the differences are going to be there there were differences in the sabbath we should not fight over it and we should agree that we agree to disagree we should not fight over it and all these issues are not on the major issues they are minor issues so i require the muslim ummah that we should be united and we should respect these mass and we should respect the scholars and see to it that we follow the quran and say hadith as close as possible hope that answers the question the next question brother mohsin bashir from kashmir india what should we follow when there is difference of opinion among the scholars on a particular issue this question related to the earlier question that what should we do and who should we follow if there are difference of opinion among the scholars allah says in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 59 [Applause] and those who have been endowed with knowledge those who have been giving the commands that means talking about the scholars obi allah and obey the messengers and obey those who are knowledgeable those who are the scholars but the verse doesn't end there was continuous but if they differ go back to our line is rasul that means they have to follow quran and follow sai hadid and the scholars but if the scholars differ go back to our land in the soul all the scholars say you should pay five time there's no need of going anywhere pray five times all the scholars say they should fast during the month of ramadan no problem all the scholars give 2.5 percent zakat in most of the cases okay follow that when there is difference of opinion and if scholars differ the quran says go back to our language now when the scholars differ what should a person do for this i would like to give an example depending upon which level do you belong to your decision will based on that i remember when i was in school when i was in the primary school for us for a child in the primary school teacher is always right irrespective whether the teacher is knowledgeable or not for the child going in primary school for him or her the teacher is the most knowledgeable in the world and i remember in the primary school when my science teacher told something and i told my father my father he was a medical doctor he was a psychiatrist he had done his post-graduation medicine and when there was a medical issue and i told my father my father said that you know this is wrong i was adam and no my teacher cannot be wrong that time i was a kid 7-8 years old not knowing that my father is a medical doctor but for me the teacher is always right similarly when a child is in primary school for him the teacher is always right so for a person who has no knowledge of thee or maybe he's a beginner in deen who is a reward or maybe who has not studied at all he may be an elderly person but did not study at all so i would consider him to be in the level of school level so for him he should judge one scholar consider him to be teacher and follow that is the safest whichever scholar he believes but that is for a person who has limited or no knowledge of thing normally the focus they divide the muslim the two levels one is the muslim a scholar and one of the non-muslims i divide normally into four levels the different levels of division i would count a person who has bare minimal knowledge of the bare minimum or maybe a reward or maybe he's elderly but no one taught him really about the deen so i would call him a person who's in school bare minimum the lowest level in the muslim the highest level i would call as a scholar or a muslim and today in today's world there are very few mushta very few scholars maybe a few hundred very few all the dyes that you see giving talks and all very few are really scholars very few the highest level scholar the lowest level is just the beginner the second level from top i would say is a student of knowledge so most of the duats are students of knowledge for example the person who studied deen and spent years studying those who love fake or the hadith of seed you can call him a student of knowledge student of knowledge may differ he may be a graduate from islamic university he may be a post graduate that his masters he may be a phd by getting a phd degree don't become a scholar can become chances are less scholar is a different category altogether allah has given him the sense of analysis of understanding he knows all these fools and has the element of puja et cetera that's a different level so scholars are very few in the world maybe a few hundred now in the full world so these are students of knowledge in the students college there are various categories low level medium high very high phd may be a very high level but yet a student of knowledge and a person may not have gone to university but a man has spent months and years discussing with the top scholars and focus he may be more knowledgeable than a phd and in my organization in islam research foundation when i was in bombay and the school itself we had more than 500 employees out of which about maybe 25 of them were graduates post graduates and phds from foreign universities mainly from mostly from islamic university of madina some from imam mohammed south university some from another university maybe 25 of them bachelors post graduates and phds then we are another 30 40 people who have passed from the islamic universities in india some have done the ifta some have done the alum course some mufti another 30 so totally we have about you know 50 60 people all of them are called a student of knowledge there were some who were in the research department who did not pass from any of the islamic universities but they spent years in doing research for me they were more valuable than the masters and the phds amongst my staff they were very knowledgeable they could argue they could quote the hadith they didn't go to any islamic university but the level of understanding of deen was much higher so the salary was higher even than the phds who have done the doctorate from the islamic university of alaska etc even from madina and none of my staff i would call not even i'm not a scholar at all i'm just a student of knowledge so student of knowledge differs at different level that is the second category the third category above the basic beginner is those who have knowledge of the deen but may not have studied to a great extent but because today it's easy to acquire knowledge either by internet or by social media they have interacted but not to the level of a student of knowledge so i would call them in four levels one is a scholar a mushta is very few in the world few hundred then you have the storage of knowledge the experience of knowledge of various categories lower level medium level higher level then you have the people who have knowledge of the deen but may not be caused to end of knowledge but they know quite fair and one is a lower level just the beginner if you're a beginner you're like in the school catch one scholar follow him that's the best you don't have that if you're a student of knowledge if you're a student of knowledge and if the scholars differ they have to analyze go back to allah and result go back to the evidence given by the scholars so if two scholars differ the student of knowledge will actually check that what is the evidence given by scholar a and what is the evidence given by scholar b he himself may not be a scholar but he has the basic knowledge of at least analyzing the evidence and no die unless he's a scholar should give a fatwa i never give a fatwa of my own what a dhai can do he can read the fatwas of the scholars and then he can agree with one scholar more than the other scholar saying i agree with this scholar more because the evidence he's giving is much more reliable than the other i feel this evidence now depending upon what level of student of knowledge are you can you agree but naturally for a very low level of student of knowledge then it may not be right for you to judge which of the scholar is correct but you have a high level you can those who are on the third level who have knowledge of the deen what they should do they should ask a student of knowledge that these two scholars are differing who do you think is more appropriate and based on the evidence they give so basically we have to go back to allah and his rasool see the evidence in the quran and the hadith there may be chances that some scholars they have made mistake out of ignorance they were nerfed some said because of difference of opinion various so if you analyze and then make a decision so if you are a student of knowledge you can analyze the evidence given by the scholars then decide which call is correct if you are the third category you can ask a student of knowledge or ask a scholar a third scholar which of the two evidence is more appropriate and hear their reasoning and based on that you can decide if you are the fourth level just knowing hardly knowing the level of dean you catch one scholar follow him blindly there's no other option but naturally should not be a fake scholar you should be a scholar by its two cents and if you do that you have no other option because your knowledge is very low in the theme these are the options we have but as the quran says go back to online result we have run out of time that are the last question
