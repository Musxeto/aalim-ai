  "title": "How can one Focus both on one's Religion & Academics? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "this question is asked by ansar from assam india but the first answer is asking a question i am basically a student preparing for my engineering exam i am actually facing some psychological issue in my recent observation i feel that whenever i try to increase the intensity of god consciousness or my iman then i cannot focus on my academic performance and if i try to focus on my academics then my intensity of god consciousness weakens why am i not able to carry out both with perfection this is a very important question brother father said that when he concentrated two months on his education he cannot concentrate on his iman his taqwa goes down if he pays attention to his religiosity to his iman and to stakwa his concentration education goes down why is this and how can he solve the problem many a time this happens by the vasa of the shaitaan the shaitaan whispers and tells you now don't offer salah because tomorrow is examination so imagine if you're going to pray full day you will be spending one one and a half hour and you will not will do well so you prepare one hour more for examination you'll do well these are the vaswatha that comes but you have to know your priorities whenever two things which are important clash always the one which is more important should be done first for example if to a doctor a patient of heart attack ischemic heart disease comes to him and a person of common cold comes to him who will he attend to first but naturally a person who has a heart attack if he doesn't attend to him he will die the person in the common cold yes has a chance similarly where it comes between your takawa and your iman and between your education both are important without doubt but the taqwa and the iman and salah is far more important a million times more important than your education because this life is the test for the hereafter and as i mentioned my previous answer that the beloved prophet muslim said it is mentioned in say muslim number one hadith number 246 that the prophet said that between a man and kuff and shirk is not praying of salah so if you think that if you become more religious if you pray and if your iman increases then your concentration of your education will go down this is the vasa of the shaitaan in fact if you pray properly the amount of serenity you get the amount of peace of mind you get that you study better i am a medical doctor doing my medical studies but natural i used to have tension during the final exam most of you mean me there but the moment you pray the whole tension goes down the serenity the calmness that you get your mind becomes more fresh it is rejuvenating and these things are very important these things are a must every day of your life so my request to you is that between the two your taqwa is more important your iman is more important your salah is more important that does not mean that you neglect your education and your study this wasa will surely go away in your salah you pray to allah please let me concentrate and the moment you pray to allah please let me do well in the examination please let me concentrate inshallah you will prepare for the examination better and you will fare also better and when these thoughts come in your mind you have to read i seek refuge in allah from satan very important and the moment you say this is insha'allah your mind will come back into the track but always remember number one is iman it is nowhere close to any other thing and inshallah if your taqwa is high if your iman is high if your salah is in place inshallah you'll do well even in your examination hypothetically even if you don't do well in the examination you will not do good in this examination of the world but this life is an examination for the hereafter as allah says in the quran in surabul chapter number 7 verse number 2 it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds inshallah you will pass in the examination of the hereafter and when we do dua we say that oh allah give me the good in this world and thereafter and save me from the torment of hellfire and we pray to allah rabbi sidney ilma increase me in knowledge and give me beneficial knowledge so inshallah life is proper inshallah your education also be better and you will come closer to allah it will benefit you in the year after as well as in this world"
