  "transcript": "and always Allah subhana wa ta'ala doesn't look at the amount he looks at what percentage of donation you have given from the N Allah has given you and I said that before that if a person who's earning $1,000 a month if he donates $100 he will get more AER than a person who earns a billion dollar and he donates only a million dollar because $1 million from a billion dollar is. 1% where $100 from $1,000 is 10% so the person who earns only $1,000 and donates $100 will get 100 times more Saab more blessings as compared to a person who earns a billion dollar and donates only a million dollar so Allah will look at the percentage of what you have that you donate not at the amount so let us make a commitment that we donate a percentage of our income for the cause of Allah subhana tala and from this we allocate a share for the Palestinians"
