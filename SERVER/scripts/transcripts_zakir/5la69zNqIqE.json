  "transcript": "from muhammad usman pakistan \ncan we say that hindu muslim   bye bye bhai bhai is a urdu or hindi \nword which means brother brother so the   question is asking can we say hindu muslim \nbhai bhai hindu muslim brother brother   as far as brotherhood is concerned there \nare various different types of brotherhood one type of brotherhood that all of us know it \nis the blood brother if we have common parents   common mother and father only common father only \ncommon mother we are called as blood brother then   the other brotherhood is the brotherhood \nof iman if we belong to the same faith to   the same religion we are called brothers in \nfaith as allah says in the quran it's surah the believing men and women they are aliyah \nthey are supporters they are protectors   they are helpers of one another that means the \nmuslims are brothers and sisters to one another   and the awareness of the brother or \nbrother of reyes brotherhood of country   but the widest and the largest brotherhood \nis the brotherhood of humanity that all   human beings are brother allah says in the \nquran chapter number 49 verse number 13 s humankind we have created you from a single \npair of male and female and have divided you   into nations and tribes so that you may recognize \neach other not that you may despise each other   and the most honored in the sight of allah is \nthe person who was taqwa here allah is saying   in the quran that all the human beings have come \nfrom a single pair of male and female adam and eve   may peace be upon them that we have common great \ngreat great great great grandfather adam and eve   and we are children of the same pair allah says he \nhas divided you into nations and tribes made you   of different color different languages so that you \nmay recognize each other not that you may despise   each other not that you may hate each other and \nthe highest in the sight of allah the criteria for   judgment in the sight of allah it is not sex it \nis not wealth it is not color it is not cast but   it is taqwa it is god consciousness it is piety \nit is righteousness only way one human being can   be more superior to the other human being is by \ngod consciousness is by piety is by righteousness   amongst the various brotherhood when i ask this \nquestion which brotherhood is the most important   and the answer almost all of them give is \nthe brotherhood of blood that if you are a   blood brother that is the closest brethren and \nthen all the other brotherhood are below that but what does allah say in the quran if you read \nthe story of nua salam mentioned in the quran   in surah we find that nua salaam was instructed \nby allah to make an arch to make a big boat   and he makes it and he takes a promise from allah \nthat o allah please save my family members and   allah promises that okay he will save the family \nmembers and when begins to reign it's mentioned   for verse number 40 40 to 43 onwards begins to \nrain his son says oh i will go to the tallest   mountain and the water will never reach there and \nthe water rises and it says in verse number 45 46   of sorry number when the water rises then \nhis son is crying out save me save me   so no ala salaam reminds allah that did you \nnot promise that you will save my family member   so allah replies in surah chapter 11 verse \n46 that your son is not amongst your family   imagine allah is telling to his prophet nua salaam \nthat your son is not amongst your family so here   allah is talking about the brotherhood of iman the \nbrotherhood of faith so in islam the brotherhood   of faith is far superior than the brotherhood of \nblood the closest brotherhood is the brotherhood   of iman as far as the basic question is concerned \ncan you say hindu muslim by very well you can   when we are talking about the brotherhood \nand humanity that the largest brotherhood   and when during question answer time we give first \npreference in the life question of succession   to a non-muslim and i always say that the brother \nthat's a very good question he may be a hindu he   may be a christian no problem here i'm referring \nto the brotherhood of humanity and there are   many masha'allah during my talk after my talk \nmasha'allah they accept islam then from brother   of humanity they get converted to brotherhood \nof faith hope this answers the question"
