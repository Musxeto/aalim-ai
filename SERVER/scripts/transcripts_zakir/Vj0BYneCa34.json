  "transcript": "there are many muslims have excuses they say that when we speak to the non-muslims they tell me that mind your own business i tell them if some non-muslim tells me that mind your own business i will tell him that's what i'm doing it's my business it is the business of every muslim to mind other people's business as far as dhawa is concerned it is the business of every muslim to mind other person's business as far as removing shirk is concerned so that's what i'm doing when someone says mind your own business that's what i'm doing this is my business it's a business of every muslim to be a die at least a part-time die if not a full-time die i'll give an example suppose if you're going on a hill station along with a family and you have two kids a girl and a boy and your boy ahmad four years old while you're talking to your wife and a small kid am i four years old he slips away from you and is going towards the edge of the cliff now by the time you realize that he's missing he's already gone far away and then you see him that walking close to the edge of the cliff you want to shout ahmad be careful you'll fall down but your voice cannot reach him far away there you see an elderly gentleman at the edge of the cliff with his hand folded he's admiring duty you want to shout mister bicep save my son he will die but your voice cannot reach him this elderly gentle man he looks at your son he smiles at your son then continues admiring beauty your son is coming closer to the edge of the cliff this man again smiles at him and at mass duty next step he takes is over the cliff and he falls and he dies i'm asking the question will you or will you not blame that elderly gentleman for not saving your son will you or will you not only thing you had to do was touch his hand he didn't even have to take a step forward only thing he had to do was stretch his hand and your son would have been saved will you blame him or not yes or no yes but when you tell him why did you save my son he will say i was minding my own business he's right he didn't push your son did he did he ask your son to jump no why is he to be blamed did he push him no did he ask him to jump no but yet you will say he at least had wisdom god gave him wisdom my son four years old masu innocent what does he know yet you will blame him will you or will you not of course same way on the day of judgement these mushriks these non-muslims on the day of judgment they will blame the muslims they will catch your color that when allah subhanahu wa when almighty god gave you hidayah why didn't you tell us on the day of judgement these non-muslims will blame the muslims and tell that why didn't these muslims who allah gave his ayah too who allah gave guidance to why didn't they correct us it is the duty of every muslim that conveys the message of islam to the non-muslims suppose if you have a neighbor who is a mushrik and if you have not conveyed the message of islam to him and if he dies allah will ask him on the day of judgment why didn't you accept islam he will say allah no one gave me the message he said i give the message directly to you you did shirk you'll go to hell allah will ask you next did you convey the message to your neighbor non-muslim neighbor and if you say no you will follow him you will follow him it's the duty of every muslim that he should convey the message of allah to those who are not aware of it"
