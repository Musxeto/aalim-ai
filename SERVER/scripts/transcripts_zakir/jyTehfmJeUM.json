  "transcript": "many imams recite the Quran in a very fast way during the or they also perform and in a fast manner which makes it difficult for the followers to supplicate properly is it allowed to pray in this manner it is very common that many of the mosques because they want to finish the full Quran in the month of Ramadan in and they want to make it as short as possible so people finish it they do recite very fast and very often you see that they go in the ru and suud very fast and many of time once I was in one of the mosques and when the Imam went in the sujud I went after him he got up again went again I was getting my full sud and he was doing second sudar is it right or is it wrong it's it's mentioned in s bukari number one in the book of Salah Hadith number 757 that once the prophet enters the mosque and there is another man who follows him he offers the Salah and after offering Salah that man he wishes the prophet asalamu alaykum the prophet greets back and says that go back and pray because you have not prayed the man goes back and he comes back to the prophet the prophet says go back and pray you have not prayed again the person goes for the third time he pray and he comes back the prophet again says go back and pray for you have not prayed for the third time so the man says I cannot pray better than this oh Prophet please teach me how to pray so then the prophet says that after seeing the T you recite while standing in the cam as much of the Quran that you know by heart whatever the Quran you know by heart you recite then then you bow down go in your until you at ease and then say glory be to Allah then stand up straight until you're at ease then go and with calmness until you're at ease and then say glory be to Allah who is the most high Thrice then get up again until you're at ease and then continue your prayer like that that means all especially your Ru and your suud and when you get up from your Ru and in between the sujud you should be at ease you can't go up and down fast if you do that it is as though your prayer has not been accepted as though you have not prayed so if you pray in this fast manner where and fast fast it is as though you have not prayed so it is best that you pray slowly with calmness and if you really feel that you can't offer 20 then offer it ra but with peace with ease and with calmness the best is that with peace ease and calmness and long should be long you should not be having competition with the other mosques you know which we have many times when the many M they compete who is going to finish the faster"
