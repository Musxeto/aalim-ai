  "transcript": "Allah said through one of the hadiths that fasting is for me and I shall reward you for it what are the implications of this statement from Allah there are various in which a beloved Prophet Muslim says that public statements number three in the book of fasting Hadith number one eight nine four as well says that all the Deeds of the son of Adam are for himself except for fasting it is for me and it means that all the other acts of worship whether it be Salah whether it be zakat whether all these can be done only for sure the person can do for you just for showing off that he's praying he can give Charities but as far fasting is concerned a person can easily go inside the kitchen inside the room and without anyone seeing he can easily eat so if you truly fast it's only for Allah it cannot be for sure it cannot be for yeah so that's the reason Allah says that all the other acts of son of Adam are for himself but fasting is for me and that is the reason when the Hadith which is mentioned in Suna nissai in the book of fasting Hadith number 2223 where a companion of the prophet peace with him he comes to the prophet and he asks him that tell me which deed that I can do which will be accepted by Allah which is very dear to Allah so Prophet said that you fast you stick to fasting amongst all the deities stick to fasting and that is the reason in another Hadith of say Muslim or number two in the book of fasting Hadith number two five six seven the Beloved Prophet Muslim said that Allah says all the Deeds of the son of Adam offer himself and every deed that he does he gets a reward 10 times or up to 700 times but fasting is for me and I will give him the reward because he leaves his food drink and desires for me so that he says he will give the reward that means in fasting it will be much more inshallah even more than 700 times so therefore because it's only for Allah says that I will give the reward any other disclosed but it means that inshallah much more than 700 times beautiful let's hope that we get as much as 700 times this Ramadan and all the questions inshallah"
