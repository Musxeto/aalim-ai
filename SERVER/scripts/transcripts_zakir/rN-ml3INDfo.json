  "title": "Is it Permissible to Pray 8 Rakaat Taraweeh in a Masjid where 20 Rakaat are Prayed? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Adnan Ibrahim from anant nag Kashmir is it permissible to pray a trakka of taravi in Masjid where 20 rakats are offered before we discuss the question is it permitted to offer eight rakat in a mosque where 20 rakats offered first let us understand which is better offering eight records offering 20 rakats of tarawi I would love it Prophet Muslim said is the right word or terminology for taravi the terminology of taravi came later on decades later on where people used to rest in between Raha so the word is derived from there but the right Arabic word used in the Hadith and you will but the prophet is and the prophet said as far as concerned as much as you can so according to the prophet you can pray to rakat in multiples of two rakats there is no restriction whether you pray to it all are accepted and there are Hadith showing that the sabbas in foreign that the prophet always offered there is no evidence in the full life of the Prophet that he performed and plus with her but the caramel level was always so if you want to follow the practice and the Sunnah of the Prophet together then it is preferable you offer eight but the prophet also said that the longer you offer taravi the longer you stand in prayer in the qayamul so the question is which is more important longer or number of rakat as per the thing of the Prophet you can offer to rakats in multiples there's no restriction so the longer time you spend in Salah is more important than the number of as long as it is the multiples of two suppose someone is offering one hour of taravi which is better offering one hour of taravi eight rakat or one hour of both accepted both are permissible but according to the practice of the prophet is preferable than offering 20 rakat of tarabifawana but both acceptable both are permissible but if someone offers 20 rakataravi for two hours and someone offers eight rakat for one hour then according to me 20 raka for two hours taravi is better than eight rakat for one hour the length the duration of taravi is more important than the raka the longer you stand in front of Allah come into your basic question can a person offer only eight rakat in a mosque which is of frequential is it permissible yes it is promisable but it is not mustahab it is not encouraged number one if you are offering and leaving the jamaat but natural the jamaat is offering 20 rakat for longer time so the sabab that they will get for taravi is more than you it's permissible but which is better of course offering 20 ragas will offer much longer than offering only and point number two our beloved Prophet Muslim said that pray till the Imam prays and if you pray till the end of the Salah till the Imam prays it is as though you have prayed for the full night so if you leave in between but naturally we will not be getting the sourab for praying the full night so according to me it is permissible to pray only eight rakat and live but the afzal Mustafa the better would be complete the full taravi along with the Imam so that you get Musa for praying longer and also gets above for praying for the full night of the answer"
