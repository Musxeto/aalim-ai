thousand while some will say 33 crores 330 million but if you ask a learned Hindu who's well vered with his Hindu scriptures he will tell you that Hindus should believe and worship only one God but the common Hindu he believes in a philosophy known as pantheism the common Hindu says everything is God the snake is God the tree is God the Moon is God the sun is God the monkey is God the human

Creator God if you translate into Arabic it becomes khik so we Muslims have no objection if someone says almighty God is khik or he the Creator or is Brahma but if someone says Brahma is almighty God who has got forehead and on each head is a crown and he has got four hands then we Muslims take strong objection to it because you're going against chapter number four verse number 19 which says of that God there is no pratima there is no image there is no statue there is no sculpture there is no Idol there is no pcture there is no painting there is no patri the other attribute given to almighty God in r book number two him number one is Vishnu Vishnu is the sustainer God if you translate into Arabic it is similar to R we Muslims have got no objection if someone calls almighty God as r or a sustainer or Vishnu but if someone says Vishnu is almighty God who has got four hands and one of his right hand is The discus the chakra the other hand is the Conch he's traveling on on the Sea on the bed of snakes or flying on the bird called as Garuda we Muslims take strong objection to it because because moreover you're going against chapter number 32 verse number three which saysa ATI of that God there is no pratima there is no image there is no Idol there's no sculpture there is no statue there is no picture there is no painting there is no portrait it is further mentioned in r book
