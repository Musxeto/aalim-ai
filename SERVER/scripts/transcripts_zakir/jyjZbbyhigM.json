  "transcript": "my name is ravinder i'm a non-muslim i am a sikh and i believe that all religions are right and there is one god everyone will go to heaven irrespective of being a muslim a sikh etc there are different disciplines to reach him i presume god sikhism islam etc what do you have to say the buddha suppose the question he's a sikh he says all religions are right all right one god so what you have to say we'll all go to heaven brother i am a student of compass religion according to me all religions are not right in the religion itself there are many contradictions in the religious scriptures itself now coming to christianity if you analyze in christianity there are so many contradictions in the bible there are so many things which are unscientific in the bible so bible according to me is a mixture it may contain the word of god it contains the word of prophet it contains the word of historians it even contains pornography to say how can i say that this pornography is the word of god there are many mathematical contributions i can give a talk only in the mistakes in the bible there are so many unscientific things mentioned in the bible the bible says the world is flat i can give a talk on that time doesn't permit me same thing with the vedas though i give talks on the veda there are many things which i disagree in the veda there are things in the veda which say that almighty god created the brahman from the head the shattrath warrior class from the chest the business starts the vaishyas from the thighs and the shudras the low cast from the feet islam doesn't believe the human being have been created in cast and levels so how can you say all religions are right again you go to the hindu scripture it says that if a husband dies then in the pyre the wife should jump the widow which is totally wrong the vedas says that the sun moves around the earth which is unscientific in this by doing comparative religion i cannot say that all religions are right part of all the religions are right you can say that which i wouldn't mind what i'm saying only follow that part which is right what is wrong you don't have to follow so in this way brother i disagree with you i must have compared religion you can see my cassettes i've spoken on various religions on judaism christianity hinduism sikhism buddhism etc so only what is right you have to follow what is wrong you don't have to follow hope answers the question"
