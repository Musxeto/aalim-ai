  "transcript": "and we muslims we prefer calling allah by the arabic word allah instead of the english word god people ask the question why do you call him allah the reason we call allah by the arabic word allah instead of the english word god is because a person can play mischief with the english word god for example if you add s to god it becomes god's plural of god there there's nothing like plural if you add b e f s to god it becomes goddess meaning a female god there's nothing like male allah or female allah he has got no gender the moment you add father to god it becomes godfather he's my godfather he's my guardian there's nothing like allah father or allah in islam if you add mother to god it becomes god mother there's nothing like allah mother or allah a mean islam allah is a unique word if you prefix a tin before god it becomes 10 god meaning a fake god there's nothing like tina and islam that's the reason we muslims we prefer calling allah by the arabic word allah instead of the english word god but when the muslims are speaking to non-muslims who may not understand the concept of allah and when they use this word god instead of allah i've got no objection but i would like to remind them that god is not the appropriate translation of the arabic word allah but when we speak to non-muslims then you use this word i've got no objection"
