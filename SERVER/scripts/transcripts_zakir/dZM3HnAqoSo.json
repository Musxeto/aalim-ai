  "title": "Is taking permission from the First wife compulsory for second Marriage? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my next question is um islam allows marriages um i mean a husband to marry more than one wife four wives is it um compulsory to take the permission from the wife before marrying the second one because a lot of muslim girls have told me that you know they have to take permission from the first wife so our interests are taken care of i hope you don't intend to become muslim and marry more than one wife no i don't know because because there's a new law in the indian government if a hindu converts to muslim and marries more than one wife then there's a problem yeah there's a new law that that's why i don't intend to but i just need to find out don't intend to marry i don't intend to convert well i won't answer that now there was another question that is it compulsory that the husband should take the permission of his first wife before he marries a second wife as a general rule because it is mentioned in the quran that a man can have more than one wife it is not required for a man to take the permission of first five but it is preferably takes permission or at least informs her as far as permission certain conditions become compulsory during a nikka during a marathon contract a man or a woman before they get married they can put any conditions which are permitted if the woman puts the condition in the nikanama that my husband will not take a second wife as long as i live because marrying more than one wife is optional so if she puts the condition then it becomes compulsory for the husband to take the permission of the wife otherwise he cannot marry if this is not mentioned in the nikanama if it's not mentioned in the military contract it's not a must it is preferable hope to answer the question thanks"
