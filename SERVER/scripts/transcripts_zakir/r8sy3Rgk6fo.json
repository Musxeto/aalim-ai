  "transcript": "and brother have any question how do we refute the allegation of uh anthromorphism in the Quran for example uh the hand of Allah the right hand of Allah and in the sight of Allah and there is a saying that on the last day on the day of qayama everybody will witness uh seeing Allah so how do we refute that allegation people say that the Quran itself gives a form to Allah asks the question that how do you refute the anthropomorphism philosophy which Islam doesn't believe in but how does Islam talk about Allah has got hands and the dirt doesn't mean you see Allah basically understand what is the meaning of anthropomorphism anthropomorphism means almighty God himself coming in different forms and picking those form that you know about so for example for a human being a human being will think about a human being an animal is think about an animal so for the animal it's an animal but because he's God coming in the form of animal for an animal even the human Mission respect that animal God so that's how we have gods in all types of forms what you can imagine what you can think so therefore we say that Islam doesn't believe in anthropomorphism the basic philosophy of the anthropomorphism it is that almighty God Is So Superior he's so holy he's so Pious he does not know the shortcomings of the human beings anthropomorphism for the human being I'm talking about so the human being says that he's so holy he's so pure he does not know how the human being feel when he's hurt when he's in problem when he's in trouble so almighty God becomes a human being to know what is good or what is bad for the human being on the face of it very good logic almighty God for Holy so pure so Pious does not know the shortcomings of human beings he becomes a human being and understand the system and then he says what is good what is wrong for the human being for example if I make a VCR a video cassette recorder do I have to become a video cassette recorder to know what is good or what is bad for obesia no since I am the manufacturer since I'm a Creator I don't have to become a VCR to know what is good or what is bad for the VCR what do I do I write an instruction manual the instruction manual for the human beings it is the Glorious Quran manual that if you want to play the video cassette insert the video cassette and press the play button if you want to stop press the stop button if you want to fast forward press the FF button don't drop it from a high degree damaged don't immersion water it'll get spoiled I write an instruction manual similarly for the human beings Allah is the creator and the best instruction manual for the human media as I mentioned earlier it is a glorious Quran the do's and don'ts for human being is mentioned here now after giving this argument I have brother rightly said that some people may misunderstand and say okay Allah has got hands Allah has got formed so isn't it going against the argument the answer is given in sureshwara chapter number 42 verse number 11 that is nothing whatever like him means like Allah there's nothing he hears and he sees but doesn't she and you're like you and me Allah says in the Quran 112 verse number four then nothing like him again number 42 verse number 11 that nothing comparable anything to Allah so when Allah talks about hands it's not like the hands that we have got five fingers like this line Allah then and how Allah something Allah has given description of certain office things in the Quran and mentioned we agree other things he has and and how Allah he hears yes he hears how Allah whether he requires the same sound waves like us is different absolutely different we require sound waves we require a year we require all gain everything Allah hears but not like you and me so that's the reason it doesn't fall in the category of anthropomorphism in the other religions an anthropomorphism it is same like a human being when that God becomes a human being with another religions whether it be Hinduism or Christianity he requires to eat he requires to sleep Allah says in Surah chapter 6 verse 14 that he feedeth everyone but does not require to be fed they're all the gods in other religions they require to Sleep Number Two verse number 255 that is eternal he's absolute he does not require rest he does not sleep talking cheese so therefore when Allah says he has got hand yes yes an anthropomorphism doesn't mean you cannot see what we say that in this form we cannot see Allah and live but in the next life will surely see Allah therefore when the Hadith is mentioned that on the day of judgment after that if we go inshallah we pray to Allah that we go to Jannah if you go to Jannah the thing would be seeing the different of Allah Faith like you and me like the way we have lips and nose and eyes so similar when I say hands yes Allah how alone so it is not the same as the philosophy in other religions therefore the world of a difference he's our creator he's on a different level altogether"
