  "transcript": "why in the starting of Surah Toba there's no bah why if you read the first few verses of Surah Toba we come to know that there is a peace treaty between the Muslims and the mushrik of Makkah this peace treaty was unilaterally broken by the mushrik of Makkah when Allah reaches was number five he's giving them a warning put things straight in four months time otherwise a declaration of war when Allah is giving us the warning bismah is uncalled for for example if someone snatches the handbag of your mother or of your wife on the streets of Abuja and runs away when you catch up with that Thief will you sayum you say hey mister give me the handbag back I'll break your arm hey mister give me me the hand back back I'll break your neck bismah is uncalled for you not say assalam alikum peace be on you you will get down to the subject directly similarly Allah subhana wa ta'ala when he's giving a very strong warning to the Musik of Makkah he gets down to the subject directly bismah is uncalled for therefore I say Surah Toba is one of the most militant Surah of the Glorious Quran"
