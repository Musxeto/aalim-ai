  "title": "Fasting Increases Taqwa - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "one of the said main objectives actually of fasting is the next question taqwa what I understand is the fear of Allah or the being aware of Allah could you explain this concept the concept of Aqua so the viewers will be able to take maximum benefit from that information that they could fast better just to give an example is like if you're walking in a very narrow Lane which has got a lot of thorns there are plants and creepers and trees with a lot of thorns and you walk in that Narrow Lane trying to prevent your clothes from getting stuck in the thorn and getting torn so how well you do that that is an action of taqwa linguistically takwa comes from the Arabic root word Waka which means forbearance which means fear which means abstinence islamically it means fear of Allah islamically taqwa is the state of the heart of a human being and the consciousness of Allah the consciousness of his presence and of his knowledge which makes him do the righteous Deeds and it prevents them from doing things with shaharam and makes him pious if you translate one word people translate as God Consciousness or Allah's Consciousness is translated as piety it's translated as righteousness in short and taqwa actually as the blood Prophet said it is a shield and taqwa is The Shield which prevents you from the Hellfire and it prevents you from the punishment of Allah and there are various verses of the Quran which speak about taqwa Allah says in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter number three verse number 102. oh you believe foreign that means the Believers should feel Allah and die not accept in the state of Islam with him while giving commentary of the first he says it means that the Believers have to obey Allah should not disobey him they have to remember him they should not forget him they should be thankful to him and they should not be ungrateful and the criteria for judgment in the sight of Allah for judging any human being it is 13. yeah means which means or humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into Nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other not that you shall despise each other and the most honored in the sight of Allah is the criteria for judgment inside of Allah it's not sex it's not color it's not caste it's not money it's not wealth it's not age but it is taqwa it is God Consciousness it is piety it is righteousness only way one human being can be superior to the other it is and our beloved Prophet Muslim he used to always encourage the Sabah and he always give guidance to his companions that they should increase in takla and especially when they went on a military Expedition he always said that fear Allah have taqwa and that was followed later on by the sahabas and giving advice and and we also have Hadith him that and fear Allah and he said you fear Allah and he will protect you have taka of Allah and he will protect you and he further said that if you give and if you thank Allah he will increase here we realize that there are many verses in the Quran which Allah gives us guidance about for example Allah says that is the criteria for a person to acquire righteousness and Allah to accept your Deeds Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 33 verse number 1771 oh you believe Allah and those who obey Allah and his messenger they are the people who will achieve a great reward would have reached a Higher Achievement message chapter number five verse number 27 Bella says that Allah accepts the acts of those those are Allah that means Allah accepts the Deeds of the people who have taqwa Point number two those people who have taqwa they gain the pleasure and love of Allah as Allah says in Surah Chapter 14 verse number 13. that the most Honorable in the sight of Allah is the person Allah says in the Quran Imran chapter number three verse number 76 whoever fulfills his pledge indeed Allah loves those Allah the third point of Festival is concerned Allah says in the Quran that because of Allah forgives their sins and increase your reward Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 65. verse number five that anyone who fulfills this Duty Allah forgives his sins he remits his sins and increases reward the fourth Point mentioned in the Quran those who have taqwa Allah keeps them on the straight path and prevents them from deviation Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number eight verse number 29. oh you believe half taqwa and Allah will give you the foreign and there are various commentaries given some people said that means the straight path some people of the community said that furukan means Paradise so if you have taqwa then you will go to paradise further it's mentioned in the Quran Allah says in the Quran in Surah Hadith chapter 57 verse number 28. that those who have takawa and those who believe in the messenger Allah gives them a light baby so taqwa keeps you on the straight path and prevents you from deviation how to achieve this taqwa Allah says chapter number two verse number 21. oh humankind worship thy Lord who has created you and created those people who came before you so that you may learn so if you worship your lord who has created you and people who came before you you will learn Allah says chapter 2 verse sayam fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-restraint the word so that you may learn so here there are two examples given how can you learn taqwa one example and we know Salah is the best pillar that a Muslim is supposed to offer Salah he has to pray to Allah five times a day and this keeps him on the straight path and this increases taqwa and the second thing one is the daily activity and Ramadan fasting is the annual activity like how a body requires overhauling once every year every machine requires servicing some require one someone some require quarterly some require early and if you allow me to call the human being a machine it is the most complicated machine on the Earth the only thing you requests everything so Ramadan is the overhauling is the servicing of the human body body as well as Soul once a year during the month of Ramadan and this increases the taqwa it increases the god Consciousness righteousness piety as we discussed in all these days and I'll let you give an example there was a sahaba when nantan was coming Makkah used to be very hot so he is traveling towards Tafe just a couple of days before ramnan and there's a Bedouin who's traveling the opposite direction from theft Makkah so this Sabha asked him that aren't you afraid of the Heat in Makkah during Ramadan so he says I am running away from the Hellfire so that gives an example of who is most righteous Allah says chapter number 22 verse number 32 honor the symbols of Allah he is the person 204 that you may be dazzled with some people's speech and they may swear by Allah that the heart is clean but Allah knows there's these people their vicious enemies of humankind Allah says in the Quran talking about awlias the friend of Allah Allah says chapter number 10 verse number 16-63 that those people who have takwa are the people who are all ears of Allah means a friend of Allah that means those people who have taklavia Allah these are the people who are only as of Allah Allah further says number 34 Allah says but most of them realize not so these are the few verses and many other verses which Allah speaks about Quran may Allah enable us to be with full taqwa this Ramadan all of us inshallah"
