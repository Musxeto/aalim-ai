  "title": "If a Muslim doctor dies while treating a patient of COVID 19, will he get the Sawaab of a Martyr?",
  "transcript": "there's a question posed on the facebook by abdul rahman assalamu alaikum brother suppose a muslim doctor does while treating a corvette 19 patient dieza suppose a muslim doctor dies many times o becomes i so it says does but i realize when i when i type i want to type on it becomes when i want to drop any becomes o so if suppose a muslim doctor dies while treating a corvette 19 patient does he get the reward of a mata and i quoted the hadith earlier in my first session as well as the second session that a beloved prophet muhammad said it's hadith of say buhari hadith number 5734 that that a plague is sent by allah as a punishment to the believers to the unbelievers to whoever he wants but as for the believers the plague is a blessing and if a believer sin with sincere faith if he stays in the place where plague is there and he believes that nothing will befall him except what allah has ordained for him then he will get the sava of a martyr and if nader i said this there are three categories of people here that if a person who dies in the plague he yet gets the sabbath if a person gets infected by plague but does not die yet he gets a swab of matter and if a person doesn't get infected yet he believes and has faith in allah yet he gets a sahaba for martyr if he dies another hadith is called as a matter but let me differentiate between the plague and corvette 19 coronavirus disease 2019 plague is an epidemic so for plague you get the server of a matter but for every for every epidemic you will not get the saab of matter a plague is an epidemic due to bacteria it is bacterial carbon 19 is viral it's an epidemic but it's not bacterial and plus there is another hadith of the prophet muslim that where the prophet said that the plague will never enter madina and another says that the plague and the dajjal will not enter makkah so the plague cannot enter madina cannot enter madi makkah and we know today that the government is taking precaution makkah madina so why should they take precaution of of covert 19. but carbon 19 is not a plague so corbett 19 is an epidemic but it's not a play so the hadith says if you die of plague you are a martyr if you die in a place where plague is there even if you don't die as long as you sincere faith your faith and not your faith in allah nothing will happen except what allah wills then you get the sabbath from mata irrespective you die or you don't die but carbon 19 is not a plague so please do not mistake in yourself that every epidemic is a plague so if a patient dies of carbon 19 or a doctor dies while treating the patient because he's treating a patient he's trying to save a human life allah says in the quran in surah maidah chapter number 5 verse number 32 if you save one human being it's as though you have saved the whole humanity so he'll get the reward for saving a human being or saving the whole of humanity but he will not be called as a matter he will not get the sabab of a matter hope that answers the question you"
