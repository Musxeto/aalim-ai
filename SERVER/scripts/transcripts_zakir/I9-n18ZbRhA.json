  "transcript": "there's one post that came with my photograph very good quality photograph Prophet says that the women are 90% to blame for the rape mean the women when they are raped 90% is their fault and it continues and says all rubbish and then say that in Islam the woman is made to satisfy the sexual urges of the man and if a woman if she satisfies the husband she's serving Allah so all these you know Post in the name of prophet mmad in the Hadi anyone of the Muslim will know that nobody did the prophet say that 90% of the rape cases are because of the blame on the woman so they say many things in the name of Islam so the way they say it you can come to know this is made by non-muslim because the Muslim will never write such things in the name of the Prophet so this in short was just a brief that when you find any post in anybody's name the social media if you're not Savvy with the social media when you search on the Google you should know the statistic how do you come to know authentic or not when not doing research how do you come to know on the Wikipedia everything on the Wikipedia is not true according to statistics two3 of what is said on the Wikipedia is true"
