  "transcript": "next question from NAD Ahmed assalamu alaykum sir is using credit card Halal if you're talking about the conventional credit card where where the bank gives you permission that you can utilize x amount of money depending upon the credit card whether it is bronze level silver level gold level depending upon the amount some give you $2,000 some give $10,000 some give $440,000 depending upon the level and this money that you utilize you have to give within one or two months and if you give that then there is no interest if you give above that then there is an exob interest which goes to up to maybe 3% a month that is 36% anywhere from 2 to 3% a month that is 24 to 36% a year which is exorbitant and I know there are some Scholars who say that if you're using a credit card as long as you see to it you pay within the stipulated time within the one month or two month frame and no interested that's permitted I disagree with it it is totally Haram the moment you take a credit card from a conventional Bank you are signing a document saying that if you do not pay it in time you will give RBA signing a document that you will pay is also har Allah and hiso will w a war against you so even using a credit card with the intention that you will not take longer than the time permitted I know majority of the Muslims living in Western countries in America in European countries in UK have a credit card from a conventional Bank majority unfortunately I know there are Scholars of the Western countries that me permission it is 100% totally Haram all the major Scholars whether it be whether it be sh bin Bas majority have said even having a credit card of conventional bank if Haram because you're signing and who can give guarantee that you'll always pay on time you're a human being you can make a mistake if once also you forget to pay on time it is Haram Allah and against to even if you pay on time regularly only signing a document is Haram so using a credit card of a conventional bank is totally Haram I'm aware there are some Scholars that have given permission I disagree with them what you can do is you can can have a credit card from Islamic Bank if it's Islamic Bank you can have a credit card the other what you can do is have a debit card debit card means the money is already in your account that you're not signing a document saying that you pay interest so debit card in a conventional bank is permitted credit card in a conventional bank is Haram however credit card in Islamic Bank is permitted because it works on the Islamic principles on the Sharia basis there is no Reba involved in this so the best option is have a credit card Islamic Bank the second option is have a debit card in a conventional bank which does not attract any interest but credit card in a conventional bank is Haram it's a major sin it is equivalent to doing Z with your mother that's what a prophet said it is clearly mentioned in must Alim Hadith number 2259 that there are 73 levels of RBA the lowest level is doing Z with your mother and it's clearly mentioned in the Quran in Sur Bak chap 2 vers 27 279 that if you give up not the demands of RBA take notice of from Allah and his so I request all the Muslims in any part of the world if you have a credit card from any of the conventional Bank please today itself if not today tomorrow please discontinue it open an Islamic Bank if you don't have Islamic Bank convert it into a debit card debit card is permissible where there's no re hope that answerers the question"
