  "title": "The Quran Mentions that the Sun Rotates about its Axis 1400 years ago - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "previously the european scientists they believed that the earth was the center of the solar system and the universe and all the planets as well as the moon and the sun it revolved around the earth this was called as geocentrism and this was believed since the time of ptolemy in the second century bc till as late as 16th century until nicolas copernicus in 1512 he propounded the heliocentric theory of the planetary motion and he said it is the sun which is the center of the solar system and all the planets as well as the earth it revolves around the sun and later on a german scientist by the name of johannes kepler in 1609 he wrote in his book by the name astronomianovia that not only do the planets and the earth they revolve around the sun but they also rotate about their own axis and when i was in school i passed my school 1982 about more than 25 years back there i too read that the planets and the earth they revolve around the sun and the planets and the earth they rotated about their own axis and the whole solar system also in the galaxy it revolved including the sun but the sun did not rotate about its own axis in this context the sun was stationary but when i read the verse of the quran in surah ambiya chapter number 21 verse number 33 which says it is allah was created the night and the day was each one traveling in orbit with its own motion so the quran says the sun and the moon besides revolving they also rotate about their own axis the arabic word used here is yas bahun derived from the arabic word sabaha which describes the motion of a moving body if i use this arabic word yes baha for a person who's moving on the floor it will not mean that he's rolling it will mean he's either walking or running if i use the same word for a person in the water it will not mean it's floating it will mean swimming similarly when allah uses the same word for a celestial body it does not mean that it is flying in the air it means it is moving along with its own rotation it is rotating about its own axis so quran says the sun and the moon besides revolving it also rotates about its own axis and today science has discovered that even the sun rotates since we can't see the sun directly you get blinded if you see directly if you have an equipment and have the image of the sun on a table top we find that there are spots in the sun and it takes about 25 days for the spots to complete one rotation indicating that the sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one rotation imagine when i was in school i was thought the sun was stationed i didn't know about phone access and the quran mentioned 14 years ago that it rotates and now alhamdulillah most of the schools have incorporated that the sun also rotates"
