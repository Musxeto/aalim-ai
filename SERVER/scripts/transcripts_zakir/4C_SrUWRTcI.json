  "transcript": "the question which when I studied with Jannah that when we talk about Quran and say Hadith we don't have all the say Hadith compiling the maximum I could do I stayed with him in the year 1997. we could say okay but that doesn't have all just say Hadith it contains books so alhamdulillah after Sheikh they are a man asked me he retired there are many scholars in the last 49 years who tried to compile all the sayadi together in one volume but all those who tried they never completed the project alhamdulillah after he retired he took about 17 to 18 years to complete this project and he compiled all the sahitya together and he compiled in a book called the full name is short form it's called and about four years ago he compiled it and the first edition was published and after it was published the revision was done about two years before and it was printed just in this year and alhamdulillah after the second edition was printed and published he checked it up and he was happy that at least the reward Edition was out though he wrote the manuscript in 20 volumes it was printed the first edition in 12 volumes the second edition because the print was larger it came in 18 volumes he also made a muktasar Jamaica in five volumes in the original Jamaica Mill asmi said there were more than a million Hadith out of the million Hadith there are many duplicates like inside bukhari if you remove the duplicates there are 2220 Hadith so if you compile all the one million Hadith and remove the duplicates according to say there were about sixty thousand Hadith from the sixty thousand Hadith he collected only the say Hadith removing the duplicates and in his Jamaica Mill There are 16 546 Hadith after removing the duplicates the Sai Hadith today in the world are sixteen thousand five hundred and forty six and we can safely say if not hundred percent at least this compilation of his contains 95 percent of the say Hadith in his compilation he has given the huja he has his own criteria he compiled all the Hadith which acai and remove the duplicates he gave a reason that if the Hadith was sahih and according to him it was safe he even mentioned that outside is Jamaica so there are additional 3000 Hadith which other Scholars say it is sahih but he says it is safe and he gives and he mentions it so that people don't think he has forgotten then he has even added in that 3000 Hadith the very common Hadith famous Hadith but they are they famous for example the very common and famous Hadith Hadith that as far as you go to acquire knowledge no problem I mean if you go to China China was never the seat of knowledge at the time of the Prophet Hadith so he mentioned this famous Hadith but did not say Hadith when giving his reason so totally contained 16 546 Hadith plus approximately three thousand Hadith which Adam was this in assets say and he says it is safe or the other famous so people don't think he has missed out and in this the big volume which is printed 12 volume in the first edition it is the second edition this has given the takrit the details why they say why it is safe and all the reasoning and if the Hadith is that he gives the references there in say bukhari Hadith number four and so including say Muslim Hadith number so and so including buddhao Hadith number so and so so after the end of every Hadith it is available in three books of Hadith or I will five books of a date oh two books of Aditi or only one book of Hadith the details are given so that you come to know from where it comes in the muktasar Jamaica Mill which is in five volumes the takrish the research has been removed so that it's easy for element to read so the complete Jamaica is mainly for Scholars and for the more they seen foreign translating it into English it was a three years project we started it about four years back but unfortunately when the translation was complete I was then happy with the English language so we are revising it so now we have completed one third of the revision inshallah next year by the end of next day it will be out so we will inshallah translate the mukta sir which is in five volumes and it will be easy for people who don't Arabic to read it and to understand it we are translating also into Urdu and other languages repeat Allah this work is a phenomenal work Malik foreign that we know that bukhari and Muslim are only two books which are 100 authentic and Scholar women say that Imam Mata Malik also for a Layman if he wants to know he cannot do research if that is safely otherwise he has to check whether they say he or not"
