  "transcript": "sister posed a very good question that when I say that hijab is required for a woman isn't it not degrading for the woman to pize it isn't it degrading if you read the Quran the Quran and Islam has prescribed hijab that means the woman should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and the hands up to the wrist this is for the modesty and it is not only mentioned in the Quran it is also mentioned in the bible if if you read the Bible in the 1 Timothy chapter number 2 verse number 9 it says that women should be dressed up with shamefacedness they should be dressed up with sobriety and should not wear braided hair or gold or pearls it's further mentioned in the First Corinthians chapter number 11 verse number five six the woman that does not cover a head then she dishonors a head a head should be shaved off anyway I don't agree with this I'm just quoting you from the Bible"
