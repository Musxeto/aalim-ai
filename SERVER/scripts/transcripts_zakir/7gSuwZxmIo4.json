  "transcript": "Ahmed studying in Candi Sri Lanka assalam sirum Asam is having bodyguards permissible in Islam the question posed is is having bodyguards permissible if it's a requirement and as long as you're not breaking any Ru of the Sharia then it's permissible even the prophet during times of trouble during times of War he had to protect him whether to call them bodyguards or not so having bodyguards is per you know there are many people who are not on the straight path gangsters are bodyguards there are people who are holigans are bodyguards so if you're a gangster causing loss to the people and having bodyguards then that act of being a gangster itself is wrong that act of you doing something Haram and the like you have caused damage to many people you have looted many people you have C loss to many people and you feel somebody will attack you and then you keep a bodyguard then that act only is wrong and that bodyguard also he a Muslim he cannot protect someone who is a robber he cannot protect so the two parts of this answer one is can you have and can the Muslim be a bodyguard so so if you are for example there are some Dies who may fear that because of Da someone may attack them and that was the case during the prophet and the saas so then you have bodyguard no problem or if you are on Quran and Sunnah if you're not doing anything wrong and then your bodyguard is per it is perfect perfectly promis some people may say that okay you have of course you have faith in Allah but Allah says tie your camel and then trust in God you cannot leave your camel and then trust in God so having bodyguard is permissible in Islam that doesn't mean you don't trust Allah but your mean security is Allah subhana tala the people who will protect you man is Allah whether Through The Bodyguard or through other things that's different now regarding a Muslim can he be a bodyguard can he be a security guard yes if he's securing a place which is halal no problem if he's securing a supermarket in which Halal goods are sold no problem but can he be a security officer of a riba bank and answer is no can he be a security of security officer of a gambling den and the answer is no because activity there is Haram it's a gambling Den so he can't be a security guard of a gambling Den he cannot be security guard of alcohol shop but he can be security guard of a premises which is permitted of a supermarket which is selling Halal Goods similarly he can be a bodyguard of a person who is not causing loss to do not doing anything Haram he can be a bodyguard of a businessman who's very rich and he's earning Halal but he feels that somebody May attack him no problem he can be a bodyguard of someone who is a or someone who a very influential person but he cannot be a bodyguard of a gangster he cannot be a bodyguard of a person who's a rafian a person who's called lost to the um so both way as long as you're on the Quran and Sunnah and having a bodyguard is no problem at all it's permissible"
