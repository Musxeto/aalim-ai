  "title": "Reply to Muslims who do not want to Give the Quran to Non Muslims because they are Unclean",
  "transcript": "we muslims we unfortunately want to sit on the quran like a cobra neither do we read it neither do we want the others to read it and many of the muslims they quote the quran saying that quran cannot be given to the non-muslim because allah says in the quran and they quote surah walk yeah chapter number 56 verse number 77 to 80 where it says that this is the quran which is kept in a tablet well preserved who none shall touch except those who are pure it is from the lord of the worlds and many muslims say that see the quran says none shall touch the quran except those who are pure and the non-muslim strategies the they're unclean that's the reason these non-muslims they cannot touch the quran if we read the new quran why were these verses revealed we come to know that the mushriks and the kuffars of makkah the laid allegation that this quran knows bella are the words of the satan the words of shaitaan allah reveals this that none can touch the arabic word use this that means a book well preserved it's does not refer to this glorious quran this book quran in arabic is called as a mushaf what the quran is referring to if it cross reference of surah chapter 95 verse number 21 22 which says that allah has kept the quran in a tablet well preserved in lahi mahfuz so this quran which is being referred is referred to the law of mahfuz the tablet well preserved the book well preserved it's not talking about this quran because if it was this quran and if the arabic word use mutaharim that it means that only body cleanliness then any non-muslim can easily go to the marketplace and buy a copy of the quran for 150 rupees for 200 rupees for four dollars for five dollars and the quran will be proved wrong the mutha harin word used does not refer only to body cleanliness it refers to a person who's pure in heart and mind in soul person who's sinless referring to the angels that none will be able to touch the quran in the tablet well preserved lord my fools except the angels trying to give a reply to the allegations of the mushriks of makkah that this quran was not the words of the satan so this verse of the quran does not indicate that a person should be pure in body if he is it's good it is mustaf but it's not a must and furthermore even if it was a requirement imagine even if it was a requirement if a person's shirk can be removed from his life even if you consider this as a small mistake to touch the quran without vudu yet removing the shirk which is the biggest sin in islam to do a small mistake to remove the biggest sin in islam it is yet a very good bargain but the scholars of tafsir they say this world does not refer and does not indicate that a person should be in voodoo to touch the quran but being in wudhu is good it is mustaf alhamdulillah but not a must there are many people many muslims who tell me okay brother zakir give the quran to the non-muslim but only give the english translation don't give the arabic text or give the hindi translation the urdu translation i've got no problem if someone only gives the translation of the quran but i personally prefer giving the arabic text along with the translation why because the translation is the work of a human being and no human being is perfect as i mentioned earlier that no translation is perfect and if there is a mistake in the translation it will not be attributed to allah because if we check it up with the arabic text besides the translation we can easily verify that if there's a mistake in the translation it is the work of the human being and not of allah so i personally prefer giving along with the translation the arabic text so that if there is a mistake allah he'll not be responsible it is responsibility of the translator and furthermore if allah holds me responsible i will be in good company i'll be in the company of the beloved prophet muslim why because if you read the theory of the prophet he dictated letters to non-muslim kings in which he dictated verses of the quran he told the sahabas he dictated letters to non-muslim kings in which he dictated verse of the quran he sent letters to  of abyssinia to emperor hirakulus emperor of persia king of yemen king of egypt many of these kings alhamdulillah accepted islam but some of them david told the letter some of them even trampled it beneath the feet imagine the verses of the quran dictated by the prophet they were torn by these kings and some of them even trampled it beneath the feet and one such letter is available in the kaptaki museum in turkey in which the prophet had dictated the voice of the quran of imran chapter number 3 verse number 64 he says say o people of the book come to common terms as us and you which is the first term that we worship none but allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves lords and patriots other than allah find our law if then they turn back witness that we are muslims bowing away to allah this verse of the quran was dictated to the non-muslim kings by the beloved prophet muhammad it's yet available in the museum the cop talking museum in turkey and i want to ask you the question today there are about 14 million arabs who are coptic christians who are christians since generations i'm asking the question which translation of the quran will you give to these 14 million coptic arab christians do you want to translate the arabic quran into arabic again you will have to give the original text to these christian arabs once in arabic as a language arabic is the mother tongue which translation will you give will you give the urdu translation will you give the english translation you have to give the original kalam of allah that's the reason i personally prefer along with the translation with the original arabic text and the quran was revealed for the whole of humankind and the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him was sent as a messenger to the whole of humankind"
