  "transcript": "Dr zakya what is the essential difference between the term Toba and the term meaning I believe forgiveness means forgiveness and means speaking forgiveness isar the meaning is of two types one type of meaning is when it comes along with the word Toba and the other meaning is when it comes individually when it comes individually it has one and the same meaning the meaning can be interchanged it means exactly the same but the scholars they say when it comes along with the word Toba then it means that we are seeking protection from the past evils that we used to do and Toba when it comes along withar it means that we are repentant to Allah subhana wa ta'ala and we are seeking protections from the things which we may indulge in future so basically means seeking protection from the things of the past which we used to do and Toba seeking protection for the things which may unfortunately we indulge in future so this is the basic difference if it comes separately the meaning is one and the same if it comes together then it has two different meanings it's good we're going through this technical definition phase in every episode I think this is something which is missing amongst the brothers and sisters is the real understanding of the basic terms the next question really for me would be why is it such a special thing to seek repentance during this holy blessed month of Ramadan this month is special because Allah subhana wa ta'ala he forgives his slaves his servants the maximum in this month therefore it is given the title Ramadan the month of forgiveness and our beloved Prophet wasallam said it's mentioned in the ofi in the book of fast thing Number 682 where our beloved Prophet wasallam said that when the first night of Raman comes the devils and the demons they are chained and the gates of hell are closed not even a single gate is open and the Gates of Heaven they open not even a single gate is closed and the caller he calls to the people that oh those who wanted good please come and those who are doing evil please desist and Allah subhana wa ta'ala he ransoms his slaves and he does that every night of Ramadan and beloved prophet wasallam he further said it's mentioned a of Hadith number 3545 where the Beloved Prophet M wasallam once he goes on the pulpit before giving kba and he says a mean a mean a mean thce the people ask that oh messenger why so the Messer of Allah subh tala says that Archangel Gabriel had come to him and said that anyone who does not have his sins forgiven after Ramadan has approached and enters the Hellfire ask Allah to keep a distance from him and then Gabriel says to mamm wasallam say a meanall says a mean means it's unfortunate that anyone Witnesses the month of Ramadan and does not have his sins forgiven because this is the month of forgiveness and our beloved Prophet mam said it's mentioned bukari Vol number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1901 that if anyone fasts in the complete month of Ramadan with belief and seeking the reward of Allah subhana waala all his pastes will be forgiven that's the reason Ramadan is called as the month of forgiveness Subhan Allah and Dr zakya we used to have a saying back in the days before I embraced Islam that I wish it could be Christmas every day and I'm going to say I wish it could be Ramadan every day now more appropriately what about the necessities of seeking repentance especially during this holy month of Ramadan and what are the merits of seeking forgiveness it is compulsory for every believer of Allah subhana wa tala for every Muslim that if he does anything whether minor or major small or big he should repent as soon as possible repentance is compulsory for any sin that you've committed and Allah says in the Quran in Sur n chapter number 24 verse number 31 oh you believe turn altogether in dependence to Allah subhana wa ta'ala so that you may attain Bliss so that you may become successful so that you may enter Paradise Allah gives a similar message in Surah chapter number 66 verse number eight that oh you believe turn to Allah subhah wa ta'ala with sincere repentance and Allah further says in the Quran in Surah Hood chapter number 11 verse number three that ask for forgiveness to Allah subhana taala and seek his repentance so that he may do good to you Allah says in the Quran in sh chapter number 42 verse number 25 that he accepts repentance and forgives sins and ask forgiveness for Allah subhana wa ta'ala is of forgiving and most merciful and Allah says in the Quran in Sur MAA chapter number 5 verse number 39 that if the thief if he repents and if he changes his acts after repenting if he has changed his acts then Allah subhana wa taala turns to him in forgiveness for Allah subhana wa taala is of forgiving and most merciful Allah repeats the similar message in MA chapter number five verse number 74 that ask Allah subhana tala for forgiveness for he's of forgiving and most merciful besides sever verses of the Quran there are sever Hadith which speaks about the Merit of of Toba for example if read theith of a beloved Prophet wasallam inkari volume number eight book of applications Hadith number 6307 where I beloved Prophet M wasallam he says that I ask for forgiveness and repentance more than 17 times a day imagine our beloved Prophet m s Ali wasallam who's the best of examples who's the best human being on the face of the Earth he says that he ask for forgiveness and repentance Allah subhana wa ta'ala more than 70 times a day it further mentioned in sah Muslim volume number four in the book of Dick Hadith number 6523 where a beloved propham said oh Believers you should repent and I Repent every day 100 times to Allah subhana tala it's mentioned in the Hadith of say Muslim volume number four in in the book of repentance Hadith number 6644 that our beloved Prophet wasam said that Allah subhana wa tala stretches out his hand during the night for the people who repent for the sins they have committed from dawn to dusk and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala stretches out his hand during the day for the people who repent for the sins they have committed from Dust to Dawn until the sun rises from the West that means until the day of Resurrection that means Allah subhana tala will forgive your sins until the day of Resurrection whoever repents a similar Hadith is mentioned in s Muslim Point number four in the book ofar Hadith number 6525 where our beloved Prophet mallam said that Allah subhah wa ta'ala will keep on forgiving for anyone who repents until the sun rises from the West that mean Allah subhana wa tala will forgive the sins until the day of Resurrection if any of his slaves any of his servants ask for forgiveness further it's mentioned inkari number8 in the book of Rec Hadith number 6438 where the Beloved Prophet mam said that if the son of Adam was given a valley of gold he would yet want a second one and if a second value of gold is given to him he would want the third for there is nothing that fills the stomach of the son of Adam except dust this shows that the greed the human beings have and irrespec of how much n Allah gives he always seeks for more and more rather he should repent and ask for forgiveness and there's a different version of the had that quoted earlier it's mentioned in s Muslim volume number four in the book of Hadith number 6613 where our beloved Prophet said that Allah subhana wa ta'ala is more pleased when his servant repents when his servant asks for forgiveness than a person who while traveling on his camel in the desert he stops for rest and he sleeps beneath a tree and when he wakes up he sees his camel lad in with Goods he's not there so he climbs on a mound and he tries to find the camel he does not find it he climbs on the second Mound but yet doesn't find it he climbs on the third Mound he doesn't find it then he turns back to the original position and there he sees his camel Laden with the goods and he's so happy so Allah subhana wa ta'ala is more happy than a person who finds his lost camel Laden with Goods in the desert Allah is more happy than that when a person asks for forgiveness when he repents so these are the merits of repentance and Toba it reminds me of my own journey to Islam once again month of Ramadan this is when I found my f alhamdulillah"
