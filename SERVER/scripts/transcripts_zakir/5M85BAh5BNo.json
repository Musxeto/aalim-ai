  "transcript": "what is the difference between zakat and zakatul this is again abdullah from riyadh saudi arabia the difference between zakat and zakatel fitter is as we discussed in the earlier session zakat means to purify it means to increase and zakat the future is purification of the fast zakat is mainly to purify your surplus wealth the wealth that is above the nissan level it is to purify your wealth or your farm products or the agricultural products or your wealth above the sub level zagato is to purify your fast zakat has to be given by every individual who has a saving of more than the nisab level or good agricultural products or farm products whereas the castle future has to be given by every muslim unless he is extremely poor or he is extremely needy and has no provision zakat can be given to eight categories of people as we discussed earlier to the focara to the poor people to the masaken to the needy to the amalun those who collect zakat the mallaputra those whose hearts are coming towards islam to harem to debtor to the cab for the fleeing of the slaves ibn sabil the wayfarer and fisabalillah in the way of allah but zakat will feather can only be given to the extremely poor and needy people who don't have provision so the people that can receive the castle fitter a very small percentage as compared to those who can deceive zakat the fourth difference that zakat is a percentage given on your saving above the sub level or on your agriculture farm products whereas zakat said there is a fixed amount it is fixed the prophet said half of wheat or wheat grains or one sar of dates or barley or rice or oats it's fixed it's not a percentage furthermore zakat can be given any part of the year any time but zakat suther has to be given before the idul fitter salah and maximum 48 hours before the israel further sallah and lastly the zakat is obligation it is a pillar of islam the qadhafi is not a pillar of islam but both are if you don't give zakat it becomes a major sin if you don't give the catholic it becomes a minor so this is all in short regarding the difference between zakat and zakat"
