  "title": "Know the Objective of Fasting to Remain Guided after Ramadhaan - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the reason is the same as I mentioned earlier that we should know the objective of fasting if you know the objective of fasting inshallah even after Ramadan is over the person will yet be on the straight path as I mentioned in my example that you should know the method of the Act and the objective so people may know the method how to eat food they make a morcel of the food put it in the mouth masticate to it and put it down the throat so the act the method they know very well that's what they do in the month of Ra n but after that if someone puts a finger in his throat and vomits out so that food will not make him healthy so that's what is happening the main purpose the objective they don't know objective is to increase the tawa to make a person come closer to Allah subhana tala so if that is there in the mind so even after the month of fasting if it's gone yet the person will be on the straight path because they don't remember the objective come closer to Allah subhana wa ta'ala and once your sins are forgiven if you repent truly one of the criteria for repentance is that besides saying that what you have done is wrong asking for forgiveness stopping it also saying that you will not do it again so if they ask for forgiveness in the right way they will not go back to the old bad habits so they follow all these inshallah even after Ramadan goes away they will be on the straight path for the full year"
