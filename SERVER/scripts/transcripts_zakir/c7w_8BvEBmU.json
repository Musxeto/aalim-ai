  "transcript": "the concept of God in Islam the best reply that any Muslim can give you regarding the concept of God in Islam is quote to you surlas chapter number 112 verse one to4 which says say he is Allah one and only Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not nor he begotten what there is nothing like him this is a four-line definition given in the Quran inah chapter number 112 verse 1 to 4 which is the Lous test for theology Theo means god logic means study theology mean study of God surlas is the Lous test for theology anyone says that so and so candidate is God if that candidate fits in this four line definition we Muslims have got no objection in accepting the candidate as God the first is say Allah only number two Allah Allah the absolute and eternal number three he begets not nor is begotten number four there's nothing like him this is a four-line definition about Allah subhana wa ta'ala given in the Glorious Quran any person says so and so candidate is God we Muslims have got no objection in accepting that candidate as God this is the Touchstone of theology let's analyze regarding bhagan rashish there are some human beings who claim bhagan rajnish is God one during question at the time one of our Hindu Brothers he told me the brother Zakir we Hindus don't consider bhagan rajnish to be God I said I never said Hindus consider bhagan rajnish to be God I've read the Hindu scriptures nowh in the Hindu Scriptures it says that bhagan nishna is God I said some human beings consider to be God so let us put this bhagan to the test of suras the first is say he is Allah one and only was bhagan rajnish one and only was he the only human being who claimed to be God there are thousands of people who have claimed to be God especially the country where I come from there are tens of thousands of men who have claimed to be God you know India it has a very rich Heritage for many centuries and I come from that country and I'm proud to be a citizen of India but in that country but in that country we have many human beings in the past and even today even today who claim to be God rajish is Not The Only One the next is Allah Allah the absolute and eternal was rajish absolute and eternal we know from his autobiography he was suffering from chronic backache from asema from diabetes malius imagine almighty God suffering from chronic back ache asema diabetes malius and the third test is he begets not nor is begotten we know from his autobiography he was born in a place in madhya Pradesh he had a mother and father who later on became his disciples and in 1981 he goes to America and he takes thousands of American for a ride and in the state of Oregon he starts his village known as rajuram and he takes thousands of American for a ride later on the American government arrest him and puts him behind bars and then he claims the American government gave me slow poisoning imagine almighty God me slow poisoned and 1985 they ki him out of the country and he comes back to India and in the city of Puna he starts his Center he goes back to where he started earlier which is really called as oo commune and he goes back to Puna and I've been to a Cento commune I like visiting such places it gives us new dimension for doing dawa and if you go to Puna and Theo commune you'll find there is samadi it's mentioned on a samadi a stone is there which says oh show never born never died but visited the Earth from the 11th of of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990 never born never died but visited the Earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990 they forgot to mention in the samadi stone that he was not given visas to 21 different countries of the World Imagine almighty God coming to this earth to visit the Earth and requires visas and the AR Bishop of Greece said if you don't remove rajes out of this country we'll burn his house and the house of his disciples and the last test there's nothing like him is so stringent that no one besides true Allah can pass it says the moment you can compare anything in this world to Allah subhana tal he's not Allah there's nothing like him for example if someone says almighty God is thousand times stronger than Arnold swasher you might have heard the name of of and fer the person who got the title Mr World Mr Universe the strongest man in the world the strongest man in the universe the moment you can compare God to anything in this world whether it be an fer whether it be D Singh whether it be King Kong whether it be a thousand times or million times the moment you can compare God to anything in this world he's not God there is nothing like him this is a full line definition of Allah subhana wa ta'ala which is given in the Quran and I request all the human beings in this Auditorium in kumur in Malaysia in the full world who will be watching this on Peach TV that whichever God you're worshiping put him to the test of surlas if he passes the test the god you're worshiping is correct if he does not pass the test it's a false God Allah says in the Quran in is chapter number 17 verse number 110 SE call upon Him by Allah or by by whichever name you call upon him to him belong the most beautiful names you can call Allah by any name but it should be a name given by him it should be a beautiful name it should not conjure up a mental picture and this message that to Allah belongs the most beautiful name besides Surah is 17 verse 110 is even given in Surah chapter number 7 verse 180 Surah chter number 20 verse number 8 and Surah hash chapter number 5 verse number 24 that to Allah subhana wa ta'ala belong the most beautiful names but we Muslims we prefer calling Allah by the Arabic word Allah instead of the English word God the reason is a person can play Mischief with the English word God the Arabic word Allah is unique the English word God if you add s to God it becomes God's Pro of God there nothing like Allah if you add D SS to God it becomes a female god there's nothing like female Allah or male Allah in Islam Allah subhana wa ta'ala is a unique word if you add father to God it becomes Godfather he's my godfather he's my guardian there nothing like Allah father in Islam if you had mother to God becomes godmother if you prefix tin before God it become tin God meaning a fake God there's nothing like tin Allah and Islam that's the reason we Muslims we prefer calling Allah by the Arabic word Allah instead of the English word god when Muslims use God instead of Allah while they speak with non-muslims I have got no objection because the non-muslim may not know the concept of Allah so when a Muslim is speaking to a non-muslim and translate Allah into God I've got no objection but I like to remind them that God is not the appropriate translation of word Allah"
