  "transcript": "the first question that has come on the WhatsApp which has been selected by my group the first question is from brother Yusuf shuheb Ghana what are the basic guidelines in Islam for choosing a spouse a similar question is asked by najiba Afghanistan I am a 16 year old girl how can we love someone in an Islamic way before marriage and a similar question asked by Abdullah from Dubai UAE if it is not too personal can we know how did you select a life partner the first question posed by the brother that what are the guidelines regarding choosing a life partner or a spouse in Islam said it's mentioned inside bukhari volume number seven Hadith number 5090 as well as in say Muslim volume number four Hadith number 3635 it is present in bukhari as well as inside Muslim it's mentioned that the prophet peace be upon him said that woman are chosen in marriage for four things the wealth the lineage or nobility Beauty and religion choose a for the religion here in this Hadith Prophet says that women in marriage are chosen for four things wealth lineage nobility third is Beauty and fourth is religion and the best is religion that means choose the woman who is religious here we come to know that the maximum importance that should be given is to the religion because all the earlier three criteria which people normally look for in marriage it is limited and mainly for this Dunya for example wealth wealth is something which can maybe get to some luxury in this world but may not be beneficial in the akhara as the Beloved Prophet said it is more difficult for rich man to go to Jannah than a poor man but it's not Haram to have wealth but it is not the major criteria it should look for the second is lineage looking at the lineage of the family it's good but that is not the mean it is mainly for the Dunya you may feel coming from a very good family from a noble family the third criteria is beauty which is again limited only to this world beauty is something which you may get tired of in few days or few weeks or a year the best and everlasting mainly for that as well as for the Dunya in religion it is the Deen and if I was to pay any weightage in choosing this is my own opinion that if a boy was to choose a girl 90 to 95 percent should be for the Deen for the religion because that will get him akhara as well as the Dunya yes as far as the wealth is concerned if a boy wants to marry a girl then what youth is the wealth of the girl to that boy a good boy who has his own self-respect but naturally would not like to live on the money of the woman of the wife so irrespective whether the girl is Rich or what difference would it make him and even if he's going to use that is only for this Dunya the lineage may or may not help that will not really count much the beauty as I said is subjective as long as the wife is not repulsive so maybe you can give about three or four points or three or four percent weightage to the beauty as long as he's not repulsive the deal is the maximum 90 to 95 percent of the waiter should be given to the Deen if it's a boy choosing a girl if a girl is choosing a boy then wealth may carry certain weight because if the girl is used to having certain comfort in life but natural she cannot marry a boy who's living on the street so if it's a girl marrying a boy then the wealth may have certain weightage Maybe about 10 marks the lineage may be one percent and the handsomeness of the boy as long as he's not repulsive but naturally because you want to live with the spouse for the full life you should be satisfied but mentally if you make up a mind you know if you really it's all in your mind any girl can seem to be beautiful it's in your mind so the handsomeness or the beauty carries a smaller percentage so for the man the religion I would say about Carrie 1995 percent marks and for the woman when she's looking for a spouse maybe would carry approximately 85 percent marks the religion The Deen which is the most important anyway this percentage is from my side it is not from nadid the Hadith is very clear that the most important is the religion that's it this is my percentage regarding the second question posed by the sister that can we have an Islamic love before marriage regarding the love before marriage that we have nowadays in the modern society in the western Society but natural it is Haram there is no lbw lbw in the cricket you have like before Wicked lbw is love before wedding so the way we have in the western culture where the girlfriend boyfriend and they want to test each other they go out to a park and they go out for a movie they sit in the last bench of the theater or they want to enjoy they go for dinner and they talk and they may go to hotel and sleep overnight all these things is Haram in Islam yes you can while selecting a life partner have interview along with the maharam if a boy is going to look at a girl then maybe the boy's sister is there or the girl's father is there along with the Madam but not chill you can ask questions you can interview for few minutes or half an hour for one hour There's No Limit you can have one meeting two meeting no problem to understand because we're going to spend the full life with the girl and the girl with the boy but going out alone and being in seclusion you know the shaitan is there the prophet said that if there are two alone the third person is the devil yes you can interview but the love before marriage what we have in the normal sense in the western world it is prohibited yeah yes you can have for example you may know the girl may know of a boy who's Islamic who's very religious Allah in the mosque and if I die and the girl may want to have a good life partner so islamically what she does is that she proposes to the boy who she thinks is religious through her father or through a brother all the parents of the girl go and meet the parents of the boy and in the Islamic way it's possible this sort of love because you like the religious values and the Deen in the boy it is permissible islamically if you go ahead following the rules and regulation not breaking in the Sharia it is possible in this way if you want to call it love before marriage because you like the religious aspects in the boy or the boy like religious aspects in a girl in this way not breaking any rules of the Islamic Sharia then you can call it a sort of love before marriage islamically but think that you don't break any of the rules of the Sharia as far the Third question posed to me is that if it's not too personal the word I would like to know that how did I select my life partner and as many of you may be aware that I'm at Sheikh Ahmad in 1987 the first time when I was 22 years old I was impressed by him and that's how I got involved in the field of dawa and my life became more Islamic previously I was an average Muslim praying five times a day fasting and doing what normal Muslims should do but the dawa came into my life after that and once I started doing dawa and alhamdulillah I realized that I was good in debating I was good and convincing so I thought as far as choosing a life partner for me inshallah inshallah no problem any girl I marry I will be able to convince her maybe in a few weeks or a few months or no problem the girl I'll be able to convince this was in the initial stages when I was a novice when I didn't have much knowledge but naturally later on as the years passed I realized that very important reading the Hadith of the prophet and knowing that aspects of Islam that choosing a life partner is very important and at that time I thought that the right age for a Muslim boy to get married is 25 that was my idea that time no also now it may be a little bit earlier so at that time I thought that 25 years is the best time for a person to get married when he finishes his graduation and he can marry and at the age of 25 when I started to look for a girl and realizing having more knowledge of the Deen reading the Hadith and the quranic verses my criteria was based on the Hadith of the Prophet Muslim that while choosing a girl you look for four things first is the wealth second is the lineage the nobility third is the beauty fourth is the Deen and the best is the Deen you should choose a girl for Dean and this Hadith was ingrained in my mind and I decided I want to marry a girl who is as religious as possible more religious than me that was my aim to get a girl who is in the field of dawa and religious so I told my sister that look out for a girl and the only criteria number one is Dean regarding wealth the poor rashif better for me because I don't want to use any of our wealth lineage it doesn't matter and Beauty she should not be repulsive that was my requirement and with this requirement I told my sister that she should find from your life partner and believe me for two years she hunted and she may have searched many girls and unfortunately not a single one did she pass not a single of the girl who she thought and who She interviewed ever passed even the prelims later on we got information that there is a Muslim a Muslim girl in a neighboring City Puna which is 160 kilometers from Bombay where I lived and we came to know that she was the head the president of a ladies Islamic dub organization and I went along with my sister and my mother and I went to Puna I traveled all the way I drove for a few hours and I went to punan that's how the first time I met my wife and that time she wasn't aware and we met her and we spoke to her spoke to a mother my mother was there and my sister was there her mother was there she was there and later on when we went back then we sent the proposal and then we had a formal meeting the first was in the formal meeting just we went and we met through one of our common friends and when we're at the formal meeting we had for a few hours and alhamdulillah she was the first girl I met or I interviewed or interacted to be my would be wife and alhamdulillah the first was the best and Allah blessed me masha'allah was the wonderful wife and alhamdulillah I consider it to be one of the best gifts that Allah has given me besides the Iman that Allah has given me the best gift that Allah gave me is my wife and she was from Puna and in the first interview itself it was nearly finalized then we had another meeting my basic criteria was that she should be religious and she should be a die these were the two criteria religious and die and I could not find a girl better than her at that time already more than 27 years has passed for our marriage at that time we could not find anyone better at my knowledge the remaining was not at all important but alhamdulillah even though I wasn't looking for beauty masha'allah Allah give me a beautiful wife and as I said the beauty is in your mind and alhamdulillah and many people used to ask me that now you're giving so many as for dawa maybe you know about nine ten hours for the hour once you get married you'll have to give time to your wife how will you be able to manage both so one of the reasons that I married a girl who is a Daya so that it's a Venn diagram most of our time would overlap so when I gave approximately five hours TOA in a day maybe three hours was discussing dawa and then we started an Islamic organization ladies Wing in Islam Research Foundation the moment you got married first thing we did was started a lady's wing and she was the president of the ladies wing of Islam Research Foundation so my main criteria was only the and dawa and but natural in the interview the question is asked was based on about what is the concept of purpose of life and other things so basically these two are the criteria Allah blessed me and the best blessing is to have a righteous and supporting life partner for Dai the wife can make the life of a thy hell I know many guys who are very good dies but after marriage the dawah has been ruined because of the spouse Allah has blessed me Masha Allah and I consider my wife to be the best wife in the world that's what I consider alhamdulillah and I thank Allah for giving me a spouse who was righteous and because of her after marriage my dawa increased multiple times and kept on increasing more and more to the level now alhamdulillah Allah blessed me and therefore choosing a life partner is very important and as the prophet said look for a life partner who's religious look for Deen in her the other criteria are not at all important most important is religious and virtuous hope this answers the question"
