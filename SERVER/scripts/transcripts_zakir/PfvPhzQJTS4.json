  "transcript": "the first question from Karachi Pakistan I am a student I came across a post with your photograph containing the below information I wanted to confirm how authentic is this information and yes in the post and the post has my photograph a very Sharp may be taken out from one of my websites a very clear image of mine and at the side of the photograph it is mentioned we should not write it as or inshallah i n f h a l l h together inverted Commerce because it means create Allah knows billah whether Arabic or English please make sure we write it properly as invert commas in space I and space space with S capital then a capital llh close invert commas that means in three separate words in then Shah and Allah in three separate words this means if allowables to make sure you forward this to everyone and help them to correct the mistake too inshallah Dr Zakir Naik fan club of Facebook www.facebook.com before I reply to this question whether the information in this post was authentic or not let me tell you that this post was not uploaded by me these words do not belong to me as we discussed in the last session that as Dr Zakir season 11 session four that every poll that you find in the social media with my photograph Etc doesn't have to mean it belongs to me and I told you have to see at the bottom go to my Facebook whether it's available there or not or I can go to my website and here it is clearly mentioned at the bottom it says that Dr Zaki Nike fan club on Facebook Dr Zakir Naik fan club on Facebook doesn't mean it is officially though the Facebook address says official but above it it says it's a fan club of doctors meaning it is posted by my fans it does not belong to me and this post has been circulating in the social media for several years and maybe tens of millions of people have read it I myself in the last several years have received that Dr Zakir is it correct and it was difficult for me to reply because this message is not totally correct and it is partly correct regarding what is mentioned in this post I'll come to it first let me tell you that this post was not uploaded by me it is not my words it does not belong to my official Facebook page it's a fan page and as I told you many people out of enthusiasm they put my photographs so that they get more viewers this is Haram but maybe the Nia is good another discussed in the last session if the knee has good medal I forgive them but fabricating something what I have not said it is wrong it is Haram so I did not say this regarding the information mentioned in this that do not write inshallah as one word i n s h a a l l e h oh within sha Allah with the capital is wrong it means great Allah rather right in space space Allah I and space s h a a space a l l a h insha Allah please circulate this you'll get Allah I received this several years before this message somebody fought it to me and I've showed this post to umpty number of Arabs Arabs from Saudi Arabia from Qatar from UE from Yemen various those who are Scholars who are phds in Islam and I received mixed response when I received this question on the Facebook asperson farik that was this why don't you check on the net even he went on the and he Googled and there were many Arabic replies given by Arabs I'm not talking about non-arabs are complete later on and some of the videos said that saying this is wrong what is mentioned here it means great Allah I should not say and some of them said it is okay some of them say you're spitting yes they were different replies what I believe now after hearing from the various different Arabs some PhD some Scholars some duarts that we know for sure that in Arabic inshallah is spelled in Arabic I live noon and there's a space in there's a space then shahina alif then there's a space and then Allah so surely in Arabic in sha Allah are three separate words this is without doubt so in Arabic it is three separate words in sha Allah which means if allowance without doubt and words inshallah in space space Allah inshallah in Arabic there's no doubt it's there it's mentioned in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse number 70. it's mentioned in chapter number 12 verse number 99 it's mentioned chapter number 18 verse number 69. it's mentioned in Surah kasas chapter number 28 verse number 27 chapter number 37 verse number 102 in chapter number 39 verse number 38 and it's also mentioned in Surah fatah chapter number 48 verse number 27. there are several places this word insha Allah I mentioned the three separate words with the space meaning if allowables and there are various other forms that are there but these are exactly inshallah that they're in the Quran I mentioned it is seven places that's mentioned there are many more places so in Arabic without doubt it is mentioned in three separate words with a space in between there's no doubt now when we write in English in the transliteration there are various forms in different ways that it is written by Muslims and in the post it says that some people write as inshallah as one word i n s h a a l l h as one word or inshallah with I capital and s h a a and a capital l h as one word or some people write as two words insha i n s h a a then space a l l h but the post says the right and the correct authentic way is to write in i n space I capital in space sha F capital h e a space this is authentic way so what is my comment is this correct or is it wrong I would say the post is to a great extent correct but if you ask me which is the best way to write in English transliteration then the post is correct the second part is correct that is the correct way to write in English transliteration is i n space s h a space a l l h or insha in sha Allah i n f h a a double A then space then a capital l a a h because in transliteration I am a bit particular because you know in the books and I am a person who's supposed to be they call me a perfectionist so in the correct transliteration Allah should be translated in English as a l l a on top of a there is a dash which many people don't know what it means but in original English language did the marks which means they have to elongated so if there is a dash above a that means a should be elongated so whenever in Arabic there is an alif or if there is that letter is elongated if it's azabar or it is then it's a single a but if it is a mother with a short mud or a long month or if it's an alif the right thing should be a with a dash on top but people aren't aware of this so Modern English many people what they do instead of the dash they write double A and that's what I've started doing in the last about four years or five years and most of our posts we started spelling Allah instead of a l l h and a l l Double H Islam instead of i f l a m i s l a m and this is more authentic the writers with the dashboard people don't know this type of English in the Modern English so there are some Muslims and even myself who prefer writing Islam with i s l a a because Islam has an alif alif scene alif so if there is an ALICE as I mentioned it's a doubly or if it's a single customer then it's the E and if it's if it has a mother then elongated becomes doubly so these are the correct way of transliteration so the way I write inshallah is I capital n with the space and Shah there is an alif so s h a a then space and then Allah a l l a a h the way I write lately a couple of years back I realized that my team in the social media said that this is the new style of spelling so everyone may not Google search you won't get it on the YouTube search you may not get it so it's better in the title we write the spelling which is more common for Islam i s l a m the more common spelling for lies a l l h so now you find in my posts and in my YouTube videos sometimes double A sometimes single a a main aim is people should find it in searching so if you write i f l double A M for Islam or Quran q u r apostrophe double A and very few people will find it in the search so because of that we went back to the more common spelling rather than the more authentic spelling but in short if you ask me the best way to transliterate and write in English is I and space I capital n space Sha F capital h a a space Allah a capital l a a h this is the right way now if someone merges and writes it is it correct if someone writes insha and then Allah is it correct or someone that's inshallah if one word is it correct and the post says it means create Allah so when I ask this question does inshallah if you write together or if you pronounce it together or if you think Allah does it mean straight Allah so some of the opinion yes it means some of the opinion no it has no meaning at all some say that it is best to avoid but all of them agreed that the best way I ask those people who know English and Arabic I didn't ask only an Arab because other knows very well that inshallah should be separate I have those people who are fluent in English and Arab and they're Arabs Arabic is their mother tongue and they're fluent in English many of the duas that come on peace TV all of them agreed that the best and authentic way is to write in separate space then Shah separate space Allah and in transliteration normally when you translate it has to be whatever the original language from which you're transliterating you have to see that if there's a space there should be a space even in the transliteration I know many people don't do it the right way and they merge it and they say no problem so if you ask me which is the best way the best way is as it is mentioned in the posts in then space Shah then space then Allah whether you enjoy double A for sha or double a folder that's your choice both are correct but is it wrong if someone writes is it right and I've discussed this with people who are even in the Islamic field you know because my post became so popular so we had many fatimas in Pakistan and in India given by various madrasad by Devan by many mothers had in Pakistan and now today because of this post it is so vital that tens of millions of people have read it and ask in the satwa so even your Fatima's in the Urdu Scholars Urdu shuks giving and most of them agree that writing inshallah separately is is the right way if you write together some post say it is wrong some say it is not wrong it is in ignorance so it's okay and some went to say the right ways to write it separately as three words but if we join it and write it is not a big issue there is no problem you don't have to make a mountain out of a mole so as I told you what was the reply I got with the Arabs the same reply is there with the ulama or the shuks from Pakistan or from India that the best is to write separately but if you write some of the websites say that it is wrong you should not do it and some said it's okay if you do it there's not a big issue and you can continue doing it so I am of the opinion that best is to write it separately if you write together out of ignorance inshallah there is no issue but since you know now that writing separately is better you should accept it you know some people say no because what I was doing earlier I stick to it this is stubbornness but naturally someone writes out of ignorance together there is no issue at all I don't think so Allah will hold responsible inshallah Allah will forgive you if you write together as one word or has two words inshallah Allah will forgive you there are some Arabs who say that if you write in shahu Allah and it is wrong so because it doesn't have the fatadama Etc when you write normal Arabic so some say avoid it some say no problem but I am of the view that if you really want to be accurate it's better you write in Allah separately i n s h a separately with the space and a l l h but if someone writes together and means that if Allah wins I feel inshallah there is no problem Allah will not hold responsible I don't want to say that the post it's now great Allah is there but when the difference opinion better be safe rather than sorry and that when you can know for sure when everyone says what is right and the second opinion people disagree better follow the first when everyone agrees that's right so that's the reason I prefer writing inshallah as three separate words and we know that in transliteration some people say no problem while we are transliterating when you are transliterating and if you remove the space no problem I disagree with this there is a problem imagine if you write together if Allah Wills imagine if you write complete if you want to translate or translate and in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful without spaces even I know English well will not be able to read it because I know by heart in the name of Allah most gracious most more civil I may be able to decipher it but if someone who doesn't know the meaning and if I have to read together imagine there are 200 letters together in the name of Allah most gracious more merciful How Will I Know where the world is ending so it is wrong to say that whether you have space or don't despise it means the same no if you are a professional person to translate or transliterate if there's a space in the original language you have to keep the space even in the transliteration if you remove it out of ignorance in inshallah Allah will forgive you there's no problem in it but to be stubborn and saying in transliteration you can do it the way you want it is totally wrong I remember in 2016 when we had the international dawa training program we had about six students from Malaysia and one student his name was attiluated I read it I said what is this I'm hearing this first time a Muslim name Sy a f i q c Africa it is s-h-a-f-i-q he said no no in Malaysian language we spell s h as s-y at all thank you for the information in 2016 I've been to Malaysia several times I did not know at that time that for sure you spell it as Sy in Malay and since this is a proper noun I said no problem it's a Malaysian name and you spell shsy the proper name is a proper name you can spell it the way your language says there's no problem later on since the dawatani program was in English he writes I think this is how we spell in Malaysia I said fine at your home you can do it but this is our training program is in English and you know English very well you cannot say that I will translate the rate from Arabic Isha into English as i s y a a it is wrong this is the English now but in Malaysia I do it okay it's accepted because in Malay language Sy means sure but this is an English divertending program so you cannot use your Malay in English if I start using Urdu in this English training program half of the thing you understand so then he understood so you cannot translate Isha as i s y a and say because it's in my culture it's right yes in Malay it's accepted but in English language you cannot say you transliterate the way you want it totally wrong in English you have to follow the rules of English so Isha is i f h a or i f h a a no problem you cannot translate as i s y a Isha you're transliterating Arabic into English so show me S H you cannot use Sy for sure you do that in Malaysia in Malay language accept it 100 correct but you cannot use Malay rules to translate it rate into English and say it is also correct no it is wrong in English language you cannot translate and use the Malay rules for English language so you have to be careful that you cannot be so Broad and say that okay remove the space it's no problem you cannot remove space from 100 words if you have no meaning at all so in transliteration you have to follow the rules so if you follow the rules the best way to translate rate inshallah line to English if I and space s h a or s h a a space someone writes together inshallah forgive it's not the major issue you don't have to make a mountain out of a mole but if you know it and if you transliterate in the right way that's better no one will object and you won't waste time arguing with people whether right or wrong or wasting your time and you're following the rules of transliteration that if there is a space in the original language you have to have a space in the English translation this is the rules we should follow so this answer is in short and this puts an end to the discussion with what is right what is wrong because you should not waste a precious time in these small issues hope to answer the question"
