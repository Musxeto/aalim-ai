  "title": "All the Information Mentioned in the Quran was Already Present in Other Books. Who Created God?",
  "transcript": "my name is sabina forgive me for my unclarity this is a rather spontaneous question um i have a friend she's an atheist and on our endless debates on the existence of god and all that we talk about she has two claims she makes two claims when i posed with a question of what the grant says in terms of the existence of the universe and the world and how it states many facts she turns around she says well that knowledge was not just for the quran it actually existed before the quran there's scriptures there is books before the quran was even written detailing information about the universe so it's not just this knowledge that is superior to the quran what do i say back to that is she lying do scriptures exist i mean i have ignorance myself but you know is this knowledge like was this available before the quran was written and sorry secondly another claim she makes is that i give the analogy of you know you have something in creation who knows it you know the creator will know about everything about it and i talk about you know if there is no god how can we possibly exist if you keep on going further and further and further and back there is no end and if there's no end how do we exist then she says well from a religious point of view you say well god is the end well i say he's an atheist who says god is the end who created god that's my question thank you which again comment the first question is that all the things mentioned in the quran were already present before so what's new it's present in other scriptures and other books etc that the first question second question who created god as far as the first question is concerned i do agree that certain things were present in time before the quran but they were not called as established facts they were not called established facts for example the thing i quoted that the sun previously people thought that the sun rotating there are certain things which were there in the greek history and the philosophical history but for example when the quran speaks about the spherical shape of the earth these greeks they believed that the earth was spherical but no one believed in them so certain facts not all a small percentage for the science has come to know today and what quran mentions were told by people previously but they failed to realize that the same greeks mentioned 100 other things which were unscientific the same greek even mentioned that the earth was center of the universe which is totally wrong so imagine if 100 points are mentioned and mohammad sallallahu picks up one which is correct that's also not possible so i do agree with you sister that certain things were mentioned before signs established as a fact today but these things weren't established that time and to say that out of the hundred false things they mentioned if one thing is right to pick up the one correct thing is again also not possible once is possible but not thousands of times sister because only a person who is even a scientist cannot do that only the creator himself can do and that's allah subhana wa so i do agree with you but that portion which has been mentioned earlier in earlier scriptures and other philosophical books is a small portion but that too along with that portion there are other things which aren't scientific mixed with that come into the second part of the question that who created god normally people in dawa they used a false strategy of logic which tips itself most of the people when they try to prove the existence of allah subhanahu ta'ala they say that everything has a creator for example who created this book how did the book come into existence somebody created it who created it and they go back where did you come into existence who created you your father who created your father the grandfather and then goes to god who created this microphone created the factory who created the factory and then they try and prove who created the sun god who created the moon so based on this they try and prove that everything as a creator which according to me is a wrong logic in my strategy what i spoke today i never said everything as a creator that is the has who told me that the first person who will tell about the mechanism of this thing is the creator i never said that i say every created thing as a creator but by definition almighty god is uncreated it is like there's a person suppose my friend he comes and tells me that my brother john was admitted in the hospital he gave birth to a baby was it a girl or a boy can you guess sister was it a girl or a boy brother john gave birth to a baby was it a girl or a boy brother john was admitted to the hospital he gave birth to a baby was it a girl or a boy can you guess you can't guess can anyone guess how can a man have a baby so to ask the question he gave birth to a baby whether a girl or a boy is it logical the same thing the definition of allah is uncreated the moment you say who created allah he sees it to be allah therefore the definition of god is uncreated therefore almighty god has got no creator if he's a true almighty god hope that answers the question"
