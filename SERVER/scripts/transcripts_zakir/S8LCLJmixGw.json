  "title": "The Jews Believe in the Old Testament. But Why do the Christians do not Believe in the Old Testament",
  "transcript": "i need a clarification i mean i'm not so sure about it the jews believe in the old testament is it and the christians don't follow the old testament what is the logic behind this and uh can you explain i mean why they don't consider the old testament important and is the new testament that they take into consideration well the jews take on to the old testament the buddhist in the jews take on the old testament the christians they're supposed to follow the old testament why do they need to go to the new testament whether just as outlined the bible in two parts the old testament new testament old testament deals with the lifestyle of the prophets that came before jesus christ peace be upon him new testament it starts the life of jesus peace be upon him and about his apostles and all so the two divisions now the jews are supposed to follow the torah the psalms everything that's there that is the complete old testament so jews are sticking to that now as far the christians are concerned theoretically they have to follow both if they don't follow both the whole christianity will fall apart why because whatever is in the new testament it is based on the old testament the prophecy of jesus christ peace be upon him they claim that he's got it so whatever they claim so they claim is only supported by the prophet of the old testament which we disclaim we say these prophecies about the prophet coming not about a god coming based on the old testament in the new testament bill without the old testament the new testament on its own doesn't have any value so many of the christians don't know about this so theoretically without the old testament for jesus christ says in the gospel of matthew chapter number five verse number 17 to 20 think not that i have come to destroy the law and the prophets i have come not to disturb or to fulfill till 11 and the earth pass away not one jot or title can pass away from the law and all be fulfilled and whosoever shall break one of the least commandments shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall keep the commandments and teach the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the sky than the pharisees in no way shall you enter the kingdom of heaven so under jesus christ unless you are not more pure than the jews unless you don't follow all the laws and commands of the jews you cannot go to paradise so if you take out the laws of the jews how can you go to paradise so according to jesus christ peace be upon him the new testament is built on the old testament so theoretically they have to follow if they don't follow they cannot be a good christian they cannot enter paradise so they have too much sorry no they have to say theoretically but practically when we argue with them and prove to them that from the old testament you come to know about the prophet muhammad no we don't follow the old testament these people who don't have much knowledge but a knowledgeable person cannot say that because if they don't follow the old testament the new testament itself carries no weight because if the new testament says that you have to follow what is in the law of the muslim read gospel of matthew gospel of john gospel of all these gospels what jesus has said that it has been said of the old times thou shalt not commit adultery but i say unto you so what has been said of the old times something jesus christ has made his own statements but as a whole he said that you have to follow each and every law of the old testament if you break one jordan you should not enter jannah so if you don't have that law how can you follow so theoretically and practically they have to follow but they don't do it so third degree they may give importance but practically when you argue with them those who have less knowledge then they say okay we only follow the new testament so we can even prove about muhammad allah from the neutral statement we can prove jesus christ was not crucified peace be upon him from the new testament so if a velvet says comparative religion even without the old testament you can hit convince them what is not from the new testament if you're well-versed but actually practically they have to follow both hope answers the question"
