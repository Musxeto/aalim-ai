  "transcript": "how correct is the phrase which some people say in that o allah i do not ask you to change your decree but i do ask you to help when it comes to pass am aware that many muslims ask this dua but this is not the right way to ask allah because allah has told us that we can ask allah subhanahu wa anything we can ask for forgiveness we can ask for the good things we can even ask him to even if it's mentioned something in our decree that something wrong is going to happen something bad is going to happen we can ask him for good so it's wrong to say that we cannot ask you to change your decree but please help us further is mentioned in the quran in surah allah chapter 113 where it says that that say we seek refuge with the lord of down from the mischief which has been created so we are asking allah for protection for refuge it's mentioned in say bihari verb number nine in the book of father hadith number 6616 that the prophet said that take refuge with allah from the severity in the calamities from the evil end and the bad fate and from the malicious joy of the enemy so but naturally you can ask allah to change his but i like to give an example that suppose there's a student for ps4 examination and he hasn't fed well i know that he's going to fail so he comes home and he pays for allah accepts his prayer so in the qatar it was mentioned that this particular student he was going to fail he comes home and he prays to allah allah subhanahu wa tala even knows whether the person is going to pray to him or not and allah even knows whether they're going to accept his prayer or not so in the original that was mentioned you're going to fail the examination allah also knows in advance that he'll come and pray and ask allah to pass so that he pass him the examination allah even knows that he's going to accept his prayer and pass him the examination so actually the qatar is perfectly doesn't change but the previous color which was there they're going to fail is there so when you pray the previous qatar gets changed but allah also has may gab that whether you're going to pray or not but therefore always you should pray to allah and ask for his forgiveness and ask for help so it's also mentioned the qatar that he's going to pray and allah will accept his prayer and he'll pass okay that's good that's very good there's hope for us all in other words"
