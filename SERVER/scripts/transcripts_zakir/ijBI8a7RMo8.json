  "transcript": "is it haram to live with a non-muslim girlfriend even if you don't do Haram things living with a non-muslim girlfriend itself is Haram so you're asking me the question is it haram to live with a non-muslim girlfriend if you don't do Haram things it is like like you're telling me that is it permissible for me to drink alcohol and then not do Haram things so you ask me the question can I live with a non-muslim girlfriend living with the namam in Islam is Haram and then you will not do Haram things that's another thing so it's like you're asking me can I drink alcohol and after drinking alcohol I will not do Haram things so is it allowed for me to drink alcohol if I don't do Haram things after drinking alcohol and answer is no it's Haram because drinking alcohol itself is Haram and after drinking you may do something else is secondary after drinking alcohol you may do Z you may gamble that's secondary but drinking alcohol itself is so L staying with a non-muslim girl friend who's a nonam she's not your wife she's not your sister she's not your mother she's to you so staying with her itself is Haram whether after that you do Haram whether you do Z with her or not after that or that is secondary but staying with the namam girlfriend itself is Haram whether after that you do Haram or not that is secondary"
