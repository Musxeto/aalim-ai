  "transcript": "and the Cornerstone of the Islamic faith is the belief in one and only Soul Creator and sustainer of the entire universe he alone deserves worship and it is because of belief in one God that they can be Universal Brotherhood that means the same God has created all the human beings irrespective whether are rich or poor whether a male or female whether black or white whichever cast color creed you belong to all of them are equal because you are created by one and only soulle Creator almighty God only if you believe in one God can you practice Universal Brotherhood that's the reason that all the major religions which believe in the concept of God on a higher level they believe in the existence of one almighty God and according to Oxford dictionary religion means a belief in a superhuman controlling power a God or gods that deserve worship and obedience so in short if you want to analyze any religion you have to understand the concept of God in that religion and the best way to analyze the concept of God in any religion is not by looking at what the followers are doing because many of the followers themselves do not know what the religious scriptures speak about almighty God the best ways to analyze what the scripture of that religion has to speak about almighty God and the Glorious Quran says in Surah al- Imran chapter number three verse number 64 say oh people of the book that come to come in terms as between us and you which is the first term Allah that we worship none but Allah that we associate no partners with him that we erect not among ourselves Lords and patrons other than Allah if then they turn back say bear witness that we are Muslims by will to Allah subhana wa tala Allah shows you a way how to speak with different people it says that come to come in terms as between us and you which is the first term that we worship none but Allah that we associate to partners with him so in order to understand the concept of God in any religion you have to understand what that scripture has to speak almighty God if you understand the concept of God you will understand the religion"
