  "title": "15 Point Action Plan for the Muslim Ummah when Someone Insults Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) - Part 7",
  "transcript": "the 14th is that whenever such issues take place in the ummah we find many people who take active part alhamdulillah but we have to realize that this is a specialized work muslim should collaborate but we should not spend our complete time only doing this and leaving the other activities for example if i am in davao organization now what i do for the next six months i stopped my dhawa activity and only concentrate on this then it will be a great loss for the ummah so what we require we require specialized muslim organizations for organizing these things or rather we'd like to say organizations for firefighting and these organizations should be specialized in taking care of such issues like someone insults the profit or someone does islamic blasphemy these organizations should mainly cater to this they should write from the starting use the social media should be able to see to it that our programs go on air on the satellite on the newspapers as articles whether they have a protest whether they organize boycotts of the products of that country so these organizations who are specialized in dealing with anyone who has insulted the prophet or anyone indulging in islamic blasphemy is very important like when we have our conference you know we have the peace conference which is one of the largest islamic english conference in the world where we have more than a million people coming over a span of 10 days in this we have approximately more than 4 000 volunteers and we have about 30 to 40 different groups we have different 30 to 40 different committees whether hospitality committee whether it be transportation committee whether it be food committee whether it be toilet company many communities and one we have which is called as firefighting this fire fighting has a separate head altogether but when required it has the heads of the other committees also joining so similarly we should have specialized organizations who are specialized in dealing with how to handle such situations and these organizations should have maybe a few cyber troopers depending upon the organization should a few lawyers these cyber troopers should know what is trending in the social media how do they utilize it and how do they convey the message they should have few lawyers now these lawyers may not be hired lawyers they may have medium level lawyers like anyone who insults the prophet or anyone who attacks any other they should be legal action taken so such organizations should be there in most of the muslim cities most of the cities which have majority muslim they should be there or should be in the cities where muslims and minority but then large numbers so these organization the main aim is to handle this throughout the year so in such issues as president macron takes place all the muslim ummah joint some may join for five days some may join for six days some will join for a week for two weeks but you can't expect the muslim ummah to leave all the activities and full year be after this issue that will be a loss imagine someone is doing dhawa someone is doing some teaching some are doing islamic teaching if you stop all this activity for one year and every year there are some issues so at this time all should get together for a few days or for a week but there are organizations who should handle the situation and they should be able to see to it that they take the impact to the highest level and in this organization they should have contacts as volunteers top lawyers top politicians top muslim leaders they will come when required but they should have full-time few cyber troopers full-time few lawyers and they should coordinate and see to it that the end result is achieved and the 15th point is that on a higher level all the muslim countries should unite and they should have a block i know that there are certain organizations which are there but i believe they have become inactive this collaboration of the muslim countries together there are today 56 to 57 countries in the world which have majority muslims we should all join together so that if any action is taken if we take it unitedly will have a bigger impact and i believe that this should be away from the normal politics what has happened now that there are certain organizations but they're more involved in whether will it benefit my country or not if i take objection will it benefit the leader of the country they are more bothered about the personal benefit of the country than the benefit of islam that's the reason unless a person loves the prophet more than he loves himself loves his father loves his children loves the humankind he's not a true believer and if we realize that there are certain countries it's not necessary all 57 countries should be together let's start with 5 countries it will become 6 it will become 10 it will become 15 let them come together and end block condemn rather than individually in such cases if we come unitedly we are a bigger force if there is a boycott of products or a trade sanction or helping each other if the countries are united the muslim countries we are a bigger force and imagine 25 percent more than 25 percent of the world population are muslims if we unite we can do wonders and i would like to give you an example in history what is the impact when muslims are united we know that the 34th sultan of the ottoman empire his name was sultan abdul hamid ii he was the last sultan which actually had powers he was the third sultan there were two sultans after that but the person who had some power and say after that it kept on deteriorating for the third last sultan but the last sultan which actually had powers and we know that he ruled from 1876 to 1909 in his reign towards the end of the 19th century in late 1800 there was a comedy play that was supposed to be held in france on a beloved prophet muslim it was a satire a comedy play insulting a prophet and when sultan abdul hamid ii heard about this he got very angry and he wrote a strong letter to the french government saying that this is not tolerated by the muslims and you should not let this play take place and i am totally against it initially the french government tried to give excuses but they realized that the sultan was serious and what did they do they immediately did not allow this play to take place and they completely abolished the comedy play to the extent that most of the actors and the people involved they exiled them to uk to please the sudan few years later again news came that the same play is going to take place in uk so again sultan abdullah me too he got angry and he wrote a similar letter to the uk government that we have heard that there is a play which criticizing the prophet and this is not already in islam and you should immediately see to it that this play doesn't take place the uk government the british government replies metro town said that this was happening in france and now it's coming in uk it should not happen and they stopped it you should stop it too the uk government replied saying uk is not france and we believe in freedom of speech indicating that they will continue with the play sultan abdul hamid gets very angry and he writes a second letter he says you may not be aware that my ancestors they gave their life for the cause of islam and i am prepared to do the same if you do not stop this play see to it it is not done i will inform the full muslim world that you are doing a play against the prophet and you will be held responsible for the consequences then the british government realized that the sultan was serious and they were so much afraid of the muslim unity that time that they immediately banned the play imagine one sultan says that because that time if you know it was the end of the ottoman empire that means the last it wasn't that powerful at all yet just because the sultan gave a warning i'll inform the full muslim world that they're doing a play which is against the profit and you will be held responsible for the consequences that letter was sufficient to bring shivers in the full government imagine at that time end of the 19th century you know the uk government the french government they were powerful that colonies in so many parts of the world they were even ruling india but sultan writes a letter at that time even though it's towards the end of the ottoman empire yet they're afraid and today we hardly see any muslim leader speaking just one two three or yes a few here and there but they are speaking individually imagine if all the muslim leaders in the world even half of them get together and give a warning there will be a world of a difference today the muslim leaders are more involved will it benefit me will it not benefit me will i remain in power will i not remain in power they are more bothered about their seat here they are not bothered about the akhira at all imagine a beloved prophet said anyone who does not love allah and messenger more than he loves himself loves his father loves his children he is not a moment how can we muslims keep quiet when someone is blaspheming against a prophet what has happened to the muslim ummah that's the reason when i gave my actions the lower actions are mainly for the common man and see this example that the muslims are united what an example even though towards the end"
