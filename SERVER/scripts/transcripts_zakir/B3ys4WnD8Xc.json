  "title": "How to Convince an Atheist Regarding Islam? How Do You Update Yourself with Scientific Knowledge?",
  "transcript": "any sisters have any questions my question is regarding a person who we cannot call him an atheist or discuss the entire discussion to take time but the basic thing is we gave him certain uh scientific facts or certain logical facts and in spite of that the person was not convinced like and everything got stuck where it comes to faith so can't we really explain this concept of faith or is it not possible for us to convince a non-muslim regarding faith because there are many things for which even science does not have answers so how do we go about and also i would like to know that how do you keep yourself updated with the scientific uh innovations or maybe the inventions new discoveries that are coming up just last two questions that we have spoken to an atheist or a person but doesn't believe in islam he tried to convince him of scientific facts archaeological facts they agreed to pervade come to faith we can't answer how do we convince faith and how to update ourselves with scientific facts this style regarding faith is concerned these scientific facts we're going to talk about failed but how you go about the technique therefore quran says chapter 16 25. invite all the way of the lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in their ways our best motivation so with science you can prove to them about faith now how you have gone about is a different technique so therefore you have to ask the person who knows so depending what your discussion is like faith i say that this is the word of allah subhanahu salah it's faith how do you prove it then i talk about science so if you see my video question quran modern science or read my book quran modern sense inshallah shows your way this is my faith it's the word of allah i can even prove it scientifically so system there are many things which you can prove scientifically if you have the knowledge of quran and science there are some things sister which you cannot prove scientifically for example if they say that how can you prove there is life after that so then you have to use logic and for that you can refer to my video concept of peace in islam on my question answer session where i've proved how to logically prove about the concept of hereafter one of the simple ways is that suppose the quran speaks about 100 things for example out of which 80 percent of whatever the quran has spoken today we have come to know that it is established effect the other 20 percent about science of the quran speaks it is ambiguous neither right neither wrong so my logic says when 80 percent is 100 correct and the remaining 20 percent near the right knees are ambiguous so my logic says that insha allah even this 20 person will be right it's not a blind belief it's a logical belief of the 20 percent which is ambiguous science hasn't proved it right neither wrong for example the existence of jinn about angels about hereafter science hasn't proved neither has science prove that it is wrong so my logic says that insha 11 this will be right so this is one way of proving and the other way of proving is going to logical aspect which if you see my video casted sister so depend what faith you're talking about are you talking about faith in quran are talking faith in allah how to prove what allah if you see my video i said is the quran god's word so faith and different things faith in allah faith in the messengers faith in the angels faith in the year after so sister depending on each phase may be the style how you convince differs so if you see my video guys alhamdulillah most of the major points of faith have been covered by very different catholic sister and regarding the second question that how can you update yourself with scientific knowledge etc sister read the scientific journals and the books so if you read the scientific books there are several scientific books coming out every month weekly daily there are books coming out on science read that or if time doesn't permit read all then you can read those books which are being written by muslims on compatibility you know there are many books which come out if not daily then at least once a month or once a fortnight there are books coming out at least on some aspects of quran and science there are journals for example saudi arabia there's a journal the name is ajaz ilm saudi arabia which talks only about islam and science quran nothing else the journalists read that online you get updated there are journalism arabic that journal is in english there are scientific journals muslim science journal coming out from india from oligarch i think it comes out once in six months if i'm not mistaken so there are mass m as it comes by mass so there are genres coming out you read these journals you update it with knowledge and even company what are spoken so this is a shortcut only reading muslim journal if you have more time you can read the other journal and think for yourself what verses of the quran match and you can come out with new things yourself inshallah hope to answer questions"
