  "title": "Is Kissing or Hugging Permitted During Fasting? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question asked on the youtube is from tehran poof assalamualaikum can i kiss or hug during fasting the question is too general if you say can i kiss my wife during fasting it's a specific question yes you can kiss your spouse during fasting or kiss you are normally permitted to kiss you cannot kiss a name whether you're fasting or not fasting it's haram but while fasting your spouse you're permitted to kiss as long as you're confident that after that you will not do acts which will break your fast if you know that you have self-control and you can control yourself you can very well kiss your wife the woman can kiss the husband as long as they show that it will not let you indulge in things later on which will break your fast so if you are sure that you can restrict yourself it is permissible once when a sabbah was sitting with the prophet a man comes and asks the prophet that can i kiss my wife while i'm fasting the prophet said yes you can another person comes and asks the same question the prophet replies that you cannot so the sahaba as the prophet the first person you said can kiss your wife while fasting the second person you said no why is the answer different so the prophet said i knew that the first person who came he could control his desires therefore i told him it is permissible for him to cases vibrating fasting the second person i knew he could not condone his desires therefore i said he cannot kiss during fasting therefore the general ruling is that if you can control your desires then you know that you will not commit any of the fast breakers if you don't do any of the fast breakers after kissing it is permitted to kiss your wife during fasting if you fear that you will not be able to control your desire then you will commit any of the fast breakers after you fast then you should not kiss your wife or hug and say the same hope that's the question"
