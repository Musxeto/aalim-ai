  "title": "Will Jesus (pbuh) Die And who is the Comforter? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I'm Austin I currently competed University and my question is the explanation that Jesus did not die using the newest scenario to explain to me it doesn't sound so convincing because a lot of people explain it in a different way too to mean the death of Jesus and the resurrection of Jesus say within that 3-day period And besides there are some quotations to that back said that Jesus died and another question is if Muslims believe in the prophets like Isaiah Jeremiah and the rest because they also prophesy about the coming of the Messiah and the death of the Messiah so if the Messiah did not die then they told lies the brother want some information information about the death and the rising of Jesus Christ peace be upon him and they prophesies the coming of the Messiah and they prophesize that the Messiah will die I do agree with it they prophesize the coming of the Messiah and they prophesize messah will die every man has to die even the Quran says in Surah maram chapter number 19 verse number 33 peace be on me Jesus Christ peace be upon him say the day that I was born the day that I will die the day that I shall be resurrected Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born but Allah almighty God raised him up alive in his second coming he will come as an umat of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him in his second coming he will come and he will die now he's raised up alive Quran says in Surah n 4: 158 that almighty God raised him up alive even the Christian beli raised what I say that if you read the Bible correctly he was put on the cross he did not die he was put alive in the sear then almighty God raised him up alive in his second coming when he come he will die so he will come again not to bring a new message he will come to testify to the Christians he never told that you should worship me but worship Allah who's my Lord and your Lord this is even mentioned in the Quran in Sur ma 5 vers 116 that in the next life in the year after Jesus will tell peace be upon Him almighty God he never told the Christians to worship him but he said worship Allah with my Lord and your lord hope this clarifies brother yeah but how they describe his de that he will pay our sins and things like that nowhere does it say nowhere does it say he will pay for the sins this is the teachings of Paul not of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him point out a single verse of the Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says I will pay for the sin it goes against the teachings of Ezekiel I'm talking of the prophets not Jesus the old prophets old prophets have to understand if you read the Bible the Bible says in the Book of Ezekiel chapter number 18 verse number 20 the soul that sin shall die the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father that means the father shall not bear the sins of the sons the son shall not bear the sins of the father righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him the wickedness of wicked shall be upon him but if the wicked turns he shall not die according to the Bible sin cannot be inherited sin cannot be inherited nowhere did Jesus ever say that he will die for the sin of humankind that means that portion of the Bible which says that is not correct we are here to follow the teachings of Christ not of the other people you know there the Old Testament New Testament in the New Testament out of 27 books 13 books have been written by St Paul now St Paul wasn't even an apostle of Jesus he's a self-appointed apostle so what you're following today is the Pauline Christianity not what was taught by Jesus Christ peace be upon him I do not believe in St Paul I believe in Jesus peace be upon him I don't want to believe in the teachings of St Paul is it clear yeah we have to believe in the teachings of Jesus CH peace be upon him okay do you believe there's one God I'm not done please you're not yeah do you believe Jesus Is God there's there's still something you need to clear here for me please no but do you believe in Jesus as God or not according to the Bible it says so where does it say point out a single unequal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am I am God or why he says worship me I will accept Christianity not Jes say who said it if somebody else says what does it make a difference when Jesus himself did not say you know when I give lecture in India many of the Hindus they touch my feet and call me God do I become God know because I quote the Hindu scriptures you know how I quote the Bible some of the Hindus touch my feet and they said does it make me God no same way somebody else said Jesus Is God it doesn't make him God brother do you believe Jesus Is God peace be upon him and about the Holy Spirit too brother do you believe Jesus Is God yes you believe he's God yeah where did he say he was God Church says yet to find quotations on that sorry I don't memorize the quotations of Fai but you know that it is mentioned in the Bible yes where you do one thing let the other people ask a question by time you search you search in the index where does Jesus say God you know there's the index if you don't know you look in the index or look in the but my question is not about Jesus being God my question is not about Jesus being God or not no my question to you you ask me so many question I'm asking you one question do you believe Jesus it's not your question it's my question because love you brother yeah I love you I was told to come and ask questions not to lecture so I came with questions not you can ask question very good but even I'm asking you one question I can ask you or not yes or no after I finish mine okay how many questions you have more one okay yes brother one more and it's about the Holy Spirit what's your question about Holy Spirit John 14 verse 26 it says and fact IC Al that the comforter is the holy spirit but if it says that that means there is a contradiction you read in your Bible open your Bible Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is experient for you that I go away for if I go not the comforter shall not come for if I depart shall I send him if it refers to the comforter the comforter was early before Jesus Christ peace be upon Him came I told that earlier the Holy Spirit was there in the womb of Elizabeth brother the Holy Spirit was there when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was being baptized it's mentioned in the gospel so surely it cannot refer to the holy spirit that means there's a contradiction in the Bible like how I told you in my lecture Jesus peace be upon Him says that John the Baptist is the Elias when they ask John the Baptist art thou Elias he says no there's a contradiction who's right who's wrong you have to solve the problem because I do not consider the Bible to be the word of God you consider to word of God so you have to solve that problem because you quoted that John to explain that's why I'm also trying to because I'm quoting John chter 14 verse number 16 John 15: 26 John 16 verse number 7 all is in context only chapter 14: 16 also the description it gave it says it to abide with us forever correct but Muhammad never abided with us forever he's abiding with us forever he died this is the teachings of prophet Muhammad this is the Revelation which he got the Quran and is saying the Hadith it's abiding with the human beings forever no one can change the Quran the inil has been changed not the Quran that means after Prophet Muhammad no other Messenger will come where is the holy spirit I don't know where is the holy spirit brother where is the holy spirit brother where is the Holy Spirit the verse 17 says no no brother I'm asking you where is the Holy Spirit the verse 17 is giving the answer verse number 17 the spirit of Truth whom the chapter number Chapter 14 verse yes 17 what does it say the spirit of whom the word cannot receive because neither sees him nor knows him the word neither sees him nor knows him who the SP Spirit of truth that the Bible was talking about so what does it mean that's what that you explain to me I don't I don't get it I've already explained to you in my lecture you don't want to believe in my explanation what can I do I'm giving you the explanation but you remember the explanation of the church which is not matching with the Bible so what am I to do this comforter in Greek is translated from paracletos the actual meaning of paracos is a good friend an advocate if they say comforter I've got no problem but the original word is pericos meaning the one who praises if you go to the original man manuscript Greek and Aramaic word here is pericos meaning one who praises if you translate to Arabic means Ahmed I told in my lecture it's talking about the one who praises that's another name of prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam hope that answers the question"
