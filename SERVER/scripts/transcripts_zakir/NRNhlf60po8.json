  "transcript": "millions of Muslims around the world don't have access to Islamic higher education many of us don't have the means to travel and learn at a prestigious Islamic University many of us can't afford the fees so what options do we have as regular Muslims to study formal Islamic higher education one man decided to change that Salam alaykum I'm Dr Bal Phillips he founded the international open University which has educated hundreds of of thousands of Muslims around the world it's completely online extremely affordable and provides completely accredited degrees that is my vision today I meet the man himself to find out how it all began it's education if the third world gets educated like the first world in terms of access to education Etc then they will potentially surpass what happened is that the opportunity to set up a university in India arose after the peace conferences of Dr Zach and Nike I felt it would be more beneficial if it was put into an institution and um alhamdulillah we launched it but with difficulty government figuring out what we were about tried to sabotage it the door was closed I had to come back to Q and at that point I decided to launch the IOU online as we begun it was just Islamic Studies that's which is why we named the university the Islamic online university we decided to focus on a simple setup it's just a matter of preparing the material the material was put online students would green the material such there would be some tests given and you know it was fairly simple there's a demand for more modern subjects so naturally Dr Bela Phillips decides to expand when the Sharia or Islamic Studies curriculum was set I had decided to add to the various disciplines which graduates from Islamic Studies usually were not trained in but they actually needed it when they came back to the communities they were tasked with leading community came or the head of the community the Imam the Sheik they were tasked by the community with solving their problems counseling and administration had Rising so I added these courses to the overall syllabus because these courses were taught by Muslims who had a concern they were committed to teach their subjects from an Islamic perspective what were those moments where you just Alam thank God I did this thank God I used all my resource thank God I dedicated I sacrificed everything to get here what were those moments were there any yeah of course well a goal was set to me the goal was worth sacrifice for when my um savings ran out others who came along and helped out to keep it growing so Allah seemed to open doors when whenever they were needed from the first time we launched it people were just pouring in and from there it has just been moving forward increasing as time pass we came up with the idea of the 1 million scholarships to provide scholarships for African youth since they had the lowest percentage graduates from high school being accepted into universities finding Indonesia is 36% and Africa as a continent less than 6% we found that the students didn't have computers you know the people who were given Scholarships in The Gambia where our headquarters for the University was chosen they were also asking for electricity in fact the internet data was even more expensive than the fees that we were charging for those who were study online so we set up learning centers in close to 20 different locations across Africa focusing on the English speaking countries so they finally make it they finally reach Global impact and here Dr Bela Phillips discovers the significance of what he started he sees the impact of all the different communities that he never imagined he would the world doesn't have a choice here the future of education is going to be online it's proven itself as a necessity alhamdulillah the Muslim world is massive and if we can take care of this Niche and there are so many other niches that Muslims can contribute overall educational upliftment of the umah they say sky is the limit educating the umah is not something we can do by ourselves it's something thing we must do together Dr belal Phillips is just one example of what someone can do if you have a big enough dream and a big enough Vision the question is are you ready to dream big and leave a legacy [Music] behind [Music]"
