  "transcript": "the other test it is contentment it's contentment and a beloved Prophet mam said it's mentioned inkari Vol number8 Hadith number 447 the prophet said that even if a person owns a valley of gold he would want to have another even if a person owns a value of gold he would want to own another value of gold and the maximum he can take in his mou is the dirt of the Grave however Rich he is let him be the richest man in the world the person would want to Crave for more wealth a person is not content most of the human beings aren't content Allah says in the Quran inaha chapter number four verse number 32 that do not ask from Allah subhana wa ta'ala that which Allah has favored other people we say know Allah subhana taala you have given him so much wealth you have given him such a good beautiful car don't ask from Allah what Allah has favored others with it will be lost for you and our beloved Prophet said it's mentioned inkari number four our beloved Prophet said that look at those people who are less fortunate than you don't look at those people who are more fortunate than you lest it will divert you from the remembrance of Allah subhana tala lest you may be ungrate ful to your lord so Prophet said look at those who are less fortunate then you see okay fine the person you know he doesn't have a car at least I have a small car maruti car don't look at a person having a Mercedes oh why don't I have a Mercedes the person doesn't have a car at least Allah has given me a car you be thankful to Allah the moment you compare yourself with a person who has a Mercedes oh why hasn't Allah given me a Mercedes look at those people who are less fortunate it will help you to remember Allah subhana wa tala and this is human nature and they the saying that there was a man who complained because he had no shoes until he saw a man who had no feet a person used to complain have got no shoes complain to Allah I've got no shoes and he saw a man who had no feet and he's thanking Allah subh at least have feet so contentment is a test our beloved Prophet M wasallam said it's mentioned s bukari Vol number eight that the real wealth is contentment it is not property the real true wealth is contentment being satisfied whatever you have you say alhamdulillah praise be to Allah that is a true M that's a True Believer that's a true Muslim contentment while people ask that how come Allah subhana wa ta'ala has created some people who are born healthy he makes some people born healthy some people are born with diseases maybe conal disease heart disease some are born handicap so is Allah unjust Allah says in the Quran in 4:40 Allah subhah wa ta'ala is never unjust in the least degree this is a test Allah tests different people different ways maybe it's possible the children that are born they are mum they're sinless it's not their fault at all but as the Quran says in Surah anfal chapter number 8 verse number 28 that your wealth and your children are a test for you and Allah repeats the message in chapter 63 verse number n that do not let your wealth and your children deviate from the remembrance of Allah subhana tala so may be possible that it's a test for the parents it's a test for the parents there may be occasion whenever any Calamity comes on any individual it is either a test or it's a punishment those people who have deviated from Allah subhana wa taala for them it's a punishment from those who on the true par is a test for them maybe the parents are very good Muslims offering five times Salah may have given the zakat may have gone for HJ maybe fasting the month of Ramadan now Allah gives them a child who has congenital heart disease the true Muslim a true M will say alhamdulillah thank you Allah subhana tala Allah is testing them a person who's ungrateful or may not be able to pass the difficult we say oh why he will start cribbing he'll complain to Allah subhana tala why did Allah give me a child who is handicapp who has congenital heart disease and more difficult the test more higher is the reward more difficult is the test more higher is the reward for example if you sit for a ba degree examination if you pass you're graduate ba graduate in arts but if you pass an mbbs examination besides being a graduate you get a doctor in front of your name doctor but to pass mbbs examination is multiple times more difficult than to pass a b examination more difficult the test more higher is the reward so maybe Allah subhana wa ta'ala wants to give those parents not J but J so even though they pass Allah wants to give them a higher reward and that the reason a beloved Prophet Muhammad wasallam said it's mentioned when a person asked that who had the maximum test in this world the prophet replied that all theas all the proph prophets of Allah subhana wa ta'ala they had the most difficult test after that those who were closest to them those who are like the prophets after that those who are like them and more higher is the faith of a person more difficult is a test mean more ta person has Allah gives you a difficult test so you took admission into mbbs because you got high marks in 12th standard so more difficult test to pass mbbs a difficult so here also the prophets that ta level cannot be compared with the normal human beings so just because they were prophets of God even the prophets were tested no Prophet was just L without testing but because the TA was high the prophets were tested multiple times more than the normal human being life compared to you and me more difficult so more higher is your tawa and the faith Allah will test You So True Believer if difficulty comes he says Ah Subhan Allah praise be to Allah alhamdulillah he takes it as a test and Calamity comes it's either a test or a punishment for the prophets of high tawa it wasn't a punishment it was a test and they pass the test when any good things happen to an individual it's either a reward or a test wealth can be a reward or it can be a test for you any good thing happens it is either a reward or a test for you for those who have deviated from Allah subhana tala they pray give me wealth Allah give them wealth and tell them and they fail so in this world they get what they want luxury but in the it's nothing but loss charity is the test contentment is the test the children are a test"
