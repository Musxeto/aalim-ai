  "title": "Is It Halaal to Stitch Clothes Exposing the Cleavage and Shoulders? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the question PS by a sister on the YouTube if i s such clothes which expose the upper part of the chest cleavage and shoulder don't show so is it Halal earning or Haram I believe the question posed is that talking about a tailor stitching clothes for a lady where the upper part of the chest is seen and the cleavage and the shoulder is seen so is it Halal to stitch such clothes first you should realize what is the purpose of these clothes you know normally when you Stitch undergarments but natural it's possible to show the clavage and it's perfectly fine because the clothes worn under under the other clothes but if there are other clothes where you know that a lady is wearing clothes only amongst the ladies and if some part of the body is exposed then it's not Haram but wearing such clothes otherwise outside it is not permitted so depending upon the clothes that if you know that you're stitching clothes for ladies who are going to wear an abay on top of that then it's perfectly fine but if you know that you're stitching designer clothes and people wear these clothes not wearing clothes not wearing a coat over it or wearing an abai over it and if you're aware of it stitching such clothes is not permitted because Allah says in the Quran in Surah MAA chapter number five vers number two that help one another in righteousness and tawa do not help one another in sin and ranker so if you're making clothes which you're aware that ladies would be wearing for parties and exposing the body and would be involved in things which are Haram then it is not correct to stitch such clothes but if you know these clothes are worn at home it's not worn the ladies are not going to wear in front of the namam there are some Muslim countries where you know people we AA so if you know that it's not going to involve any Haram action then there's no problem but if you're aware that this will be wound by ladies who normally go for party is outside and they don't wear the hijab and you're especially catering to them then it is not permited for you to help them in doing Haram activity you should not stitch that clothes so depending upon how it's going to be used and you as a tailor know better your customers so based on that you have to decide whether what you're doing is Haram or Hal hope that answerers the question"
