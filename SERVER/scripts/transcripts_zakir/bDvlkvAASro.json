  "title": "How to Convince Oneâ€™s Non Muslim Parents of Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "salamu alaykum my name is PRI I'm a non-muslim I'm of a sik religion and um I came across Islam like a year and a CL back through a friend we are studying in the same University and he introduced Islam to me he gave me a couple of books to read because I used to look at the way he was practicing Islam he used to pray and his talks the way he used to talk to me and then after some time uh I used to ask him a lot of questions so he told me why don't you read the Quran in the translated version so that's what I did so uh I was pretty convinced after I read the Quran that Allah is the only true God and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the only is the last [Applause] messenger but after some time my parents came to know about it and they are very religious so they are very unhappy that I was um diverting into another religion so they decided to take me to the temple to renew my faith despite the fact that I was um not very happy I could not object them because they would scold and like raise their voice and I didn't want to fight with them so I just agreed but I did not do it from my heart I just did it to make them happy to please them to avoid any argument and all that so now I actually want to ask you for an advice what do I do how am I supposed to convince my parents how am I supposed to tell them that I believe this is the religion for me at [Applause] least sister as a question that she had been studying Islam since the past one and a half year and she liked the teaching she read the Quran she got convinced that there's one God and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger and later on when the parents came to know they took her back to the temple and though she unwillingly had to obey the parents she's asking how can I convince my parents there is a talk I've given and there's a book of mine concept of God in major world religions Y what I spoke was only of four religions Hinduism Judaism Christianity and Islam if you see my full leure it even includes sism sism sism sister is a religion which came towards the end of the 15th century in the land of Punjab it was formed by Guru nanak sah and and what the scholars say it's an amalgamation of many of the teachings from Hinduism and Islam and it's a religion of 10 gurus and if you read the concept of God in Sikhism if you read the text not the practice the text if you gurug gr if you read the first chapter adig the first verse is known as jaui it says that he is true he is not b gotten and he's most powerful free from all wants and has power of all things and there's nothing like him so this of japu matches very closely with surlas which I said so theoretically sism definition of almighty God is quite similar to definition of Quran surlas that's the reason what SS believe they believe in they give two names omara which has a manifest form and aara and there are various attributes given to almighty God in sism they call almighty God as sahib which means Lord they also call him as raheim merciful they call him as Kim beneficient they call him as V Guru one true God and sism is against idol worship it's against AAR almighty God taking forms it's even against idol worship so the teachings of as far as concept of God is concerned theoretically is quite similar practically they do deviate here and a little bit but otherwise as far as concept of God is concerned it is quite similar what my advice to you would be you can give the translation of the Quran even to your mother and father and ask them to read and tell them that can you point out something which is not good or something which it disagrees so you have to be patient and you have to tell them and you have to do the duty of a True Believer first I would like to know that you did say that you read the Quran and you did also say that you believe in one God but you never said whether you accepted Islam or not but by believing there's one God believing idol worship is wrong believing proph wasallam you do enter into the fold but whether you did accept or not I'm not aware I would like to ask you sister that would you like to accept Islam yes I would like to but at this moment I would want to think like want to know how am I supposed to convince my parents first because I don't want to do something like they are not of the knowledge and I told my parents that if I'm going to take any step I will inform you you will be informed before I take any step that's right so what I would request you as I told you that you can give my DVDs to your parents there are various D and I know there so much of misconception there about Islam that most of the non-muslim would get afraid oh you're becoming a Muslim that me you're becoming a terrorist you're going to follow religion of terrorist you're going to violence in fact I always recommend that anyone who becomes a Muslim especially the youngsters first thing I tell them that there should be a difference between your behavior what you did before accepting Islam and after accepting Islam and as my son faric he told in his lecture that paradise Lies Beneath the feet of your mother even for you sister your Paradise even if your mother is a non-muslim Paradise is let bath the feet of your mother whether your mother goes to Paradise or not is secondary you understand now because you have to love your mother you have to respect your mother that does not mean that if you become a Muslim if you become you have to disrespect your mother so when your parents see the change that fine I us to request my daughter to do small things she never used to do now she's helping me she's dabbing me she's following my instructions so you have to see that once you become a Muslim there's to be a marked difference between your behavior what was earlier and what was now if previously you were a good daughter now you have to be a better daughter and when they ask you why you say this is the teaching of the Quran this is the teaching of the Prophet so once they find a mark difference in your behavior in your kindness in your obedience if you are following 50% try and follow 99.9 or 100% if you are 90% try and follow 100% only those things what they tell you which goes against the teaching of the Quran and teaching of prophet Muhammad's peace be upon him those are the only things you should abstain from besides that all what she tells you even though you may not like it you should do so there should be a marked difference for example they may tell you okay wear clothes which are blue and blue is not your favorite color so blue is not your favorite color if your mother likes it it so she gets happy so you have to look after her you have to care for her more so that they should be forced to ask how come this change is there so one they they are forced to ask you how the changes because these are the teachings of the Quran and that's what my son told in his lecture what I give a gist so if this is this sister at the same time you have to try and remove the misconception I've written a book on the most common questions asked by non-muslims that book I think it will be available outside I request the volunteers to give a copy to her and these normally try and clarify the misconception what the media has spread about Islam so if you give that book to read to your mother and father maybe they will understand part of it if not completely and give the translation and what I would say that never disrespect your parents even if they do things which are wrong you as a daughter should not disrespect as the Quran says you can't say o to them also but same time only those things what they tell you which is against Allah and his rasool these two things is the only time you can disagree but politely all the other things you go out of the way to convince them and to be good to them be kind to them there should be a marked difference and then inshallah they will be happy initially they would feel a bit sad because but natural they would think that you're going into a wrong religion but later on because of your behavior they'll get convinced and you never know you may be the Z for the Jenna like your mother par beneath her feet maybe you may be the Z you may be the path which will lead your parents to Paradise hope the answer the question sister thank you thank you"
