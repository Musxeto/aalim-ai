advisors to each of the speakers ladies and gentlemen to address you today dr william campbell [Applause] greeting to dr nike who came almost surely came the farthest greeting to sabil ahmed and muhammad nike and greeting to the organizing committee calling this the ultimate dialogue is a bit of an exaggeration but it is good advertising and greetings to you the audience i'd like to also bring greetings in the name of yahuwah or better known as jehovah the great creator god who loves us i wish to start by speaking about words tonight we are going to speak about the words of the bible and the words of the quran the scholars of modern linguistics tell us a word a phrase or sentence means what it meant to the speaker and the person or crowd of people listening in the case of the koran what it meant to muhammad and those listening to it in the case of the bible what it meant to moses or jesus or those listening to them to check this we have the context of all the usages in the bible or the quran in addition there is the poetry and letters of that century for the gospel the first century a.d for the quran the first century of the hezera if we are going to follow the truth we may not make up new meanings if we are seriously after truth there are no permissible lies here is an example of what i am talking about you can have the first slide here this is talking about two dictionaries that i have in my home one from 1951 and 1991 in these two dictionaries the first meeting pig a young swine of either sex is the same the second meaning any swine or hog any wild or domestic swine it's the same third the flesh of swine pork is the same then the meaning a person or animal of pinkish habits it's the same a person who has gluttonous and down here pouring metal into a pig for pig iron is the same but over here is a new meaning a police officer you call it police officers pigs all right the question is in the torah it says you can't eat pigs well can i turn around and say oh yes that means police officers you can't eat police officers of course not in the quran allah says can't eat pigs can i translate it can't he put police officers no it's wrong it would be stupid it would be lying actually mohammed did not mean police officers moses did not mean police officers we may not have any new meanings we must use the meanings known in the first century a.d for the bible or that is for the gospel and the first century of the hager for the quran now let us look at what the quran is going it says about embryology oh sorry got the wrong thing it has been said that the idea of the embryo developing through stages is a modern one and that the koran is anticipating modern embryology by depicting differing stages in a pamphlet entitled highlights of human embryology by keith lor moore dr moore claims the realization that the embryo develops in stages in the uterus was not discussed or illustrated until the 15th century we will weigh this claim by considering the meaning of the arabic words used by the quran and secondly by examining the historical situation leading up to and surrounding the koran we will start by looking at the main words using the word alaka main verses the arabic word alaka and the singular or alak as the collective plural is used six times in the surah of the resurrection al-qaeda 75 35-39 we read was he man not a drop of sperm ejaculated then he became alaka and god shaped and formed and made of him a pair the male and the female in the surah of the believer al-moutman 40 67 it says he it is who created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a leech like clot alaka then brings you forth as a child that perhaps you may understand in the surah of the pilgrimage al hajj 22 5 it says o mankind if you have doubt about the resurrection consider that we have created you from dust then from a drop of seed then from a clot alaka then from a little lump of flesh shapely and shapeless and finally the fullest treatment is uh in the surah of the believers 23 12-14 which reads fairly we created man from a product of wet earth then placed them as a drop of seed in a safe lodging then we fashioned to drop of clot alaka and of the clot we fashioned the lump and of the lump we fashioned bones and we clothed the bones with meat then we produced it as another creation and here you have the stages according to the quran nutha sperm alaka klot mudaga piece of meat adam bones and the fifth stage dressing the bones with muscles over the last hundred plus years this word alaka has been translated as follows there's ten translations here i'm not going to read them all three are in french where it says in gomo dasa or a clot of blood three versions five versions are english where it's either clot or leech like clot one version is in indonesian at the bottom there sigmund paldara lump of or clot of blood and the last one is farsi juan vasta a clot of blood as every reader who studied human reproduction will realize there is no stage as a clot during the formation of a fetus so this so this is a very major scientific problem in the dictionaries of were and have the nor the only meanings given for alaka in this feminine singular are clot and leech and in north africa both of these meanings are still used many patients have come to me to ask for a clot to be removed from their throat and many women have come to me and told me their period didn't come when i say i'm sorry i can't give you medicine to bring your period because i believe that's a baby they would say mazel dim it's still blood so they were understanding these ideas of the quran lastly we must consider the first verses which came to muhammad in mecca these are found in the 96 surah called alak clots from the very word that we're studying in 96 1 2 we read proclaim in the name of your lord who created created man from alak here the word is in the collective plural this form of the word can have other meanings because allah is also the derived verbal noun of the verb alika the verbal noun usually corresponds to the gerund in english as in the sentence swimming is fun therefore we could expect it to mean hanging or clinging or adhering but the ten translators listed above have all used clot or congealed blood in this verse too in spite of the number and qualifications of these translators who use the word clot the french doctor morris bukai has sharp words for them he writes what is more likely to mislead the inquiring reader is once again the problem of vocabulary the majority of translations describe for example man's formation from a blood clot a statement of this kind is totally unacceptable to scientists specializing in the field this shows how great the importance of an association between linguistic and scientific knowledge is when it comes to grasping the meaning of quranic statements on reproduction put in other words bukhai is saying nobody has translated the quran correctly until i dr bukai came along how does dr bukai think that it should be translated he proposes that instead of clot the word alaka should be translated as something which clings which would refer to the fetus being attached to the uterus through the placenta but as all you ladies who've been pregnant now the thing which clings doesn't stop its clinging to become chewed meat it keeps on being the thing which clings which is attached by the placenta for eight and a half months thirdly these verses say that the chewed meat becomes bones and then the bones are covered with muscle they give the impression that first the skeleton is formed and then it is closed with flesh and dr bukhai knows perfectly well that this is not true the muscles and the cartilage precursors of the bones start forming from the somite at the same time at the end of the eighth week there are only a few centers of ossification started but the fetus is already able to make muscular movement in a personal letter from dr t w sadler who's associate professor in embryo in anatomy and the author of langman's medical embryology dr stad sadler states at the eighth week post fertilization the ribs would be cartilaginous not bone and muscles would be present also at this time ossification would just begin muscles would be capable of some movement at eight weeks it's always better to have two witnesses so we shall see what dr keith moore has to say about the development of bones and muscles in his book the developing human extracted from chapters 15 and 17 we find the following information the skeletal skeletal system develops from mesoderm the limb muscles develop in the limb buds that are derived from this somatic mesoderm we see that here on this slide it's difficult perhaps to see but there's the limb bud and then here there's just a little bit of cartilage with the muscles around here there's more cartilage and this is the whole but the bones are formed and in the form of bones but it's all cartilage no bones yet this second slide shows how it forms here's a here's the cartilage now just the bone is looks like cartilage and then it starts to have some calcium deposited and then it starts to have ossification and bone formed as the bone models form sorry i want to go back to this as the bone models form myoblasts develop a large muscle mass in each limb bud separating into extensor and flexor muscles in other words the limb muscles develop simultaneously from the mesenchyme surrounding the developing bones so there's the cartilage and here are the muscles developing around the cartilage during a personal conversation with dr moore i showed him dr sadler's statement and he agreed that it was absolutely valid conclusion dr sadler and dr moore agree there is no time when calcified bones have been formed and then the muscles are placed around them the muscles are there several weeks before there are calcified bones rather than being added around previously formed bones as the quran states the quran is in complete error here the problems are far from being solved let us fully return to alaka dr moore also has a suggestion he says another verse in the quran refers to the leech-like appearance and the chewed-like stages of human development from this definition dr moore has gone ahead to propose that a 23-30 day a 23-day embryo three millimeters long that's an eighth of an inch i can hardly put my fingers that close together without touching this is carnegie stage 10 shown on the inside cover of morse book this is the beginning and here's the sperm entering the egg so that's stage one comes down here to stage six in the second week and here is the third week and there that's their stage 10 and here is day 23 and this is what dr moore wants to say looks like a leech if we look further though and look at the x-ray here's day 22 and the backbone is still open and when we look at day 23 the backbone is open there and it's open there and the head is wide open it doesn't look like a leech at all and if you keep on and this this is a diagram of it the head is open they're not rostral neural pore and finally this diagram shows there's the there is the the 20-day embryo it's got a yolk sac it's got an umbilicus it doesn't look like it'll each at all the problem the great problem with these new definitions for the word alaka is that no confirming examples have been provided from the arab arabic used in the centuries surrounding the hazara the only way to establish the meaning of the word is by usage the only way to establish whether the singular form alaka can mean a three millimeter embryo or the thing that clings is to bring sentences demonstrating this usage from the literature of the arabs of mecca and medina close to the time of muhammad especially from the language of the quraish this will not be an easy task because much work has already been done on the clear arabic of the quraish the early muslims understood intuitively the need to know exactly what the quranic words mean and for this reason they made comprehensive studies of their language and poetry hamz abubakar former rector of the main mosque in paris brought up this subject at a conference on the one god in montpelier in 1985. he posed the question to the audience has the comprehension of the text of the quran known at the time of muhammad remains stable and his answer was ancient poetry sows that it has we can only only conclude if the verses which bring spiritual comfort and hope to muslims have remained stable then the scientific statements embedded in those verses must also be accepted as stable unless new evidence can be brought forward this is especially important since some of the verses say that this information is a sign the surah of the believer as we saw above says he is he it is who created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a clot alaka that perhaps you may understand and in the surah of the pilgrimage he said o mankind if you have doubt about the resurrection consider therefore the question must be asked asked if it was a clear sign to the men and women of mecca and medina what did they understand from the word alaka which would lead them to faith in the resurrection the answer we are going to examine the historical situation leading up to the time of muhammad to see what muhammad and his people believed about embryology we will start with hippocrates according to the best evidence he was born on the greek island of coast in 460 bc and he has stages his stages are as follows the sperm is a product which comes from the whole body of each parent weak sperm coming from the weak parts and strong sperm from the strong parts then he goes ahead and talks about the coagulation of the mother's blood the seed embryo then is contained in the membrane moreover it grows because of its mother's blood which descends to the womb for once a woman conceives she ceases to menstruate then about flesh he says at this stage with the descent and coagulation of the mother's blood flesh begins to form with the be formed with the umbilicus and lastly bones he says as the flesh grows it is formed into distinct members by breath the bones grow hard like and send out branches like a tree next we will look at aristotle in his book on the generation of animals sometimes about 350 bc he gives his stages of embryology and he talks about first semen and menstrual blood or catamania in this section aristotle speaks of the male semen as being in a pure state it follows that what the female would contribute to the semen of the male would be material for the semen to work on in other words the semen clots the menstrual blood then he goes to flesh he says nature forms this from the purest material the flesh and from the residue thereof it forms bones and lastly around the flesh around the bones and attached to them by thin fibrous bands grow the fleshly parts clearly the koran follows us exactly sperm clotting the menstrual flood which forms meat then the bones are formed and lastly around about the bones grow the fleshly parts next we will consider indian medicine the in the opinion of sharaka in 123 a.d and seuss ruta is that both the male and female contributed seed the secretion of the male is called the sucra semen the secretion of the woman is called artavar sanita blood and it is derived from the blood by way of food by way of blood here we see that in the medicine of india they too had the idea that the child was formed from semen and blood now we shall look at galen galen was born in 131 a.d in pergamum modern bergamo and turkey galen says on semen the substance from which the fetus is formed is not merely menstrual blood as aristotle maintained but menstrual blood plus the two semens the quran agrees with galen here when it says in surah 76 2 we created man from a drop of mingled sperm now we'll look at the galen stages galen also taught that the embryo developed in stages the first is that in which the form of the semen prevails the next stage is when it has been filled with blood and heart and brain and liver are still unarticulated and unshaped this is the period that hippocrates called fetus the quranic surah 22 5 reflects this saying then out of a morsel of flesh partly formed and partly unformed and now the third period of gestation has come this thus it it nature caused flesh to grow on and around all the bones we saw above that the quran agrees with this in surah 23 14 where it says and we clothe the bones with meat the fourth and final period sorry the fourth and final period is at the stage when all the parts of the in the limbs have been differentiated galen was so important in medicine that just about the time of the hazra four leading medical men in alexandria egypt decided to form a medical school using 16 books of galen as the basis of the studies this considered continued up to and including the 13th century we must now ask ourselves what was the political economic and medical situation in arabia at the time of muhammad from the hadra mount in yemen the caravans of the spice trade passed north through mecca and medina and then reached into all of europe in northern arabia in about 500 a.d the rasa needs took over and by 528 they controlled the syrian desert over to the outskirts of madhyana syriac a form of aramaic related to arabic was their official language as early as 463 the jews translated the torah in old testament from hebrew into syriac the british museum has a copy this made it available to the hassan who were christians and to the jewish tribes in arabia during this time sergius al-rassaini who died in cancer constantinople in 536 one of the earliest and greatest translators from greek into syriac translated various works on medicine including 26 works of galen this made them available in the kingdom of khasrew 1 in persia into the rasan tribe whose influence extended to the outskirts of medina casaro 1 arabic kisrah king of persia was known as khasrew the great his troops conquered areas as far away as yemen and he also loved learning and started several schools the school of juniper became during hustler 1's long reign of 48 years the greatest intellectual center of the time within its walls greek jewish nestorian persian and hindu thought and experience were freely exchanged teaching was done largely in syriac from syriac translations of greek texts this meant that aristotle hippocrates and galen were readily available when the medical school agenda shapur was operating during his reign the next step was that the conquering arabs compelled the nestorians to translate their syriac texts of greek medicine into arabic the translation from syriac to arabic was easy as the two languages had the same grammar concerning the local medical situation during muhammad's life we know there were physicians living in arabia during this period hari ben kalada was the best educated physician trained in the healing arts he was born about the middle of the sixth century at tafe in the tribe of bani thakuf he traveled through yemen and then persia where he received his education in the medical sciences at the great medical school of jindi shapur and thus was intimately acquainted with the medical teachings of aristotle hippocrates and galen having completed his studies he practiced as a physician in persia and during this time he was called to the court of king with whom he had a long conversation he came back to arabia about the beginning of islam and settled down at taif while there abu wilker a king of yemen came to see him in connection connection with a certain disease and on being cured rewarded him with much money in a slave girl though harithman kalada did not write any book on medicine his views on many medical problems are preserved in this conversation with khosru about the eye he says that is constituted of fat which is the white part about the and then the second is constituted with water which is the black part and have wind which constitutes the eyesight well these things we know to be wrong now but this was greek thought all this goes to show the acquaintance of hari with the greek doctors summarizing the situation in a few words in his book eastward de la medicine arab dr lucian leclerc writes harith ben khalid has studied medicine at jandy shapoor and muhammad owed to harith a part of his medical knowledge thus what with the thus with the one as well as the other we easily recognize the traces of greek medicine sometimes muhammad treated the sick but in the difficult cases he would send the patients to hari another educated man person around muhammad was nadir bin harith not related to the doctor he was a karashiite and cousin of muhammad and had also visited the court of khasru he had learned persian and music which he introduced among the quraysh at mecca however he was not sympathetic to muhammad mocking some of the stories in the quran muhammad never forgave him for this and when he was taken prisoner at the battle of vader he caused him to be put to death in summary we see that one arabs living in mecca and madina in 600 had political and economic relations with people from ethiopia yemen persia and byzantine a cousin of muhammad knew persian well enough to do his musical studies in it three the hassan tribe which ruled the syrian desert over to the gates of medina use syriac one of the main languages used to teach medicine in jhundi shapur is their official language an ill king of yemen came the taif to consult the physician harithman kalada who had been trained where at jondi sheppur the best medical school in that world and to whom muhammad sometimes sent patients five during muhammad's lifetime a new medical school was established in alexandria using the 16 books of galen as their texts this all shows that there was ample opportunity for muhammad and the people around him to have heard of the embryological theories of aristotle hippocrates and galen when they went to seek treatment from harithman kalada and other local doctors thus when the quran says in the late meccan sore of the believer 4067 he it is who created you from dust then from a sperm drop then from a leech like clot that perhaps you may understand and then in the surah of the pilgrimage o mankind if you have doubt about the resurrection consider what we have created that we have created you from dust it is correct for us to ask again what were they to understand what were they to consider and here are the quranic stages again nuttfus sperm alaka klot mudaga piece of meat adam bones and five dressing the bones with muscles the answer is very clear they were understanding and considering that which was common knowledge the embryological stages as taught by the greek physicians i don't mean that muhammad's listeners all knew the names of the greek physicians but they knew the embryological stages of the greek physicians they believed that the male sperm mixed with a female menstrual blood to cause it to clot and this be this became the baby two they believed there was a time when the fetus was formed and unformed three they believed the bones formed first and then were covered with muscle allah was using that common knowledge as a sign encouraging the listeners and readers to turn to him the trouble is that this common knowledge was and is not true arab physicians after muhammad we must now look at two well-known physicians from the period after muhammad obviously they had no effect on the quran but they demonstrated that faith in the embryological ideas of aristotle hippocrates and galen continued among the arabs right up to the 1600s if the correct translation of alaka is leech like substance as modern muslims like shabir ali claim there is no place where these post quranic doctors said so in fact it's just the opposite the ideas of these greek physicians were being used to explain the quran and the quran was quoted to enlighten the meaning of the greek physicians the human being takes its origin from two this is speaking about even a cena or avicenna the human being takes its origin from two things the male sperm which plays the part effector the female sperm first part of the menstrual blood which provides the matter thus we see that even usino gave the female semen exactly the same rule that aristotle had assigned to the menstrual blood it is difficult to overstate the importance of ibnucina as a scientific and philosophical authority for the pre-modern europeans then we're going to look at even kayim al-jawsiya even kaim took full advantage of the agreement between quranic revelation and greek medicine this is not very clear probably but the hippocrates is it purplish and the koran is in bold type green and the hadith is in purple and commentaries are in red and his own thoughts in sort of a blue green so it starts out he's giving he says hippocrates said in the third chapter of catawba jinnah the semen is contained in a membrane and it grows because of the blood of its mother which descends to the womb some membranes are formed at the beginning others after the second month and others in the third month and this phrase about the blood descending to the womb we saw it when we looked at hippocrates slide that is why god said here the quran is mentioned he creates you in the womb of your mothers by one formation after another in three darknesses that's quran 9 39 6. then he gives his own ideas since each of these membranes has its own darkness when god mentioned the stages of creation and transformation from one state to another he also mentioned the darknesses of the membranes most commentators explain and hear the words of the commentators it is the darkness of the belly and the darkness of the womb in the darkness of the placenta in a second example we read hippocrates said the mouth opens up spontaneously and the nose and ears are formed from the flesh the ears are opened and the eyes which are filled with a clear liquid the prophet used to say i worship him who made my face and formed it and opened my hearing and i say and so so forth here we look at hippocrates again and there in the second stage is the same thing we just read even is quoting hippocratic hippocrates and speaks of the mother's blood descends around the membrane he could do this as we have seen because the educated people of muhammad's time were familiar with greek medicine however what is important for us here today to realize is that there is no place where the quran corrected greek medicine there is no place where even kaim was shouting hey you guys you got it this all wrong the correct meaning of alaka is that which clings or leech-like substance on the contrary even kaine was demonstrating the agreement between the koran and the greek medicine their agreement in error a final witness is the commentary of baidawi in 1200 a.d here we have the commentary we have the the air the we have the koran here and we have his character his commentary and here it's been translated and he says then from alaka a piece of solid blood is his explanation of alaka alaka is underlined that's from the quran and here's his explanation a piece of solid blood then he goes on then from a piece of meat from the quran a piece of meat originally as much as can be chewed and so forth as i mentioned at the beginning of this study it has been said that the idea the embryo developing through stages is a modern one and that the koran is anticipating modding modern embryology by depicting differing stages yet we have seen that aristotle hippocrates the indians and galen have all discussed the stages of embryological development during the thousand years before the quran and after the coming of the quran the account of the different stages as described by the koran and the greek doctors was carried on in the teachings of avicenna and even and is essentially the same as that taught by galen and those preceding him comparing concerning the bone stage it's clear as dr moore demonstrated so capably in his textbook that muscles start forming from the somites at the same time as the cartilage models of the bones there's no bone stage where there's a skeleton sitting here and then and then the the muscles are plastered around it it is equally clear that alaka in the quran means clocked and that the quraish who heard muhammad speaking understood him to be referring to the menstrual blood as the female contribution to the developing baby therefore we can conclude that during all these years the quranic verses on embryology saying that man is created from a drop of sperm which becomes a clot we're in perfect accord with the science of the first century of the hedrah of the time of the quran but when compared with the modern science of the 20th century hippocrates is an error aristotle is an error galen is an error and the quran is an error they are all in serious error now we're going to look at a little bit about moonlight does the koran state that the moon gives off reflected light from the sun before this was common knowledge in the surah of noah 71 15 16 it says see not how allah has created the seven heavens one above another and made the moon a light noir in their midst and made the sun as a lamp see raj the moon is called the light arabic nur and the sun a lamp sirash some muslims claim that since the quran uses different words speaking from about the light of the sun and the light of the moon it reveals that the sun is a source of light while the moon only reflects light this claim is implied very strongly by shabir ali in his booklet science in the quran and stated clearly by dr zakir naik in his video is the quran god's word as you will now see clearly the light that we have the light that we obtain from the moon where does it come from so he will tell me that previously we thought that the light of the moon was its own light but today after science's advance we have come to know that the light of the moon is not its own light but it's a reflected light of the sun i will ask my question that it is mentioned in this quran in surah al-spur khan chapter number 25 verse number 61 blessed is he who has created the constellation and placed there in a lamp and a moon which has reflected light the arabic word for moon is kamar and the light described there is muneer which is borrowed light or noor which is a reflection of light the quran mentions that the light of the moon is reflected light you say you discovered it today how come it's mentioned the quran 1400 years ago you will pause for a time you won't reply immediately and then may say maybe maybe it's a fluke i don't argue with him near the end of the video we heard dr nike explain the arabic word for moon is kamar and the light described there is munir which has borrowed light or noor which is a reflection of light please do not forget what he said munir is borrowed light and nor is reflected light not only is this claimed to be a statement in keeping with scientific truth but it is also claimed to be scientifically miraculous since this was supposedly only discovered relatively recently it is correct that the moon does not emit its own light but only reflects the light of the sun but this was known already almost a thousand years before muhammad aristotle in about 360 bc discussed knowing that the earth was round by its shadow on the moon he could only speak of the earth's shadow crossing the moon if he knew that moonlight is reflected light if you still insist that this is a miracle of scientific knowledge then we must ask ourselves do the quranic words themselves support this claim siraj first we shall look at siraj in surah noah which was read above in surah al-farqaan 27 25-61 it is simply lamp referring to the sun in surah anaba 7813 sirajan wajan means a dazzling lamp again indicating the sun the words noor and munir come from the same arabic word root the word munir is used six times in the quran four times surah imran 3 184 al-hajj 22 8 luchmann 3120 and fatiha 3535 it is the phrase kitab al-munir which yusuf ali translate as a book of enlightenment and pictol uses the scripture giving light clearly this indicates a book which is radiating the light of knowledge nothing about reflection nor it says in surahs noah 71 16 and yunus 10 5 that allah made the light the moon of light thus we find that the quran says that the moon is a light and it never says that the moon reflects light moreover in other verses the quran says that allah is a nor a light noor 24 35 one of the most beautiful passages in the quran reads allah is the light nor of the heavens and the earth the parable of his light is as if there was a niche a niche and within it a lamp the lamp enclosed in glass the glass says that we're a brilliant star and so forth thus we see that the word nor is used for both the moon and allah are we going to say that allah gives off reflected light i think not but if you continue to insist that nur used for the moon means borrowed or reflected light and we saw above that allah is the light nor of the heavens and the earth what is the source of this light siraj of which allah is only a reflection think about it if allah is named noor or reflected light who or what is the siraj well the quran tells us who the siraj is but the answer will shock you in sura 33 45 46 we find o prophet truly we have cynthia as a witness a bearer of glad tidings and a warner and has a lamp spreading light here it says that mohammed is the lamp spreading light in arabic it is linguistically and spiritually this is the end of the discussion linguistically siraj and the adjective munir are used together for the same shining thing the person muhammad it's clear munir does not mean reflected light in this verse or in any other verse it means shining the people of muhammad's time understood that the moon was shining and they were right just as the people of moses time understood that the sun was the greater light in the land moon the lesser light and they were right but if you insist the arabic words noor and munir mean reflected light then based on the use of these words in the quran muhammad is like the sun and allah is like the moon does dr naik really want to say that muhammad is the source of light in the law is only his reflection why are these so-called scientific claims made which no muslim can support if he makes a serious study of his own koran in a dialogue like tonight it makes honest discussion very difficult almost impossible let us go on and look at the water cycle some muslims and other authors some muslim authors claim that the koran shows pre-scientific knowledge of water cycle what is the water cycle here in this slide you see four steps the first step is evaporation the water evaporates from the seas and the earth second step it becomes clouds third step it gives rain and fourth this rain causes the plants to grow this is all very straightforward and everybody knows two three and four even if they live in a town they know the clouds come and rain comes and their flowers grow but what about step one the evaporation you can't see it it's difficult and the quran does not have step one now we're going to look at a prophet from the bible a prophet from 700 bc prophet amos and he writes he who made the pleiades and orion who turns black blackness into dawn and darkness darkest darkens day into night and then who calls off for the waters of the sea stage one and pours them out over the face of the land stage three the lord yahweh is his name and what one other prophet is uh job in 36 26 28 at least a thousand years before the hedra he says how great is god beyond our understanding the number of his years is past finding out stage one he draws up the drops of water which distill from the mist as rain that's stage three and then the clouds are mentioned stage true stage two which pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind so here in the bible this difficult stage one is there for more than a thousand years before the quran now let us go on and look at mountains the quran has more than a dozen verses stating that god placed firm and unmovable mountains on the earth and in some of these verses the mountains are listed as either a blessing for believers or a warning for the unbelievers one example of this is found in the sora lookman 31 1011 where the mountains are one of five warnings it says he was created he has created the heavens says he has created the heavens without supports that you can see and has cast elka onto the earth firm mountains rowasia lest it should shake with you in the prophet zelenavia 21 31 as one of seven warnings we read and we have set on the earth firm mountains bless it should shake with you with them finally in the bee and 16 15 says and he has cast alcoho into the earth firm mountains russia lest it should shake with you we see then that the believers and unbelievers are told that allah has done this great thing he's thrown down and placed the mountains so that the earth will not shake violently with them therefore we must ask ourselves what did they understand in the next two verses another picture is given the news in naba 7867 have we not made the earth and expanse and the mountains as fakes algebala o ta'aden as those used to anchor a tent in the ground and then the overwhelming el gasia 88 17 19. do they the unbelievers not look at the mountains el jibal how they've been pitched like a tent here men are told that the mountains are placed as tent pegs tent pegs keep the tent stable so again the idea is put forward that the pegs the mountains will keep the earth from shaking a third picture is presented in the word roesia used for mountains this word comes from the arabic root arsa and the same root is used for the arabic word for anchor to throw out or cast the anchor is el calmersa so instead of cast the anchor to keep the ship from moving we have cast the mountains to keep the earth from shaking from these pictures it is clear that muhammad's followers understood that the mountains were thrown down like tent pegs to keep a tent in place like an anchor to hold a ship in place to stop the earth from moving i.e limit earthquakes but in fact this is false the forming of mountains causes earthquakes therefore these verses present a definite problem dr maurice bukai recognized this and discussed them in his book the bible the quran and science after quoting the above verses about mountains he says modern geologists describe the folds in the earth as giving foundation to the mountains and the stability the earth's crust results from this phenomenon of these folds when asked about this professor of geology dr david a young says while it is true that many mountain ranges are composed of folded rock and the folds may be of large scale it's not true that the folds render the crust stable the very existence of the folds is evidence of instability in the crust in other words mountains don't keep the earth from shaking their formation caused and still causes the surface of the earth to shake geological theories at the present time propose that the hardened crust of the earth is made of sections or plates which slowly move in relation to each other sometimes the plates separate like north and south america separating from europe and asia and europe and south africa and sometimes they go together and they slide next to each other and they bump into each other and then they cause earthquakes an example this time of mountain formation is found in the middle east where the migration of arabia toward iran has resulted in the zygos range in iran in many parts of the world as one travels along the roads one sees a hillside where the sandstone layers which were horizontal when they were deposited are now sticking up at angles and so here you can see these sandstone layers which were horizontal in the beginning now they're sticking up at 75 degrees where they've been they were pushed up there by an earthquake by the mountains being formed sometimes the plates get caught on each other and stop sliding during this period great forces are built up when the forces of friction are overcome the piece of plate that was stuck lurches forward causing the shock wave of a thrust quake and all of a sudden it goes like this in a recent earthquake it was calculated that the cocos played in mexico suddenly jumped forward three meters well if your house suddenly jumped three more years it would be a catastrophe another type of a mountain is that formed by volcanoes lava and ash from inside the earth are thrown out and piled up until a high mountain is formed even from the bottom of the sea and we can see this kind of action in this picture i hope you can see it not clear is it the ocean crust is right here and the continental crust is there and the oceanic crust is going down under the continental crust and mountains have been formed here here's a volcano and here is the magma or the molted rock going up through the volcano and here's another volcano with magma going up and so this is how the mountains are formed and earthquakes are formed in the case of some igneous mountains molten rock intrudes into the throat of a volcano's opening and cools form a relatively dense intrusion which extends below the surface of the earth so this if this got stuck and sealed then it would be like a plug however it's not a root it does not bear the weight of the mountain it's really a plug therefore on occasion pressure builds up under the plug and the volcano explodes as happened in the south pacific at krakatoa in 1883 when the whole island was blown away and it happened in mount saint helena in our days when the mountain was blown away we can conclude from this information that mountains were formed originally with movement and shaking and that now in the present earthquakes are caused by their continued formation when the plates buckle over each other there are earthquakes when the volcanoes erupt there can be earthquakes however it is clear that the followers of muhammad were understanding these verses to say that allah threw the mountains down as a tent pegs or anchors to keep the earth from shaking throwing the mountains down into the earth may be poetry but to say that mountains keep the earth from shaking is a severe difficulty which is out of step with modern science now we're going to take a little look at what the sun says about about the quran says about the sun in the surah of the caf 1886 it says until when zul cornain that's alexander the great reached the setting of the sun he found it said in a spring of murky water i'm sorry in 20 cents science 20th century science the sun does not set in a spring of murky water and then in the criterion of furkan 25 45-46 it says hast thou not turn thy vision to thy lord how he prolongs the shadow if he willed he could make it stationary then do we god make the sun its guide what about this as the sun if you think of the sun overhead you have no shadow or a little tiny shadow and then as the sun goes down your shadow gets longer on the other side well the sun is stationary in relation to the earth it's not what causes the shadow to shift the rotating earth guides the shadows so if you demand 20th century accuracy the sora should say the rotating earth causes the shadows to change i will look at a different subject solomon's death whether this is science i don't know maybe sociology solomon's dead he's propped up on his staff says the jinns worked for him as solomon desire then when we decreed death upon solomon nothing showed them his death except the little creeping creature of the earth which nod away his staff and when he fell the jinns came clearly saw clearly how if they had known the unseen they would not have continued in the humiliating penalty of work so here's solomon he's dead he's propped up on his staff like a wakaf in morocco overseeing only a road gang and no cook comes to ask him for what he wants for dinner and no general comes for orders and none of us nobles come to say let's go hunting no one notices i'm sorry i do not believe this story and it won't fit 20th century sociology or 7th century sociology where the king would never be left alone like that now finally let us look at milk it says in the surah of the bee and 1666 we pour out to you from what is within their cattle in their abdomen the cattle's abdomen between excretions and blood milk pure and agreeable to the drinkers the abdomen where the intestines are sorry in 20th century medical science the abdomen where intestines are is where the intestines are the mammary glands are under the skin in humans they're under the skin here in cattle they're under the skin between the legs no connection there's no connection between the breasts and the intestines and their feces in any way feces though in the body it really is outside of the animal animals finished with it it's not connected to milk or to anything else and finally going to look at communities the surah of the cattle and 638 there is not an animal on the earth nor a being that flies on two wings but forms communities like you speaks about no animal on earth not a being that flies and then it says that every one of them is communities like you and i assume that the quran is speaking about we humans well some fly in some spiders when they finish mating the mother eats the father well i'm glad that my wife didn't eat me even in bees the extra male drones are thrown out to die well i'm glad also that after i had we had four children then my wife didn't push me out of the house too finally the lions when a lion gets old a male lion gets old a young lion comes along and drives him away from his own wives and the young lion takes over their wives but what he does with the cubs the cubs of the old lion he kills them all so i do not think that this sentence is true all of the communities are and all of the animals do not live in communities like us in conclusion it is clear that the koran has many scientific errors as a generality the koran mirrors and reflects the science of its time the science of the seventh century a d we came here to seek truth i've done my best to present valid information if you want to see all the references my book the quran and the bible in the light of history and science is for sale outside that door at a bargain price tonight may the god of all truth guide you thank you thank you dr campbell for your presentation now we have brother sabil ahmed presenting an introduction of our next speaker dr zakir naik assalamu alaikum muhammad allah it is my pleasure to introduce one of the best scholars of our time dr zakir abdul karim nayak ish 34 years old he is the president of islamic research foundation bombay india though a medical doctor by professional training dr zakir naik is known as a dynamic international operator on islam and comparative religion dr zakir naik clarifies islamic viewpoints and clears misconceptions about islam based upon the quran hadith and other religious scriptures as well as adhering to reason logic and scientific facts he is popular for his critical analysis and convincing answers to challenging questions posed by audiences after his public talks he appears regularly on many international tv and satellite tv channels programs in several countries of the world he has authored books on islam and comparative religion he has also participated in several symposiums and dialogues with prominent personalities of other religious faiths ladies and gentlemen may i call upon dr zakir naik to present his talk [Music] respected dr william campbell dr maracas dr jamal brother samuel noman dr muhammad naik my respective elders and my dear brothers and sisters i welcome all of you with the islamic greetings assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi the topic of today's dialogue is the quran and the bible in the light of science the glorious quran is the last and final revelation which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him for any book to claim that it is a revelation from almighty god it should stand the test of time previously in the olden days it was the age of miracles alhamdulillah the quran is the miracle of miracles later on came the age of literature and poetry and muslims and non-muslims alike they claim the glorious iran to be the best arabic literature available on the face of the earth but today is the age of science and technology let us analyze whether the quran is compatible or incompatible with modern science albert einstein said science without religion is lame and religion without science is blind let me remind you that the glorious quran is not a book of science s-c-i-e-n-c-e it's a book of signs s-i-g-n-s it's a book of ayats and there are more than 6000 signs ayaats in the glorious quran out of which more than a thousand speak about science as far as my talk regarding quran and science is concerned i will only be speaking about scientific facts which have been established i will not be speaking about scientific hypothesis and theories which are based on assumption without any proof because we all know many a times science takes u-turns dr william campbell who wrote a reply to the book of dr maurice buchel the quran the bible in the light of history and science he says in his book that there are two types of approaches one is a concordis approach which means a person tries to bring a compatibility between the scripture and science and the other is the conflict approach in which a person tries to bring a conflict between scripture and science like how dr william campbell has done very well but as far as the quran is concerned irrespective whether a person uses a conflicting approach or a concordis approach as long as you're logical and after a logical explanation is given to you not a single person will be able to prove a single verse of the quran in conflict with established modern science dr william campbell has pointed out various alleged scientific errors in the quran and i'm supposed to actually refute in the rebuttal but since he chose to speak first i will be refuting a few points in my talk i will reply to the major part of his talk mainly dealing with embryology and geology the remaining inshallah inshallah i will have a level best to reply in the rebuttal i have to do both i can't do injustice the topic the topic is quran and bible in the light of science i can't only speak about one scripture dr william campbell hardly spoke about one or two points about the bible which i shall deal with inshallah i will speak about both inshallah i want to adjust this to the topic as far as quran and modern science is concerned in the field of astronomy the scientists the astronomers a few decades earlier they described how the universe came into existence they called it the big bang and they said initially there was one primary nebula which later on it separated with a big bang which gave rise to galaxies stars sun and the earth we live in this information is given in a nutshell in the glorious quran in surah ambiya chapter 21 verse number 30 which says do not the unbeliever see that the heaven and the earth will join together and we close them asunder imagine this information which they came to know recently the quran mentioned 1400 years ago when i was in school i had learned that the sun in respect to the earth it was stationary the earth and the moon they rotated about the axis but the sun was stationary but when i read a verse of the quran saying in chapter 21 verse number 33 it says it is allah was created the night and the day was our commander the sun and the moon colon fifa yes each one traveling in orbit with its own motion now alhamdulillah modern science has confirmed the quranic statement an arabic word used in the quran is yas bahun which describes the motion of a moving body when it refers to a celestial body it means it is rotating about its own axis so quran says the sun and the moon they revolve as well as rotate about their own axis today we have come to know that the sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one notation it was edwin hubble who discovered that the universe is expanding the quran says 51 verse number 47 that we have created the expanding universe the vastness of space the arabic word muslim refers to vastness the expanding universe regarding the topics on astronomy which dr william campbell touched i will deal in the rebuttal inshallah in the field of water cycle that william campbell pointed out certain things the quran describes the water cycle in great detail i know wilhelm campbell mentioned four stages in his book he mentioned four a and b the last one he didn't mention in the slide i don't know why it says that rip conditioning the water table he missed out here maybe because not mentioned in the bible he said there is not a single verse in the quran which speaks about evaporation quran says in surah chapter number 86 verse number 11 rajasthan that by the capacity of the heavens to return and almost all the commenter of the quran they said that this verse of surah tariq chapter 86 verse number 11 refers to the capacitor of the heaven to return back rain meaning evaporation dr william campbell who knows arabic may say why didn't allah subhanahu tala specifically mention meaning the capacity of the heaven to return back reign why didn't allah mention specifically now we have come to know why didn't allah do that in his divine wisdom because today we have come to know that besides the ozonosphere the layer above the earth besides returning back rain it even returns back other beneficial matter and energy of the earth which is required by the human beings it does not only turn back grain today we have come to know it even returns back waves of telecommunication of television of radio by which we can see tv we can communicate we can hear the radio and besides that it even returns back the harmful rays of the outer space back on the other side and absorbs for example the ultraviolet rays of the sunlight is absorbed by the ionosphere if this was not done life on the earth would cease to exist so allah subhanahu talaha is far superior and far more accurate when it says capacity of the heaven to return and the remaining things as he mentioned is there in the quran you can refer to my video the quran described the water cycle in great detail regarding what he said about the bible he saw stage one and stage three in the first slide and the second stage one three and then two that the rain water is taken up he says and then the invader comes on the earth this is the philosophy of phase of militis in seventh century bc he thought that the spray of the ocean was picked up by the wind and fell into the interior as rain there's no cloud mentioned there in the second quotation dr william campbell gave first is according to him evaporation which we agree we don't mind having the concordance approach of the bible then rain falls down and then other clouds formed that is not the complete water cycle alhamdulillah the quran describes the water cycle in great detail in several places how does the water rise evaporates form into clouds the clouds join together they stack up the thundering water comes down the clouds move into the interior they fall down as rain and the repetition of the water table and alhamdulillah in great detail the quran speaks about the water cycle in great detail in several places in surah nur chapter number 24 verse number 43 in israel chapter number 30 verse 48 in surah chapter 39 verse 21 in surah milan chapter 23 verse number 18 in room chapter number 30 verse number 24. in surah chapter 15 verse number 22 in surah chapter number 7 verse number 57 in surah chapter number 13 verse number 17 in surah furqan chapter 25 [Applause] 36 verse number 34 in surah jason chapter 45 verse number five in surah chapter number 50 verse number nine in surah chapter 56 verse number 16 and 17 several places surah chapter 67 verse number 30 the glorious quran speaks about the water cycle in great detail dr william campbell spent maximum time on embryology about half his talk quite a lot on geology and touched on other six topics i've noted down in the field of geology we have come to know today the geology tell us that the radius of the earth is approximately 3750 miles and the deeper layers they are hot and fluid and cannot sustain life and the superficial part of the earth's crutch which we live on it is very thin hardly one to thirty miles some portions are thicker but majority one to thirty miles and there are high possibility that this superficial layer the earth's crust it will shake it is due to the folding phenomena which gives rise to mountain ranges which gives stability to this earth quran says in sura naba chapter number 78 verse number six and seven we have made the earth as an expanse while jabal and the mountains as stakes the quran doesn't say mountains were thrown up at stakes mountains at stakes arabic word means stakes meaning tent peg and today we have come to know in the study of modern geology that mountain has got deep roots this was known in the second half of the 19th century and the supervision part that we see of the mountain is a very small percentage the deeper part is within exactly like a stake how it is driven in the ground you can only see a small part on top the majority is down in the ground or like a tip of the iceberg you can see the tip on the top and about 90 is beneath water the quran says in surah russia chapter 88 verse number 19 and foreign number 79 verse number 32 was and we have made the mountain standing firm on the earth made the mountain standing from on the earth today after modern geology has advanced iono william campbell said that by the theory of plate tectonics it was propounded in 1960 which gives rise to mountain ranges the geologists today do say that the mountains give stability to the earth not all geologists but many do say i have not come across a single geological book and i challenge dr william campbell to produce a single geological book not his personal correspondence with the geologist that doesn't carry weight his personal correspondence with dr keith moore documented proof and if you read the book the earth which is referred by almost all the universities in the field of geology one of its authors by the name of dr frank press was the advisor to the former president of usa jimmy carter and was the president of the academy of sciences of usa he writes in his book that the mountain is a west shape it has deep roots within and he says that the function of the mountain is to stabilize the earth and the quran says in surah ambia chapter number 21 verse number 31 in israel luqman chapter 31 verse number 10 as well as chapter number 16 verse number 15 that we have made the mountain standing firm on the earth lest it would shake with them and with you the function of the mountain in the quran is given to prevent the earth from shaking nowhere does the quran say that the mountain prevents the earthquake and dr william campbell said he writes in his book and even the talk that you find in the mountainous regions that are various earthquake and mountains cause earthquake point to be noted nowhere does the quran say that mountain prevents earthquake the arabic word for earthquake as dr william camel knows arabic is the result of but the words used in these three verses are quoted it is tamida tamida means to shake to sway to swing and quran says in surah luqman chapter 31 verse number 10 as well as foreign chapter number 16 verse 15 we have put on the earth mountain standing firm lest it would shake with you it is tamida become shake with you indicating if the mountains were not there if you would have walked if you would have moved even the earth would have moved with you if you would have swayed even the earth would have stayed with you and we know normally when we walk on the earth there doesn't shake and the reason for this is according to dr frank press and dr majar who is from saudi arabia and he wrote a full book on georgia concepts in the quran answering almost everything what dr william camilla said in detail another william campbell in his book he writes that if mountains prevent the shaking of the earth then how come you find earthquake in the mountainous regions i said nowhere does the quran say mountain permits earthquake earthquake is resolved and if you see the definition in the oxford district it says earthquake is due to conversion of the superficial crust of the earth due to release of compressed seismic waves due to crack in the rock or due to volcanic reaction the quran speaks about zazzallah in surah chapter 99 but here it speaks about tamida become to prevent the earth from shaking with you and in reply to the statement that if mountains prevent earthquakes how come you find earthquakes in mountainous region the reply is that if i say that medical doctors they prevent the sickness and disease in a human being and if someone argues if doctors prevent the sickness and diseases in a human being how come you find more sick people in the hospital where there are doctors than at home where there are no doctors in the field of versionology the glorious quran says in surah fur khan chapter 25 verse number 53 that it is allah who has let free two bodies of flowing water one sweet and palatable the other salt and bitter though they meet they will not mix between them there is a barrier which is forbidden to be test passed quran says rahman chapter 55 verse number 1920 it is allah who has let free two bodies of flowing water though they meet they will not mix between them there is a barrier which is forbidden to be test fast previously the commenter of the quran wondered what does the quran mean we know about sweet and salt water but between them there is a barrier though their meat do not mix today after advancement of oceanology we have come to know that whenever one type of water flows into the other type of water it loses its constituents and gets homogenized into the water it flows there is a slanting homogenizing area which the quran refers to as unseen barrier and this has been agreed upon by several scientists even of america by the name of dr haye you lost knowledge and dr william campbell writes in his book that it is an observable phenomena the fisherman of that time knew there were two types of water salt and sweet so prophet muhammad during expedition to syria he may have gone in the sea or he might have spoken to this fisherman sweet and salt water is an observable phenomenon i agree but people did not know that there was an unseen barrier until recently the scientific point to be noted here is the barzak not the sweet and the salt water in the field of embryology brother william tam will spend approximately half of his talk on that time will not permit to reply to every small things which are illogical i'll just give a brief reply which will be satisfactory inshallah and for more details you can refer to my video cassette quran modern science and my other questions on quran and medical science there were a group of arabs who collected the data dealing in the quran about embryology and the hadees dealing with embryology and they presented it to professor keith moore who was the chairman of the head of the department of anatomy in the university of toronto in canada and at prison he is one of the leading scientists in the field of embryology after reading the various translations of the quran he was asked to comment and he said most of the verses of the quran and the hadith are in perfect conformity with modern embryology but there are a few verses which i cannot say that they are right neither can i say that they are wrong because i myself don't know about it and two such verses were the first verse of the quran to be revealed from surah surah chapter 96 verse number one and two which says ikra this mirror because read recite or proclaim in the name of thy lord who created who created the human beings from something which clings a litch-like substance regarding dr william campbell's statement that to analyze the meaning of a word you have to see what was the meaning at that time when it was revealed at that time when the book was written and he rightly said that to analyze the meaning you have to analyze the meaning at the time it was revealed and to the people who it was meant for as far as this statement of his is concerned regarding the bible i do agree with it totally because the bible was only meant for the children of israel for that time it's mentioned the gospel of matthew chapter number 10 verse number 5 and 6 jesus christ peace be upon him tells his disciples go not in the way of the gentiles who are the gentiles the non-jews the hindus the muslims but rather go to the lost chip of the house of israel jerusalem peace be upon him said in the gospel of matthew chapter number 15 verse number 24 i am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of israel so jesus christ and the bible were only meant for the children of israel since it was meant for them to analyze the bible you have to use the meaning of the word which was utilized at that time but the quran was not meant only for the arabs of that time quran is not meant only for the muslims the quran is meant for the whole of humanity and it is meant to be for eternity quran says in surah ibrahim chapter 14 verse 52 in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse 185 and surah zuma chapter 39 verse 41 that the quran is meant for the whole of humankind and prophet muhammad peace be upon him was not sent only for the muslim or the arabs allah says in the quran in surah chapter 21 that we have sent thee as a mercy as a guidance to the whole of humankind so as far as the quran is concerned you cannot limit the meaning only for that time because it is meant for eternity so one of the meanings of alaka is leash-like substance or something which clings so professor keith moore said i do not know whether the early stage of embryo looks like a leech and he went into the laboratory and he analyzed the early stage of an embryo under a microscope and compared it with the photograph of leech and he was astonished at the striking resemblance this is the photograph of a leech and human embryo what dr william campbell showed you is the other perspective of it if i show this book it looks like a rectangle if i show you like that it's a different perspective that diagram is given in the book the diagnosis on the side is given there and i'll deal with inshallah prophet keith moore after about 80 questions asked to him he said if you would have asked me these 80 questions 30 years ago i would not be able to answer more than 50 because embryology has developed recently in the past 30 years he said this in 80s now do we believe in dr keith moore whose statement is available outside in the fire if video cast is available this is the truth unknown recorded statement so will you believe dr william campbell's personal conversation with professor keith moore or the one mentioned in this book with islamic edition as well as the photograph that i've shown to you and in the video cassette available outside you can see it he makes those statements so you have to choose which is more logical personal discussion with dr william campbell or his statement on video like how do william campbell showed my video 100 proof what i said moon is reflected light i'll come to it later on and whatever additional information you got from quran and hadith it was incorporated later into the book the developing human the third edition and this book got an award for the best medical book written by a single author in that year this is the islamic edition that was put forward by sheikh abdul majid azindani and certified by keith moore himself the quran says in surah muhammadun chapter 23 verse number 13 and surah chapter 22 verse number 5 and no less than 11 different places in the quran that the human beings have been made from anutha a minor quantity of liquid like a trickle that's remaining in the kaplan arabic a very small quantity today we have come to know in one seminal emission in which there are several millions of sperm only one is required to fertilize the ovum the quran refers as mutfa quran says in surah chapter 3 verse number 8 we have created the human beings from salalah that means the best part of a whole the one sperm which fertilizes the ova out of the millions of sperm the quran refers to best part of the whole and quran says chapter 76 verse number two we have created the human beings from a minor quantity of mingle fluid referring to the sperm as well as the ovum both are required for the fertilization the quran describes the various american stages in great detail of which the slides were shown to you about william campbell he helped me to complete this topic it's mentioned foreign chapter 23 verse number 12 to 14. the translation is that we have created the human beings from another a minor quantity of liquid then placed it in a karate machine a place of security then we made it into an alaka a leach-like substance something which clings a tangible clot of blood then we made that alaka into a mudga a chewed like lamb then we made the mudga into izama bones then clothed the bones with him flesh then we made it a new creature blessed be allah who's the best to create these three verses of the quran speak about the various embryological stages in great detail first the nutha placed in a place of security merindue and alaka alaka has got three meanings one is something which clings and we know that in the initial stages the embryo clings to the uterine wall and continues clinging till the end point number two that it also means a leech-like substance and as i discussed earlier the embryo in the initial stages does look like a leech beside looking like a leech it also behaves like a leech it receives its blood supply from the mother like a blood sucker and the third meaning which dr william campbell objected to that that is the right meaning the kanji sort of blood and that's why quran has a scientific error and i do agree with him that dr william campbell didn't agree he said how can it mean a conjecture out of blood because this is the case and the quran is wrong i'm sorry to say quran is not wrong dr william campbell with due respect to him he is wrong because today today after advancement of embryology even dr keith moore he says that in the initial stages the embryo besides looking like a leech also looks like a congenital slot of blood because in the initial stages of the stage of alaka three to four weeks the blood is clotted within closed vessels and dr william campbell made it easy for me he showed you a slide it will be difficult for you to see but this is the side showed you this is exactly what professor keith moore said looks like a clot in which the blood is plotted within closed vessels and during the third week of the embryo the blood circulation doesn't take place it starts later on therefore it assumes the appearance of a clot and even if you observe the conceptus that's after abortion takes place you can see it looks like a clot only one line answer is sufficient to answer all the allegations of dr william campbell is that the stages of the quran while it describes the embryological stages is only based on appearance appearance first is the appearance of a alaka a leash-like substance as well as a clot of blood and dr william temple rightly said that some ladies come and ask please remove the clot it does look like a plot and the stages are based on appearance it is created from something which appears like a clot which appears like a leech and is also something which clings then the quran says we made that alaka into a mud chewed like lamb prophet keith moore took plaster seal and bit between his teeth to make it look like a mudga the teeth mark resembled the somites the william campbell said when the alaka become the mudga the clinging is yet there it is that late and half months so the quran is wrong i told you in the beginning the quran is describing the appearance the leech-like appearance and the clot-like appearance is changed to the chewed-like appearance it yet continues to cling till the end there's no problem but the stages are divided on appearance not on the function later on quran says we made the mudgah into his armor bones then clothed the bones with flesh so william campbell said and i do agree with him that the precursors of the muscles and the cartilages that is the bones they form together i agree with that today embryology tells us that the primordia of the muscles and the bones they form together between the 25th and the 40th day with the quran refers to the stage of mudga but they are not developed they are not developed later on at the end of the seventh week the embryo takes form of human appearance then the bones are formed today modern embryology says the bones are formed after the 42nd day and it gives an appearance of a skeletal thing even at this stage when the bones are formed the muscles aren't formed later on after the seventh week and the starting of eighth week are the muscles formed so quran is perfect in describing first alaka then mudga then izaman then close it with flesh and when they form the description is perfect and professor keith moore said that the stage is that how it is described in modern embryology stage one two three four five it's so confusing the quranic stage on embryology describing on the best of appearance and the shape is far more superior alhamdulillah therefore he said therefore he said that i have no objection in accepting that prophet muhammad is the messenger of god and that this glorious quran has to be a divine revelation from almighty god it's mentioned in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse 56 it speaks about pain previously the doctors they thought that the brain was only responsible for feeling of pain today we have come to know besides the brain there are certain receptors in the skin which are responsible for feeling of the pain which we call as pain receptors quran says in surah chapter 456 that as to those who reject our signs we shall cast them into the hellfire and as often as the skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skin so that they shall feel the pain indicating there is something in the skin which is responsible for feeling of pain which the quran refers to as pain receptors prophet talatakushan who is the head of the department of anatomy in chiang mai university in thailand only on the basis of this one was he proclaimed the shahada in the 8th medical conference in riyadh and said rasulullah that there's no god but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon him is the messenger of allah i started my talk that soon we shall show them our signs in the furthest of the horizons and into their soul until it is clear to them that this is the truth this one verse was sufficient to prove to dr takatakashan that quran is the divine revelation some may require 10 signs some may require 100 some even after 1000 signs are given they will not accept the truth quran calls such people as in bakra chapter 2 verse number 18 mukmun um yun found our june the death the dumb the blind they will not return the true part the bible says the same thing in gospel of matthew chapter number 13 verse number 13 seeing they see not hearing that you're not neither will they understand regarding the other parts of embryology i will deal in my rebuttal inshallah if time permits i have to adjust this to the other part also regarding bible in the right of science at the outset let me tell you that quran says in surah roy chapter 13 verse 38 that we have given several revelations by name only four are mentioned the torah the zaboor the injeel and the quran the torah is the wahi the revelation which was given to moses peace be upon him the zaboor is the wahi which was given to david peace be upon him the injeel is the way the revelation which was given to jesus peace be upon him and quran is the last and final revelation which was given to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him let me make it very clear to everyone that this bible with the christians believe to be the word of god is not the injeel which we muslims believe was revealed to prophet jesus peace be upon him this bible according to us it may contain the words of god but it also contains words of prophets words of historians it contains absurdities obscenity as well as innumerable scientific errors if there are scientific points mentioned in the bible there are possibilities why not it may be part of the word of god in the bible but what about the scientific errors what about the unscientific portion can you attribute this to god i want to make it very clear to my christian brothers and sisters the purpose of my presentation on bible and science is not to hurt any christians feeling if by presenting if i hurt your feelings i do apologize in advance the purpose is only to point out that a gods revelation cannot contain scientific errors as jesus christ peace be upon him said search you the truth and the truth shall free you you have the old testament you have the new testament now you should follow the last and final testament which is the glorious quran as far as dr william campbell is concerned i can be more liberal with him because he has written a book quran bible in the light of history and science he has given a presentation and he's a medical doctor i don't have to be very formal with him as far as the other christian brothers and sisters are concerned i apologize if i hurt your feelings during the presentation let's analyze what the bible say about modern science first we live with astronomy the bible speaks about the creation of the universe in the beginning first book book of genesis first chapter it's mentioned it says almighty god created the heavens and the earth in six days and talks about evening and morning referring to a 24-hour day today scientists tell us that the universe cannot be created in a 24 hour period of six days quran 2 speaks about six ayams arabic word singular ethereum pluralis i am it can either mean a day or 21st or it is a very long period and yawn and epoch scientists say we have no objection in agreeing that the universe it could have been created in six very long period point number two bible says in genesis chapter number one verse three and five light was created on first day genesis chapter one verse fourteen to nineteen the cause of light stars and the sun etc was created on fourth day how can the cause of light be created on the fourth day later than the light which came into existence on the first day it's not scientific further the bible says genesis chapter 1 verse 9-13 earth was created on the third day how can you have a night and day without the earth the day depends upon the rotation of the earth without the earth created how can you have a night and day point number four genesis chapter number 1 verse 9-13 says earth was created on third day genesis chapter 1 verse 14 19 says the sun and the moon was created on the fourth day today science tells us that earth is part of the parent body the sun it cannot come into existence before the sun it's unscientific point number five the bible says in genesis chapter 1 verse number 11-13 the vegetation the herbs the shrubs the trees they were created on the third day and the sun genesis chapter number 1 verse 14-19 was created on the fourth day how can the vegetation come into existence without sunlight and how can they survive without sunlight point number six that the bible says in genesis chapter 1 verse number 16 that god created two lights the greater light the sun to rule the day and the lesser light the moon to rule the night the actual translation you go to the hebrew text it is lamps lamps having light of its own and that you'll come to know better if you read both the verses genesis chapter 1 verse 16 as well as 17 verse number 17 says and almighty god placed them in the form of men to give light to the earth to give light to the earth indicating that sun and the moon has its own light which is in contradiction with established scientific knowledge that we have i would like to end my talk by giving the quotation of the glorious quran from surah baqarah chapter and then say this is from allah to traffic with it for a miserable price go to those for what they write go to those for what they earn alhamdulillah i would request our audience to bear bear with us and maintain a due decorum for the continuation of the dialogue now i call upon dr william campbell to present his response to dr zakir naik well dr nike has brought up some real problems and there are some of these problems that he has said and i don't deny them and i don't have good answers for them but i will tell about we're going to make a mathematical study of prophecies it's called the theory of probabilities estimate and will estimate the possibility that these prophecies could be fulfilled by chance i now call upon dr zakir naik to present his response to dr william campbell [Applause] dr william campbell only touched on two out of the 22 points i made only two you can only solve two problems the sixth day creation problem and first day light came and third the earth but the remaining four problems yet is there so dr william campbell chose to say days a long period and out of six he solved two scientific errors the remaining four of the creation of the universe he does agree to it that's good the king james version as well as the international version which dr william campbell refers to drink deadly poison not eat drink [Applause] dr wilhelm temple doesn't know that indians out here surely many minor gujarati marathi even i know if i ask you dr william campbell did not reply to my 20 points and he starts speaking about prophecy what does prophecy to do with science in the bible if prophecy is the test but even if there's one unfulfilled prophecy the whole bible is disproved with the word of god i can give you a list of unfulfilled prophecy according to your theory of theory of probability bible is not the word of god irrespective whether you use the conflict approach or the concordance approach if you are logical you will not be able to take out a single verse of the quran which is contradicting neither a single verse which is against established science if dr william campbell cannot understand the quran that does not mean quran is wrong bible says in job chapter number 10 verse number 9 and 10 that we have made the human being from clay like poured out milk and curdled cheese poured out milk and curdled cheese is exact plagiarization from hippocrates yes i'd like to post this question or rather this test to dr william campbell why don't you attempt the falsification test of the bible given in the book of mark chapter 16 verses 17 and 18 and prove to the audience here right now that you are a true christian believer my question is dr zakir naik the christians explain the concept of trinity scientifically by giving the example of water which can be in three states solid liquid and gas in the form of ice water and vapor similarly one god is a triune god father son and holy ghost is this explanation scientifically correct the word trinity is not there in the bible but it is in the quran you said there isn't any mistake in quran i see more than 20 mistake in arabic grammar and i will tell you some of them brothers one question at a time but at the same thing he said in 63 mistake can you explain that and the book is referring to abdul fahdi abdulfati correct is the quran infallible i can see some things yeah my side is good dr campbell since you are a medical doctor could you please explain scientifically the various medical aspects that in the bible regarding because you didn't answer them in your rebuttal for example blood used as a disinfectant bitter water test for adultery and most importantly that the woman is unclean for double the period when she gives birth to a daughter then as compared to a son okay dr campbell if you cannot answer the contradictions in genesis regarding the creation don't you think that th that proves that the bible is unscientific and therefore not from god i admit that i have some problems with this the muslim yastic the quran is far superior to your ayat the science therefore you should believe in quran which is far superior dr campbell agreed to dr nike that the errors he showed are not wrong and that he can't answer them so does this mean that dr campbell agrees that the bible has errors so it's not the word of god there are things in the bible that i can't explain that i don't have an answer for now how can a son be two years older than the father believe me even even in hollywood film you will not be able to produce it you"
