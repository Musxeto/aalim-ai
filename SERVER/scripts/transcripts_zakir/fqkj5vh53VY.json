  "title": "Ka'bah is the Qibla & Not God! - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yeah I'm Dr chabra I'm an eye specialist I'm in Dubai since 1984. I had a chance to listen Dr zagir a few times and it's always fun to listen him every time it's so informative so educated so eye-opener and I always enjoy asking him some questions so I'm lucky to be the first to ask him the question my first question is you said the holy place is in the center so that it is equal from everywhere but to my mind I may be wrong or right the God is all prevailing omnipotent omnipresent Omniverse then he need not to be present in one place is everywhere who non-muslim Brothers asked a good question brother he has the question that God is omnipotent omnipresent so why should he be in the center whether when you heard a man's I think you misunderstood and never said God is present in the center I didn't say that I said the Kaaba is in the center not God Kaaba is the Qibla the direction and the car by the direction for Unity when we worship almighty God we Face In One Direction for Unity not that God is only there Quran clearly says in Surah chapter 2 verse 177 it is not righteousness that you turn your face to the east and west it is righteousness that you believe in Allah so you misunderstood Kaaba is the Qibla attraction so for Unity they have kept the direction in the center God is not in the center God is on the earth he's on the throne what we realize that for Unity we have to face in One Direction so the Kaaba for Unity has been kept in the center so all the different people different human beings from different parts of the world can face for Unity in One Direction because we believe when we offer prayers in Salah we believe in congregation believe in unity hope that answers the question"
