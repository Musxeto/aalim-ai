  "title": "The New Recording Facility for Live Talks and Question & Answer Sessions â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "it is good to know that you have set up everything in Malaysia and are now broadcasting live millions are benefiting from these live shows please do continue even after Ramadan there's a similar question how is the relocation going in Malaysia did you reset up the post-production team there a similar question from shoa from Dhaka Bangladesh Dr Zakir Naik you are my hero you don't know how much I was missing you and finally You Came live I have a lot of questions to ask first is how often am I going to see my hero please continue this live talks always that basically two questions one is about the setup in Malaysia and second is about my life talks as far as watching me on the media I am available 24x7 you know not on the peace TVP Steve English I come approximately 18 of the time and PhD may be 14 but you can go to the pitch TV app and there you can see all the programs you have missed for the last one week so download the pitch TV app from the Google or from the App Store and you can see you can go on the YouTube there are about 2000 videos of mine uploaded on the channel you can go on the Facebook you can watch me 24x7 as far as the live sessions are concerned we never had live sessions on Peach TV except for the lectures and the conferences which was you know on average a few times in a year but alhamdulillah in this month of Ramadan as you may be aware I am twice a week life that is nine times in this month of Ramadan alhamdulillah after Ramadan inshallah I've decided I will come live on this peace TV network as well as my social media once a week every Saturday is the most important day for the maximum viewership and I will try and have the program on the prime time the prime time in most of the world is from 8 30 to 11 o'clock more close from 930 and as you know that more than 50 percent of the viewership whether it be on the pitch TV more than 50 on the Facebook on the YouTube is from the Indian subcontinent Bangladesh Pakistan and India so when is prime time there it will be in Malaysia 11 30. so every Saturday inshallah after Ramadan ends I'll be live having a similar section by the name by the topic ask Dr Zakir it will start at 11 30 inshallah Malaysia time that would be the GMT would be 330 in Bangladesh it will be 9 30 a prime time in India would be nine o'clock again prime time and Pakistan 8 30 against prime time but in Malaysia it would be 11 30 and in Indonesia again we have a viewership would be 8 30. and inshallah it will be every Saturday Maybe few times in a year due to my busy schedule we may have to avoid the live session when inshallah if Allah will continue throughout the year every Saturday GMT 330 for one and a half ask Dr Zakir and this would only contain question answer session you do not have a talking in the start it will have a question answer session exclusively mainly questions asked on compiler privilege and question asked by non-muslim question us on science on other aspects on logical questions with the non-muslims attack Islam with so that the Muslims can continue doing the dawa and propagation the second part of the question that how did I set up in Malaysia and relocated and maybe you know everything is set up and we have a big team here let me tell you that in Malaysia at present I have only two full-time paid employees as far as the setup is concerned I am the director I am the dop Director of Photography I am the cameraman I am the light man I am the setting man it is helping me and lastly I am also the speaker how we set up I asked my one of the staff to sit here and I go be and believe me we have got no professional equipment you will be shocked to know that this program I'm recording is with my iPhone iPhone 11 Max Pro the only equipment I purchased is the stand for my iPhone which costs less than 50 US dollars and the microphone which costs less than 25 dollars that's it there was a time a few years back in 2015 and 16 we had the best equipment of the world we had 8K cameras 4k camera film camera each camera costing about 250 000 US dollars more than a million drink it more than approximately two crore Indian rupees and four crore Pakistan rupees one camera and we had 18 cameras all of it now is in custody of the Nia of India the illegally the confiscated all the camera which what did the camera got to do with the allegations against me but this is how they want to stop the activity but Allah has his ways alhamdulillah I am recording with an iPhone with this microphone of less than 25 dollars and the standoff less than 50 US dollars there is no professional person alhamdulillah has given me the passion for which I'm involved in many technical aspects and I was also involved as a technical head of the of the peach TV alhamdulillah and I'm using that knowledge with no professional equipment with home lighting you can see that there are no Shadows that's very important you may have the best camera in the world but the lighting is poor equally been atrocious here we have an iPhone it is home these plants are from home this chair is from home the curtain is home there is no studio and while I was doing recording with one of the satellites they said masha'allah your setting is better than the studio I don't agree it's better but it is and it you cannot compare with the recording of fish TV that was par Excellence we had the best equipment in the world but yet this recording alhamdulillah is better than most of the recording done by done for the Islamic program world over I have been to many studios of Islamic channels and Islamic organizations with all the limitations we have yet masha'allah it's better than most it's not the best and what do I do I ask my my one staff I ask him to sit on this chair I go behind the camera I do the setting we do the lighting and then see how much is headspace on top and then after the company he only presses the button so this is mainly because of the help of Allah and the support of Allah so this is just to show you that money is not the requirement for doing dhava and I always said this in the past and also same with our training program out of the 10 most important things the least important tenth is money Allah help is the most important and in Bombay we had the largest private Davao organization in the world more than 500 pool full-time paid employees only in Mumbai outside Bombay in India another hundred I was outside India another many so total about 650 people to Bombay alone we had more than 500 employees and now I have only two less than half percent yet we are continuing I've already two staff on the social media overseas and maybe five staff for the peach TV network technically uplinking that's it and yet we are continuing we are reaching mashallah tens of millions and we are increasing by Allah's help so main thing required is Allah's help we started organization with a hundred dollar per month budget eighty dollars sorry per month budget with a one thousand dollar a year and in a span of next several years it became the largest and the biggest private organization alhamdulillah so it's mainly Allah's help and I believe that the help of Allah is increasing every day the difficulties are there but Allah has blessed me so much as far as my personal life is concerned it is becoming better every day it is multiple times better than what was in India and Allah is helping us multiple times more and I am even if we thank Allah billions of times trillions of times it will not be sufficient it's hard I mean for the rabbi it's only because of the grace of Allah"
