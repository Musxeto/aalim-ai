  "transcript": "hi i'm an american student studying culture and theology and i have a question you said jesus never claims his divinity and that jesus was only here for jews but the bible says tell us if you are the christ the son of god and jesus replied yes it is as you say and then in matthew 28 18-20 jesus says to his disciples all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age sisters quoted two verses from the bible the first one from mistaken you said that jesus claimed that you're a son of god did you say that sister yes sir son of god and second she said that jesus said go to all the nations what she's quoting is the ending last portion of the gospel of matthew if you go earlier sister let's mention the gospel of matthew chapter number 15 verse number 24 he says to the apostles that i have been sent not but to the lost sheep of the house of israel what you quoted according to the scholars of the bible what they say that is an interpolation but whether it is or not i don't argue but then there's a contradiction in the bible the bible clearly mentions in the gospel of matthew chapter number 10 verse number 5 and 6 jesus christ peace be upon him says to the apostles go not into the way of the gentiles going not in the way of the non-jews the hindus the muslims but rather go to the lost ship of the house of israel as far the first question is concerned that jesus christ peace be upon him said that i am the son of god sister do you know in the bible god has got sent by the tongues adam was the son of god a fram a son of god israel or son of god all those they are led by the spirit of god they are sons of god so if you are a righteous person you are a son of god if i am a righteous person i am a son of god that is the language of the bible as far as calling son of god to a righteous person i do agree that since prophet jesus was the messenger of god he should be called the son of god but what do the christian missionaries say no no no no he is not a normal son he is the begotten son and they quote the bible gospel of john chapter number three verse number 16 for god soul of the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believed in him shall not perish but have everlasting life so what we have to realize that this verse of the bible begotten son according to the faith scholars of the highest eminence of 50 corporate denominations if you read the rsv revised time version they say this word begotten is interpolation is a concoction is a fabrication and they thrown out of the bible so jesus is not the begotten son because begotten means it belongs to an action of animals of lower level so he is verily the son of god son meaning a righteous person we have no objection but he is not the begotten son he begets that noise begotten help to answer the question alhamdulillah"
