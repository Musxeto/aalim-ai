  "title": "Will the Fast of a Person dealing in Riba (Interest) be Accepted? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "if a person by profession deals in Ariba or as it's been now translated interest does this mean that they're fast would not be accepted as far as concerned the Quran in knowledge they need different places Allah mentions it in Surah Al Imran chapter 3 verse number 130 in israelisa chapter number four was the 161 it's mentioned Thrice in Surah chapter 2 verse number 275. it's also mentioned in Surah chapter 276 and also in Surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 278 and 279 and I quote that last verse only I don't intend giving the speech Allah says chapter 2 verse number 278 and 279 that give up what remains of a demands of lucery and anyone who does not give up the demands of usury interest rava is Arabic word if anyone does not give up the demand of Interest then take notice of a war from Allah and his soul if anyone deals in interest in useri a land is a survival wage of war against you it's more serious it's a bigger sin than having alcohol it's a bigger sin than taking drugs because when you have alcohol when you take drugs when you have poke it's a big sin but a land where the school will not wage a war against you but if you involve yourself in the take or give both when you take interest or give interest both of them are major sins so if a person is involving in riba it will not break the fast per se because I've told you things that make the fast I've already mentioned total 10 things so this does not come in that but it's a major sin a person should abstain throughout his life especially in the month of Ramadan which is the month of forgiveness month of blessing it will only reduce his reward more reward he gets for fasting his fasting will not be nullified it will not be invalidated but the reward will be reduced another beloved Prophet Muslim said number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1903 said a person does not leave his false actions and false talks Allah does not require him to leave his drink and eating the person who does not abstain from doing wrong things saying wrong things Haram things Allah does not require him to leave his eating and drinking So based on this it is Haram his reward for the month of fasting will be reduced it may be nullified also"
