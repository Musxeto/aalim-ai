  "title": "Why does a Muslimâ€™s Passion for Worship Go down after Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya why is it that Muslims can't continue worshiping Allah with the same enthusiasm and Zeal after the month of Ramadan one of the main reasons for this is because many Muslims they consider the acts done in the month of Ramadan more as a custom more as a tradition that it's a custom we have to fast in the month of Ramadan you have to pray in the month of Ramadan we have to do good deeds more of a custom it is not for the worship of Allah subhana tala and there are many people who offer that is the very religiously but unfortunately they miss many of the F Salah yes which is absolutely wrong because F Salah is a f is not a it's so because of this more of a custom Ramadan being more of a custom more of a tradition that's the reason that once Raman is over they forget everything as I mentioned earlier that as Allah is only there in the month of Ramadan and not in the other months Point number two is because the surrounding and the atmosphere which is there in the month of Ramadan does not remain after Ramadan is over so if they as I mentioned earlier if they keep righteous friends and Company of good people then the chances of being steadfast is much more and thirdly that because of weak Faith many times the act of righteousness keeps on becoming less and less in the starting of Ramadan people are enthusiastic and they overdo it sometimes therefore we find that the MTH are filled during the first starting nights for for and later on keeps on decreasing and towards the end of Ramadan it becomes the least so a person should not overdo the act out of zeal and enthusiasm as a prophet said that the ACT should be constant that's better even though it's few rather than you know the doing many and doing for a short time so a person should do acts which are constant and should be strong in faith and the last point is that as it's mentioned the Hadith of wasallam in mus Ahmed volume number two page number 23 Hadith number 7148 that the Beloved Prophet said that in the month of Ramadan the satans the Devils they Chained and the doors of paradise are open and the gates of hell are closed so but natural the Temptation is there during the month of Ramadan because the devils are chained the moment Ramadan gets over the Temptation is more the devil is more after you so more chance of you to deviate from the Thro and in the month of Ramadan the gates of hell are closed the doors of Heaven are open so more chances of doing good deed so these are the few points which are the reasons why a person does not remain steadfast after the month of Ramadan"
