  "title": "A Christian Inadvertently Shows the Bible to be Self Contradictory - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "kofia Clement in Acts chap 2 verse 22 you quoted um Peter said this Jesus a man approved of God Luke wrote the book of Acts he was not a disciple of Jesus then Paul quoted the book of First Timothy 3:16 he says without any controversy great is the mystery of godliness for God was manifest In the Flesh he was seen by angels He was preached he was justified so my main question is if you have quoted from acts written by Luke who was not a disciple then you have opened your case then I can also consider someone else like Paul who was not directly part of the disciples thank you brother has quoted because I quote Acts he can quote somebody else brother I told you very clearly there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or where says worship me if you can point out a single unequivocal statement a single unambiguous statement from the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God or he says worship me I ready to accept Christianity what that quoted acts but at a different time I quoted Deuteronomy which is not the words of Jesus peace be upon him I quoted to you the words of Jesus earlier Gospel of John Chapter 14 verse number 28 my father is greater than I it's the words of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Gospel of John chapter 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all words of Jesus peace be upon him now in my lecture I quoted to you many places of the Bible what my challenge says if you want to prove Jesus Is God point out a single unequivocal statement from the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself says that I am God always says worship me now one place if you telling see you are problem you have got I'm giving the answer doing like that like that if you're doing like that like that you cannot understand my answer listen to my answer keep your mind open and listen to my answer if you keep on doing like that like that like that you will not understand so you're telling him now I'm talking to you and you're talking to somebody yes it means I accept it that is what you at least listen after man answer is over then you can open your mouth why you are not listening to my answer again you did the same problem which you did earlier my challenge is point out a single unequivocal statement from the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God where he says worship me I'm ready to accept Christianity now now I have given many statements Deuteronomy 18 verse number 18 which is not words of Jesus Christ peace be upon him I quoted book of Acts chap 2 verse number 22 which is not the saying of Jesus Christ peace be upon him I know it now even if you quote which is not the words of Jesus you believe the Bible to be the word of God yes please that means there's a contradiction in your Bible okay you don't want to quote the words of Jesus Christ peace be upon him keep it aside book of Acts chapter 2 verse number 22 the word of or not so it is contradicting with Paul so you have to solve the problem How can there be a contradiction in the word of God that means there's a problem therefore I do not agree Bible is a word of God when book of Acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 clearly says aen of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man who approved of God amongst You by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him and you witness to it now you quote to me words of Paul now it is word of God word of God is more important or word of Paul is more important so if there's a contradiction there are hundreds of contradictions in the Bible according to the scholars of Christianity there are 50,000 errors in the Bible how many how many the law of don't contradiction the 50,000 errors in the Bible according to Scholars of Christianity 50,000 you see my video cassette Bible and Quran in the light of science there are many contradictions there there are many scientific errors read that hear that and you'll be convinced that Bible is not the word of God"
