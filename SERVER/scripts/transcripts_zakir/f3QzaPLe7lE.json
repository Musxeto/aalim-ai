  "title": "Logical Reasons Why in Islam Women Inherit Half of what Men Inherit - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "furthermore in islam a woman even inherits in many religions the woman is not allowed to inherit she does not have any share in the property left behind by her family members but in islam the woman inherits there are on many occasions where non-muslims the object and they say fine in islam women do inherit but why do they inherit half trying to say that islam subjugates the woman but if you analyze the logic behind it you'll understand the wisdom of allah of our creator almighty god as i mentioned a few minutes earlier in islam it is the man who bears the financial burden before woman is married it is the father and the brother after she's married it is the husband and the son who looks after her lodging boarding clothing and all financial aspects if you read the quran the inheritance is given in several places in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse 180 in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 240 in 20 chapter number four verse number 79 insurance chapter number four number 19 in several places but the most specific share division is given in surinamesa chapter number four verses 11 and 12. where it says that allah has ordained that in what you leave your wealth for your children the sons get double the share of the daughters if only daughters two or more they share into third if only one she gets half the verse continues and what you leave for your parents each get one sixth if you have children the mother gets one third if there are no children and the worst continues in what your wives leave for you you get half if there are no children you get one fourth if there are children what you leave for your wives they get one fourth if they're not children they get one eighth if you have children don't confuse yourself go back home open the quran surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 11 and 12 easy i do agree that most of the times the women inherit half the amount what the men inherit but there are occasions when they inherit equal for example one sixth both for the parents for mother and father if they have children but if they don't have children mother gets one third that means double than that of the father but i do agree with you as a whole most of the times the woman is at half son gets double than that of the daughter husband gets double than that of the wife most of the time what is the logic behind it the logic is as i mentioned since man is the person who takes the financial burden and suppose there's a person who dies and after giving the shares of the other people if 150 000 dollars or 150 000 rupees is balanced for the children after giving the shares of the other relatives if 150 000 150 000 rupees is balanced and that man has got one daughter and one son the son will get hundred thousand dollars a hundred thousand rupees and the daughter will get fifty thousand dollars or fifty thousand rupees people will say injustice why did the daughter get half but the logic behind it is the man has the financial burden i am asking a question would you want to inherit 100 000 100 000 rupees and spend 80 or 90 percent of that whatever inherited on the family if you are a man or would you prefer inheriting 50 000 or 50 000 rupees and not spending a single penny or single paisa on the family if you are a man and if you inherit 100 000 100 000 rupees maybe eighty or ninety percent goes on the family what is left with you ten thousand twenty thousand rupees or dollars if you're a woman you get fifty thousand dollars or two thousand rupees hundred percent you keep for yourself so would you prefer inheriting 100 000 and keeping only 10 20 000 with you or would you prefer inheriting 50 000 and keeping everything with you if allah would have given equal amount to both then i would have to give a talk on men's rights in islam when allah has given the rights he's even equal if he has put the financial burden on the men he sees to it that the men get double others it will be injustice and the quran says in surah chapter number 4 verse number 14. allah is never unjust in the least degree so if you know the hikmah behind it you'll realize that the guidance given by our creator is the best just because the women in islam are financially more secured than the men what would you say the women in islam are they protected or are they subjugated"
