  "transcript": "did the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam mention any particular six days for a Muslim to fast in the month of or cannibalism randomly select those days at his own will as far as fasting in the month of the Beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in say Muslim worry number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2614 the prophet said that anyone who fasts in the month of Ramadan and follows it with six days of fasting in the month of it is as though he has fasted for the full life fasted perpetually or fasted for one year the Arabic word is dahar it means perpetually or full life one of which means is also forward full year so if you fast in the month of Ramadan the complete month followed with six days in the month of shawwal it's as though you have fasted for the full year as far as fasting is concerned that should we fasted immediately after the month of Ramadan or can we fast later on or should we fast consecutively or can we fast at random separately the views of the scholars differ as far as this is concerned but according to authentic ruling to the best of my knowledge since the Hadith does not specify that it should fast immediately you can fast any six days in the month of shawwal after the month of Ramadan has ended except for the Hadith that you should waste in the Good Deeds so if you use that logic then the earlier you fast the better it is so that you hate in the Good Deeds as far as fasting consecutively or separately it doesn't make any difference though there are some people who say that you should fast together then only it's valid but there's no authentic Hadith to prove that you can fast together or at random or separate layers as long as you fast in the month of shawwal and the third point of difference among the scholars is that since it's a voluntary fast you can even decide you can get up in the morning and if you want to convey the knee at that time also though some of the scholars say no because it's important voluntary fast you should make the Nia one night before but appointed ruling authentic Hadith you can even get up in the morning and then decide first as long as you have not eaten or drank anything does differ but the authentic I feel is that you can fast any time of the month either starting ending knowledge you need not fast consecutively can fast consecutively also as well as separately and you can make the near even late as long as you don't break any rule of the fasting furthermore it's not necessary that you have to fast every year if you fast it's good alhamdulillah but you can fast one near next you don't fast also know the sin and suppose you don't fast and only two days of a while I left that does not mean you cannot fast if you fast for two days you can swap for two days so the main Hadith says that we should fast for six days in the month of shawar after keeping them done it will seem as though you have fasted for the full year Dr Zakir just further to the issue of fasting the six days in short did the prophet Muhammad select number six six days for any particular why wasn't it for instance five or seven or eight or nine the complete month of Ramadan then follow it with six days as they are faster for the full year and the one Mahadev which says that one deed is multiplied by ten Deeds ten hasnas so if you fight for one month in the month of Ramadan it's either fasted for 10 months and then you follow it up with six days six day multiply by ten it becomes 60 days that's two months so ten plus two months become 12 months so that's the logic he said six days so that if you multiply the full month of Ramadan plus six days it's equivalent to one full year"
