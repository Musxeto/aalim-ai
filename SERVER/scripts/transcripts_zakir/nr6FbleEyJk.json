  "title": "Several Researches on Fasting - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "let's move on to the next question relates to the science behind the benefits of fasting there are some people and I want to know whether they're right or not who say that fasting actually has some harmful effects on a person psychological social physical etc is that correct several researchers have been done map many scientists as far as fasting is concerned and what effect does it have in various aspects of living body and scientists will tell us that when a person takes in food it increases the metabolism of the body when the food intake is reduced or in a person fast the body metabolism rate goes down by about 22% and if you fast continuously for several days for a month then this stabilizes at a lower rate the body metabolism rate is reduced by fasting further though the research done on various groups of male and female Muslims word fasted and it showed that there was a slight reduction in the body weight but those increase in the glucose level as far as all the other things are concerned it remained constant whether it was the testosterone or the cottage cell whether it was sodium potassium urea whether it was cholesterol whether it was HDL high density lipoprotein whether the LDL low density lipoprotein whether it was TG the diglyceride all these the body levels they remained the same the fasting did not have any effect on them except it increased the glucose level and there was a slight reduction in weight when another research was conducted in Iran where some men fasted for about 17 hours for 30 days in the month of ramadhan it showed that it had no effect on the male reproductive hormone on the testosterone and it had no effect on the HP ta as well as on the thyroid hormones there were several researches conducted there was also research the study made which was called as increase in oxidation in the month of ramadhan on healthy women away from maintaining the weight weight maintenance and it showed that during fasting there was no change as far as the physiology the body was concerned the weight was same and all the functions were the same fasting increases the fat oxidation and decreases the carbohydrate oxidation and we have to realize that we have to let the physicians of the Western world they should know that they should know that the levels of bilirubin and glucose while fasting the further study is conducted that fasting increases the mucosa developed B lymphocyte cell responsiveness but it not sure change in the Billiam for that responsiveness of the romera detritus and health volunteers but in fasting it increased the Ranji T of the life increase the lifespan of many researchers conduct and animals it increases lifespan further research was conducted on the lactating woman when they fasted the fasting did not increase or decrease there was no change in the milk volume I have another content of the milk the glucose level was the same the fat concentration was the same the lactose content was the same and there's no change per se as far as a lactating mothers were concerned the research is done regarding fastings effect on menstruating women as well as the reproductive cycle and when the research well done there's no change whatsoever there wasn't any change in the menstrual cycle in fasting or they all no negative effect no positive effect so it is wrong to say that fasting as ill-effect there are many benefits which we discussed earlier but there are certain positive points that fasting has helped in certain diseases for example rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis it helps and what we realized that we researchers were done that on animals when they are sick they don't before having any food same thing of the children when children get sick they don't prefer having food it is the family members who fold them dry food and research has shown that when food is taken when a person is sick it prevents him from getting well early it hampers the immune system so when a person fast when you seriously ill it helps him to recover faster that is the reason now we find that there are many treatments which include fasting for various diseases which are followed by the Western world because when a person fast his body gets rest and the toxins are removed from the body so it helps him to recover faster and fasting is also good to change the behavioral pattern and if a person is addicted or a person is alcoholic as I mentioned earlier or in the change smoker if he fast it's a good point that he can stop it throughout his life and people who have be treated to things like tea coffee junk food when they fast and they stay away from it when the tastebuds they don't have for the full month the tastebuds don't crave for that and when they have healthy food they start liking it that's a good time to stay away from junk food if you can do it for one month you can do it throughout your life yes and there are certain diseases for example insulin dependent diabetes a person who's suffering from insulin dependent diabetes he should not fast because the F ketosis normally the ketones are used as a source of energy but if a person has insulin dependent diabetes he's unable to use this therefore person with incident dependent I believe he should not fast but naturally if he takes insulin and fast and with the medical device it's fine but the other type of diabetes which is more common non-insulin dependent diabetes fasting helpful for that and as I mentioned earlier it's helpful in very diseases like cardiovascular disease hasta ma arthritis digestive tract diseases in lupus and skin disease can name all list of diseases in which fasting is of great benefit I think it would be really interesting to know I mean this research has it been done by Muslims or non-muslims these researchers have been done by both Muslims and non-muslims and there are hundreds of non-muslim scientists I have done research on fasting so it's not only the Muslims more of their own Muslims do research and fasting but their Ivan Muslims for example if you read the book fasting a way of life my island cut he writes that fasting is altogether it gives rest to the digestive tract as well as a central nervous system to the whole body and he's a non Muslim there was a resurgent mind in dr. my dream of is Shanthi Romani and she says that when a person fast there is no intake of food so the toxins are created by the food that you eat so no new toxin is created and whatever toxin is there present in the body from before it gets excreted from the body so fasting is a very good method of excluding all the toxins from the body and it purifies the body system well done my non-muslim research isn't even be Muslim the research done by dr. Solomon in the University Hospital in Amman in Jordan and he did a research on a group of men and women they were 42 men and or anything woman and the refers further in the de fasted and the changes in the body was noted and they found out that there was a slight reduction in weight and there's an increase in the glucose level but they're far as the other components are concerned testosterone cortisol sodium potassium urea all of them remain the same there's no change as per in the body color except the glucose they will increase and the reduction in the weight of the immunity there were several different men on Muslims those a group of non-muslim scientists couldn't research in Africa in areas where there were famine and they realized that people when the research that people who were starving because of famine and they lived in the same refugee camp some people who had food and some people were starving but those who were starving that left chances of having to book losses as well as malaria so fasting increase the difference mechanism against tuberculosis and malaria so it's a las Murcia hamdulillah can you believe because they were starving it prevented them from having tuberculosis and v√©lez malaria Allahu Akbar the research is done my non-muslim they show that fasting increases the longevity increase the lifespan and it has a reversal on the aging process there was research done by a Muslim scientist by the name of Osama candle in the Howard olicity Muslim but in a non-muslim country not with simplicity and he did a research on patients suffering from cancer and he tried to find out what they do the cells function especially the killer cells which attacked the cancer cells and he did accounting just before they started fasting and then he again little counting on the rena folder from them then 20 in there from them and he found that there was a marked difference after 21 days and 28 days the number of cells the killer cells they increased and these cells their type of cancer cells and it shows that even the immunity increased the defense mechanism of the human being because of fasting it increased and then they research again done in the same patients and it found out that the t-cells which are normally required for the defense community of the human being they increase drug gate level and T cells are mainly responsible when anyone has a disease they are mainly the soldiers or they are called the Major General of the army that you have they are the T cells and they go and they see to it any disease is there it goes and try and destroy the disease and AIDS is the disease which mainly attacks these T cells therefore known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome so when you fast this has increased and immunity of the human means increase I would like to mention one research done by a European non Muslim by the name of dr. Jeffery and what he says that fasting is not only done by human beings fasting is even done by the animals and the plants and he give the example animals that live in cold countries during heavy snowfalls they stay separately and they don't eat and they weren't hibernation and there are examples of animals like frog which go in hibernation and here they don't need a first and he gives the example in his book that even the priests in winter when they don't get water the fasting but the moment later when spring comes you'll find that the tree is filled up with colorful leaves with flowers with fruits and he suggested that every human being every year should at least fast for 40 days and we know that it's for every Muslim to fast in the month of Ramadan and approximately 30 days and further if we keep the six days of fasting in show while that missile effective so Allah subhana Allah and our prophet had already given us this guidance with the non-muslim European has given us recently so the many refer children were non-muslims on fasting and very beneficial for the body dr. Zakir most of the research that you've mentioned I suspect a lot of the other research we haven't had time to mention today was done relatively recently was this knowledge with scientific knowledge available for the Muslims in history as far as the earlier Muslims are concerned some of the facts were known someone not known not in the same way as we have come to know by at first today and I'll give you the reason why later now the main question is concerned that were they aware what did aspects of fasting in a different way may not be in the same way we know today that reminds me I did a book by Abul Hasan and we are carnal Harbor where mana Burlison not we he writes in his book Arcana Harbor and he gives the incidents at the time of caliph harun rashid and there he gives a dialogue between the christian physician of caliph harun rashid and a muslim by the name of ali bin Hussein ben wocken and this Christian physician of caliph Harun Rashid he says that the Quran is considered to be a book of Sciences and we know that two types of Sciences science of the body science of the soul so what does your Quran speak about medical science so Ali bin Hussein been working he said let Allah subhana WA Ta'ala in half of us of the Quran he combines both these Sciences when he says in surah Araf chap number seven was the method even eat and drink but do not waste in excess Oh allah subhanaw taala likes not the people who wished Linda Christensen disease but what did your prophet normal solution say about medicine so he said that he's mentioned that the stomach is the main house of diseases and prevention is the best thing for ailment in provision is better than cure and as I mentioned a beloved partner Salah slim said it's mentioned in give me my jaw one member for a date number three three four nine the Prophet said the son of Adam does not fill a vessel more worse more evil than the stomach a few muscles are sufficient to keep him on his feet if you have to eat more one-third of the stomach can be a food month a drink and one-third should be for his pet so then that a Christian physician said that means when you had the guidance of your Allah and Prophet Muhammad we did not require Gallinas jolliness he was a very famous non-muslim physician of that time so what the prophet and Allah say is an telegraphic message which we had done the first today but the Prophet also already has given a nutshell the message before and in that same book are carnal are ba-na-na-na bonus and oddly he mentions and gives the example of another non-muslim scientist who's an American he says that every human being with the poor or rich he should fast for some days every year it will keep him healthy and then he says that Islam is the best religion which has made it compulsory on as follows too fast and he said that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was the best physician who has prescribed fasting and he said that there's no better healthy way then fasting and after that Torabi in which you have to do some exercise I went to him which helps in digestion so if you realize that the non-muslim depreciated the region of Islam after the research do many of the Muslims are aware about the medical benefits of fasting but the Muslims we don't fast for these medical benefits we fast for sake of allah subhanaw taala for the pleasure of allah subhana Allah we don't fast for the medical benefits these medical benefits and similarly yeah or they may be the maybe three dishes may be the desert our main biryani a main meal course if a pleasure of allah subhanaw taala which we discussed in the objective of fasting we don't fast for medical benefit even is this molecular benefit one out there we must remove that fast if Allah subhanAllah but and what do we do for last - Allah Allah gives us back in return so all that that we do it actually benefits us in various ways in this world as well as najara but v muslims don't fast for these medical benefits these are just bonuses that we get it respectively that we get not yet read fast physical last mandala yeah that's good when you listen to the commandments of allah subhanho wa taala rasul allah llahu allahu islam look at his life and implement those things immediately you get some benefit in this world subhanAllah"
