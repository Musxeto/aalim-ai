  "title": "Is it a Sunnah to cover the head for a Muslim Man? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "oxaza is it a sunnah to where the head covering where the cap because we do see a number of people particularly those people who have returned from gulf countries and such like hajj etc that deliberately remove their cap whilst they're praying is there any basis for this at all as far as the first part of the question is concerned that is it a sunnah is it mustap to cover one's head there are various hadith which say that prophet muslim his head was always covered whether with the cap with the turbine whether with the helmet and even the head of the sahabas are covered it's mentioned in say muslim number two in the book of hajj hadith number 3148 it says that when muhammad sallallahu sallam addressed the people on the day of the victory of makkah he was wearing a black turban so the many hadith saying that muslim covered that further according to hadith which is narrated by umar it says that wore a white cap it's made by bnumer and according to tabarani he has rated this as hasan hadith one of the categories of say hassan and according to imam suthi it says it is a highly authentic hadith he wearing a white cap the arabic word is kufi for a camp in india we say topi it is authentic and there are other hadith saying that the sabbah also covered the head a similar hadith is mentioned in say buhari number seven in the book of dress hadith number five eight zero two says that one has been malik please with him he covered his head he wore a cap so based on all these hadith almost all its unanimous agreement among the scholars of the scholars that covering the head is mustafa it is the sunnah of the prophet it's mustafa it's encouraged all all the four schools of thought the hanafi the shafi the malaki the humbly all four schools of thought and all the four i am mass they agree that covering the head is muslim and when you pray while praying also it's mustafa to cover the head it's muslim and if you pray bare headed it's makru the reason that why people when they come back from the gulf countries or when they come from hajj they normally even in india previously a few years back maybe 10-15 years back the people when they paid in the most 99 percent or 99.9 percent whenever any man prayed in the mosque he had his head covered maybe 20 years back but now we find that 25 percent one-fourth or one-third of the people they pray the salah bear headed the reason is that previously it was known that it mustabe to cover the head so even when they didn't cover their head normally at least by offering salah these to cover that even though they didn't cover that normally always they covered the head at least while offering salah it's a good sign when people go to gulf countries there they realize and they come to know that covering the head is not further for the salah to be accepted and there are many people because they come from different parts of the world in the countries and they have different ways of practicing islam there is a hadith in which one of the sahabas to show to the people that it's not far he just put one piece of cloth from the shoulder down below the knee and he played salah and it's accepted so if you ask that is it first to wear a cap or cover the head while offering salt it's not a farm but it is musta so this is what they feel to realize that it is mustabe so why should he not do it when they come back from the gulf countries and they come to know it is not a fair they try and show the people that we have knowledge and they purposely don't cover the head and now we find in the mosque about 25 percent one-third of them don't cover that which i feel is going away from the sun of the prophet these people they fail to realize that if they ask the scholars of these gulf countries the top scholars all of them they cover their head all of them they cover the head so just because it's like lack of knowledge is dangerous just because fine salah will be accepted but is mustahab and according to shivnasu dalbani he says that covering that is mustab and praying bareheaded is makro and he says that the hadith of ibn abbas will be the same what narrates about prophet muhammad that he kept his cap as a sutra in front of him while offering salah it's a hadith it's not authentic and some of the scholars especially from egypt they've given the fatwa that you know because in haram when you're performing hajj or doing umara you don't cover your head and the salah is accepted therefore covering that is not the criteria for offering salah if you read the hadith of the prophet sallam never did the prophet left his head uncovered by praying except in haram except for performing hajj or umrah where the prophet in covenant had all other times he had his head covered the reason that during umrah while in haram the head wasn't covered is because it is haram to cover the head many things which are mustard haram during the state of aram so if you say that because in hajj you don't cover the head that it's a rule that you should not cover the head in salah it's totally wrong there are many things which are mustafa for example cutting the nails with mustard in the normal day-to-day life but in haram it is haram similarly covering the head is mustafa but in haram only it's haram so giving this logic is totally wrong in haram you don't have to cover that because it's not allowed it's violating the rules of haram otherwise it should cover the head and if people are at least covering while offering salah they should continue they will get savable and that's what all the for aymas said even sheikh nasser al-bani ibn sheikh bin baaz and all the scholars and imam malik said that from the time of islam till today always the scholars and the sabbahs and the surface all in the covered head and there was a turban you know whether they were tobin or a kufi etc so i encourage that the muslims should cover that it's one of the recommended acts of the prophet"
