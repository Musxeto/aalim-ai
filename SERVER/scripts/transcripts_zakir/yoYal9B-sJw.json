  "transcript": "brother as the question that in Islam before the Advent of Islam Jesus Christ peace be upon him was killed and Prophet Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam left Saudi Arabia went to the neighboring country is this history this is not history this is fabrication before the Advent of Islam Islam is there since time immemorial there's a misconception that Islam is a new religion which came into existence 1400 years back and Prophet Muhammad is the founder of Islam this is a misconception Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is not the founder of the religion of Islam he's the last and final messenger the first prophet of Islam is Prophet Adam peace be upon him so if you say before the Advent of Islam is before Adam peace be upon him you don't have knowledge about Islam and this is only fabrication of the media and Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam left Saudi Arabia at the time of Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam there's no Saudi Arabia at all there was no Saudi Arabia came recently so what you're talking is all fabrication yes Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam left Mecca he went to other parts he went to Syria but nowhere does it say that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him died what the Quran says in Surah n 4 verse 158 Allah subhana taala raised Isa Alam up to himself and I told you earlier the reason Allah has raised Jesus Christ peace be upon him is because his followers as a whole mistook him that he claimed Divinity in his second coming he will again testify he never claimed he was God but saidah worship Allah my Lord and your lord hope the answer the question thank you"
