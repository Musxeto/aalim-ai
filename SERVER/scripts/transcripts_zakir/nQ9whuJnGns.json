  "transcript": "sixth most common question if islam allows a man to have more than one wife why does not islam allow a woman to have more than one husband as far as married woman is concerned the categories of women a man can marry is clearly specified in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 22 to 24. and it's mentioned in surah nisa chapter 4 24 that you cannot marry a woman who's already married that means in islam a woman cannot have more than one husband before i give you the real reason imagine there's already a scarcity of woman finding husband if a woman has more than one husband this scarcity will increase it will multiply the problem let's analyze what are the logical reasons that islam prohibits a woman to have more than one husband when a man has more than one wife and if any child is born out of that wedlock you can easily identify who is the father as well as who is the mother but if a woman has more than one husband and if a child is born you can identify the mother but you will not be able to identify the father [Applause] and if you go to admit that child in school and they ask you what is the name of the father you may have to give two names and today psychology they tell us that identifying the parents is very important for a healthy childhood especially the idea of the father if you cannot identify the parents the child has a lot of mental trauma today after science has advanced i'm aware that there is dna testing and genetic testing where you can identify who is the father and who is the mother though it's not very accurate but even if i agree that maybe after a few years it becomes accurate yet it has happened recently all these years it wasn't there and this is not the only reason why a woman is not allowed to have more than one husband the various other reasons for example today science tells us that a man is more polygamous in nature as compared to a woman today science tells us that because of the various behavioral and psychological changes that take place in a woman during menstrual cycle she cannot do the role of multiple wives simultaneously whereas a man he can do the role of multiple husbands simultaneously furthermore if a woman has more than one husband or more than one sexual partner and if all of them are loyal to each other yet there are high chances that venerable diseases and sexual transmitted disease will emerge and it can be retransmitted back to the man whereas if a man put a medical science tells us that if a man has more than one sexual partner has more than one wife and if all of them are loyal to one another there are hardly any chances of venerable diseases or sexually transmitted diseases emerging in them so scientifically also and medically it's no problem for a man to have more than one wife but problematic for a woman to have more than one husband"
