  "transcript": "good evening to everybody i'm mrs i'm a teacher by profession with due respect sir i wish to ask you a question how is karma and moksha defined in islam and how is it in different violent practice sisters has a question that how is karma and moksha defined in islam karma sister in the hindu scripture means deed the deed that you do action it should be fought according to dharma and the hindu scholars they believe in a philosophy known as samskara the cycle of birth death birth and death known as reincarnation or the theory of trans migration of soul and they believe that whatever karm you do if you do good deeds in the next life you'll be born of a higher level if you do bad deeds in the next life you'll be born of a lower level if you do good deeds you'll be born like a human being if bad deeds may be like an animal like a rat like a cat or like a cockroach and only if there are no things there are no balance of good or bad then you get moksha from the cycle of samskara birth and death this is the philosophy of the hindu scholars but this is nowhere mentioned in the veda is nowhere mentioned in the vedas the highest authorities they do try and derive it from bhagavad-gita which is mentioned bhagavad-gita chapter number two verse number 22 that like a body changes clothes and puts on new clothes same way a soul puts on a new body in the hindu scriptures there's a mention of punar janam in the vedas book number 10 hemp number 16 verse number four five punnar means next jannah means life next life we believe in next life we believe we came in this world once we only come once we were alive before allah calls her to die we came in this world again we'll die again we'll be resurrected in the next world so we believe in this world islam believe will come once and then we'll be resurrected raised up alive in the next year after depending upon the good and bad deeds you go to hell or heaven swarganarak this is what the vedas say but they could not realize the hindus scholars that how come some people are born deaf some people blind some people poor some people rich some people healthy so god cannot do injustice so they came up with this philosophy of cycle of birth death birth death transmigration of soul which is nowhere mentioned in the veda even bhagavad-gita when it says you throw over your old clothes and put new clothes same way the soul throws away the body and puts the new body once i've got no objection one should i again are resurrected but islam has a reply for the query because the hindu scholars could not agree that how can god be unjust some people born deaf some people healthy some people with heart disease some people rich some people poor islam believes allah says in surah chapter number 16 verse number 2 it is allah who has given death and life to test which of you is good indeed so this life is a test for the hereafter now some people are born rich some people are born poor the rich people the quran says you have to give zakat whatever saving you have more than 85 grams of gold more than nisab two and a half percent zakat every lunar you have to give the rich person may give may not give he may give half he may get hundred percent marks make it fifty percent if he doesn't give he'll get zero for the poor man he doesn't have to give zakat he gets hundred out of hundreds of hundred therefore prophet said it is easier for a poor man to go to jannah than a rich man the rich man will say oh i don't have to give so much that i may have to give i may not have to give if he is the best maximum will get 100 out of 100 for the poor man already full marks so everyone is tested in different ways some people are unhealthy some people are born with congenital heart defects we don't believe he's born with a disease because it's sin in the last life it's a test for thereafter not that he had sinned maybe it's a test for the parents allah says in surya anfar chapter number 8 verse number 28 your wealth and your children are a test for you maybe allah wants to test the parents they are very pious and he gives birth to children who have congenital heart disease someone will say oh i don't believe in god those are very good parents may say yet i believe in god allah is testing the greater the test the higher the reward maybe allah wants to give them generatives like if you pass a graduation you get a ba or a bsc or a b com if you pass mbbs you get doctor difficult to pass mbbs than normal ba but if we got the test higher the degree so we believe no one is born sinful everyone is born muslim but in the hindu philosophy of the scholars not of the scripture they believe that you come in this world again and again if you do good deeds as a human being bad deeds as a low being this the vedas never believe and furthermore logically if you unless today's sister the crime is increasing or decreasing increasing or decreasing is increasing or decreasing increasing is the population of human beings increasing or decreasing increasing so logically if the crime is increasing the human population should decrease it is not so that proves that this philosophy is wrong and furthermore refer to my video cassette similarities between hinduism and islam for more details on the subject you"
