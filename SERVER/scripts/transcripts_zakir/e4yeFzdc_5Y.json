  "title": "How Long Should the Beard Left to Grow? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "what about the required length of the beard because there are many people with different lengths and and it's rather confusing when you look outside and you think who what should I be doing what did the prophet Muhammad sallallah alaihi wasallam uh do as far as the length of the beard is concerned the scholars are divided they have different opinions and as far what is the length of the beard there are two opinions one group of Scholars say that because the Hadith of s bukari number seven book of dress Hadith number 5892 says the prophet said do the opposite of what the pagans do keep the beard and trim your mustaches so because the Commandment is keep the beard that mean they say that it should be kept that's it and the second Hadith of s bukari Vol number seven book of death Hadith number 5893 says that cut your mustaches short and grow the beard so the first group of Scholars say grow the beard means keep on growing you should not touch it keep the beard means Let It Be therefore you should not at all neither trim the beard nothing at all you should let it grow as much as possible this is their view but if you read there is not a single say Hadith which speaks about the length of the beard of the Prophet not a single say Hadith there's not a single sayth but according to Shiki he says that we understand when the Hadith says that keep the beard or grow the beard it means you should leave it you should not touch it and let the length be as much as possible and if someone shaves it is Haram and someone trims it to the size of a fist that the other view then it is Mak so this one group of Scholars said let it grow as much as possible the other group of Scholars what they say that the length of the beard should be one fist as I mentioned earlier there is no which speaks about the length of the beard of the Prophet there's a Hadith which is ath or MTH we say that the beard of the Prophet it touched the chest but that's or there's ath mentioned in say Muslim volume number four Hadith number 5789 where jab bin samura he says may Allah pleas with him that the prophet had a thick beard there are many say had we say the prophet had thick beard but doesn't mention the length of the beard but this group of scholar they say that since the length of the beard is not mentioned what we have to do is we have to look at how the sahabas has kept the beard the length is not mentioned so look at the sa because the prophet said if you don't find in my example then look at the people around me in this generation that the Companions sahabas and when we look at the sahabas we find several authentic Hadith more than 10 say Hadith which say that the sahaba they kept their beard at the length of one Fist and whatever was below the one fist they trimmed the beard including Omar be pleased with him Abbas be pleased with him Abu be pleased with him all these SAS which are very close to the prophet they trimmed their beard even those who narrated the same Hadith Omar with him ofari number seven book of death Hadith number 5892 pleas with him who narrated thei that the prophet said that do opposite of what the pagans do keep the beard and trim your mustaches immediately after that the Hadith continues and says that whenever Omar Beed with him used to go for umra and Hajj after umah and Hajj he used to catch the beard with his fist and whatever was below the fist he used to cut it so imagine those sahabas who narrated The Hadith and all these pleas with them all they were staunch followers of the Sun the prophet and they narrated The Hadith when they narrate the Hadith of trimming the mustach and keeping the beard growing the beard they understood the way the prophet wanted so why did they trim the beard if the view of the first group of Scholars let right that keep on growing growing means how to grow the way the prophet grew and if there's no Hadith indicating his sayings or actions then you look at the way the saas did that's the way how you analyze Hadith that's the reason n albani he says that the right size of the beard should be the size of a fist and he says for example that when we analyze the Hadith if it's present in the sayings that the best of the Prophet if it's not you look in the actions if not in the action approval if it's not there you look in the lifestyle of the sahaba what did they say what did they do so we agree that what the sahabas did was they followed the prophet and you don't find a single Hadith neither of the Prophet or neither of any of the sahabas we say that they did not trim the beard there are more than 10 Hadith which say that the sahabas they trim the beard below the fist if there was even a single Hadith which says that this sa did not trim the beard at all then it can be possible that both are right because there's not a single Hadith on the other side saying that the SAA never trim the beard but there are no less than 10 had which say that the sa below the F they trim the beard according to sh n albani it is f to trim the beard below the fist it is f and anyone who keeps a beard more than the fist length it is Mak according to him Mak detestable so this is a strong fwa Alani he's very stch and I personally agree with his view because there is evidence in the lifestyle of the saas and he further says it his book and he writes that why it should be the length of one fist he said besides the sahabas many examples we find who kept one Fist and cut below one fist the beard he gives the examples of many Sal who had the beard the size of a fist and they trimmed the beard below the fist like for example we have examples of Imam Malik imal all these great sine they trim the beard below the fist they qu it like that and they Trimm it below the fist so this is the view of the second group of Scholars and I agree more with the group of Scholars including albani that the right size is the size of the Fist and the rest allaham"
