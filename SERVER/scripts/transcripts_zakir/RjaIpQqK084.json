  "transcript": "thank you [Music] yeah [Music] how many years maybe thank you very much so many thousands of people entered Islam uh after you alhamdulillah um what was the the most emotional moment for you like one specific story that affected you personally [Laughter] one of the unique words whenever has to go to Dubai to your lectures there was a person Hindu by the name of Rahul he used to whenever public lectures used to ask me questions and he's trust me one of the most difficult questions and he said that I know more about Islam then about the management that you're doing or engineering I think you're doing so his question was something which was different than the other questions and then I remember one question and asked me and he said that uh the first Revolution of the Quran that was given by Archangel Gabriel through the prophet and he has studied a lot of Quran and Hadith says so he'll ask in the question that what did Archangel Gabriel show to Prophet Muhammad when he said is that document available in the museum what did he show there is no record of what did he show when he said I cannot read so I told him you asked a good question I asked him that do you know Japanese he said no I said did I show you something in Japanese that you said no so you don't have to show to say you don't know and ask him he said I don't know yes the same way asked as the prophet to lead he said he doesn't have to show something to say that I cannot read sure so with this much one of the questions that convinced him and there were many questions he asked number of questions and find him uh do you count mashallah how many person entered Islam or no Allah uh what an uh foreign Chef can I ask you a personal question sure how do you spend your day like you're a role model to many Muslims so we want to know like how do you spend your day when you wake up until sleep like what do you do of course when I was in India where we had a we had an organization which were one of the largest Muslim non-government organization in the world where we had more than 500 people working in one office volunteers so that the routine was that I go to the office and on average I spent about 15 16 hours in a day in office masha'allah and normally many attempts come after Fajr yeah and uh they need a fighter they'd sleep for about three hours then get up have breakfast then then spend time with my parents were very old that time now my father and then go back to the office but naturally here when I did Hijra from India to Malaysia there was a change in life my Iman encouraged masha'allah so now my my home has become my office so normally I feel that if Allah has blessed you the maximum time a person should spend in life in a day is not a fight it's my recommendation so and the best for a Muslim especially die that he should spend longer than so I advise that if we can spend initially half an hour and maybe one hour then maybe two hours the longer you spend it's better and all your face Allah should be in the mosque in Jama and how did you get to know your kids if you're working like 16 hours a day Ah that's very good I believe in Venn diagram because when Venn diagram means there is all happening when I'm married before married I have to spend about maybe about 10 hours per hour so people told me if you marry you will not be able to spend 10 hours for that one so I married but in that 12 hours maybe four or five hours with my wife so when a children they say you know so I opened Islamic school so I'm with my children doing dhava and many a time then we go for lecture towards whether it be tomorrow many parts of the world Indonesia all five of us give talks me and my son they give talks among the general audience my wife and my two daughters excluded in front of ladies so we go for lecture to maybe about for seven eight days we extend for two days and we enjoy the the beauty of that country whether it be noon in Malaysia so it's more for Venn diagram so it is two in one and that's the best um foreign foreign Umar in one word what would he say S one more difficult I would say that Allah has chosen him to spread the message of the interim so he's one of the chosen person from Allah what he said about you he said uh if the prophet was to see you he will be very glad"
