  "transcript": "my name is manoj raicha my first question is under the name universal brotherhood you are advertising islam and on the basis of that please define your terms when you are saying that universal brotherhood you should act under the name universal brotherhood brotherhood you should accept brotherhood to all whether muslims that is follower of islam and non-muslims which you say kaffir who don't otherwise quote the term muslim brotherhood it will be okay so whether i asked a question that in the name of universal brotherhood i am promoting islam suppose if i have to say that the best cloth i'm promoting best cloth in market and suppose raymond has to be the best cloth so it's the fact i'm promoting agreements if raymond's company is best anyway i don't get any cut from payment that's an example i'm not a dealer of raymonds but if i say the best of this raymond and if the talk is which is the best cloth i have to speak about that so i'm giving a talk on who is the best doctor in the world and if i have to take a personal name xyz and if he's the best doctor i'm promoting him yes to similarly universal brethren i'm telling you that islam is a religion which speaks about universal brotherhood and shows you a way how to achieve it regarding a question that in universal brethren can you call muslims non-muslims as brother or only muslims as brothers the universal brother of islam is all human beings are your brothers i made it very clear in my talk i'm not mincing with words i'm very clear maybe it may have slipped you may not have heard it inside my talk it's from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other not that you shall despise each other and the most honored in the sight of allah is the person who has taqwa who has righteousness who has piety who has got consciousness in the universal brotherhood are all human beings the person who has got piety is one of taqwa of righteousness i've got two brothers one is a good person actually i've got one brother only but suppose i have two brothers one is the medical doctor like this brother instituting the patient etc and the other brother the drunkard is a rapist both are my brothers who is a better brother a brother is a doctor and treats the people and doesn't cause harm to the society the other brother is my brother but he's not a good brother of mine similarly all human beings are my brothers but those who are closer to me are those who have taqwa who has righteousness who has piety anyone who has piety who has righteousness who has got consciousness is closer to me it's very clear i've sent my talk and i repeat it hope to answer the question"
