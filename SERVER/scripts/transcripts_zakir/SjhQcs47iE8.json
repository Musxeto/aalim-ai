  "transcript": "assalamualaikum my question is uh now the age of combined study so is it permitted to study in field of medical because for women's so because most of the 99 percent is we face brother has a question that is co-education permitted especially in medical colleges correct if a woman wants to become a doctor and there is no single sex medical college is it permitted if the cause is there the islamic sharia says let a small loss take place to prevent a big loss so now that lady if she goes in a coed college of medicine and there's no single sex college it will be difficult for her to maintain hijab but she can she can not that she can't you know she'll have to maintain hijab in medical colleges the atmosphere is the worst i've been to a medical college mashallah saved me otherwise medical college atmosphere is the worst in terms of breaking the hijab worst and it's only allah who can save you otherwise the medical colleges you know the girls and the boys they have groups they have to look examine the patient they stay overnight it's very dangerous if allah is with you inshallah i can be on the straight path so for a woman if she goes to a medical college she has to yet maintain a hijab and in the college that i was there were muslim women to maintain them not all of them but they were one or two who maintained the hijab maintain their job see to it that if we have to suppose if the patient is common and you have to take a common history with another gent you know we have to take the common history of the patient maybe the colleague is a gent fine when you talk low your games not oh how are you how is the movie did you see the movies are all coming oh let's go for a spin let's go for a drive on the bike so all these things if you avoid and see to it that if you have to talk with your khali you can talk with lowering your gaze though the people will not like it so she has to maintain a hijab it's very much possible as for examining the patient of opposite sex the quran and the say hadith get permission why because you're treating the patient so doctor can see the opposite sex if required best is same sex same doctor best but you don't have it everywhere that's the reason we brother we have initiated in our activities in the united islamic aid a new activity called as free medical center so we have started recently which will inaugurate after this conference sheikh salab there the imam of majida we will be inaugurating our center in mumrah on the 10th of november inshallah two days after the conference the inauguration of this center it is the uniqueness is it is on the lines of quran and sunnah means lady doctor will examine lady patients gen doctor will examine gen patient his area two thousand square feet separate waiting area for ladies separate for gents children can go where they want no problem if they're young but lady doctor will check ladies and inshallah inshallah we aim to have only mbbs doctors and md you know so that they're more professional everything air-conditioned but free good quality medicine and inshallah inshallah when i started the center i'm a medical doctor i intend to give better treatment in this free center than the owned medical clinic that i have got i have left my profession my brother and my father mashallah the doctors and the running offender which is good but there we charge and that's the bread and butter we charge money but inshallah in this free medical center inshallah we'll give better services inshallah than the only medical cleaning that we have for our bread and butter inshallah fully air-conditioned inshallah good waiting room hygienic but free those who can't afford it free anyone can come even muslims and non-muslims can come and in the waiting room we won't have stardust magazine we won't have fulfilled magazine we'll have islamic books we'll have islamic satellite channels you know people have you know you go to a high caliber doctor filmfare magazine status so besides them getting cured by the diseases inshallah even the iman will get cured who are shafi it's allah who cares so what we believe that if you want to do medicine if there's no single sex college you can but you have to maintain your hijab become a doctor so that more hijab can be maintained once that lady doctor becomes muslim becomes a doctor she will allow many other women to follow the hijab hope that's the question"
