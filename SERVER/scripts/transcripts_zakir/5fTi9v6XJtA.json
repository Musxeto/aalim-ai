  "title": "Should Muslims follow Social Distancing for Fear of Coronavirus? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question is from Abdul Qadeer from Dammam Saudi Arabia should Muslims follow social distancing for fear of coronavirus what is the meaning of social distancing the literary meaning of social distancing is they have to keep the society apart and this is not in favor of Islam the literal meaning of social means you know you have to keep people apart whether it be your relatives whether it be our kith and kin whether it be a parent this breaking the relationship of Kipp and Kim if the ninth major sin in Islam III being a medical doctor I know the social distancing in the medical terminology it's a misnomer the right word should be physical distancing physical distancing is the more appropriate word this word social distancing was coined in the early part of the 21st century in 2001 2003 and in 2009 wh o World Health Organization said that if you keep an arm's length away from the other human being that is a term used for social distancing approximately one meter but after coab 819 coronavirus disease 2019 initially the medical the medical doctors and whu-oh said keep one metres distance but later on they changed it to two metres distance be 6 feet apart so the right terminology should be physical distancing social distancing is a misnomer because social distancing we serve to keep socially apart which is parameter in Islam we know today that the world has advanced we know we can socially be connected to a person even if you are thousands of miles apart a person living in America can be socially connected to a person living in Bangladesh or India or Pakistan through the social media that's what it's called social media we can socialize with each other we don't have to be physically close so I believe this what social distancing is a misnomer the right terminology should be physical distancing as far as physical distancing nificant third yes if there is a contagious diseases it was it was accompanied by the Prophet and I quoted that in the previous session that when you see a person who has leprosy then run away as though you have seen a tiger the Prophet recommended that when there is a plague you should not enter a place which has a plague and if you're in that place you should not leave it so this is what this is what the medical fraternity today tells us so I am for it but I am only against the terminology social distancing is a misnomer the right terminology should be physical distancing and this is also there in medical terminology both are used but in the media that we find today social distancing has become so popular I would request the Muslims not to use this for social distancing they should they should use physical distancing and this is appropriate word and if there is a contagious diseases or it can be an epidemic or a pandemic or like coronavirus covered 19 yes I recommend that to prevent its spread it is full now it is a requirement that you should maintain your physical distances"
