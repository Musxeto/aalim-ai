  "title": "Islam gave Economic Rights to Women 1300 years Before the Western World - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "let's discuss the economic rights of the women in islam islam gave a woman the economic rights 1400 years ago thirteen hundred years before the western world when the quran was revealed at the advent of the prophet muhammed any adult woman whether married or unmarried she was allowed to own or disown the property without the permission of anyone else if we read history the first time the westerners gave right for a married woman to own or disown the property without the permission of the husband was in 1870s under the special married woman property act and this special woman's marriage property act was further revised in 1882 and 1897. imagine islam gave right to the woman to own or disown 1300 years before the western world in islam a woman is financially more secured before she is married it is the duty of her father and her brother and after she's married it's the duty of her husband and a son to look after her financial aspects lodging boarding clothing and all the financial aspects she need not work for a living financially a woman is secured it is the duty of the man in the house to earn the living the financial burden is put on the shoulders of the men in islam but if both the ends don't meet and the woman wants to work she can work as long as it is within the purview of the islamic sharia she maintains the hijab and she follows the quran and say hadith because there's no verse in the quran which prohibits a woman to work as long as it is not against the quran and the sahadi there are many professions which are prohibited for the woman those professions which exhibit the body for example modeling acting dancing all these professions they haram for the woman it's prohibited furthermore the many professions which are prohibited for the woman as well as the men for example working in alcoholic bars working in gambling then doing dishonest business cheating bribing all these are prohibited for both men and women there are many professions which are noble and we want the woman to do there are some professions which if the women want the both the ends to meet they can do for example they can do cooking at home pottery weaving knitting they can work in places which have got segregation of sexes where the modesty is protected where the hijab is maintained they can take up noble professionals such as teaching they can become nurses and doctors if i want my wife my mother my daughter to maintain a hijab but natural we should make our women folk some of them as doctors but if you analyze in islam the woman is financially secured she need not work for a living it's the duty of the man to look after the financial burden before she's married as i mentioned it's the duty of the father and the brother and after she's married it's the duty of the husband and the son to look after her lodging boarding clothing and all financial aspects she need not work but if she works and if that work is within the purview of the islamic sharia then whatever she earns she need not spend on the family she can keep it for herself that's her right but if she wants to take part and help in the financial aspects she can but no one can force her in islam during marriage the woman is on the receiving end the quran says in surah chapter number 4 verse number 4 that gift to the woman in marriage adore as a gift in islam maher that is a marital gift is compulsory for a marriage to solomonize without maher a marriage cannot solomonize in islam in indian culture where we live it is the opposite it is the woman who gives dowry to the would be husband in islam it's opposite it is the man who gives to the would-be wife maher a marital gift a tower but unfortunately in the muslim society many of us have made it as a joke you know in india we keep them here as 786 rupees you can't even buy a pair of shoes with 786 rupees and for namesake they keep two thousand rupees or unni's miscarriage you know saying that the prophet kept unleashed miscarriage my hair if you have the same wealth as the prophet and hazrat ali you may be having ten times hundred times more well than what the prophet had and hazrat ali may allah please with him and you want to give unnies you have to give 190 1900 miscall if you want to follow the profit they spend on the weddings lavishly they may keep the nikka in the mosque for namesake but a walima on a big ground spending lacks of rupees millions of rupees and they want to keep amer as 786. now to make a mockery of islam the indian culture unfortunately some of the muslims they are being influenced by the indian culture you know in indian culture it is the woman that gives the dowry to the would be husband and you know depending upon the market if you want to marry a graduate you may have to give five lakh rupees half a million rupees if you want to marry an engineer you have to give 10 lakh rupees 1 million rupees if you have to marry a doctor you may have to give 50 lakh rupees 5 million rupees as the herds and cattle are being sold in the market places in islam to demand dowry from the would-be wife is haram it is prohibited demanding directly or indirectly both prohibited you can't tell the parents of the would-be bride that my son he likes to travel in a mercedes car giving indication i want a mercedes car for dowry you know my son he likes to live in a three bedroom apartment give me an indication that you want a three bedroom apartment for dowry demanding dowry directly and directly is private in islam if willingly if the parents of the girl the bride wants to give some gift to the daughter there's no problem but you cannot force or cannot ask or request directly or indirectly it is prohibited in islam so if you analyze in islam the woman they're on the receiving end during marriage and furthermore irrespective the woman may be very rich the wife may be very rich or she may be poor irrespective whether the husband is rich or poor it is yet the duty of the husband to look after the food clothing lodging and on financial aspects of the wife he cannot say okay my wife is rich i'm poor yet it is his duty furthermore just in case if divorce takes place or if a woman gets widowed she gets maintenance for the period for the waiting period and if she's pregnant it extends till she gives delivery of the child till she gives birth of the child and if the child is born she even gets financial support till the child grows up"
