  "transcript": "that every Muslim should donate whatever possible in his capacity for the Palestinian Cause And while giving donation the amount is not important the percentage is important and I always say that if a person who earned $1,000 a month and he donates $100 for the Palestinian cause he's donating 10% of his monthly income on the other hand if a billionaire who earns a billion dollar a month from that he donates a million dollar for the Palestinian cause $1 million of a billion dollar is 0.1% whereas $100 of $1,000 10% so the person who earns $1,000 and donates $100 for the Palestinian cause will get 100 times more Saab than a person who earns a billion dollar a month and donates a million dollar because $100 is 10% of his income and $1 million of a person who earns a billion a month is. 1% of his income"
