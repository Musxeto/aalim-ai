  "title": "Why are Men seated in Front of Women in the Audience in this Conference? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "hi my name is meredith and i'm a student studying psychology from canada uh my question's very simple uh how can you say that men and women that there's no sexism when the very setup of this conference is sexist for example the men are seated can you repeat the question a bit slowly sister yes why is it that the men are seated in front of the women the very structure of this conference is sexist why is that mashallah this is a very good question that why aren't the women seated in front no why are we not if you're going to separate us how come we're not left to the right why is one in front of a good question that why are the women if you believe in equal why not left and right why not it's a very good question sister because the quran says in surah nude chapter 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his gaze and goddess modesty whenever a man looks at a woman any brazen thought comes in his mind he should lower his case now if the woman are sitting on my right i will only have to speak looking on the left you know because i cannot look at them yeah i can look at everyone just i cannot see your face also from here you may look at my direction if you want to see me close you can see on the screen there no problem but for me the quran says the moment i look at a woman i should lower my gifts unless she's my wife or she's my mother she's my daughter and if someone says that someone looks at a woman and nothing happens to him then he requires a psychiatrist so if you were here i'll talk to you like that so you'll tell me what an ill-mannered man is this you know showing me his back now my gaze is there knowing the microphone i cannot see you i can just see okay just a little bit here and there so i'm maintaining my hijab now when we have lady speaker speaking only ladies front row no problem so what happens because it's a gen speaking there are occasions some occasions then we have to keep a partition and we can do that and we have done that but there's such a vast gathering so many cameras it will obstruct so that's the reason but in no way are we trying to say that the women are inferior that is the reason we are going to screen close to you mashallah especially if our sisters are sitting a bit more behind so you can get the view but in front it will be difficult for me to speak for me to maintain my hijab for me to look because in public speaking you know we are taught we have to look at the audience if the audience is a woman in front of me you know i remember once i had gone to the gulf country and i was called for a talk and a ladies organization i always say that at least the front row should be gent you know but they didn't do it so half the talk i gave looking at the ground and balance off looking at the ceiling down ceiling believe me i was in hell not because i was in company of ladies i was in hell because half my lecture i gave looking at the ground and half my lecture looking in the ceiling i had to maintain my hijab here i can i can talk to the person i can look at him i can stare at him if he's sleeping i stare at him he stops sleeping you know the public speaking but with the ladies therefore it is for maintaining the hijab so that's the reason sister it is not at all in any way trying to belittle them and the reason we have given you one microphone instead of two because we feel that the proportion is approximately one third two third that's the reason but the moment last time when there were more ladies we gave equal proportion hope to answer the question sister thank you"
