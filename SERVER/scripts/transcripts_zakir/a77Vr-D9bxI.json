  "title": "How to Convince an Atheist that the Qur'an is the Word of God with the help of Science â€“ Method 2",
  "transcript": "many of the atheists they believe in science all these arguments may not satisfy them completely many of the atheists they say that science is a yardstick they believe science is ultimate so let's try and prove to this group of atheists also about the existence of allah so if i know that this atheist believes only in science after congratulating him i'll ask him a simple question that if suppose there is equipment there is a gadget who no one in the world has ever seen and if that gadget is bought in front of you another question is asked that who will be the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of this gadget that atheist he may say after thinking for a while the first person who will be able to tell you the mechanism of a gadget who no one in the world has ever seen no one in the world knows about it he will tell you that the creator of the gadget or he may say the make of the gadget he may say the inventor he may say the producer he may say the manufacturer whatever he says it will be somewhat similar either creator manufacturer producer maker inventor somewhat similar just keep that answer at the back of your mind the second person is the creator if he says to somebody else he'll come to know or a person who does research but that is secondary you asked this atheist that how did our universe come into existence so he will tell you that our universe was initially one primary nebula then there was a secondary separation a big bang which gave rise to galaxies stars moon sun and the earth on which we live this he calls as the big bang you ask him when did you come to know about this creation of the universe about the big bang he will tell you about 50 years back 40 years back so you tell him this thing what you're mentioning about the big bang is already mentioned in the quran 1400 years ago in surah ambia what you're talking about the big bang is already mentioned in the quran 1400 years ago who could have mentioned this in the quran so he will tell maybe it's a fluke somebody wrote it no problem don't argue with him ask him the next question what is the shape of the earth so he will tell you previously the human beings thought that the world was flat it was in 1577 when sir francis drake he sailed around the earth that he proved that the earth was spherical you tell him that the quran mentions chapter number 79 verse number 30 we have made the earth x-shape the arabic word one of its meaning is an expanse and the earth is an expanse the other meaning is derived from the arabic word which means an egg and we know today that the earth is not completely round like a ball it is sudden from the pole and bulging from the center it is geospherical in shape it is somewhat similar to the egg and the arabic word does not refer to a normal leg it specifically refers to the egg of an ostrich and if you analyze the shape of the egg of an ostrich it is geospherical shape imagine the quran mentioned that the earth is your spherical 1400 years ago who could have mentioned that so he will tell you ah your prophet muhammad peace be upon him intelligent man don't argue continue the light of the moon is in its own line of reflected light so the atheist will tell you previously we thought that the light of the moon was its own light but today we know that the light of the moon is not its own light it's a reflected light when you come to know he will tell you we came to know yesterday 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back quran mentions 1400 years ago in surah for khan chapter number 25 verse number 61. that blessed is he who has placed the constellations in the sky and therein sun shams having its own light and moon having borrowed light the arabic word for sun is shums its light is always described as siraj of a hajj meaning a torch or a blazing lamp and the moon in arabic is called as kamar its light is always described as muneer onur munir means borrowed light and noor means a reflection of light and nowhere is the moonlight described as mahaja it's always described as nur amunir borrowed light a reflection of light who could have mentioned this in the quran 14 years ago now there will be a pause don't wait for the reply continue when i was in school i had learned that the sun revolved but it was stationary it did not rotate about success the quran says chapter number 21 verse number 33 it is allah was created the night and the day was something will come out the sun and the moon fifa yes each one traveling in an orbit with its own motion the arabic word yes bahun describes the motion of a moving body and if it's talking about accessory body it means that this sun and the moon besides revolving it's also rotating about its own axis and today science tells us that the sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one rotation imagine what i read in school i finished my school 1982. sun was stationary 1400 years before the quran says the sun rotates and my science book said the sun was stationary today it has been incorporated that the sun rotates you ask him that who could have mentioned this there'll be a silent pause some critics will say it's nothing great that the quran speaks about astronomy because the arabs were advanced in the field of astronomy i do agree the arabs were advanced in the field of astronomy but like to remind them that it was centuries after the quran was revealed that the arabs became advanced in the field of astronomy so it is from the quran that the arabs learnt about astronomy and not the vice versa in the subject of hydrology when you ask the atheist that you ask him about the water cycle he will tell you that the water evaporates from the ocean it forms into clouds the clouds move into the interior it falls down as rain and the water is replenished i asked him when did you come to know this he will tell you it was in 1580 when sir bernard palace he spoke about the water cycle for the first time fifth and eighty so you tell him what you came to know in 59 and 80 just hardly a couple of hundred years before the quran mentions 1400 years ago the quran says the water evaporates from the ocean formed into the clouds the clouds move and join the moon the interior and they fall down the drain and the water will be depleted the water cycle is spoken in the quran in great detail in several places mentioned surya zuma chapter 39 verse number 21 in sure room chapter number 30 verse number 24 in surah chapter number 15 verse number 22 in sorry mommy noon chapter number 23 verse number eighteen in this room chapter number thirty verse number forty 48 in surah nude chapter number 24 verse number 43 it's mentioned in surah chapter number 17 verse number 12 to 14. it's mentioned in surah chapter number 7 verse 57 in surah chapter number 13 verse number 17. it's mentioned surah furqan chapter number 25 verses 14 49 it's mentioned in surya seen chapter number 36 verse number 34 it's mentioned surah father chapter number 35 verse number nine it's mentioned surah joshua chapter number 45 verse number five in surah chapter 50 verse number 9 and 10. it's mentioned foreign chapter 56 verse number 67 to 70. it's mentioned surah chapter 96 verse number 11. i can go on and go on and go on quoting only the verses in the quran we speak about the water cycle only the quran speaks about the water cycle in great detail who could have mentioned this in the quran 14 years ago no reply don't worry continue the quran speaks about geology the geologists say that the radius of the earth is 3750 miles the deeper layers are hot and fluid the upper layer is a thin crust hardly 1 to 20 miles in thickness and there are high possibilities it will shake it is due to the folding phenomena which gives rise to mountain ranges which prevents the earth from shaking allah mentioned this in the quran it's mentioned in the quran in surah we have made the earth as an expanse and the mountains aspects which science has agreed today a similar message is mentioned in suryambia chapter 21 verse number 31 that we have placed on the earth mountain standing firm lest it would shake with you in the field of oceanology previously we knew that there was two types of water salt and sweet but the quran says in surah for khan chapter 25 verse number 53 that it is he who has let free two bodies of flowing water one sweet and palatable the other salty and bitter though the meat did not mix there is a barrier which is forbidden to be test past we knew that there were two types of water but what does the quran mean there is a barrier which is forbidden to be test passed today we know that whenever one type of water flows into the other type of water it loses this constituents and gets homogenized into the water it flows this homogenizing area is called as a barrier of in the quran quran mentioned this 14 years ago quran mentioned about biology it's mentioned chapter number 21 verse number 30. we have created every living thing from water will you not then believe who could have believed in the deserts of arabia that everything made from water today science tells us that every living thing is made from water there is a theory known as theory of probability that if you make a wild guess the chances you'll be right is depending upon what are the options for example if i toss a coin head or tails whatever reply you give the chances you'll be right is one upon two half fifty percent two options chances will be right is one upon two fifty percent if i cost a ton twice the chances i'll be right both the times is 1 upon 2 into 1 upon 2 it is 1 upon 4 it is 25 if i toss a coin thrice the chances i'll be right all three times is 1 upon 2 into 1 upon 2 into 1 upon 2 it is 1 upon eight twelve and a half percent if i throw a dice the dice has got six sides the chances if i make a wild guess it will be right is one upon six now if you apply this theory of probability that someone made a wild guess for example what is the shape of the earth you can think of ten things flat square rectangle triangular hexagonal on and on may be spherical the chances if you make a wild guess it is spherical it will be right is one upon 10. if you ask a person the light of the moon is its own light or reflected light if he makes a wild guess chancellor will be right as one upon two the chances that both are right the shape of the earth and the light of the moon is not its own light is one upon 10 into 1 upon 2 is 1 upon 20 that is 5 all living creatures made of what you can think of a thousand things sand iron tin wood on and on maybe even water chances you make a wild guess and one is right is one upon thousand chances all three are correct shape of the earth is spherical light of the moon is reflected everything made from water is 1 upon 10 into 1 upon 2 into 1 upon 1 000 is 1 upon 20 000 is 0.005 percent only in three scientific facts it's 0.005 percent i've already mentioned several and if you read my book there are hundreds there are many things quran speaks about botany in surah chapter number 13 verse number three that all the fruits are created in pairs in sex is male and female quran says number 20 verse 53 that the plants are made in sexes male and female which you came know recently in the field of zoology quran says the animals and the birds live in community like the human beings in surah anam chapter number 6 verse number 38 which we came know recently quran speaks about the bee that it can find its path which we came from recently in surah and hell chapter number 16 verse number 16 69 the quran says that the worker be the female bee previously thought it was the male bee quran says in surah nil chapter number 16 verse number 69 that the worker be the female be quran speaks about the lifestyle of the spider in surah and kabut chapter 29 and verse 41. the quran speaks about the lifestyle of the ant in surah namal chapter number 27 verse number 7 18 which we have come know recently quran speaks about genetics that it is the male fluid it is the sperm which is responsible for the sex of the child and surah najam chapter number 53 verse number 45 and 46 as well as chapter number 75 verse number 37-39 which we came to know recently quran speaks about embryology that all the human beings are made from alaka a leash like substance something which clings in surah al-aqsurah chapter 96 verse number two which we came from recently quran speaks about the various embryological stages alaka mudga which we have come to recently there are various scientific facts mentioned in the quran just mention two more there are people who say that after human beings die and after we are buried and our bones are disintegrated how will allah wa'ta'ala be able to reconstruct the bone on the day of judgment so allah says it's mentioned in the quran chapter number 75 verse number 3 and 4 that when they say that how will allah be able to reconstruct the bones of the day of judgment tell them allah can not only reconstruct the bones he can even reconstruct in perfect order the very tips of your finger what does allah mean by saying he can not only reconstruct your bones he can even reconstruct in perfect order the very tips of your finger it was in 880 that's a francis gold he discovered the fingerprinting method and said that no two fingerprints even even a million human beings are identical today the police the cid the fbi the cia they use the fingerprinting method to identify the criminal quran speaks about the fingerprinting method 1400 years ago and we discovered in 1880 who could i mention this i would like to mention one more thing before and the scientific facts is that there was a scientist by the name of prohibited prophet rashawn hail from thailand and he was doing a great deal of research in the pain receptors previously we human beings we thought and the doctors thought that only the brain was responsible for the feeling of pain today we come to know that there are certain receptors in the skin which are also responsible for the feeling of pain that's the reason when a person of burn injury comes to a doctor the doctor takes a pin and pricks it in the area of burn if the patient feels pain the doctor is happy the pain receptors are intact if the patient does not feel pain the doctor is sad the pain receptors have been destroyed it's mentioned in the quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse 56 that as to those who reject our signs we shall cast them in the hell fire and as often as the skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skin so that they feel the pain indicating there is something in the skin which is responsible for the feeling of pain imagine quran speaks about the pain receptors 14 years ago and professor takara when he came to know this is mentioned in the quran in the ninth medical conference in riyadh in the conference itself he said the shahada and said mohammed rasool allah there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad peace be upon the messenger of allah so when you ask the atheist who could have mentioned this in the quran the only reply can give you is the same which he gave you earlier it is the creator it is the maker it is the producer it is a manufacturer it is an inventor this creator this producer this manufacturer this maker this inventor we muslims call him as allah that's the reason today science is not eliminating god it is eliminating models of god scientists today they are eliminating models of god this cannot be god this cannot be god they aren't eliminating god and a famous philosopher and scientist francis bacon he said that those who have little knowledge of science they become atheist but those who have in-depth knowledge of science they become a believer in god i would like to end my talk with the quotation of the quran from surah fusillah chapter 41 into the furthest regions of the horizons and into the souls until it is clear to them that this is the truth [Applause]"
