  "title": "I was a Hindu who met a Muslim boy 3.5 years ago because of whose Dawah I became a Muslim.",
  "transcript": "therefore inshallah be the last question before we end the session this question is from Isha a revert from jharkhand India I am born in the Hindu family but from the past few years I am a Muslim alhamdulillah my family is absolutely anti-muslims and after this Corona and jamaat incidents the hatred for Muslims have doubled I met a boy three and a half years back he gave me the knowledge about Islam and Allah gave me the hidayah and I became a Muslim by heart and soul now I want to marry him so that I can follow Islam and inshallah I will but till the time I am here at my parents house I have to face many troubles like I have to hear the cruel words against Muslims they criticize Muslims they say bad things about Muslims they force me to eat Prasad they scold me when I do hijab they scold me when I say good things about Muslims they stop me from fasting they actually don't know that I am a Muslim now but they have hints they put question on my character and many other things what should I do till the time I'm here sir the boy I want to marry who gave me the knowledge about Islam never forced me to convert my family members see news channels such as Aaj Tak and Republic TV and they keep on criticizing My Religion Islam they are hardcore BJP facts regarding the reply to your question sister is Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 41 verse number 34. that repel evil with goodness you may never know the person in whose heart is evil he will become your friend the person who's your enemy he will become your friend so Allah advises repel evil with goodness so even though your family members are against you they are cursing you they are criticizing you the attacking the Muslims you as a good Muslim and I congratulate you that you have accepted Islam may Allah support you you as a good Muslim should respect your parents to respect your family members if they are against you you have to be better you have to be kind to them you have to be merciful for them they should say what kind of daughter is this we are attacking her we are criticizing her she's yet kind she's yet loving you have to love your mother more you have to love your father more you have to love your brother more and they should find a marked difference between Isha what was before becoming a Muslim Anisha after she's become a Muslim you should obey them only those things what they tell you which is against Quran and the Sunnah against the Commandments of Allah and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad sallam again the Sharia those are the only things you have to obtain from Allah says in the Quran in foreign that you have to be kind to your parents but if the parents do Jihad strive and struggle to make you worship somebody else besides Allah then don't obey them so only in this time when they ask you to do do idol worship don't obey them when they force you to have Prasad don't obey them politely refuse them don't be rude to them and there should be a marked difference in your behavior love them even if they criticize you then I would request you that ask your friend who brought you close to Islam and confirm that does he want to marry you you may never know if he body goes to Islam he didn't force you but ask him directly do you want to marry me and how long will you take to marry me ask a direct question don't feel shy if he says it's a few months no problem if he says too long then you have to tell him that I cannot practice for long Islam in my family so I have to see to it that you have to tell him to talk to his parents and finalize the marriage as soon as possible and if he's trying to give excuses no I will give you the answer after three years after four years then give him an ultimatum you give me the answer within a few days or a couple of weeks when are you going to marry and see to it that it is very soon in the next few months maximum a few more months but don't delay it too much if you find that he is not very firm I would advise you look for someone else who is a good Muslim or convince him to marry you first and marry this person according to the rules of sharia taking the permission of his parents inform your parents then the moment he agrees that you have become Muslim you are an adult you have a right to choose your life partner and alhamdulillah after you tell your parents that you're become a Muslim it becomes your duty that you have to do dawa to them but see to it that don't behave rude with them if they are rude to you you should not be rude to them because Paradise Lies Beneath the feet of your mother your mother may not be in Paradise but your Paradise Lies Beneath the feet of your mother be kind to her be respectful to her and it's your duty that you can then give my talks on similarity between Islam and Hinduism and other lectures of mine slowly slowly talk to them only when you talk to them and you speak to them nicely kindly with love and affection and I pray to Allah that may give hidayah to your parents and all your family members so that all of you inshallah"
