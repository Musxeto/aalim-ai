  "transcript": "the degree that we acquire in the colleges and universities it may or may not help you in this world there are hundreds and thousands of graduates and postgraduates that I know that are jobless and the education you acquire in school colleges and universities if it does not get you closer to Allah subhana wa ta'ala if it does not get you closer to your creator almighty God then this education is useless for the Hereafter but as far as the Quran is concerned Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 1 and two this is a book of guidance without doubt for those who have tawa for those who fear Allah subhana tala that means Allah is giving a promise that this book is a book of guidance and it will surely benefit you in this world as well as hereafter"
