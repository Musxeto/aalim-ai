  "title": "To be a Fundamentalist, Vice or Virtue? - Shaikh Fariq Naik",
  "transcript": "the second most common question or misconception that is there in the minds of non-muslims is that why are most of the Muslims fundamentalist what is the meaning of the word fundamentalist fundamentalist by definition means a person who follows the fundamentals of a particular subject for example for a person to be a good mathematician he should know follow and strive to practice the fundamentals of maths unless he's a fundamentalist in the field of maths he cannot be a good mathematician for a person to be a good scientist he should know follow and strive to practice the fundamentals of science unless he's a fundamentalist in the field of science he cannot be a good scientist you cannot paint all fundamentalist with the same brush that all are good or all are bad depending upon which field the person is a Fundamentalist you have to label him accordingly for example there is a fundamentalist doctor whose profession is to save human lives he's a born for the society on the other hand there is a fundamentalist robber whose profession is to Rob he's a being for the society as far as I am concerned I am a fundamentalist Muslim and I am proud to be a fundamentalist Muslim because I know and I strive to practice the fundamentals of Islam and I know that there is not a single fundamental of Islam which is Against Humanity as a whole I challenge any human being to point out a single fundamental of Islam which is Against Humanity as a whole there may be some fundamentals which some people might think they're Against Humanity but the moment to give a logical background there is not a single fundamental of Islam which is Against Humanity as a whole fundamentalist according to the Webster dictionary was first used to describe a group of American Protestant Christians the Christian Church believed that the Bible was a word of God these American Protestant Christians they not only believed that the Bible was a word of God but they believed every word every letter of the Bible is the word of God according to the Oxford dictionary fundamentalist is a person who strictly adheres to the ancient doctrine of any religion and in the revised edition of the Oxford dictionary fundamentalist is a person who strictly adheres to the ancient doctrine of any religion especially Islam this word especially Islam has been added in the revised edition of the Oxford dictionary the moment you hear the word fundamentalist you start thinking of a Muslim you start thinking of an extremist I tell the people I am an extremist I'm extremely kind I'm extremely hon honest I'm extremely loving I'm extremely just what's wrong in being an extremist why are we apologetic what is wrong in being extremely kind extremely honest extremely loving extremely just extremely truthful but we should be an extremist in the right direction we should not be an extremist in the wrong direction Allah subhana wa taala says in the Glorious Quran Bak chapter number 2 vers number 208 oh you who believe enter into Islam wholeheartedly you can't say partially when it will benefit me I'll will be just and when it will not benefit me I will not be just but we should be an extremist in the right direction we should not be an extremist in the wrong direction so why are we Muslims apologetic it is time for us to turn the tables over"
