  "transcript": "assalamualaikum dr knight this is zakir knight my name is rashid i'm a government officer talking about unity in the muslim ummah okay in terms of scholars in nature i believe most of us follow same scholars but when it comes to political ideology we fall apart into certainty but i can't hear you clearly sister brother can you say a bit slowly because the microphone is not very clear can you speak a bit loudly and slowly okay all right better talking about scholars in malaysia most of us follow same scholars but when it comes to political ideology we fall apart into certain parties my question is how to to unite them so that all of us will be under one party and our voice will get stronger in parliament that's a good question that when it comes to scholars we we follow one scholar but when it comes to political party we follow different parties how to unite them the only way you can unite is on the basis of quran in sunnah you can unite the muslims whether it is a politician whether he's a businessman whether he's a comedy academy whether he's a scientist whether he's a doctor whether he's a die where they're practicing only way you can unite this is a master key quran and say hadith and if that person doesn't want to follow quran and say hadith that means he may not be a good practicing muslim whether we win the seat or not whether we come to power or not all this is a test from allah this is a test from allah a main aim should be to unite the muslim ummah on the quran and say hadith some people may not be following the quran but for the political gain they may say they are practicing muslim they may not be some people are practicing muslim when they come to power they show their less practicing because they want to become they want to continue being in power let not the politics of this world take you away from jannah you are a very bad businessman if you are going to batter the seat of this world for your seat in jannah you are a very bad businessman the seat in jannah is much more valuable so what we find that many times in politics we are more bothered about maintaining a seed than maintaining the guidance of allah and israel in india i know many politicians who are far away from the deen but because they will win because they show their islamic they will prove themselves islamic they may not be islamic there are some good muslims who come to power to show themselves cycle or what they do that they stand start behaving singular they are good muslims before they came to power they were practicing muslim oh now because i have come to power if i wear trousers over the ankle what will people say so that houses go below they have a beard to shave their beard they were practicing before so let's not and allah says in the quran and sorry imran chapter 3 verse number 185. every soul shall have a taste of death the final recompense will be on the day of judgement and the person who's safe from the hellfire and enters jannah has achieved the objectives of this world for this world is nothing but goods and chapters of deception all this is a test for us whether when i do business am i doing business according to the quran when i'm doing my academics i'm having work on the quran in sunnah when i'm doing my profession when i'm doing my job am i honest or not so all this is quran in sunnah so the only way you can unite the muslim ummah is on the quran in sunnah whether they come to it or not you at least be on quran in sunnah correct what should we say whether you're able to do it or not do you stick to the quran and sunnah if everyone goes away you stick at least you will go to jannah if i stick at least i will go to jannah ajanna is very precious you cannot barter the jannah for anything in this world for any power in this world for any wealth million dollar trillion dollar zillion dollar you cannot barter it for the jannah our beloved prophet muslim said a believer lives in this world like a prison an unbeliever lives in this world like paradise so once a jew approached a scholar i think him and he told him that you are a judge you are so rich i am poor how come this world is present for you and jannah for me so he told him if you come to know what will happen to you in akira because you are doing you'll go to jannam this world will be jannah for you and me if i follow the quran and sunnah and go to jannah all these judges in the wealth is like a prison for me compared to the pleasure in akhirah so if we live like that that this life is the test for the hereafter and we follow the quran in sunnah inshallah peace will be with you if you understand the concept of islam irrespective what the enemies do to you you will be peaceful because your jannah is in your heart not in the dunya hope to answer the question"
