  "title": "Rotation of the Sun and the Moon in the Qur'aan - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Brothers asked a question he said that he has read the Bible he quoted a few verses of the Bible and of the Quran didn't give the reference he said that the Bible says that almighty God created day and the night in the F what he's quoting is the first book of the Bible the Book of Genesis chapter number one verse number three it says that almighty God created the day and the night and on the first day and further if you read in Genesis chapter number one verse number 13 29 it says almighty God created the sun on the fourth day I'm giving the references also so doesn't this go against science I do agree with you it goes against science and I had a debate with Dr William Campbell in USA Dr William Campbell he is a missionary and a medical doctor and got a PhD writing a book against the Quran and in that debate on the Quran and the Bible and the of science even I posed this question even he couldn't answer so I do agreee there's a problem in the Bible now coming to your question that the Quran says that almighty God controls the universe regarding the Bible yes I do agree with you Bible is against established Signs regarding a question that Quran says almighty God controls the universe you didn't say that sun rotates ah that that's what I heard therefore I'm asking you to repeat why AR you repeating I heard that and it gave reference CH 21:22 the reference is wrong the real reference I'll tell you the real reference isia 21: 33 not 22 vers 33 here the Quran I'm speaking from memory I'm not a computer I'll give the reply brother after I reply whatever query you have no problem brother you as brother you asked the question let me reply after I finish my reply you can ask another 20 questions but you as the question I was listening to you carefully Now you listen to my answer and after I finish my answer if you have any query you can ask I will give you enough chairman doesn't agree I'll request him to give you time because you are delighted to come here we are more delighted that you are here the brother said that the Quran says in Surah Amia 21 verse 22 it's actually verse 33 that the sun rotates what is's quoting in the verse of the Quran ofia 21:33 he says it is Allah who has created night and the day and the moon each one driving orbit with his own motion and this mistake was even taken out by Tas you know Tas heard of her ah from Bangladesh she said that if a book believe that the sun rotates around the earth then how can we advance so the Quran has to be changed the problem is that a view should be changed and she should read the Quran correctly the Quran says it is Allah who has created the night and the day the Sun and the Moon each one traveling in orbit with its own motion no does the Quran say that the sun rotates or revolves around the earth no way what does the Quran say the Sun and the Moon rotate and revolve nowhere does it say around the earth the word Earth is not there in this verse it says it is Allah who has created night and day the Sun and the Moon each one traveling Orit with his own motion when I was in school I had learned that the sun was stationary it did not rotate about his own axis it revolved in the universe the whole solar system is revolving but I when I passed my school 1982 I had learned the sun was stationary did not rotate but this ver of the Quran says the Arabic word yesun is derived from the word sabaha which describes the motion of a moving body if I use this Arabic word sabaha for a person on the floor it will not mean he's rolling it will mean he's walking or running if I use this Arabic word for a person in the water it will not mean he's floating it will mean he swimming when Allah uses this word for a Celestial body it doesn't mean it's flying it means it is ating about his own axis so Quran says the Sun and the Moon besides revolving they're also rotating about their own axis when I read the of the Quran I said but I read in my school book the sun does not rotate today science has advanced and we come to know we can have the image of the sun on a tabletop and we see that the sun has got black spots and these black spots take about 25 days to complete one notation indicating the sun takes approximately 25 days to complete one ration so what I learned in school in 1982 today hand says it is wrong Quran has mentioned this not 20 years back, 1400 years back what I learned in school 20 years back the Quran says what I learned is wrong first I got a shock but then I did more research I realized that the Quran is Right Quran is not wrong my science book was wrong and T where did she put the word Earth inside I don't know does she know Arabic can she read English English translation doesn't say that she assumed that when the Quran says that Sun revolves it revolves around the earth that's assumption so her assumption is wrong alhamdulillah Quran is not wrong and I do agree with you that Allah subhana wa taala he controls this universe that's the reason according to Francis bin Francis B is a great philosopher he said little knowledge of science makes you an atheist but indepth knowledge of science makes you a believer in one God hope to answer the question sir I'm not sure the chapter number no problem I never criticize you I just corrected you I tell I have to just tell the right thing if you have given something wrong reference if someone open I corrected you I didn't say that you have to know by heart neither are you computer neither am I a computer but I think it is in the Surah number eight I think the sun is rotating Earth it's nowhere in the Quran I'm telling you the verse you're quoting is Surah Amia 21:33 even quot by and hundreds of critics of Islam No Way in Sur anal chapter it does it say that the sun nowh in the Quran it says the sun rotates the closest misunderstanding you can have if you don't know Arabic or don't read the transl correctly is Sur so your first reference was very close only 11 verses difference so your reference was right chapter number was right 21 but the verse was not 22 it was verse 33 yes the Quran no chapter number 21 verse 22 the God controls the universe a now one more the God controls the universe that from you science hasn't Advanced so far to come to know about the reality of Allah subhana wa tala I've given the talk is the Quran God's word and have proved scientifically the existence of Allah subhana tala I would request one of the volunteers to present my video cassette to him I request brother that you can ask one of the volunteers I'll give you a gift a video cassette is the Quran God's word which has mentioned several scientific facts and has even proved scientifically the existence of Allah subhana wa tala therefore today scientist top scientists are not eliminating God they are not the eliminating models of Goda they are not eliminating God but eliminating models of God ill you understand so today scientist top scientist in the world they all believe in God most some may have deviated but most of them agree there has to be a Creator about the creation of the universe today science tells us how did the universe come into creation how by The Big Bang correct yes yes very good big bang that that today scientists they tell us that first there was a primary nebulah the whole universe then there was secondary separation a big bang which gave right to galaxies which gave right to Stars the planets the Sun the Moon and the Earth we live in this is called the Big Bang when did you come to know about this big bang 20 years back 30 years back 40 years back correct Allah says in the Quran in Surah Amia chapter number 21 verse number 30 Allah says 1400 years ago Allah says that do not the unbeliever see that the heavens and the Earth were joined to together do not the unbeliever see that the heavens and the Earth will join together and we clo them as under so Allah says that the heavens and the Earth were join together and we clo them as under this big bang was today the scientist talk about is mentioned in the Quran 14400 years back in a nutshell who could have mentioned this that time science wasn't Advanced who the Creator so like that I've given a full talk you can refer to my video cassette of Quran modern science and is the Quran God's word inshallah inshallah if you watch it with an open mind you have to be convinced that there's one God and he is the creator of the universe thank you"
