  "title": "Logical Evidence that Men and Women are Equal in Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "but as i mentioned earlier to you in islam men and women are equal equality does not mean identicality depending upon the makeup depending upon the background men and women they are different physiologically psychologically biologically physically and depending upon the makeup almighty god our creator has set roles for them and the verse in the quran from surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 32 the ayah our honored career from saudi arabia recited the third last i recited surah nisa chapter 432 it says that do not covet things don't say this is right or this is wrong you may never know allah knows what is best for you what you may think is best for you may not be good for you what do you think is bad for you may be good for you if you read the news in the quran why was this verse revealed this verse was revealed because the wife of the prophet the objected to the prophet and said that why can't we too go for jihad we want our rights about inheritance why aren't we equal this was revealed because allah knows the logic you don't know and i gave you the logic of inheritance imagine the women want to go for jihad they want to fight a beloved prophet muhammad said when others shall be pleased with the rest that can you go for jihad it's mentioned say buhari the prophet said the best jihad for the woman it is a perfect hajj allah knows what is good for them and those people who object to islam and the quran they too know but they don't want to admit this western world this western media which are pointing fingers to islam i'm asking this media the western world they too if they say that islam subjugates the woman they are bigger subjugators i ask a simple question that when you have sports why do you have men and women taking part separately in olympics for the 100 meters dash why don't the men and women run together why why separate for men and separate for women why when you are swimming freestyle swimming why men and women are separate why they should have together you know when you have long terrace and badminton men's badminton women's badminton why you know you have mixed double mixed double means one man one woman means one is superior one is inferior mixed double why don't they have two men and two women against each other you have one man one woman and one team other team one man one woman why don't you have two men in one team and two women in the other team if they equal because the western world knows that physically men and women are different why don't you go and tell the judges of olympics why are you subjugating the woman why don't you let the women and men run together any media ever objected to the olympics to the wimbledon no we have boxing matches have men and women together against each other why not see when you appear for your examination standard 10 men and women sit together when you appear for graduation men and women appear because they know fine where studies are concerned men and women equal but where physical thing is concerned they're different you know we have beauty contest in beauty context we have females separate and male separate do we have together do you have any beauty contest we have seen the men and women taking part together have you seen any why because the beauty of a woman differs than a beauty of a man so even the western world knows that but they don't want to admit it so many a time the competition they are identical sometimes they aren't identical so depending upon what field are they competing in we decide oh yeah men women are separate here men women are same but who is better than our creator who knows the human beings better than our creator allah and he has mentioned in the quran his last and final revelation where the women and men identical where they are different overall men and women are equal but they are not identical and i would like to end my talk by giving a simple example to you suppose in a class two students a and b both get 80 out of 100 in the examination and both come out first when you examine the answer sheet the 10 questions each carrying 10 marks when you examine the answer sheet you come to know the student a got 9 out of 10 in answer number 1. student b gets seven out of ten in answer number one so in answer number one student a has a degree of advantage over student b in answer number two b gets non-order of ten and student a gets n out of ten so in answer number two student b has a degree of advantage over a in all the remaining eight answers from question number three to question number ten both student a and b they get eight out of ten both are equal if you total the aggregate is 80 out of 100 both are equal but in answer number one student a as a degree of advantage answer number two shouldn't be either of advantage all the other answers both are equal so similarly in islam allah knows where women are equal they have equal role where the identical wherever the identical they have identical role in some aspects the men have a degree advantage in some aspect domain of a degree of advantage for example where it comes for love and compassion towards parents as i mentioned the hadith of buhari word number eight book of adam book of manners chapter number two hadith number 5971 where a man comes and asks the prophet who deserves the maximum love and compassion the prophet said your mother your mother your mother and then the father so here the mother gets three times more love and compassion from the children as compared to the father so here the mother has a degree of advantage but for example if a robber enters my house if a thief enters my house i'll not tell my wife and my daughter go and fight i believe in women's rights allah says in the quran into surah chapter number 4 verse number 34 allah has given most trend to the men as compared to the women so it's my need you to fight one degree additional responsibility in supporting her have ever men objected that why can't i give birth to a child that's the prerogative of the female why don't the men object that why can't i best feed the child that's the program or the female so depending upon the biological makeup depending upon the physiology you can make up depending on psychological makeup almighty god has given different roles for the men and women sometimes the men have a degree advantage sometimes women never give advantage overall men and women are equal that's the reason if you analyze the women's rights in islam based on quran and authentic hadith you have no option but to agree that the women in islam they are protected and they are not subjugated alhamdulillah you"
