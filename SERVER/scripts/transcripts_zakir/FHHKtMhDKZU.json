  "title": "Can we say Ramadhaan Kareem? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question my name is regarding can a muslim wish another muslim with ramadan mubarak is it permitted is it a sunnah is it prohibited normally the prophet whenever the month of ramadan approached he used to inform the people it's mentioned say bihari volume number three hadith number one eight nine nine that the beloved what muslim said that ramadan is the month in which the gates of heavens are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained the various other hadith in which the prophet used to inform the sahabas that ramadan is the month in which fasting has been prescribed and there are various blessings in it and the gates of heaven opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devil is chained and anyone who doesn't benefit from this month is in loss so the prophet and the sabbath used to inform each other so there is no problem at all in a muslim wishing and then the muslim ramnan kareem or ramnan mubarak though these words specifically were not used at the time of the prophet by himself or the sabbath but it is muba it's optional but to inform about ramadan it is mustaf to your other muslim brother the other muslim sisters it's mustafa but these words specifically ramadan kareem or mubarak were not used by the prophet but there is no harm at all it is muba but greeting each other and informing about this blessed month is a muslim it's a sunnah act hope the answers"
