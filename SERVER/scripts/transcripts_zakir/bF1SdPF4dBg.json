  "transcript": "can we move on to the mic behind for the ladies yes kindly state your name your profession and your question briefly my name have to be keep secret for a few reasons and I hope my face is not recorded I'm a student and to Dr Zaki Nai first of all I'm sorry because you are the person I hated the most a few years back before I became a Muslim I really don't like you I really hate you and when any of my friends try to praise you I will make sure I done great you so my question to you today is despite of all these kind of hatred of others towards you how do you continue doing this that word to the entire nation people and everyone and one more thing Dr Zaki I would like to sincerely say I'm sorry for all the hatred in the past sister asked a very good question she said that previously in the past you used to hate me and she used to speak against me and anyone who praised me is to attack them and attack me and I believe that now she is a Muslim and she's apologizing for that sister first I'd like to say that thank you for giving me all those hatred because when a person truly hates someone and he believes in it but if he's logical inshallah there are chances they will come to the true part and I'll give you a very good example the best example I can give you is he was the second caliph of Islam he was one of the stock Prophet Muhammad Islam so much so that Prophet Muhammad sallam did Dua to Allah that give hidayah to one of the umarain out of the tumor give her that to one and Allah gave his eye to um and when the person used to hate Islam they to kill in the name of Islam when he accepted Islam he was one of the staunchest supporters of Islam inshallah you will be one of the staunchest supporters of Islam inshallah and a beloved Prophet Muslim said that once a person accepts Islam all his or her previous sins are washed away all the negative is washed the more bad they did that much positive they gave that may the person before they before accepting Islam the more evil he did he was so far away from the Deen when he accepted Islam that the negativity all becomes positive means the more you abuse me or Islam inshallah you will get that many positive point of the except Islam inshallah regarding a mean question that how do I when there are many people who are hating me how do I get foreign 100 000 million so as to think okay first when I started out of 101 percent there was my enemy so 100 people one person enemy one thousand there'll be ten enemies when million one person or million in ten thousand ten thousand enemy so yes my popularity is increasing and percentage by the enemy is increasing that was my understanding which I was wrong when we do the analysis of the seed of Allah we come to know that when he started preaching Islam five of them accepted Islam there were no enemies as he kept on growing spreading the truth the enemies increased today the person who is the most influential in the world it is not only agreed by the Muslims living by non-muslim Michael a chart in his book The Hundred most influential people he puts our Nabi Curry is number one number one most influential human being in the world do you know the person against whom the maximum written the person who's criticized most today in the world who is it who's that person who is it who is the person today in the world who's criticized the most who's attacked the most who is it who is it sorry can't hear you Donald Trump how many books are against him today the person who's the most attacked and hated in the world by the enemies of Islam that to every Prophet we have appointed the enemy and since prophet Muhammed in the last prophet he has to have enemies I told the presence of Arun Suri in India proves that the Quran is right if people like Arun surely you write books against Islam did not exist in the world the Quran has been proved wrong Quran says for every Prophet we have appointed enemy so then I realized the more you spread the truth and people start liking you the enemies start hitting you alhamdulillah when I did a little bit of survey in the in the website mashallah the following kept on increasing it is all because of Allah I'm nothing I don't deserve it not even point zero zero one percent of it we started it increased and as Dempsey said now it is alhamdulillah 17.5 million on the Facebook is the largest and religious personality with the Muslim Christian or Hindu the second is a Christian Joel oysten 16.9 million but when you go on the net and when I added a survey out of every 10 website at least two websites against me maybe twenty percent it may increase you know the followers are 1.8 billion maybe 2 billion some non-muslim loving but yet the people hitting him AMU today the books written against him and that reminds me of a scholar that you asked me the question how many people hate to White continues there's a scholar who's who quoted that the second caliph of Islam Allah created a sect S one scholar said the reason Allah created a sect s so that more because he will get reward so in the way Allah is rewarding him when a person does the the word of Truth people speak against him it will be converted on the day of judgment in the favor because anyone who criticizes me speaks against me and it's in the wrong on the day of judgment his good deeds will come to me when his Good Deeds end my bad needs to go to him so though I don't want anyone to trust me but when they curse me because of the teachings of Islam and a beloved Prophet Muhammad sallam it makes me Aston chadai and the more you spread you'll have to get difficulties Allah says in the Quran chapter number two verse number 155 surely we will test you with fear and hunger with loss of life and goods and what you have earned or toiled for Allah will test you Allah will test you with fear and hunger and we find that more difficult the test more is the higher reward in akhara and our beloved Prophet Allah said all the ambias all the messengers were tested much more than any other non-messenger in the world so more difficult the test higher the reward and today it's only because of Allah and I left my profession Al I'm a fool I left my medicine profession and because I became from Doctor of a body to doctor of a soul they called me a fool because when I wanted to become a doctor I thought it was the best profession in the world to to serve the sick people it is a good profession but when I found a better profession of a die I gave up my medical profession to become Adai thought of I'm sure if I were the doctor I wouldn't have come here in Polish to hear me there are enough people we did for the sake of Allah Allah gives you multiple times more and today the problem because we're spreading the truth there are people against us there are people accepting Islam in large numbers alhamdulillah peace TV today the network has more than 200 million viewers every day hundreds of non-muslims accepting Islam this doesn't go down the throat of the enemies of Islam whether it be the Western countries whether it's the country where I was born in India they don't like it I like the constitution of my country India it is one of the few countries in the world we give the citizen the right to preach practice and propagate the religion I did not break a single law of the country but because of a spreading peace I was giving solution for Humanity all the people who don't like peace to Prevail they don't like me so move this drive against me I am striving harder to spread the message of Allah the more difficulties they put to me thinking that they will they will maybe make me break down it is making me a more firm die because you know the many people to attack them they threatened him that they will put him in jail and they threaten him that they will kill him they will Exile him and I say that I am nothing I'm nowhere compared to him I'm just .001 and I say the same thing what he said that what can you do if you Exile me contemplate on the creation of Allah if you execute me I will become a Shaheen my Jannah is in my heart they cannot take my Jannah away from me I either die of Islam looks at the seera of the prophet of Allah the more they attack the Prophet The Prophet was kind the prophet was compassionate we are no way close to the prophet but we as thy we cannot that repel evil with goodness you may never know who's your enemy he will become your friend and you are one of the best examples for the Fulfillment of this verse of the Quran chapter 41 verse number 34 that repel evil with goodness the person who the enemy will become your friend and sister I only Quran and they say Hadith to the best of my ability and the more you follow because our main goal and my lecture tomorrow the purpose of our life you should hear that what is the purpose of a life so if your purpose of our life is this Dunya is nothing you strive for the Allah will give you Duniya and I pray to Allah that me he make me serve Islam as much as I can though Allah doesn't require me utilize Every Breath of my life to spread the Deen to the best of my ability hope to answer the question thank you Dr Zaki for everything and I hope you forgive me sister I've already forgiven you and I pray for you and I pray that Allah has more people like you coming close to Islam inshallah"
