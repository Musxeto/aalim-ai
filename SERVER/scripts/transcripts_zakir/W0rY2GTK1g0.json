  "title": "Hajj-e-Badal its conditions and the reason behind stoning the Jamaraat? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my question is regarding hajj can a person who \nhas not yet performed hajj do haje badal or not   what is hajibadal and the second question is posed \nby a non-muslim regarding the rituals in the hajj   when we throw stones what is the relevance of that \nand does in any way shaitaan get affected by those   stones or not i mean this was one of the thing \nand in that act there are lots of people who die   i mean what is the answer to that as well as in \nthe first part that was the question that a person   who has not performed hajj and since hajj is far \ncan you do [ __ ] badal first question the second   question is that when we stone the jamarath does \nthe satan does the devil get hurt and don't people   get killed so what's the reason as far as the \nfirst question is concerned that can a person who   has not done hajj du hajj no they cannot do hajje \nbadal means doing hajj on behalf of somebody else   maybe the person is alive he may be sick he \nphysically cannot perform all the rituals of hajj   so surely he can say that \nhere i'm giving you money   just because i am physically not \nfit i am asking somebody else to go   as far second part of the question is concerned \nthat when we stone the jamurath does the devil   get hurt so you have to realize that when we \nstone the jammarat it is not that physically   we are causing a damage to the satan it is \nsymbolic that means we are against the devil   that is there and we know that the devil \nalways strives to take us on the wrong path   so when we are stoning the jamarath we actually \nsymbolically agreeing that we are against the   devil and we want to fight against him because \nhe's an award enemy to us as per the last part   is concerned that while showing the genres many \npeople etc that's the reason the government   is making facilities the government is giving \nmore facilities where people can stone and yet   they may not be a stampede etc but if you analyze \nbrother previously when people used to go for hajj   maybe 50 years back 100 years back 200 years back \nmore people used to die as compared to today today   about two and a half million perform hajj every \nyear on average two and a half million people   perform hajj every year previously it was less \nthan a million if you go back more it was less   than 100 000 people yet when we went for hajj \nsuppose living in india we had to go by ship   it would take months to do hajj now you can \ngo for it and come back even in six days time   minimum even less than that on average they take \ntwo weeks to three weeks so that they want to go   to madina et cetera and stay in makkah for longer \nperiod but the minimum requirement can be done   in a few days previously take months and whenever \npeople used to go five days to meet the relatives   and there was an understanding maybe we will \nnot return back maybe chances not that they   won't return for sure but chances are they \nwhether 20 percent they will not return back   30 percent or 40 whatever it is but now if we \nanalyze the two and a half million people going   and the total number of people dying for whatever \nreason it is 0.001 it will be less than 0.1   so compared to before now the facilities are \nmuch better as far as the toilets are there   mashallah very hygienic compared to before but \nnow we don't want even a single person to die   so if any one person also dies for any reason \nbecause of overcrowding or stoning the jamaraj   the government of saudi arabia is trying its best \nto curtail it down and when non-muslim experts   when they hear about the facility that the \ngovernment is giving they say it is impossible   logically and scientifically it's impossible \nthat two and a half million people are gathering   together in arafat meena and performing the \nrituals without hundreds of thousands of people   dying they say it's impossible yet alhamdulillah \nwe see that every year the hajj is being performed   there have been occasions where there was some \nfire took place and fewer people expired there   was a tunnel that caved in but yet if we see the \npercentage it is very negligible so even in jamrat   now the government has made a flyover and have \nextended the genre so that we can stone from   the ground flow as well as first level now our \nsecond level has come and more will keep on coming   so they're trying to level best and see to it \nthat people come and do what is required in   the religion without being hurt and when people \ngo for hajj there they see millions of people   going together people dressed up in two pieces \nof unfold cloth preferably white there we see   the real brotherhood people from america canada \nuk singapore malaysia india pakistan uae gulf   countries they dressed up in two pieces of unsewn \nwhite cloth preferably you cannot identify the   person standing next to you is a king or a popper \nwith the rich or poor all look similar so here we   get the universal brotherhood and practical demon \nstate so we perform hajj because it's one of the   pillars of islam it's a further the commandment \nof one language result hope to answer the question"
