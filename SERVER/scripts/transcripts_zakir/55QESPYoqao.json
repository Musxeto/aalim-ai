  "title": "Is giving Zakaat Restricted to Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yes brother zakat is should it be given only during Ramadan or can it be given throughout the year is there any uh specific period let me ask the question that can zakat begin any time of the year or should be given only namdan the basic rule is that any rich person who has more than a sub level more than 85 grams of gold a saving for more than one year then if that saving remains with that person then applicable so moment you have that saving of more than the sub level more than 85 grams of gold if it's for more than one year if you save it whether the saving starts in January December or April movement is with you for a period of more than one year then applicable and it can be given any time of the year but for convenience it will be difficult if I start calculating you know this money I have with me now in January I had one like rupees in February one and a half like rupees then 50 000 added in March then again in April at three like rupees so it's difficult so for convenience what we do that we take any point of the year and most of the Muslims they prefer being a holy month but you can give any time at the time of Ramadan in the first of Ramadan you decide or the fifth of Ramana 10th of Ramadan to take a point in the calendar year it should be lunar calendar it can be December or January because that becomes the solar calendar which 11 days more so that you'll be paying zakat lesson 33 years once less so take any one point of time and since we don't follow lunar calendar at a big we don't know very well most of the people take any one data from that and at that time whatever money you have you give zakat on that now when you do this policy you remember you are actually maybe giving little bit more than what is actually meant to be given because if we have a saving more than one lunar year then applicable now once we calculate suppose the first of Ramadan so if you have suppose now 10 lakh rupee saving so you beyond that next Ramadan you have running like to be saving so you know what happens it can be possible that you may be paying little bit more zakat but you can't pay less you can't pay less because maybe when in this month of Ramadan you are 10 lakh Rupees next first off from now you have 20 like rupees saving but actually maybe five like came just one month before actually not applicable so when you take one fixed time of the year it's a very safe thing the whatever money I have at one particular time of the year it is very safe that you are at least paying the minimum zakat you may be paying little bit more means if you're saving two lakh rupees that comes to 5000 rupees if you have to like or if you're only like rupees come to 50 000 rupees so actually maybe two like rupees came just one month before so the cards are applicable at that time it's applicable maybe after 11 months so you may be paying little bit more but you can't pay less so this is a very safe system so normally people they prefer Amazon but there's nothing as such but once you decide suppose you take the cutting off point as Ramadan and then suppose the rich people have one pro two Crow property so two core property means they have to pay about five like rupees so what people normally do they can even spell it out like they know approximately like my zakat for the next year this coming year will be approximately five to six hour bill so every month that they got fifty thousand which you can do you can press the cards in advance you can even pay two years in advance he paid extra zakat he said that yeah rasul can I pay for an extra cities you can so you can even pay for one year in advance because to take out five lakh immediately in one month may be difficult so people even can say that approximately come to five to six flags so every month I got 50 000 rupees and the final calculation is done at the cutoff date most of the non-arabs they prefer the cutoff date being in Ramadan because that's easy to calculate but there's no such rule as you should be namdan but if you have one particular date you can be sure that you aren't paying zakat less you may be paying little bit more but not less so that's the reason people prefer giving charity in the month of Ramadan because thinking they get most of so if they do that there's no problem but there's no rule aside that the card should be given in the month of Ramadan but if one year is over you can't delete this suppose if you're calculating for the full month of Ramadan if you calculate the first of Ramadan whatever is due you should pay immediately you can't help it later on if you have paid Advance no problem then the balance you can pay immediately so if you say once you calculate then immediately Within a few days or a couple of weeks you can't delay too long that okay fine I'll give it after a few months that's wrong so that's the question"
