  "title": "God is Imageless but if Someone Still Prays to 'Idols' will his Prayers be Accepted? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is sundarajan basically from a Hindu religion but I am not differentiating Muslims and Hindu or any other Christian but one small doubt God doesn't have shape but even if we are going temple in Hindu where you know very well there are different names of gods under different pictures under statues you know very well my question is if I am going Temple if for example if I am suffering something problem if I am going Temple if I pray for me God will accept or not this is my question that God does not have shape but if I go to a temple and if I worship idols does God listen to me does God answer my prayer or not whether if you read bhagavad-gita is the most widely read book amongst all the scriptures of Hinduism verse number 20 says all those whose intelligence has been stolen by material desires they worship demigods they worship false god that means if you're a materialistic person you worship false god you worship demigod and further it says that those who worship false god almighty God true God yet answers your prayer but you go to the kingdom of false god that means even if you worship false god god many a Time answers your prayers so that you go to the kingdom of false god same thing you mentioned in the Quran chapter number two verse number 15. that Allah gives them rope so that they may go through and fro Allah says that Allah gives them rope to go to and fro so that they will understand so many a Time many a time even if you worship the false god your prayers are answered that does not mean that you are worshiping the correct God because many people think for example many of the people who are non-muslims they are wealthy they are leading a luxurious life no wealth is not the criteria for you to go to Jannah it's not the criteria for you to go to paradise the Quran says wealth is a test anything which good befalls you it can be two thing it can either be a reward from God or it can be a test from God any Calamity that befalls you it can either be a punishment or it can be a test will suppose you worship as far as God you go to a temple and you worship the idol just because your prayer is answered that does not mean you're worshiping the true God is testing you you ask for wealth God gives you wealth God is testing you that do you follow the true path or not because if you read the Hindu scriptures bhagavad-gita is called as the nectar of The Vedas the most Superior scripture amongst all the Hindu scriptures other Vedas there are two type of scriptures one ashuti the other is pretty Shruti is the word of God and smriti is the word of human beings so among the shrutis you have The Vedas and new punishers these are the highest quotation which means god is one without a second if you read this chapter number six verse number nine of that God there are no Lords you have got no parents almighty God has got no Superior he has got no mother he has got no father it's mentioned chapter number four verse number 19 of that God there is no pratima which means an image a photograph a painting a picture an idol it means a portrait it means a statue so chapter number 4 19 says of that God there is no image there is no photograph there is no painting there is no portrait there is no Idris there is no statue there is no sculpture the same message repeated even in your way chapter number 32 verse number three of that God there is no image there is no picture there is no painting there is no portrait there is no Idol there is no sculpture there is no statue so if you go back to the scriptures you realize that according to the Hindu scripture almighty God has got no image yet goes no statue so if you worship an image you're going against The Vedas you're going against upanishad so just because you are going and praying sometimes as the bhagavad-gita says God May answer your prayer to test you that do you follow his commandment or not that does not mean that who you are worshiping is correct so that's the reason you should follow your scripture and your Hindu scripture says that almighty God has got no Idol has got no image has got no photograph has got no sculpture so making an idol of God an image of God a photograph of God a statue of God is prohibited Hinduism doesn't answer your question brother okay thank you so do you believe that God has got an idol yes do you believe God has got an idol you mean water clearly do you believe in idle worship yes to scripture and you're going against The Vedas my point of view Faith only so brother you said that you're a Hindu correct yes so do you believe in The Vedas or not yes so I quoted references from a Hindu scripture that your Hindu scripture chapter 32 verse number three says that God has got no image has got no portrait has got no Idol so isn't idol worship wrong no I don't have much communication skill so that's why I could not express more you don't have to have communication skills you have to read you have to read your scripture I am quoting I am giving references from your scripture you don't have to hunt you have to go back home or we have a library in Bombay Islamic Foundation Library which we have translations of all the major scriptures in the world or you go on the internet and type chapter verse number three and read the translation it says almighty God has got no image I've got no photographers no painting so do you believe in The Vedas or not will you yet go to a temple but from my childhood or not so I am going there suppose your father believes from childhood two plus two is equal to five so what do you believe today if they stitched from the first standard or not then I will also same thing so if someone teaches in the village 2 plus 2 is equal to five from first standard and he comes to you so will you say two plus two is equal to five that is the first case of my knowledge then that is the way I will accept it so suppose your son goes to a school and they teach to pray will you say sir no problem continue will you say that no no no no no no no no no no what you will tell your son my son that teacher taught you wrong already I tell you to two plus two is four so I cannot uh put my son two plus three two is five no but if he goes to a school before admission do you interview the match teacher no no so suppose a match teacher teaches him wrong so won't you correct your son yeah I will correct it okay so that's the reason I'm correcting you I love you brother thanks because I love you I want to correct you that what you are saying is against your scripture forget what the Quran says forget about the Bible says if you read your Hindu scriptures the Hindu scripture says that God has got no image has got no picture has got no painting has got no Idol so if you're doing idle worship you're going against a scripture so what I request you brother today when you go back home go on the internet type chapter verse number three chapter four verse number 19 and 10 did the translation and tomorrow inshallah come again we're having a question and session tomorrow at nine o'clock same time and inshallah will give you the first opportunity"
