  "title": "Life After Death in Hinduism and Islam ‚Äê Cycle of Birth, Death and Rebirth in Hinduism",
  "transcript": "the fifth pillar of iman is life after death the third after first we'll discuss the life after the hinduism and then islam the common hindu or most of the hindus they believe in the cycle of birth death rebirth death rebirth known as the samsara it's also called as the theory of reincarnation or trans migration of soul and this philosophy of samsara it came about because the scholars they could not justify that how could almighty god be unjust that some human beings are born wealthy some human beings they're born poor some human beings they have been given health some have got diseases so almighty god cannot be unjust therefore they came with this philosophy of samsara based on the verse of bhagavad-gita chapter number 2 verse number 22 it says that as a human being he changes and throws away the old clothes and wear new clothes similarly the soul throws away the old material body and puts on the new body a similar message is given in behind hunker upanishad part four chap number four verse number three it says that whenever caterpillar climbs onto a grass of blade he jumps onto a new blade similarly a soul takes a new body so based on these verses of bhagavad-gita and upanishads the scholars to justify they had this theory of samsara cycle of birth death rebirth and they believe in the concept of karma that's action action not only of the body but action even of the soul based on the philosophy as you saw so shall you reap whatever you sow you shall reap they believe also in dharma dharma means deed righteous did how you live your life family life life in society if your karma is based on dharam you will have good karma and they also believe in moksha that is nirvana that is ultimate salvation from the cycle of birth death and rebirth if you have no deeds in which you can be reborn you get moksha now this philosophy they say that a human being is born handicapped is born with diseases maybe because in his previous birth he did some evil deeds therefore he's been punished in this world so this philosophy came up to justify that almighty god cannot be unjust but if you read the vedas nowhere do the vedas speak about the cycle of birth death and rebirth nowhere do they speak nowhere in the vedas is the concept of samsara they what it does mention is the punarjan punar in sanskrit means next or again and janam means next birth or next life the right translation of punar janam is next life it doesn't mean life death life death life that doesn't mean cycle of death and life punar janam if you translate sanskrit into english it means next life so vedas have got no problem in agreeing next life and if you read the vedas book number 10 hemp number 16 verse number 4.5 it speaks about the next life that there is a next life but doesn't speak about death and life death and life and the vedas also speak about swarg that is paradise describing that there is rivers flowing beneath of milk you'll have all kinds of fruit you'll have peace in ferg in several places in atharva book number two atharva with book number four book number six ringworm book number ten seven places rigveda even speaks about narc that is hell describing somewhat like a fire a torment of fire for punishment in several places in rigveda book number four so if the concept of swarg and narc is there that after a person dies he will get a reward and punishment so what is the requirement of him to come again in this world so according to the vedas the vedas believe in next life only once and there depending upon your deeds you will either go to paradise swark or nark that is hell it doesn't believe in the concept of birth death and rebirth which most of the common hindus believe and regarding the logical reply why almighty god makes some people handicapped some people healthy will discuss in the concept of life after than islam in islam allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 28 that don't you have faith seeing that allah gave you life we didn't have life then he caused you to die then again he'll give you life and to him will you return allah says chapter number 16 verse number two it is allah who has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds allah says in sula and imran chapter 3 verse 185 that kulu nafsin zayakatul every soul shall have a taste of death but the final recompense will be on the day of judgement and anyone who is safe from the hellfire and enters jannah the garden he has achieved the objective of this world for this life is nothing but mere chapters of plain amusement so you are according to islam a human being comes in this world only once and this life is a test for the hereafter and depending how well you follow the commandments of almighty god i don't follow commandment of almighty god based on that in the next life in the year after depending which ways more you will either go to heaven that is paradise or hell that is narc and the description of paradise jannah in arabic janna's translators garden is given in several places in the quran and the concept is similar that there are rivers flowing beneath rivers of milk and honey fruits of all kind you'll have pomegranates you'll have peace there will not be any sin quran also talks about hell about jahannam similar to the vedas as torment of hell whose fuel will be men and stones surah baqarah chapter 2 verse number 23 24. and many places the quran even speaks about hellfire so the concept of hell and heaven in islam is somewhat similar to the concept given in the vedas and if you read the vedas it is similar to the islamic concept that you come in this world once and next life depending upon your deeds upon your karma next world you'll either go to hell or heaven but it disagrees with the common philosophy with the hindu scholars talk about the samsara the reason they came up with this philosophy of samsara as i told you they could not logically justify that how could almighty god make some people born in a rich family some in a poor family some are born healthy some are born with congenital defect the logical reply for this is given in the quran allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 29 verse number two that do you think just by saying i believe allah will let you go and allah will not test you that even if you say that i believe in god do you think allah will not test you you are bound to be tested every human being is bound to be tested allah says allah says in surah baqarah chapter number 2 was 155 that surely we will test you with fear and with hunger with loss of property loss of lives loss of fruits of your toil and only those will pass those who are patient and perseverance that means almighty god will test you with hunger with fear with loss and property in health and different things allah says in surah anfal chapter number 8 verse number 28 that your wealth and your progeny is a test for you the wealth and the progeny your children are attached for you so in islam we believe that this life is a test for the hereafter and different people in different ways and depending upon the surroundings and the facility allah gives you he will test you accordingly for example if the question paper is difficult the teacher corrects the paper leniently if the question paper is easy the teacher connects the paper more strictly so similarly depending upon the facility allah has given you he will test you accordingly and allah says in surah anfal chapter 8 verse number 28 that your wealth is a test for you now regarding the logical concept why some people are born in a rich family some people are poor family allah says wealth is the test for you the third pillar of islam is every rich person who has a saving of more than the nisab level 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5 percent of that saving in charity every one year so maybe very few rich people will actually give the 2.5 percent of the excess health in charity majority may give only part of it so in charity they'll get less marks some people will not give so they'll get zero marks for a poor man who has a saving of less than 85 grams of gold he doesn't have to give zakat so in zakat they get full marks we think ah bichara garibadvi poor man allah says wealth is the test for you and a prophet said it is difficult for a rich man to enter jannah so wealth is a very difficult test [Applause] imagine in the year 2002 during examination a very difficult question comes in the year 2003 doesn't come so you should be happy good this question didn't come we should not cry but we human beings we think opposite you know he doesn't have wealth he's a poor man you know a sad person it is good for him the difficult test of wealth is not undergoing if he had the wealth the test of the wealth is very difficult maybe you would have failed so allah test different people in different way regarding the reply why some people are born healthy some people are born with disease with congenital heart defects allah says in surah anfal chapter 8 verse 28 that your children are a test for you so the person who's born even if you want handicap we in islam believe every child is sinless we don't believe that the child did some bad deeds in the previous birth therefore he's born handicapped we believe every child born in any family he's sinless he is not soon but he may be a test for the parents the parents may be pious people may be offering five times salah maybe allah wants to test them further and if allah wants to give you a great reward he has to test you in a higher level maybe for example if you sit for a graduation in arts to pass a ba degree in arts is easy if you pass to become a graduate but to pass an mbbs exam is more difficult but if you pass you get a doctor more honor but the chances of passing mb base is much less but if you pass you get great honor similarly maybe the parents the past people almighty god wants to give them janatay for those allah also tells them that after giving handicapped children yet do they believe in almighty god or not so allah tells different people with health with disease with wealth with poverty all these are tests of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and it is allah subhanahu wa allah tell different people in different ways that's the reason there are differences in the human being it is not because almighty god is unjust he's testing different people with different ways and depending upon the facility he has given you he will reward and punish you accordingly so this answers the logical concept which the scholars could not realize"
