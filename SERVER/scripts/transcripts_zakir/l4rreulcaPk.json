  "title": "The Second Most Serious and Sinful act that Invalidates the Fast - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "foreign which is the second most serious and sinful act which invalidates the fast during Ramadan the second most serious thing that breaks in the first or invalid of the first it is masturbation and this we get from the Hadith of a beloved part of Muslim let's mentioned in word number three in the book of fasting Hadith number one eight nine four where the Prophet said that Allah said that all the Deeds of the son of Adam or for himself except for fasting it's for me and I will reward him and further he says that the person he leaves he abstains from eating and drinking and his desires for myself Allah says the person abstained from eating drinking and his desires for myself now this desire from here we come to know it includes even masturbation so when a person masturbates or ejaculates whether by touching his wife or looking at his wife or of other reason or looking at any other woman and if ejaculation takes place then the fast gets invalidated he has to repent to Allah and complete that day of fasting and he should compensate for this fast keep this fast later after the Ramadan gets over but here there's no kafara there's no penalty because that penalty is only for a sexual intercourse here because the Intercourse hasn't taken place the penalty shouldn't repent make up that fast that first should complete and then make up for that fast later on but if a person does not ejaculate and if there is madhi which comes out fluid then the file does not break similarly this is the prosthetic fluid the madhi and if the vadi comes out that is after donation a white fluid then to the fast does not break only thing you have to do is estanja he should watch the private parts and do Voodoo the file does not break he can complete the fast and continue the fast I think that would be very useful for a lot of people living in the west and may Allah protect us from I mean following our desires to that level"
