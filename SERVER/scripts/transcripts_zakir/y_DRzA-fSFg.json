  "transcript": "foreign one is immediate 10 grams of gold or it may be one lakh rupees on the spot the hair is given the second type is part is givenika and part later on and third type is that you defer I'll give you later on I don't have the money now but inshallah I'll give it to you now if the husband says I'll give you part later on if you're given full amount the wife can do what she wants she can give it to a parent she can utilize it she can do business that's her property If part is given and part is given later on or if completely given later on if she has not received part of the mirror or has not received the full amount of mail and if the wife dies it yet goes to her that matter has to be given and whoever is a legal has of her they get it if the husband dies whatever property the husband has left suppose the mayor was one leg and the man left 10 likes so one leg from the 10 lakh first is given to the wife because that's a debt because Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number four verse number 11 and 12 that the inheritance share should be given after paying off the debts so that's the debt on the wife so if 10 lakh is remaining one like you give from that amount to the wife and then the wife gets the share also that if there are children she gets money if there no children she get one fourth that is there if a flat is there he has no money so whatever the value of the flat the value of 20 lakhs so she gets that one like you can sell the flat and distribute it so if the husband dies whatever property is balance of his has to be given to the wife and then the property is divided depending on the Sharia if the wife dies then the wife's property is divided and yet even the loan has to come in so the husband share of one like whenever it comes in will be divided according to the Sharia hope that answers the question"
