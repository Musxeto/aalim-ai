  "transcript": "the next question my name is SRA I'm a student and live in USA I had a question that I hope you can give the answer if God forgives everyone's sin what if a person do all good deeds but at exchange only wants from God to forgive El Satan is this wish acceptable if not then what the promise that God gives us that he will accept any Dua the question posed by S is that if Allah is going to accept every Dua he's given the promise so if you do good deeds and we tell Allah to forgive El will he forgive El if he doesn't then Allah hasn't kept his promise Point number one nowhere does Allah anywhere in the Quran or any authentic Hadith says that he will accept all your Dua it is your wrong concept it's a misconception that you have what Allah says that if you truly repent then Allah will forgive any sin of yours so however much big sin you do as long as you repent sincerely with your heart Allah forgive you so that's the reason that if a person sins he truly repents he ask for forgiveness stop what he's doing agree it is wrong never does it again Allah will surely forgive him but but here your question is that if I do good deeds and I ask Allah to forgive El no way does Allah say that Allah will fulfill all your duas if El would have repented to Allah and say he sorry he never do it again inshallah Allah will forgive him but Allah knows is not going to do that we know that so where is the question and you saying that you do good deeds and Allah to forgive no way does Allah say that he's going to believe in all your duas Allah will forgive your sin if you truly repent and you compensate Allah will forgive but that doesn't mean that you do some good deeds and you ask Allah to forgive this is not there anywhere and this is a misconception hope the answer the question"
