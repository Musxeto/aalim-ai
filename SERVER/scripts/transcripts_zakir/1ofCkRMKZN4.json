  "transcript": "and according to the home Department of UK when I had come in the year 2009 I was informed by reliable sources that according to the home Department of UK the most popular Islamic Satellite channel in the world is peace TV and the most watched Islamic Satellite channel in UK is also Peach TV not only is it watched by Muslims but even watched by non-muslims the same report said that the most popular Islamic speaker in the world is Dr Zakir Nik and the most popular Islamic speaker in UK is also Dr n that's the reason the home Department was requesting me that can I reach out to those Muslims which the UK government cannot but now because of the change of government what I feel it was more of a political move rather than a legal move and as maybe they wanted someone popular so that they could pass the message that we are tough against Muslims and that the reason what we feel that we have more faith in the judicial system rather than the political system I think it was mainly because of popularity and it was mainly a political move rather than a legal move and inshallah God willing we feel that this exclusion order would be reversed by the court of appeal hopefully"
