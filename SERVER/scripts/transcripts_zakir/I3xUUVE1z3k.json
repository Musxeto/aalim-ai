  "title": "Eating of Pork is ‘Haraam’ in Islam & Christianity - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh my name is Daniela and I am a Christian like since a long time I've been having conflicts with myself the questions that I would like to ask today are mostly like maybe assumptions or like things but I've been influenced from people like my first question it's about a big basically I would like to know what exactly is the meaning of Haram like uh is uh for his religion like Islam it won't accuse anyone of being wrong yeah uh it it wouldn't say something to be so wrong why is uh Pig Haram because I had attended a Christian convention and over there it was told like there was this priest who was saying that why I spoke Haram in Islam uh he gave an example saying that uh uh like the same rubbish like it was used as manure for the plants uh the plants like supposing it was a mango mango tree the mango Guru The Roots had absorbed the same nutrients the same rubbish it grew into mango and we consume it so how is it different from consuming it in pork and the mango sister asked the question that what is the meaning of Haram and why is pork Haram in Islam and to give the example of the priest a Christian priest who said that many are which is dirt and filth is used by the tree the tree grows and then mango comes and we eat mango trying to say that even if you eat the filth of the pork it may be good for someone else may not be good for others that's what he means to say so in Islam it's Christianity it's aloud sister first I'll tell you the meaning of Haram means prohibited means forbidden Haram in Islam means prohibited it means forbidden I will answer your question of the priest first and then I'll come to the real reason why Pokemon the priest give the example that man you're supposed to be dirt and filth is healthy for the tree and when the tree grows it gives mango and we eat the mango trying to say that maybe it's Haram for Muslims but good for Christians if you compare the manure which is filled for the human beings it may be good for the plants because plants and human beings are two different beings they aren't the same they are different but in Islam and Christianity the human beings are the same you may follow different religions but what is good for one human being as a general thing is good for the other human being unless he has certain problems for example if he has diabetes then sugar may not be good for him but normally sugar is good it gives you energy unless he has some problem then it may not be good for him but as far as general human beings are concerned the rule for all the human being what is good and bad is the same so you can't give the example of manure is good for some and not good for other what we have to see we have to go to the guide what does the guide tell us and we'll try and analyze what does the guide tell us the guide in Christianity it is the Bible the guy in Islam is the Quran when we read the Quran there are no less than four different places where the Quran says spoke is prohibited Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 2 verse 173 in Surah chapter number five verse number three in Surah chapter number six verse from 145 and Surah chapter number 16 verse 115. forbid for you for food that meat blood the Flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides Allah's name is taken so your Quran says in no less than four different places that eating the Flesh of pig poke is prohibited similarly if you read the Bible Bible in no less than three different places say spoke is prohibited Bible says in the Book of Leviticus chapter number 11. chapter number 11 verse number seven and eight that thou shall not eat the Flesh of swine not touch its carcass it's unclean for you a similar message is given in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number eight though the swine has clove in foot and you choose not the cut it is unclean for you similarities mentioned in the book of Isaiah chapter 65 verse number two to five that you should not have the Flesh of swine so Bible says in no less than three different places that you should not have the Flesh of swine and Jesus Christ peace be upon him said in the gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 1720 that think not that I have come to destroy the law of the prophets I've come not to disturb but to fulfill for anyone who breaks one of the least Commandments Shall be Called least in the Kingdom of Heaven that means if you break one law one jot or tittle from the Old Testament you shall not enter Jannah so as a Christian if you believe in the Bible then eating poke is prohibited for you is forbidden for you is Haram for you if you are a Muslim if you believe in the Quran it is prohibited if you do not believe in the Bible or do not believe in the Quran let's analyze what does today's reason and logic and science say about Pope today science tells us that if you have the Flesh of swine there are chances that you may have no less than 70 different diseases you can have pinworm you can have round worm the most dangerous amongst all the diseases it will stay poem it's called astinia Solium and it happens in the intestine and is very long even if you cook the food very well the eggs the OVA of tenia sodium does not die and from the intestine through where the bloodstream it can go to almost all the organs of your body it can enter the eye and cause blindness it can enter the heart and cause heart attack it can enter the brain and cause brain damage and by the time you realize you're suffering from the disease it's an irreversible Damage Done furthermore today science tells us that when you eat pork it is more of fat Building Material rather than muscle building material that's the reason most of the people who are regular Pig eaters they have got tires they have got flaps today's science tells us that by eating pork there are high chances of having atherosclerosis atherosclerosis today science tells us that if you eat pig regularly you may have hypertension that's the reason more than 50 percent of the Americans today they're suffering from hypertension because most of them are pig eaters today science tells us that one of the most filthiest animal on the face of the Earth is the pig wherever you find dirt and fish you'll find the pig there today science also tells us that pig is one of the most Shameless animal on the face of the Earth pick today is one of the most Shameless animal on the face of the Earth it enjoys seeing its spouse seeing its mate have sex with his friend in the Western countries we have dance parties after dance parties we are swapping our files you sleep with my wife I sleep with your wife do you think it's modest and there is a scientific thing that you eat pig and you behave like Pig hope this answers the question
