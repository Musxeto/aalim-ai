  "title": "Why is the Right Hand Preferred to the Left? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "so Dr zakya the first question I'd like to um draw your attention to is regarding the use of the right hand over the left which I understand is a Sunnah inshallah you're going to explain that can you explain why the right hand is preferred in such things as eating greeting and other things and the left is not uh preferred at all alhamdulillah as far as right hand being preferred in Islam the things which are honorable the things which are must the things which get blessings the things which are good are supposed to done with the right hand and the others like leading Etc supposed to with the left hand and according to the Sunnah of the prophet wasallam we have to eat with the right hand we have to drink with the right hand we have to shake hands with the right hand and a person when he wears a garment he should wear the right hand side first if he's wearing a shirt it should be right hand first if he's wearing a trouser then right leg first if he's wearing a footwear again the right leg first and similarly when a person is doing wodo the right limb should be first the right hand F then the left hand the right leg first then the left leg while entering the Masjid it should be with the right foot if you're completing uh Salah and doing Salam then the right side first if you're touching the black stone it should be with the right hand if you're combing your hair then right side trimming your mustache right side cutting the nails right hand first if you're removing the unwanted hair from the body again right side first if it's shaving the head then again right side first and if you're exiting the toilet it is right leg first and if you're putting coal in your eyes again the right side first and if you are doing Mis if you're doing then again right side first so these are the sunnas of the Prophet The Prophet has taught us and as I mentioned that the things which are to clean and which are not honorable that's with the left hand for example when you're removing your garments is the left side first removing your shirt then left hand if you're removing your tow and left leg if you're removing a footwe then again left leg and left foot first you are exiting the mosque then the left leg if entering the toilet again left leg if you're cleaning maybe going to the toilet and cleaning your part of the body then again it the left hand if you're blowing the nose it's left hand so this is the differentiation and you find several Hadith mentioning these things it's mentioned the Hadith of s bukari m number seven in the book of foods Hadith number 5376 where the Beloved Prophet malli wasallam says he says to a young boy that say bah before eating take the name of Allah before eating eat with the right hand and eat what is next to you it's mentioned say Muslim volume number three in the book of drinks Hadith number 5010 Prophet said which means do not eat and drink with your left hand for the Satan eats and drinks with the left hand so that is the reason you see that most of the Muslims who follow the Sunnah and are Pi they don't eat and drink with the left hand but normally when we have our food when we having lunch having dinner having with your hands and if you don't drink water most of the people because their right hand is dirty they have with the left hand but in order to follow the Hadi they put the right hand down so you might have noticed that instead of having directly they put the left hand and put the right hand down so that you know it indicat having with the right hand so that don't dirty the glass but Nas albani he has objection to this he says that if the Hadith would have said that drink with the right hand or eat with the right hand then that act that be right what the Hadith says of wasallam do not drink and eat with the left hand for the Satan eats and drinks with the left hand so even doing this he objects he says even though your right hand is dirty you can pick up the glass with the right hand because it's preferable to dirty the glass then to dirty the soul so he even disagrees having with the left hand and putting the right hand below he said have it directly with the right hand hand if the glass gets dirty no problem it's preferable to dirty the glass than dirty the soul this is the difference of opinion that n Alani has may Allah have mercy on him furthermore it's mentioned in the Hadith of Abu da in the book of foods Hadith number 4129 the Beloved Prophet mallam said that do the right side first while you're doing vooo and while you are putting on a garment the prophet said use your right hand first when you're putting on a garment and when you're doing woodoo and then you can use the left later on further it's mentioned in the had of Abu daud volume number one Hadith number 33 it's mentioned that Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam said that you should use your right hand for getting food and use your right hand for doing ablution right side first and then use the left side and if you're washing then use the left side and further mentioned in the Hadith of say Muslim Hadith number 504 the Beloved Prophet said that do not use your right hands for things like washing Etc have to use the left hand for things like washing Etc and based on this mallah it's a Sunnah that as I mentioned we do good things and honorable things must things the right hand and the other with the left hand and regarding the logic behind this is that medical science tells us today that the left side of the the brain it controls the right side of the body and the right side of the brain it controls the left half of the body and today's science tells us that more than 90% of the human beings their left hemisphere of the brain is dominant that's the reason more than 90% of the human beings they are righty where the left side of the brain is dominant so most of the things that people do whe the Muslim or not Muslim they use the right side but Islam encouraged us for doing the good things with the right hand and the things which are cleaning Etc use the left side and the reason is that normally most of the people use only left hemisphere of the brain because they're righty but Islam encourage us to use right hand right side of the body for the good things but even tells us to use the left side for doing things which are not honorable things which opposite so here a human being besides doing things the good things right hand he is forced to use his left side for example while exiting the mosque you have to exit with the left foot for entering the toilet you have to enter with the left foot so here we make a conscious effort for example removing the Garment normally people use the right hand they put the Garment with the right hand and remove with the right side this is a normal habit so here we deliberately consciously use the left side for removing the Garment left side for removing the footwe so here we are even utilizing the other part of the brain though less than the right side so it gives a good exercise to the brain and it is much more better for the brain scientifically also it's better what the prophet said more things we do with the right hand but we consciously do certain things with the left hand so that is a good nourishment and exercise for the brain"
