  "title": "Can Astronomical Calculations be used instead of Sighting the Moon? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "is one allowed to use astronomical evidence um to site the moon um after all isn't that more accurate than using a human witness as far as using astronomical evidence astronomical calculation or computation for the sighting of moon as far Islamic month is concerned and the suggestions have been given very often it's mainly given by those people who have lack of knowledge of Islam because as far as astronomical calculations were concerned they were there even at the time of the prophet and this suggestion was not given only lately it has even been given at the time of the prophet and when we read the Hadith we come to know what the prophet said about it it's mentioned in s bukari volume number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1913 where om AR M pleas with him he says that the prophet peace be upon him said that we are an illiterate nation and we do not calculate and we do not do accounts mainly relating to the month of fasting indicating that we do not use astronomical calculation or competition as far as calculating the Islamic month is concern and he said that it's only so and so and he did thce 1 2 3 and third time he pressed his thumb indicating it's either 29 days or it is he did tce like that so and so indicating 30 days now he said that we don't use astronomical evidence astronomical calculation or competition and immediately there's one more Hadith which is mentioned in Abu da volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 2313 where Omar with him it is said that he fasted alone along with the people and did not rely on the astronomical evidence on the astronomical calculation from here we come to know that we have to rely only on sighting of the Moon with your eyes that's important and Sh he says when the prophet M wasallam said that we are an illiterate umah what do he meant was he tried to praise Us Praise the umah saying that we are simple and we don't r on anything else but the sighting of the Moon with own eyes it was not a statement used to put the umah down but to uplift the umah that we follow a simple religion and Prophet M sallallahu Ali wasallam purposely did not use this competition because he wanted to be followed by the common human being and he did not want to let this evidence of the whether the month starts or not to be in the hands of a selected few people of knowledge whether the right or wrong is secondary So based on that the astronomic evidence is not used for sighting of the Moon only seeing with the eyes is sufficient sighting of the Moon and to rely whether the Islamic month starts or not furthermore it is the lack of knowledge of Arabic and Islam that people suggest such things and further says that that word Halal it actually means to see the moon or to announce and if the moon is there but if people don't see it and people don't announce it then that means the new month hasn't started though the moon may be there but because it's not seen by the people it's not announced so it's not started furthermore the Arabic word for month is Shahar it comes from the Arabic word word ashar which means Fame that means unless it becomes famous or becomes known to the people the month hasn't started many people think that if the moon is there irrespective whether people cite it or not whether people know about it or not whether it becomes famous or not the month has started No it should also be seen by the people and it should be made famous to the people then the right Arabic word Shahar that mean known to the people then can we say the Islamic month has started so based on this therefore the astronomical competition whether right or wrong it is not taken into consideration because people should see themselves it should be announced and should be made common then the Islamic month starts"
