  "title": "I Started Fasting one day earlier than in Bombay.  When I make up for my Menstruating days.",
  "transcript": "this is a question regarding Ramadan and fast uh like uh ladies are menstruating they are not able to have all the fast in the month of ramzan so they have to color but for example like I started my first a day earlier than Bombay because I started from Madras so can that be considered for one extra fast can be calculated in the kada or I know a friend who started from here and went to a part of Tamil Nadu where there is conflicting of two uh fans like they did only 28 and celebrated Eid so does he has to do two more kalas or like can you explain about that despite the fact that you start in the month of Ramadan whichever part of the world you're in you start along with the JAMA of that area you can start from there when it comes here you end here but if it becomes more than the required for example previously normally two days only days to start if I'm in Saudi Arab I start two days earlier and then come to Bombay and then if I end with bomb bats then in the end I fast 32 so then option is given to me they cannot be more than 30 days either 29 or 30 days so if it comes to more than 30 the last two parts of Bombay like either keep or I can keep as nothing extra fast that it cannot be further fast similarly if you start in Bombay and then end in Saudi so I start two days late and it's too fast I'm keeping less 28 days so that I have to make Kaza after Ramadan so what you have missed but you can't make other before you can't make before so haven't heard of making Qatar before so that's not right so if you have missed the files during the menstruation we have to keep it after Ramadan you can't keep it before the before fast optional fast unless it is part and password if you go back to Saudi Arabia before ramnan ends so that because part of the fathers I have kept but you can't look at that before but if suppose there's a problem by the moon has been sighted and you start in Saudi maybe one day earlier and you come here and suppose the moon they decide okay fine we start Ramadan one day late and ramzan of that time was only or 28 days so the Muslims are Bombay after Eid is over they have to fast Monday extra now because I started one day earlier being in Saudi Arabia I need not keep that Rosa now because you started in Saudi Arabia one day earlier that is part of your Ramadan so if they are 30 days in Saudi Arabia 30 days and in Mumbai 30 days and if you start one day earlier and then in Bombay if you miss five days so actually the last one day that are keeping in Mumbai is extra Roda so that can be counted as do you understand it means you start suppose two days early in Saudi Arabia and 30 days was the month of Ramadan Saudi Arabia you come here and you continue and in between you miss about six five because of your Cycles but you are supposed to end on 30 so two options they have got the last two fast of Bombay don't keep or you keep too fast so that can be active is it clear so finally if the bombards are mint in 30 days but if there it is 30 days your 29 so at least 30 you have to keep so 30 you can keep if it's more than 30 then that can be counted in the extra fast and can be included less sister plus 20 . yes in a lunar month Islam they can't be 28 days either 29 or 30 so if it's 20 days it comes from we started you have to keep but if we see the moon like this eighth Moon we say oh the moon was a bit big it should have been it's actually a second day Moon so it should have been 30 days we kept 29 so that's nothing of kada for that if you give 29 even if you come to Italian one day late then nothing is not requirement of kada because I didn't see the moon to start Ramadan you have to see the moon but then we realize at the end of the month the 28 days we see the new moon it can't be possible so it's a confirmed fact that we start one day late then we have to keep Katha you understand because the Hadith of the Prophet sorry that okay this is the moon of the second day so Prophet said don't think like that maybe Allah made it much more so you don't have that doubt in your heart that we started Ramadan late you think we said one time maybe Allah made it bigger and one more thing that if you miss the new moon just by few minutes the next day moon will look like a two days Moon I mean the new moon came but because of the sun was present you could not see the new moon and you can't see it so if you just miss it by a couple of minutes the next day moon will be like a two days Moon so people would think oh no these are two days Moon we start one day at all these are their own hypotheses they don't know science very well so if you miss the new moon even by a few minutes you cannot see it the next day moon will be a two days Moon so all these hypothesis hope that's the question sister"
