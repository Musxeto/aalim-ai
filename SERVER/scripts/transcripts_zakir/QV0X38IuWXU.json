  "transcript": "could you explain which is the night of decree or the night of power as far as the exact date or day of the night of power according to say bihari the committee of say bihari fatalbari it says that there are more than 40 different versions which the scholars have given regarding the day or the date of the night of power some say it's the first night of the month of ramadan some say it's the seventh night some say the 19th night the different versions but the most authentic according to the say hadith is that it is one of the odd nights in the last 10 nights of the month of ramadan and it's mentioned in sai buhari volume number three in the book of superiority of the night of qatar hadith number two zero one seven allah's messenger muhammad sallallahu salaam said that seek for the night of life in the odd nights amongst the last 10 days of ramadan so this is the most authentic and further it's mentioned in say bihari volume number one in the book of faith hadith number 49 allah's messenger said that he once went out to tell the muslims the exact date of the night of qatar then he saw that two muslim men they were fighting amongst themselves they were quarreling and he said that so and so and so and so amongst the muslim men they were calling and allah took away the knowledge that means he forgot it and the prophet said maybe it's better for the muslims so seek for the qatar on the seventh or the ninth or the fifth night amongst the last ten nights of ramadan so you're the option given allah messenger for the later qatar and further it's mentioned in say muslim volume number two in the book of fasting hadith number two three six four obey bin khab will appear with him he said by allah he heard shabba saying that most probably the night of qatar is on the 27th night because the prophet peace be upon him he asked us to stand up in prayer in this night so according to this hadith most probably it is the 27th night of ramadan further it's mentioned in say hadith that the beloved prophet muslim said that seek for the night of father on the 21st night 23rd night 25th night on the 27th night and the last night in the month of ramadan it's mentioned in say bihari volume number three in the book of ethical hadith number two zero two zero that the beloved prophet he used to do a tikka in the last 10 days of ramadan and he has to seek for the qatar in the last 10 nights of ramadan it further mentioned in say muslim volume number two in the book of fasting hadith number 2621 that prophet muhammad said that seek for the night of father laythrough in the last ten nights but if you're weak and if you cannot do in the early parts of the month of ramadan then seek it in the last seven nights of ramadan it's further mentioned in say bihari volume number three in the book of superiority of hadith number two zero one five prophet muhammad said that the night of qatar is during the last seven nights of the month of ramadan so from various records we come to know that is most probably in the last 10 nights of ramadan that's the reason most of the scholars including sheikh hutaymi sheikh bin baaz most of these scholars they say that no one knows when is the exact date of life when is the exact day of the night of decree but it is in the month of ramadan and most probably in the last 10 nights of the month of ramadan and most probably in the odd nights of the last 10 nights of the month of ramadan most probably on the 27th night but no one can pinpoint the exact date but surely inshallah it's in the last 10 nights from that most probably in the odd nights in the last 10 nights or from this is what most of the scholars say"
