  "transcript": "Psychologist happiness is a continuous state not only of present even of future. There happiness can be categorized into three different types. The first category is false happiness. This false happiness is very short-lived and some people may consume drugs, alcohol, intoxicants which gives them a delusion of happiness. But this delusion of happiness is short-lived. The moment the intoxication veins, the effect of the d drug waines, happiness also disappears. And then there is misery. Due to which the person has more drugs, more alcohol, he then becomes a drug addict and this happiness is false happiness. The first category which is short-lived and only a delusion. The second category of happiness is the temporary happiness which is achieved after achieving a goal. You may want to come first in the classroom. You may want to come first in a race or want to win a boxing match or you want to be a very rich man or you want to become a doctor. You have a goal. When you achieve the goal, you feel happy. But this happiness is also short-lived. But it is not as damaging as the first category. Once you achieve the goal, then again your state of happiness disappears. So the second category which is called as temporary happiness is only short-lived when you achieve a particular target. You have a particular goal you have whether you want to be a rich man or you want to become a minister whatever goal you have once you achieve you get happiness for a short time after that it vanishes. The third category of happiness is the true happiness. This happiness according to psych according to psychologist and according to scientists they say this happiness is a continuous happiness and a feeling of enjoyment, delight and generosity. It's a continuous feeling. It's not temporary. And this continuous feeling of happiness is unlike the first two category. It can only be achieved on a belief. If you have faith and if you analyze the various types of belief that you have in today's world, the only ultimate to happiness can be achieved by following Islam. The religion of peace, the religion of submitting your will to your Allah subhanaa tala. Many people think how can they achieve happiness and the most common that men think is if you're rich you'll get happiness. So something wealth will bring you happiness. Something power will bring you happiness. Something that fame and popularity will bring you happiness. Something the more number of friends will get you happiness. Different people have different standard of achieving happiness. But let me tell you all these happiness few may fall in category one. The remaining fall in category two. You may think becoming a rich man by becoming a millionaire or a billionaire you'll be happy. If you see the statistics of today's most richest men, Elon Musk, Jeff Bos, Bill Gates, all of them divorced. Some of the children they filed a suit against their father in the court. Is this happiness? The husband and wife fighting. Imagine richest man. All have been all of them have been richest at least once. So this is a false perception."
