  "title": "Is not Allah Unjust to put Non-Muslims who are more Righteous than many Muslims in Hell?",
  "transcript": "the next question is from hamza from india allah says in the quran that he is not unjust in the least degree but I feel it is injustice to non-muslims who are more righteous than many Muslims to end up in hell and also it is unjust to put Muslims in heaven who are not as righteous as some non Muslims this is a very important question brother Hamza have asked that Allah subhana WA Ta'ala is not unjust in the least degree and it is unjust to put non-muslims who are more righteous into the hell and and just for the Muslim you are not righteous to put in hearing what the bread is referring to in the verse in the Quran from surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 40 where Allah says in the Quran that Allah is never unjust in the least degree that means Allah is the most just he will not do even a minut fraction of injustice a fair question is concerned that why non-muslims who do righteous deeds will be put into Hellfire and Muslims who are unrighteous why should they be put in heaven we have to understand that what is the meaning of the word righteousness and who is a righteous person for me to make you understand I'll give you a for example number one if there are total 199 US dollars divided into 64 notes the 54 notes if you total all the value of these 64 notes it is $199 and I distribute the notes to few people some get 10 notes some get 20 notes some get 30 notes some get less some get more a normal person who may not be aware of the notes and the value will say whoever gets the most notes number of notes is the richest person no it's not like that we have to see what is the value of each note in these 64 nodes one node is of $100 one note is of $20 the hundred dollar note is for a person who believes that there is only one God and that God has got no partners and prophet Mohammed is a Messenger of that Almighty God the number twenty dollar bill per US dollar did the person who prays five times a day then there's one $10 note there is to find out notes $10 note is for a person who give zakat fergus charity five dollar note to the person who fasts and fatter low note is a person who goes watch the remaining four all if you put together is 140 dollars the remaining fifty nine dollars are one one dollar bill all put together dollar sixty four notes so fifty-nine notes out of one one dollar so just because somebody has 30 notes or 30 bills doesn't make him rich if he has 30 bills of one one dollar he has only a value of thirty dollars the person who has $100 is more richer than all the other notes put together if all the other 63 notes put together will make it only $99 but one bill $100 is more valuable than sixty three bills all put together a 99 that very then the creator he has put this formula many clearly mentioned in the Quran in surah nisa chap number four was ylim 48 and certainly such up number force 116 that Allah will forgive anything if he pleases but he will never forgive the sin of Sheikh for anyone who has committed ship has strayed far away had done the most innocent that means the biggest sin in Islam according to our Creator almighty or a las manos Allah is doing Sheikh is associating partners with him it is the biggest thing and the best thing wasn't going to a spa he'd believe in only one God and believe that there is no one was there worship but Almighty God and Prophet Muhammad is the messenger for mighty God so he's the creator he said the rule we are the people who wonder were gaining that machine let me give one more example that in certain tests certain complicity question which you should pass separately like I did a medical examination in MBBS beside the theory papers we had vivos orals every student had to pass separately my vamos separately he may score hundred out of hundred in theory paper but in the way Bob was if he fails he fails examination I cannot argue this is a rule set so the compulsory paper in Islam is spite you should believe in one God and worship a menorah no one else and the first pillar that I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and Prophet Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah it's compulsory if you fail in this you fail in the test you may get as many other marks in the other questions this is number one and let me give you an example that if there is a question paper the total marks of all the answers in the question paper it totals to 1,000 miles one question is compulsory most important which carries 501 marks and the minimum passing marks the minimum passing for this paper is 501 if you get anything less than 500 and 1 out of 1000 that means we have to get more than 50% marks you have to get minimum 501 if you get anything less than 500 and one out of thousand you fail like the emission that means this one main question which is compulsory it is Tauheed it is the first bill of Islam that there's no one worthy of worship except Almighty God and Prophet Muhammad is the messenger for mighty God this is number one which carries 501 mucks then number two is Salah may be carrying hundred marks then would be giving charity zakat may be 50 marks then fasting in the month of Ramadhan that may be 20 bucks then going for hedge that may be the ten marks another maybe 100 more hundreds of more question to March 1 mark 3 months 1 1 month but if you get zero marks in the major question of toe heel of the first pillar of Islam you failed exam mission so this is a test for thereafter Allah says in the Quran in surah bullcrap number 6 in verse number 2 a logical ethyl maltol hata it's Allah was created death and life to test which of his good indeed so Allah subhana WA Ta'ala has send us in this world as a test for the earth and the rules and regulations have he laid down in the Quran any last and final revelation he kept on sending revelations the moment it got corrupted he sent a new revelation he's in the new messenger the moment it again got corrupt British and a new message and a new revelation there were many revelations sent on the face of the earth by knowing when only for tourism or India and the Quran and the last and final revelation is glorious quran and the last and final messenger is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so you may be thinking this non-muslim he is very honest so what is the mark for honesty okay maybe five months or the thousand max hi max he's very charitable okay maybe ten marks he's very kind ten bucks but out of thousand months these five March 10th mark 5 marks 10 marks to marks one month will not make him pass the examination you may be singing okay doing ten good deeds or twenty good deeds but if that one person who has $100 bill who passes in the vibra was the compulsory question the one who gets full marks in four he'd he is the person who are sure to pass the best would be a Muslim who believed in though he'd offer Salah and also give charity zakat also fast does the Hajj is good to the neighbors love people is honest for does not bribe not America Hall does No gamble who helps others help the neighbors loves his parents and so on and so he's the best maybe he'll get 90% marks maybe he'll get more than 900 out of thousand they may be at the Muslims who may not be honest but yet believe in tawheed but because they believe in thyroid they've got the hundred dollar bill they have passed in the viola was they have what 501 marks already in that one compulsory important question so logically who would be higher in the examination a person who's got 501 marks or a person who's got five five marks maybe 10 times 50 my 100 months 200 marks so what you have to understand we have to understand what is righteousness and Allah says in the Quran in surah hujrat chap number 49 verse number 13 yeah you won a so in Allah Kanako means a friend wants a virgin laughs ooh-ooh mawwaka by Lalita Reforma kwinda let's go home in illallah Muhammad or humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and I've divided you into nations and tribes so that you may recognize each other not that you may despise each other and the most honored in the sight of Allah is the person West Allah the criteria for judgment in the sight of allah subhanaw taala it's not sex it's not wealth it's not color it's not race it is not gender it is aqua it is righteousness it is God consciousness it is piety so I have you rightly said who is righteous imagine our Creator Almighty God who has given us this life who's given us the clothing the food clothing food besides the point how many of us thank Allah for the water he has given us free how many of us thank Allah for the air if we don't get for a few minutes we will die how many of us so imagine if we are going to associate partners with the Creator who has given us all the facilities in life who's given us the body was even at health who has given us food to eat here enough clothes and then you say you're righteous the biggest thing you can do is a it partners with him you worship somebody else beside the Creator so what you have to understand what is righteousness is very important you have to understand that very clearly so if you understand this what is righteousness you will come to know and you will realize that who should get more marks so if you know this then insha'Allah you'll never object to the Justice of a masked man I hope the answer the question"
