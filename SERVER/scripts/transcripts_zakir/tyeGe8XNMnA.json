  "title": "The Most Concise Definition of Allah in the Quran - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the concept of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala and regarding the concept of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala the best reply that any Muslim can give you the shortest and the best and the most concise definition of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala is given in the glorious Quran by Allah himself in surahlas chapter number 112 verse number 1 to4 where Allah says say He is Allah one and only. Allah Allah the absolute and eternal. He begget not nor is he begotten. There's nothing like him. This is a four-line definition of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala given in the glorious Quran. Any person says so and so candidate is God. And if that candidate fits in this four-line definition, we Muslims have no objection in accepting that candidate as God. First is say Allah one and only. Second is Allah Allah the absolute and eternal. Third is he begget not nor is he begotten. And the fourth is the most stringent. There is nothing like him. The moment you can compare God to anything in this world, he's not God. This suras is the touchstone of theology. Theo means God, logic mean study, theology mean study of God. Touchstone as many of you will be aware that if you want to buy or sell jewelry, gold jewelry, and you want to know how pure is the gold, so you take it to a goldsmith. He takes this touch stone and he rubs the jewelry against the touchstone and observes the color and tells you that this is 24 karat gold or he may tell you it is 22 karat gold or he may say it is 18 karat gold or he may say it is not gold at all because everything that glitters is not gold. So surahlas is the touchstone of theology. If any human being says that so and so person is God or so and so candidate is God. If it fits in this definition of suras we Muslims have no objection in accepting that candidate as God. Let me give an example that there are some human beings who consider Bhagwan Rajnish to be God. You may have heard the name of Bhagwan Rajnes. He was very famous. He was from India from the country where I come. So there are some human beings who think he's God. So let us put this Bhagwan Rajnes to the test of suras. The first is say Allah one and only. Was Bhagwan Rajnish the only man who claimed divinity? We have thousands of them and many from the country where I come India. He's not the only one. The second test Allah Allah the absolute and eternal was raish absolute and eternal. When we read his autobiography we come to know he was suffering from astama from diabetes malitis from chronic backachche. Imagine almighty god suffering from aama from diabetes malitis from chronic backachche. Third test, he begget not nor is he begotten. We know from his biography that Rajnes had a mother and a father. He was born in Jabalpur, Mhyra Pradesh. And later on in 1981 he goes to America and in a village by the name of Oregon he starts his own village called as Rajnish Puram and he takes thousands of American for a ride. Later on the American government arrest him and puts him behind bars. Rajnes claims that the American government gave me slow poisoning. Imagine almighty God being slow poisoned. In 1985 they kick Rajnesh out of the country US and he comes back to India and in the state of Maharashtra in the city of Punea he starts his new center there Oshoku commamune and if you go there it is mentioned on samadhi. Samadis when the Hindus when they when they burn when they cremate the body nash are kept there and on the stone it's mentioned oh show the dashnish never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990 never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990. They forgot to mention on the samadi he was not given visas to 21 different countries of the world. Imagine almighty god coming in this world to visit the world and he requires visas and the archbishop of Greece said if you don't remove rashes from this country we will burn his house and the house of his disciple and the last test there's nothing like him is so stringent that no one besides Allah can pass the moment you can compare Allah to anyone in this world he's not God."
