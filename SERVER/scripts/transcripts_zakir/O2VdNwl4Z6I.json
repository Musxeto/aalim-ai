  "transcript": "next question is from sameer from kerala india sir one atheist has asked that can god create a heavy rock that he himself cannot lift this is a common question that was asked to me also in my school days and my college days that can god create a rock which you cannot lift to reply to this question i normally ask that atheist that do you know how to drive and say this i know drive a car can you take a left turn whenever i tell you whenever you tell me i can take a left one you know driver yes can you take a right turn whenever i tell you yes whenever you tell me i can take a right turn the person is expert in driving a car i should be the expert in riding a motorcycle okay tell him can you take a left turn whenever i tell you when you come at a crossroad yes i can take a left turn whenever you tell me whenever i come at a crossroad if you come at a crossroad if i tell you right the wheel decider he said yes i can take the right turn i said okay now good now when you come at a crossroad take a left right turn the atheist will say what is the left right turn take a left right turn he will say i cannot take a left right just now you told me you can take a left one whenever i tell you you can take a right turn whenever i tell you not take a left right turn then you understand what i'm telling him is in logical yes he can take a left hand whenever he wants he can take a right hand whenever he wants but left and right are two opposing things you cannot do at the same time so if you are stan god create anything he said yes god can't get anything can he lift anything and everything yes he can lift anything and everything can he create a rock which he cannot lift it is illogical yes god can create whatever he wants yes he can lift whatever he wants now you're telling can god create a rock which he cannot lift so as they say why don't you take a left right turn it's like telling that can god create a tall shorter man yes god can create tall man he can create a short man can he get tall short man there are two opposing things that meaningless can god make a fat thin man god can make a fat man god can make a thin man god can make a fat man into thin man he can make a thin man into a fat man but fat thin man these are illogical things so the question is illogical the atheist doesn't know the qualities of god yes this question can be asked to a human being no problem because the human being cannot create everything a human being cannot lift everything so if this question is asked to a human being it makes sense but the atheist doesn't know the concept of god that the reason is asking this question so i ask that it's yes can you take a left and he said yes can you take a right i said yes kendrick a left right turn he says no so now he's trapped so similarly this question saying can god create a heavy rock which he cannot lift is an illogical question so you can answer an illogical question by asking an illogical question back to the questioner and this way inshallah he will realize the mistake so allah subhanahu wa is all powerful he can do what he wants but he will not do ungodly things hope that answers the question"
