  "title": "Is Alcohol Categorically Prohibited in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next uh issue I'd like to ask you about Dr zaka is um concerning alcohol what does Islam say about alcohol does it prohibit it entirely Allah says in the Quran in Surah ma chapter number five verse number 0 oh you believe most certainly intoxicant and gambling dedication of stones divination of arrows these are Satan's handwork abstain from this handwork that you may Prosper so Allah says this is It's a Satan handwork abstain from it that you may prosper and IMI in his list of Al in the 70 major sins he puts having alcohol intoxicants H having wine number 19 in the list and having intoxicant prohab in Christianity if you read the Bible it's mentioned in the Book of Proverbs Chapter number 20 verse number one it says that vne is a mocker it is strong raging drink and anyone who's deceived he's not Wise It's mentioned in the book of Ephesians chapter number 5 verse number 18 be not drunk with wine but unfortunately we find that none of the Christians and the Jews they follow the advice given in the Bible unfortunately and what is the logic the reason that Islam has prohibited alcohol normally in a human being there is an inhibitory Center this inhibitory Center it prevents a human being from doing things which are illogical and not correct for example if a person wants to go to the call of nature the in Center will say that don't do it in the public place go to the toilet inhib Center is working and inhib Center when a person speaks to the parents tells that don't be disrespectful to parents don't use f language so this is the work of inhib Center when a person is intoxicated when a person has intoxication has wine has alcohol the inhibit sent is inhibited and he doesn't know what he's speaking therefore you find many of them they start cursing they start doing verbal abuse you find them saying offen things you may find them that they ruin in their own clothes so this is because the inhibitory Center is inhibited and if we Analyze That alcohol is responsible for many crimes that take place according to the US Department of Justice 1996 every day in the year 1996 2713 cases of rape took place that means every 30 to second one rap is taking place in America in 1996 and the report says that majority of the people who committed rape they were intoxicated further Accord American statistics it says that 8% of the Americans they indulge in incest having intercourse with the Clos relative and it says that every 12th person who come across in America they're doing incest and majority of them they're in a state of intoxication when they do incest so we realize that alcoholism besides being bad for the health it's a cause for many diseases and healthwise and even it's a cause for AIDS which has recently cropped up and there are many people who say that I'm a social Drinker and I have only one peg I don't intoxicated when you interview the alcoholics all of them when we ask them they will say they initially they were social drinkers no alcoholic starts to drink because he wants to become alcoholic all of them are social Drinkers and later on they become alcoholics and if you meet any social Drinker who has been drinking for a couple of years you ask him that how many times he been intoxicated and there will be several times that he been intoxicated with all the power that he has and once the person intoxicated and if he commits a sin like rape like incest it's an unforgivable sin and irreversible damage done and we realize that that's the reason abled Prophet malli wasallam mentioned Inn ma volume number three book of intoxications chapter number 30 Hadith number 3371 the Beloved Prophet said that intoxication alcohol is the mother of all evils alcohol is the mother of all evils and it further mentioned Inn ma volume number three book of intoxicant chapter number 30 Hadith number 3392 the Beloved Prophet said that anything which intoxicates in large quantity is even prohibited in small quantity no excuse for n you can't say I'll take a peg you know whatever intoxicates in large quantity is in PR in small quantity and the Beloved prophet he has cursed 10 categories of people who indulge in alcohol it's mentioned Inn Maja volume number three book of intoxications chapter number 30 Hadith number 3380 the Beloved Prophet said 10 categories of people who indulge in alcohol are cursed the one who distills it the one for it is distilled the one who drinks it the one who transports it the one for whom it is bought the one who sells it the one who serves it the one who utilizes the earnings from the sale of alcohol the one who buys it the one who buy it for somebody else so all these 10 categories of people they are cursed by last tala and there are various different diseases that a person can acquire when he has alcohol and today alcohol is one of the major causes for the maximum number of deaths in the world and today science tells us and many people aware of it that the various diseases the person can have the most common is SOS of liver if a person is alcoholic has high chances of having steros of liver he can have cancer of the esophagus cancer

the alcohol fetal synd syndrome they can be skin disorder like alopecia they can be nail destrophy they can be angular stomatitis you can keep on listing the diseases for hours together only because of the consumption of alcohol but nowadays my colleagues the medical doctors they say that alcoholism is a disease you know they try to pacify that don't be rude to the alcoholic no don't blame him alcoholism is a disease if alcoholism is a disease it is the only disease that is sold in bottles it is the only disease that is advertised in the newspapers in the magazines on the radio broadcast stations it's advertised in the satellite channels in the television it is only disease that has licensed outlets for its sale it's the only disease that brings a revenue to the government it's the only disease that causes violence that's on the highways it is only disease that ruins family it is only disease that got no viral or germ cause it's not a disease as Allah says in 5 ver number 90 it is a Satan's handwork abstain from this handwork that you may prosper"
