  "transcript": "for example there are many human beings who \nsay that bhagava and rajnish he's almighty God   once didn't question answer \ntime there was a Hindu brother   who told me we don't believe bhagwan doesn't \nneed to be God and I told him I never said   that the Hindus believed to be called I said \nsome people many people believe bhagwan used   to be God I've read the Hindu scriptures no \nway do the Hindu scriptures say that Bhagavad   rajnish is god let's put this bhagavanish \nto the test of Surah class the first is see he is Allah one and only was the \nrajneesh one and only was he the only   human being who has claimed to be God there \nare many hundreds and in this country of us   in India there are thousands of men who have \nclaimed to be God but will say no he is unique   let's go to the next test Allah Allah the \nabsolute and eternal was rajdish absolutely   eternal when you read his autobiography it's \nmentioned in the autobiography of rajnish   that he was suffering from diabetes \nmellitus from asthma from chronic backache   imagine almighty God suffering from diabetes \nmellitus from asthma from chronic backache and the third test is he gets not noise begotten we know that \nbhagavad-na he was born in the state of   madhya Pradesh and he had a mother and father \nand in the year 1981 he goes to America he goes   to USA and he takes thousands of Americans for \na ride and in the state of Oregon he starts his   own village which was called as rajnich puram \nlater on the American government they arrest   bhagwan rajnish and they put him behind bars \nin prison and bhagwan rajnish says that the   American government gave me slow poisoning \nimagine almighty God being slow poisoned   and in 1985 the American government kicked bhagwan \nrajnish out of USA and he comes back to India   and goes back to the city of Puna in \nMaharashtra the state where I come from   and he goes back to his old Center \nand gives the name the Osho commune   and if you go to the Osho commune \nand I've been there several times   it's mentioned on a samadhi also never born \nnever died but visited the Earth from the 11th of   December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990 never \nborn never died but visited the Earth from the   11th of December 1931 to the 19th of January 1990. \nthey forgot to mention in samadhi that he was not   given visas to 21 different countries of the World \nImagine almighty God coming down to this earth   he wants to visit the world and he requires visas \nhe was not giving visas to 21 different countries   of the world and the Archbishop of Greece said \nif you don't remove rajnish out of this country   we will burn his house and the house of his \ndisciples and the last test that nothing like   him is so stringent that no one besides the true \nalmighty God can pass the moment you can compare   God to anything in this world he is not God \nand we know rajnish like as human beings he   had two eyes one nose two hands white beard he \nwore a white robe the moment you can compare   God to anything in this world he is not God well \nthey're nothing like him for example if someone   says almighty God is thousand times stronger \nthan Arnold Schwarzenegger you might have heard   the name Arnold Schwarzenegger the person who got \nthe title Mr world the strongest man in the world   Mr Universe the strongest man in the universe \nif someone says almighty God is thousand times   stronger than Arnold Schwarzenegger the moment you \ncan compare God to anyone whether it be understood   whether it be King Kong whether it be a thousand \ntimes a million times the moment you can compare   God to anything in this world he is not God \nthey're nothing like him this is a four-line   definition which is given in the Quran in for a \nclass chapter number 112 verse number one to four   that anyone who you claim to be almighty God if \nhe fits in this four line definition the Muslims   have got no objection in accepting that person as \nalmighty God so whichever God you are worshiping   I would like to tell the audience here and \nall my brothers as well as my sisters that   whichever God you're worshiping put him to the \ntest of Surah class if that God passes the test   of Surah class he is a true God if he does not \npass the test of Surah class he is not a true God"
