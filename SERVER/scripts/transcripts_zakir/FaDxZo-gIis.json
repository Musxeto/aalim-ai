  "title": "Dr Zakir Naik Debates with an American Atheist - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "hello Dr Zucker Nike my name is Harris I'm from Phoenix Arizona in the United States I'm an entrepreneur and a marketing manager two of my friends in America have converted watching YouTube videos of you uh one of them a Christian one of them in atheists one of my friends presented me with how to deal with an atheist DVD of yours which I did watch but that didn't answer my question and I've asked this question to a lot of people with no satisfactory answers a lot of intelligent people of all the scholars that I've ever watched on YouTube in my opinion you are the most rational logical easy to understand kind of scholar that I've ever come across my life and it is really important that this question is answered because I've never had a satisfactory answer for this question uh my questions like to coin with two sides the first side of it is this and this is the question I'm somewhere between an atheist and agnostic I'm not sure where um God has created this entire universe and the Quran speaks a lot about how it has taken so many days and mountains and this and that and life is going to be a test and whatnot my question is way before God decided to create this entire universe before he decided to put human beings before he decided to send Prophet Muhammad or Adam and Eve way before he even planned about doing any of this he knew the end result of it he knows in the end he will be disappointed by certain people and He will throw them in the Hell Fire he knows they will be burning he knows they'll be tortured and as that is when they'll be repenting for what they've done way before he created the entire universe he knows the outcome is going to be bad it may be good for certain people who are in heaven but he knows that he can save those people from being in Hell way before he even decided to go ahead with the creation yet he decides to go ahead with it with all his Godly logic why would he want to do that the question if I can just put it in this manner how can God be so sadistic that he would actually go ahead with a plan which he knows is going to end up in that manner that's the first side of the coin the second side of the coin is for some reason if I believe that okay God is all Almighty and he understands everything is great God is great why is God insisting in the Quran that look at the mountains look at the protons the electrons this and that everything is so synchronized how amazing I am why is it forcing us to find his creation amazing when it is a piece of cake for God I mean he just had to say Kun and it was done then why is it a big deal if God has made this entire universe which is so amazing because for God it's nothing so I should not be really amazed at this creation he can do much more than this so I do not understand why he wants us to respect what he's done or find it amazing what he has done the brother asked a very good question and a very intellectual question that's a very good question and he has seen some of my tapes on YouTube even of atheism and this question that's troubling him he hasn't got the answer to ask the question that almighty God knows everything before he created the heaven then the Earth before he created human being even if one person goes to he could have helped hell he could have avoided that I mean he could avoid being disappointed of course I'll reply the brother said even if one person goes to hell it is as though God would be disappointed now coming to your question I started school I started school and you may have heard Islamic International School if a teacher takes an examination if she's just while she is giving the examination she writes in the maths paper 2 plus 2 is equal to how much the student in front of her or him the teacher right fire she can very well tell the student change five to four would it be just on the teacher during the test and examination to correct a student who's writing a wrong answer I am asking a simple question the teacher has given the question paper all the students for that particular situation for that particular situation the teacher can tell dear student change five to four what will the other students think about unjust but that can be just at the same time he can create a complete completely different condition he doesn't have to go ahead with that situation he's not bound by any situation but they're saying God almighty God can create something which is perfect and will not make mistake right that God has already done he created the angels God created the Angels the angel never go against any commandment of God but human being is a better creation than Angel the angels have got no free will of their own if you have heard my tips if you have not heard I'll tell you now the angels are a creation of almighty God but not the best creation almighty God created the human beings the human being they have a free will to go against God or to follow God if you have chosen to be a human being if you disobey his Commandments you go to hell if you obey his command means you're Superior than the angel because the angel doesn't have a free will of his own then he follows God it's nothing great the human beings are the better creation of almighty God almighty God has given a free will that's a different question that almighty God knows because he has he has knowledge of the future he is more Superior so he has created such a creation which has a free will the fault is of human being not God now but God has created us with that fault and he knows he cannot wait not fault it's not fault brother it is free will why is he giving us a Freeview when he knows he's going to eventually put these many people in hell why is he doing something that was a different creation that would you want to create something which can think on its own or would you want someone so compassionate peace what you want God has already created angel I am asking you which is better an angel following almighty God or human being following almighty God which is better for me absolutely if I get a second chance I would want to be an angel why would I risk correct that's why almighty God says chapter number seven verse number 172 almighty God bought all the human beings from The Lion of Adam and ask them is there one God all agreed almighty God says chapter 59 verse number 21 if almighty God revealed the Quran on the mountain the mountain would shut her down almighty God says verse number 72 it is the human being you were fools who said we want to be human beings you and I you and I were fools now you cannot backtrack once you said you want to appear for the test once you read the test paper nobody asked me that's they asked Adam and Eve no brother Quran says every human being was asked and then it is washed off this memory is washed off if the memory is away the test almighty God says in the Quran do you want to be a human being if you become a human being you can become Superior to an angel or can get inferior if you don't want to become a human being just pass even for arguments please let me complete you ask the question all right guys if you're interested I will answer sure go ahead so almighty God asked the human beings and the Quran says we human beings were fools you and I both were fools who opted for the test now once you undergo a test if you follow the Commandment after free will you be superior to an angel if you disobey Allah you become inferior to an angel we wanted to pass with distinction you and I you and I you told I don't remember of course you will not remember and even I don't remember but I believe in the Quran on the day of judgment almighty God says not a single human being will object to the justice of Allah that will come to know on the day of judgment only thing will say please give us one more chance almighty God will say it's too late because if he wants to give you a new chance even I'll have to come back in the world again everyone so those who failed he can't get only the failures so the Quran says no one will ever object on the justice of Allah they will request Allah give us one more chance almighty God is too late almighty God gives us chances in this world itself you make a mistake Allah gives you a chance to repent you repent Allah forgives you again you make a mistake all once you die it's only one so as far as the first question is concerned Why did God create because it's a better creation any logical person including you has to agree that a person who has a free will is a better creation than a person who has no free will only a question you don't remember is perfectly right when you die when you're resurrected that time you and I will meet then you will say I remember even I don't remember now but I have faith in the Quran that Quran cannot be wrong because scientifically if you heard my lecture 80 percent of the Quran is 100 matching with hands twenty percent ambiguous neither right neither wrong so my logic says when 80 is 100 correct and not even 0.1 percent of the twenty percent is wrong so my logic says even this 20 percent would be right I'm a scientific person I'm a logical person so I believe in the statement of the Quran that we chose if you wouldn't have chosen you could have questioned God why did you make me a human being then God would have been at fault but God says in the Quran he asked the mountains were afraid everything is perfect we human beings opted for this but do you remember being asked I don't remember being asked if you heard my answer even I don't remember but if you remember the where is the test imagine if a teacher teaches you something teacher teaches you something teacher gives you the book the teacher has to take away the book for the test if the teacher says okay take the book and answer where is the test after the examination is over you can go home and check or not but even before brother listen to me after the examination over can you go and check home or not in the textbook absolutely but during the examination can you check no so now the examination is going on brother once it's over you can check if you don't teach a teacher I want to see the textbook I don't remember no during the examination you cannot refer to the textbook it will be called cheating correct so once the examination is over if you don't remember you tell God what is this illogical but Quran says not a single human being will object to the Justice let the test get over so today I being a scientific person I being a logical person based on my knowledge of science based on my logic when I read the other scriptures and when I read the Quran I find Quran is the only book only religious scripture on the face of the Earth which passes this test so therefore I being a scientific person being a logical person agree okay fine this statement of the Quran also has to be right I don't remember that's the test if I remember where is the test so that answers the first part of the question first part that saying that God was sadist God did not say this for example I started Medical College I want the school students to go to Medical how many students who go to school enter the Medical College just roughly can you guess few show only less than five percent less than maybe one percent so why did you make a college of only one person can enter five it is for Selected Few same way God made Heaven Jannah everyone cannot go to General why not sorry why not why can't every why can't everyone go to Medical College because it's human capacity if humans were capable of being able to give everyone a Medical College they would that's the way we admit the same way everyone cannot become a doctor only those who have the capacity same way everyone cannot go to generate for those the high levels of paradise we have to strive God has given you capacity if you don't follow his guidance you cannot if you follow his guidance to go to Jannah very easy if you are intelligent it's very easy if you're intelligent and if you are truthful to yourself but if you are not truthful to yourself even a non-intelligent man can go to Jannah only thing you should be truthful God has given you different options how to follow him some people think they are smart I tell them the extra smart if they were smart they would see it is crystal clear in black and white that this is the word of God you have to follow it that's the reason Francis Bacon said little knowledge of science makes you an atheist in-depth knowledge of science makes you a believer in God so I wouldn't say God is sadist I said we were fools who opted to undergo the test not God God gave you an option what do you want to be we chose so we are responsible not God God is not a sadist we are fools that's what the Quran says on the day of judgment you will come to know inshallah you and I both inshallah if I go to Jannah inshallah inshallah I'll pray to God I thank God you know I was a good person I choose to be a human being if you pass that if you fail then we will curse our own self hope to answer the question the second part sorry what are the second part that even if I believe how Almighty he is how knowledgeable he is why is he so bent on convincing us look at the mountains look at the electrons look at the protons the second part of the question was that why does almighty God give references of the mountain that is created this for him it is peanuts so why is he talking you know why they think he's saying these peanut things Mountain they would shudder you human me were Superior why don't you understand had the Quran been revealed on the mountain the mountain will have fallen down to utter ruin but to us human beings it makes no difference giving these examples to show that these things which are so powerful the mountains Etc which has created would have submitted the will why don't you human me do he's trying to give an example that we are fools he's not trying to praise himself and whenever he passed us to praise him or when he says for with Allah Akbar go to the greatest do you think it will change Allah no whether you say a thousand times Allahu Akbar or a million times he cannot become greater he's already the greatest the reason we Face these things is because it is our human mentality our human nature that we follow the people who are famous we follow the people who we praise for example your mother the heart attack there is unknown person on the street who gives you the treatment and you heard that the best heart specialist in the world is Dr X now will you follow Dr X's advice or the person on the street who you don't know doctor X why because doctor X is famous people know him he's the best in the world so the reason in our Salah in our life we say Allah Akbar Allah is the greatest Allah is the most wise Allah is the most intelligent why if we say that it does not benefit Allah it benefits us that if we pray them we follow him if we follow we go to Jannah to our light makes no difference therefore Allah says will you not then believe will you not then understand that means the Quran is revealed to the people for understanding so he's giving this example not to make himself great he is already the greatest whether you say a million times Allah is the greatest it will not make a difference to Allah he is telling it to you Allah says in the Quran Allah does not require you you require him so when we pray them it is human psychology that the person you praise person you talk great about you tend to follow their wife by following your advice it will benefit you it will not benefit him he's already the greatest he's already the merciful so these are rules and regulation laid down he is our creator he knows our mindset you are a student of science correct I am also student of science the moment I come to know Allah mentioned these scientific facts which we came to know today 50 years back it increases my faith in Allah so Allah is giving these examples so that it benefits us for him it makes no difference it is benefiting us so he is giving us a chance to follow him so that we can go to heaven hope dances the question brother recognized as power and I understand he's amazing and all that that he's done but am I expected to be amazed at his achievements at creating this universe because for me for him it's like a one second job correct right so for him with a one second job when he tells you not to have alcohol if you really sure it's creation no see the thing is that he's not there to prove himself better if you believe that for him it is peanuts so will a person lie no but I'm not amazed at his creation because for him it's nothing compared to us it's amazing for him it's nothing right but compared to us a person who can create the universe when he tells me not to have alcohol I immediately follow sure I went following him but do I have to be amazed at his creation as is said in the Quran see as you ask me the question should I be amazed at the creation right I would say if I believe human being is a better creation then yes I'm amazed and then I say alhamdulillah he has made me better than that so if I'm amazed he made the mountains he made the Stars he made the Sun ah but he made Zakir Naik also he made a human being and we are the best of creation so we give this examples so that we realize what benefit he has given to us all the favor they have given to us talking about the science talking about the protons talking about the mountains finally he says human beings are the best creation so in comparison we have to agree that our creator has created the human body the molecules the DNA the complex thing which can never come by chance so in this way we are amazed at the creation of the human being and then we submit to him if you are not amazed only by being amazed we submit that he is our creator he is worth worshiping no one else can do that this is so that we worship Him and we pass the test and we go to paradise hope that answers the question if Bill Gates gives me a hundred dollars should I be amazed that he has given me that money I believe that the question has been answered and unfortunately we are very constricted for time you are welcome to come back tomorrow insha Allah as with all of the brothers and sisters we have come to the end of tonight's session so please that if Bill Gates gives you hundred dollars did I be amazed will you get a missed brother the question is why should Bill Gates give you 100 if you tell me a Tom Dick and Harry gives you 100 nothing to be amazed Bill Gates gave me a hundred dollars it's something that he gave you why did he give you one and somebody else why the question is why did he give you is a question okay if some Tom Dick and Harry gives you if a man understood give a hundred dollars Bill Gates yes absolutely that is the answer so inshallah I hope they will come closer to Islam so I should not be amazed at the fact that he's given me the money I should be amazed it's him who's giving the money alhamdulillah so it was worth the time extending alhamdulillah"
