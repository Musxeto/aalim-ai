  "transcript": "go ahead with your question brother assalamualaikum my name is Rajesh and I'm from IIT profession my question is why a religion for a peace why a religion yeah why do we need a religion like Islam you're preaching Islam brother asked a very good question that why do you need a religion like Islam or any other religion whether if you understand what is the meaning of religion religion according to Oxford dictionary means a belief in a superhuman controlling power a personal God or gods that deserve worship in Islam the Arabic word used is Deen Deen in Islam means a way of life so you asked me the question that why do you require a way of life and why do you require to understand as Oxford dictionary says religious means believing in God so why do you have to understand God the reason is that brother normally when you get a machine if you get a machine maybe a complicated machine along with the degree instruction manual I'm asking the question why do you require the instruction manual why brother to understand to understand because you don't know the machine if you allow me to call the human being the machine you'll have to agree it is the most complicated machine on the face of the Earth so don't you think this requires an instruction manual the last and final instruction manual for the human being it is the Glorious Quran like how you have the instruction manual written by the producer of that equipment or the manufacturer or the inventor our manufacturer our producer our creator is almighty God so he knows what is best for the human being so based on this almighty God has given the rules and regulations for example when you buy a DVD player it tells you if you want to play the DVD insert the DVD press the play button if you want to fast forward press the FF button if you want to skip press the skip button if you want to stop press the stop button don't drop it from a height it will get damaged don't demonstrate what it will get spoiled the instruction manual similarly Allah in the last and final instruction manual the Glorious Quran has written the do's and don'ts for the human being and almighty God has only sent one religion Allah says clearly in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter 3 verse number 19. the only religion acceptable in the fight of almighty God is Islam but by the passage of time whenever almighty God sent the instruction manual the manual in passage of time it changed knew that the human beings may not be able to grasp the complete message of the Quran as is mentioned in the Bible in the Gospel of John chapter 16 verse number 12 to 14 Jesus Christ peace be upon Him says I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide Allah knows that 1400 years ago at this time now the human beings can grasp the last and final message so Islam came in his complete form 1400 years ago and the last and final Revelation is the Quran all the previous Revelations the basic message was the same believing in one God worshiping the true God who does not have any image doesn't have any Idol you have to prostrate the basic message was the same but because they have changes in these scriptures almighty God reveals the last and final Revelation the Quran and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter 15 verse number 9 that I have revealed the Quran and I will get from corruption now because this is the last and final Revelation Allah takes it upon himself that he will guard it from any corruption so that's the reason today all the human beings in the world should follow the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and last and final message the Glorious Quran all the scriptures that came before since they were time bound they were meant only for a particular group of people they were not meant for the whole of humanity and the message was supposed to be followed till the new message came Allah didn't require to preserve that message when the last and final Revelation was revealed and since no other Revelation is going to come Allah takes it upon himself to preserve it and it's not only meant for the Muslims or the Arabs it's meant for the whole of humanity irrespective whether you're staying in Dubai India Pakistan Saudi Arabia America UK Canada all the human beings in the world should follow the last and final Revolution and the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad [Applause]"
