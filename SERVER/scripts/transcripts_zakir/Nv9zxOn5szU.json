  "title": "Is Questioning after Death Limited to those Buried? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "that's a very good question many people are confused that because there Hadi of the Prophet wasallam that after you die you'll be questioned in your grave and there's also mention of the aab the punishment in the grave and it also says that the people who are bured they'll be question you have to understand that what this Hadith means when the prophet said that after your bir it means that because today we know that most of the human in the world they are buried when the statement is made it is mainly meaning after you die you'll be question question if you're buried it's in the grave if not wherever you are that doesn't mean that if you're not buried you will not be questioned there are chances that maybe wild animals May kill you and you don't get buried there are chances you'll drown do it mean you won't be questioned no because for questioning two things are required the soul and the body the body if you realize even when you are buried it gets disintegrated it gets merged into the Earth so the main concept is that if Allah can resurrect you on the of judgment why can't he yet whether you have a body or not whether they buried or whether they have drowned whether you're created Allah can yet if he wants to give you pain wants to give you punishment"
