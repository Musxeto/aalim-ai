  "title": "Is It Allowed to Take Your Payment from a Person Whose Income is Haram - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "whether the client if he's buying from a Islamic Bank or a debit card or from a conventional credit card it is not their concern for example I'm a doctor and I treat a patient and the patient is working in a Haram company he's working in a bank he's a banker his money is Haram but I giving Service as a doctor and I'm charging him fees $100 he's paying me 100 his is Haram but for me it's Halal so similarly someone is using Halal method to pay as long as your company is halal it's permitted but if you working for a payment Gateway which is Haram which is based on interest there are certain Banks which have got payment gateways so if you're doing a payment Gateway for a bank which is a conventional bank and they're charging some element which involves RBA then it's Haram for you to work for such a conventional bank which has a payment Gateway"
