  "title": "Is It a Contradiction in the Quran to Say that Everything is from Allah and at the Same Time",
  "transcript": "Dr zakya next question doesn't there seem to be a contradiction in the Quran when it mentions in several verses that everything happens by the will of Allah in and furthermore in one verse the good is from Allah and the bad or the evil is from yourself there are many in the Quran which mentioned that everything happens with the will of Allah subhana tala as we discussed in the earlier answer but it's mentioned Ina chter 4 verse number 79 all the good that happens is from Allah subhana tala and all the evil is from the human beings on the face of it it seems to be a contradiction but if you realize the real meaning there's no contradiction at all for example the electricity comes from the head Power Station it's coming the power is from the head station and with that we can use good things we can use equipment we can use Machinery but if you put our finger in a life wire we will get a shock so the power is from the headquarters head electric station but if you put a finger and do a thing which is not supposed to be done then we get a shock so the good is from the power illustration but if the power is cut from the headquarters I'll not get a shock but we cannot blame that because the power is coming from there they are to blame for the shock it is me who has put the finger in life fire so I'm to blame but the power is coming from the head electric station let me give you another simpler example that the father is head of the family he earns and he spends on the family so he responsible for everything that is spent but at the same time he gives pocket money to his son now with the pocket money what the son receives he gambles he has alcohol so who's to blame the person to blame for doing the sin of gambling and having intoxication is the son but the money is coming from the father so it's happening with the money of the father but who's to blame the son the same way everything happens of Allah subhana wa ta'ala but if anything good takes place it because of Allah subhana wa tala any bad it is because of you so I hope this example will make you understand that there is a coalition between both these verses there's not a contradiction but it's the clarification"
