  "title": "Does Smoking Invalidate the Fast? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "some Scholars say that smoking is Haram I'd like to know what's your opinion and does smoking invalidate the fast as far as smoking is concerned several years before when science had in advance that far most of the scholars used to say that smoking is makro which is number 855 because the prophet said that anyone who eats garlic or onion they should stay away from us and stay away from the mosque Prophet said that you know don't come to the mosque after having garlic onion because there's bad breath when you are smoking the breath is worse than any nagali So based on this Hadith therefore garlic So based on this Hadith Scholars give the fatwa that smoking is macro but now after science has advanced we have come to know that smoking is nothing but it's a slow poisoning tobacco in any form rather than smoking cigarettes whether Beady with the tobacco and hookah where the chewing tobacco all forms of tobacco contain the protein and tar and we know it's nothing but snow poisoning that is the reason most of the non-muslims also they agree that smoking is Haram not only the Muslim world even the non-muslim that's the reason they put a statutory warning on the cigarette packs they put a statutory warning saying cigarette smoking is injurious to health or in some countries it mentioned general surgeons warning or surgeon general's warning smoking is injurious to health and anyone gives the ad where the newspaper in the magazine or television it is compulsory that they have to highlight the statement smoking is injurious to health so I'm talking about the Muslim world even the non-muslim world agrees that smoking is nothing but slow poisoning and today according to statistics the World Health Organization says that every year more than 4 million people die only because of smoking and if you count the other forms of tobacco it will be much more and Today Medical Science tells us and even I had learned when I was doing my medicine in Medical College that more than 90 percent of the lung cancer deaths are only due to smoking where the security whatever it is 25 percent of the cardiovascular deaths are only because of smoking 70 to 75 percent of bronchitis and related deaths are only because of smoking smoking is nothing but still poisoning it blackens your lips blackens your gums your fingertips it damages your lips your damages the esophagus it damages your stomach and it can cause constipation it can cause loss of appetite it can cause loss of libido the sexual power gets suppressed it can cause immunity to the drugs you take and it reduces the difference of your body and you can only give a talk on why smoking Haram and I've given the talk on deity laws in Islam and I've covered this topic in detail time doesn't permit me here but based on all these various research there are today more than 400 fatwas the majority of the scholars they agree that smoking is alarm and all form of tobacco is Haram there may be certain score of the certain countries including this country where I come from India they say it is makro yet but most of the scholars otherwise thought the world majority of them they agree that smoking Allah says chapter number seven verse 157 that you follow the prophet the unleaded Prophet was mentioned in your law and scriptures and further it says that this prophet asks you to do things which are good for you for you so take what he gives it to you what is lawful and good and he prohibits things which are khabis things which are unlawful things which are bad for you so what a prophet gives what he gives you which is good take any prohibits with things which are khabis unlawful you have to abstain from it this is alone and Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number two verse 195. make not your own hands the cause of your own destruction indicating they do not kill your own self because smoking is nothing but so poisoning it comes in this category something like you said Slow poisoning every puff you take you reduce your life so based on this there are more than 400 fatwas saying that smoking is Haram and furthermore this is one of the major reasons further mawla says in the Quran in Surah of chapter number seven verse number 31 eat and drink would not be extravagant Allah says in Surah Israel number 70 verse number 26 27 there do not be extravagant do not be a spent Thrift or verily a person with a spent Thrift is a brother of the Satan is the brother of the devil and we know that when we smoke in nothing but extravagance it's nothing but taking a pound note or a few pounds or taking a dollar note the green dollar bill or a pound and lighting up with fire when we smoke when we let this figure it nothing but burning money whether it be rupees whether it be dollar whether it be pounds whether it be realist it's nothing but extravagance which is Haram in Islam and you can give a list of reasons why it's Haram but just took a shot one more reason that you cannot harm your own neighbor you cannot harm your own brother and in smoking when you exhale out the smoke it causes more damage to your neighbor passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking when the person who smokes when he exhales out if the person who's a neighbor inhales the smoke it causes more damage to him than the person who smokes that's the reason many countries like Singapore etcetera the banned smoking in public places in your personal house you can do it in public places and government places smoking has been banned So based on this Haram so smoking is Haram as far as the second part of the question is concerned that does smoking invalidate the fast normally when a person smokes the smoke goes into the lung but there are some other particles also that goes into the stomach so when we smoke besides the smoke going into the lungs it also goes into the stomach and there are some particles there are some vegetable things so all the scholars unanimously agree that smoking does break the fast it invalidates the fast so when you're smoking besides a person breaking the fast he's even doing a sin and that reduces the reward and many people who are chain smokers they don't smoke during fasting but the moment the first ends after iftar they take Puffs and they he bought smoking the full night and this again defeats the purpose of fasting increasing a taqwa and if a person can abstain from Dawn to dust from the beginning of dawn to Sunset very well you can abstain from smoking from the cattle to the Grave so it's my advice the chain smoker is a very good time where they can really stop smoking and that will be a permanent part in the life inshallah for the future"
