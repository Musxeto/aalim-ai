  "title": "Can we say Ramadhaan Kareem? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question my name is Shamil from ethopia can we say Ramadan Karim regarding can a Muslim wish and the Muslim with Ramadan Mubarak is it permitted is it a Sunnah is it private normally the prophet whenever the month of Ramadan approached he used to inform the people say bukhari volume number three Hadith number one eight nine nine that the Beloved part of Muslim said that Ramadan is the month in which the gates of Heavens are opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained the various of the Hadith in which the prophet used to inform the sahabas that Ramadan is the month in which fasting has been prescribed and there are various blessings in it and the Gates of Heaven opened and the gates of hell are closed and the devil is Chained and anyone who doesn't benefit from this month if in loss so the prophet and the Sabbath used to inform each other so there is no problem at all in a Muslim wishing and then the Muslim Ramadan Mubarak though these words specifically were not used at the time of the Prophet by himself or the Sabbath but it is it's optional but to inform about Ramadan it is Mustafa to your other Muslim brother the other Muslim sisters it's Mustafa but these words specifically Ramadan Kareem or Ramadan Mubarak were not used by the prophet but there is no harm at all it is but greeting each other and informing about this blessed month hope that answers this question"
