  "title": "How A Revert Should Pray Five Times Salaah without getting Discovered By Parents - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "after my parents work hours they are always around which makes it difficult to pray without drawing attention I'm concerned that if they discover me praying it could lead to Serious consequences could you please provide advice on how I can manage my prayers as far as prayers are concerned for a adult Muslim it is compulsory that he should pray all five times Salah there's no excuse he cannot miss for a male Muslim irrespective whether he sick or going to war there is no excuse he cannot miss under any circumstances for the muslima for the Muslim woman the only two exceptions are that if the undergoing M cycle or the postpartum period after the child birth these are the only two occasions where they did not pray otherwise they always have to pray there's no excuse whatsoever under any circumstances besides these two for a muslima or for a Muslim to miss the Salah but as a beloved Prophet said that you should choose the easy path and Allah does not lay a burden on you greater than you can bear so for Salah of course you have to choose a clean place to pray Salah you have to be in W and face the direction of the and off for your Salah but there are verses in the Quran that if you're on the battlefield that you have to pray whether you're moving whether you're on a camel's back or if you're sick you can pray while lying down or while sitting so there are concessions given that if you have a problem in the knee you can pray while sitting on the chair if you're sick you can even pray while lying on your sides or lying on your back if you have problem you can even pray with just indications suppose you're imprisoned of your hands are tied you can yet pray only with indications but prayer is f as far as your condition is concerned that you are a revert muslima of the age of 18 and your parents don't know that we have Ed and you're afraid that if they see you praying there'll be problem then they are anti-islamic the anti-muslims that will create a lot of problems for you so of course there are various considerations given in Islam for example you can also join your prayers you can join your Salah you can join your M and is Salah and if as you mentioned that you can only freely offer the door and prayers and the other prayers are difficult they may watch you so if it's difficult to pray on time then the earliest time you get to pray you can pray the Salah which you have missed and in your case you can pray your you can pray very freely because the parents aren't there but most of the time during M and is and they are there so there is an option that if you have no option at all and you cannot pray because they are watching you the last option is that the earliest time that you get when they leave the house you can pray the Salah that you have missed and if there is a possibility if your bathroom is clean you can even pray in your bathroom there are Scholars who have said that of course you cannot pray in the toilet that's not permitted but in the bathroom the bathroom is a clean place if it a clean place you can yet pray there if it's clean and yet you can offer your Salah there while you're praying if you come to know that your mother is going to enter the room or something going happen you can very well break your Salah Islam gives you the permission because instead of being exposed and facing dire consequences which will be detrimental to you following your de in this case you can even break your Salah and when you have the right time you can compensate and pray the complete Salah again this is permitted because praying Salah is a but if you know that there's a danger and for example while you're praying and you come to know that someone is coming watching of course you can do some other act and you can break your Salah you can see to it that you prevent your family members from coming to know they're praying Salah all these are permitted but you should always offer Salah and for a person who has reverted or who has converted but natural pray complete Sal in Arabic is the best but the minimum requirement is Sur faat Sur fa is a in Arabic but if you have reverted you have just reverted and some people may memorize Sur fat maybe in half an hour one hour some may take few hour some may take days so going to Scholars you can even say only alhamdulillah so if you cannot say the full F even this Dua The Scholar is sufficient till you learn Sur F and Sur f is so this can compensate till you learn next maybe may take a day may take two days but see to it that the most important part of the Quran that you have to memorize is Sur fat and then of course allahar is very easy then what you say in the r or theud and these are few things which are very easy to remember and with this also you can complete your Salah you can do the Dua in your own language also if you don't know Arabic or don't know the Dua but make it a point that you learn all the Arabic the minimum that you can you should learn so actually basically if you're a new Muslim to start offering Salah you can even memorize in half the small thing which I mentioned and you can start offering Salah it will be accepted and if you're praying in a jamat follow what you see your neighbors are doing it's very easy and then not that you have to memorize long suras that you can do later on read Sur fa and as I mentioned only the few parts that is Allah or what you do in the what you do in theum with this you can complete your Salah almost all of it then you can maybe me memorize three or four short verses of the Quran maybe the three maybe these are small suras so the shortest Surah is and then the second shortest is hardly three verses is only 10 words so you can start with this of course is one of the most important suras after Sur fat then learn Sur you can alhamdulillah offer almost all of the Salah but as I mentioned in your case see to it that you do not miss a single Salah as f as possible pray on time pray in the right way that is in a clean Place facing the doing your woodoo if for example you have problem you can't do woodo and you'll be exposed no problem you can even do so there are various options and Facilities given in Islam not to overburden a Muslim or a muslima but praying is a f to the best of your ability see to it that you pray don't miss any Salah if the time goes as soon as you get the time see to it you compensate for all the Salah that you have missed and inshallah Allah will accept it and I pray to Allah subhana tala that may Allah give to your complete family to your parents so that they understand the truth of Islam and they accept it and insh Allah"
