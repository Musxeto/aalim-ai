  "title": "How can a Muslim Woman Mix with Non-Muslim Women for Dawah, If She is an Introvert? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "after listening to your talks I have come to know that dawa is an important thing for a Muslim but for a Muslim woman who is supposed to be modest and look after the house Etc I feel it is quite a difficult task and to mix up with the non-muslim women Etc and also for an introvert person can you suggest some steps how to do dawa this is another question that after you heard in my talks just come from it's important as compulsory sister important yes but compulsory means in the important category compulsory category basic question is that for a lady how can she do dawa interact with non-muslims especially if she has to be modest so many people have the misconception that only if you are outward and outgoing channel it's not like that sister there are many modest women mashallah and they are modern also mashallah and they're doing alhamdulillah but for a person who's introvert how can she do dhava sister many people have a misconception is only giving talks it's not that only giving talks are very strikes fine you can talk on one-to-one basis you can use sitting at home you can write letters you can send emails but nature as far as concerned on individual level a male does to a male and a female to a female in most of the cases there may be a situation where they may demand but naturally with them Haram but if you're focused on all the Islamic Sharia well alhamdulillah sister even sitting at home you can do dawa even if you're introvert fine you may not have the habit of speaking or you may feel shy or you may not feel like I don't know if any person who was in a more worse situation than me out of this time you're a sister so when it comes to speaking on one-to-one business as to stumble if you ask what was your name my name is that was me maybe more than earlier and alhamdulillah Allah opened up the pathways you know after I passed my medical 12 years back when I got involved in the field of dhava mashallah if you strive as I mentioned earlier in my earlier answer that if you strive into Jihad in the way of Allah Allah opens up the pathways whatever you are you know most of the people that are me 99 by nine percent those won't rule they can speak better than what I was when I started that's the best example it's Allah's help Allah helps none can overcome Wallah for sakes none can help them therefore let the Believers put the Trust In Allah it is 160. so sister you start even if you may think you don't feel like speaking you don't feel like interacting or introvert yet start and inshallah Allah will help you besides that for a lady that doesn't mean that if you're modest you can't do tawa so many people are misconception model is me sitting at home the mod is me is modest whether in or out you follow the Islamic Sharia you lower your gaze in fact a modest woman can do modawa she can do better dawa than a modest woman now that herself when she carries herself outside in Islamic way that itself is dawa and when they convey the message and they speak indirect and that just reminds me to the morning when we were thinking of selecting some Trainers for our lady teachers in voice modulation we had one of the best people in Bombay they came up and we're going to interview everything the talk went fine my sister and myself and they're basically ladies when they went they asked that fine when we come to train can we waste this is it fine or milk is due you know so they asked me we didn't put any criteria after them they were ladies they're going to train Our Ladies they are with ladies or not as per our criteria there's no problem but imagine the way my sister spoke the way we presented ourselves non-muslim professionals trained by foreigners training other people how to speak they are asking the question why because they will be present we didn't speak anything about Islam only talking about professional thing but that itself the way we present is that's not a must they were not Muslims so alhamdulillah so sister it's not that by being modest to come to Dava in fact by being modest you can do better you're in a better position and there are situations you may say that I am a lady asset at home I may not interact that much outside you can interact on the telephone you can interact on the internet but naturally with female is preferable so in this way sister you can you can send books you can send video cassettes you can send tapes Etc you can convey the messages to Muslim friends and ask the Muslim friend if you're not Muslims you ask a Muslim friend that do you have a non-muslim to require any question on Islam no problem ask a Muslim friend that do they have non-muslim friends they have queries simple Allah will open up the pathways and once you start inshallah help you but you have to make a beginning don't wait for tomorrow start immediately hope that's the question"
