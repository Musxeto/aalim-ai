  "transcript": "elders and my dear brothers and sisters i welcome all of you with islamic greetings mercy and blessings of allah of almighty god be on all of you the topic of this evening's talk of mine is the quran and modern science compatible or incompatible the glorious quran is the last and final revelation of allah of almighty god which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him for any book to claim that it is the word of god for any book to claim that it is a revelation from allah it should stand the test of time previously hundreds and thousands of years back it was the age of miracles and alhamdulillah the glorious quran is the miracle of miracles later on more than a thousand years back it was the age of literature and poetry when the quran was revealed and alhamdulillah muslims and non-muslim scholars alike they claim the glorious quran to be the best arabic literature available on the face of the earth and allah subhanahu wa gives the challenge of the glorious quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 23 and 24 which says and if you end out as what we have revealed to our servant prophet muhammad peace be upon him from time to time then produce a surah somewhat similar to it and call forth your helpers and witnesses if there are any besides allah if your doubts are true for illumi and if you cannot valance of allu and of assurity you cannot then fear the fire whose fuel is men and stones which is prepared for those who reject faith here the quran gives a challenge they try and produce a surah somewhat similar to it and the shortest surah is hardly three verses hardly a few words no one has done it so far and no one inshallah till eternity will ever be able to do it but today suppose a religious scripture in a very poetic fashion says that the world is flat will a modern man believe in it but naturally no because today is not the age of literature and poetry today is the age of science and technology"
