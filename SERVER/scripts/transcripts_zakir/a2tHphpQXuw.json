  "title": "Rights of a Wife in Islaam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "now we'll discuss the rights of the wife in islam most of the other religions besides islam they consider the woman as an instrument of the devil but the quran refers to the woman as a mahasana masana in arabic means a fortress against the devil because the pious woman who's on the straight path she prevents the husband from deviating and going on the wrong track and keeps him on the sarathur mustakin therefore she's called as mahasana a fortress against the devil 21 refers to marriage to nikah as a sacred covenant it's a sacred covenant a sacred contract between the husband and wife the quran says chapter number 30 verse number 21 that we have created for you mates from amongst yourselves so that you may live with them in tranquility and he has put love and mercy between your hearts the beloved prophet it's mentioned say muhamm volume number seven in the book of nika chapter number three hadith number 5066 the beloved prophet said o young people whoever has the means to get married should get married the beloved prophet also said there is no monasticism in islam and the prophet said anyone who marries he completes half his deen once during question also time there was a person who asked me that does it mean that if i marry twice will i complete my full deen what did the prophet mean when he said that marriage completes half your deen marriage prevents you from promiscuity from fornication from homosexuality only if you marry do you have an opportunity to be a husband or a wife only if you marry do you have an opportunity to be a father or mother which are very important duties in islam so irrespective whether you marry once or twice you only complete half yaddin in islam for a marriage to solomonise taking the permission of both would be husband and wife the man and the woman is equally important the quran says in surah nisa chapter number 4 number 19 do not inherit the woman against their wishes this hadith is mentioned in sai buhari number seven book of nica chapter number 43 hadith number 5138 a lady by the name of khanzap in the khadim al ansaria she approached the prophet and said that my father has married me to a person against my the prophet he nullified the marriage there's another hadith which is mentioned in humble hadith number 2469 where the lady approaches the prophet and says that my parents have forced me to marry a man against mavishes and the prophet said she has the option of either continuing the marriage or nullifying the marriage does the similar hadith is the same hadith a woman approaches the prophet and tells her that my parents have forced me to marry against mavishes and the prophet says you can either continue the marriage or you can nullify the marriage and the woman says i continued the marriage but i wanted the woman to know that the parents cannot force their daughters to marry someone who they don't like the quran says in surah chapter 2 verse number 228 that the women have rights similar to those against them on terms equitable but the men have a degree of advantage based on this verse of the quran men and women are equal except in leadership the quran clearly says that the women have rights those similar to them on terms equitable but the men have a degree of advantage now many of the muslims they misunderstand this ending phrase that the men have a degree of advantage and they think that men are superior and they call the verse of the quran that the men are superior to the woman so allah said the men have degree of advantage the men are superior what they're quoting is the verse of the quran which was recited by a wonderful khari from surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 34 which says that the men are the kawam of the woman what is the meaning of the arabic word kawam kawam comes from the root what akama which means to stand up for how we have akama before salah we stand up for salah so this arabic word kawam means the men have one degree of additional responsibility and one degree additional service towards the woman not one degree of superiority to boss over the woman and if you read the tafseer of tabari say the arabic word quran means one degree of additional responsibility because if you read the verse ahead the verse says that allah has given men more friend than the woman so because of that advantage it's the duty of the men that they should take care of the woman they should not boss over her furthermore quran says in sura nisa chapter number 4 verses 19 that treat your wives with equity and kindness even if you dislike her means even if you don't like your wife yet treat her with love and compassion and treat her kindly even if it is like her even if it is like her treat her with kindness and compassion and in islam we do not consider calling the woman as housewives housewives you know housewife if you analyze means she is married to the house in islam we don't consider our women they are married to the house to be called housewives you know in english we have what is their profession housewife we in islam prefer calling the women as homemakers because they make the home they build the home so inshallah i believe that the ladies from now onwards when they have to fill any form instead of writing the profession if they are not right housewife that's english technology they are marrying you to your house prefer mentioning homemaker because the woman builds the home they make the home and in islam a woman is not married to a master to be treated like a slave she is married to an equal and the role is that of partnership and quran gives a very good phrase in surah chapter number 2 verse 197 may almighty god says that they are your garments and you are the garments that means your wives are your garments and you are the garments of your wives what is the role of garment the role of the garments is to beautify to conceal to protect the husband and wife they conceal each other's faults they beautify each other they help each other it is a role of hand and glove"
