  "transcript": "my name is buddy panila i'm a filipino and a christian i just want to ask doctor regarding this uh maryam maryam gave birth to jesus right i just want to know if it is mentioned in quran how was jesus given to maryam is it mentioned in quran that's all doctor our christian filipino brother has asked a good question he wants to know about mariam salam how did she give birth to isa al-salam and what does the quran speak about that yeah brother if you read the quran there is a full chapter called surah maryam chapter by the name of mary mary he was the mother of jesus christ peace be upon him if you read the bible out of the 73 books of the bible out of all the 66 books of the bible there is no book by the name of mary or maryam yes yes let us know but if you read the quran if you read the quran there is a chapter by the name of maryam that is mary the mother of isaal and the quran says in sula imran chapter number 3 verse number 42 it says behold the angel said o mary in allah that we have chosen thee and purified thee and chosen thee above the woman of all nations imagine this verse of the quran was revealed to an arab sallam which says that allah has chosen a jewish woman a woman above all the other women and purified you know actually it is bad marketing the jews were against arabs and the audience of muhammad sallallahu salman arabs now mohammed sallallahu is saying that almighty god has chosen a jewish woman maryam mother mary as a woman above all the other women this is what the quran says women above the ordinations but this is the revelation from allah muhammad sallallahu alaihi has no option it is not his words it is the word of allah that whatever is revealed to him he has to believe furthermore if you read chapter 3 verse number 43 44 45 you come to verse number 47 it says the main question that you asked what does it speak about the birth of isa salam it says that when archangel get real in suleiman chapter 3 47 comes to mind says that you shall give birth to a son so she says that how shall i have a son when no man has touched me similarly if you read in the bible a similar incidence it says that how shall i have a son when i know it's no man no it's no man me she does not know any man knowing no man here means not knowing it means knowing sexually we understand the language of the bible when marijuana says in the bible i know it's no man means does not know any man sexually when the quran says when no man has touched me it doesn't mean physical touch it means sexual touch that no man has touched me but then the quran continues allah says be and it is when allah decrees the matter he says be and it is so allah says when almighty god willed that she should give birth to a son it takes place and it is so the birth of jesus christ peace be upon him was a miraculous birth it was a miraculous birth there was no male intervention that's why we believe that isa alaihi salam was born miraculously without any male intervention further when you go in ceremony chapter number 19 verse number 28 to 32 onwards when mary marilyn when she has the child the new born isla islam in the hand people start allergy they start insulating her and they tell her that how come you have the son you come from the family of haroon al-salam from aaron how can you do such a low thing trying to insulate her that she did adultery the people started insiding her that this woman without marriage she had a child insinuating that she adultery she was speechless she could not reply immediately isla salaam from the arms of his mother he replies and says that i am a messenger of allah he protects his mother and he replies i've been sent as a messenger allah to give glad tidings on you now the first miracle done by salah salaam in the quran is he speaks when you are the infant few days old he speaks from the mother's arm the first miracle done in the bible is if you read your bible that when there was a party and all the wine gets over so the hostel is worried there's no wine for the people so he said get water and he converts water into wine that was the first miracle in the quran first miraculous he protects his mother and he supports his mother and speaks on behalf of the mother when he was in the arm of his mother just when he was born so this is how the quran respects maraella salam and uplifts her and calls her as the best woman amongst all the nations no such title is given in the bible that's the reason i say we respect and love maryam and more than the christians we love and respect isa salaam jesus christ more than the christians thank you [Applause]"
