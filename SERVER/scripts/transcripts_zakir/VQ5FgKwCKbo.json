  "transcript": "from carolina de souza on the question slip in your talk you singled out jesus as a very unique person then you emphasized how moses and prophet muhammad peace be upon him were mortals doesn't this comparison make jesus more special the question posed by the sister is that when i spoke about jesus christ peace be upon him in comparison i proved that muhammad and moses peace be upon they were mortals doesn't it make jesus christ peace be upon him special special yes but not god especially yes he's a special messenger every messenger was given a speciality a speciality like moses peace be upon him he is called as tell him allah that almighty god spoke to him so in that way he was special same way jesus christ peace be upon him was special because he was born miraculously without any male intervention because jesus christ peace be upon him was born miraculously without male intervention he was special but that does not make him god you know what people say normally some of the christians jesus christ peace be upon him he had a mother he had no father who's the father almighty god so just because he had no wordly father if it makes him god the reply is given in sula imran chapter number 3 verse number 59 it says that the similitude of jesus is the same of adam peace be upon him he was made from dust and said be it was if you say that jesus christ peace be upon him almighty god because he had no father then adam peace be upon him according to the quran and the bible he had no mother and no father so do you mean to say he's a greater god so it is just a miracle of almighty god that does not mean jesus christ peace be upon him is god neither does it mean that adam peace be upon him for god hope to answer the question [Applause]"
