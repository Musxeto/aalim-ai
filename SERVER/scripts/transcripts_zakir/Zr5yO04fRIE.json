  "transcript": "let's analyze the concept of god in islam the best reply that any person can give you regarding the concept of god in islam is quote to you sure class chapter number 112 verse number one to four which says say he is allah one and only allah allah the absolute and eternal there is nothing like him this is a four line definition of almighty god of allah any person saying that is almighty god if that person fits in this four land definition we muslims have got no objection in accepting that person as almighty god the first is allah one and only second is allah allah the absolute eternal third is he begets not noise begotten and the fourth is and there is nothing like him this surah class chapter number 112 is the touchstone of theology theo means god logimi study surah a class chapter number 112 of the glorious quran is the touchstone of theology anyone claiming to be almighty god if that candidate fits in this foreign definition we accept him to be almighty god and for the universal breadth to prevail it's compulsory that you believe and worship only one almighty god so anyone claiming to be almighty god if that person fits in this four line definition we have no objection in accepting that candidate as almighty god you know there are many false people who claim to be almighty god let's analyze whether they pass the test or not and one among such person is bhagwan rajnish you know there are some people who claim that he was almighty god during one of my lectures in the question answer time there was a hindu friend of us who told that the hindus don't believe in bhagavad-gita as god i told him i do agree and i've read the hindu scriptures nowhere does the hindu scripture say that bhagavan dashnesh is god what i said some people say that bhagavan rashnesh god i know very well that hinduism doesn't consider bhagawan rajneesh to be god let's analyze the claim of such people who say that bhagwan rajna is almighty god the first test is say he is allah and only is bhagwan rajneesh one and only we know that there are several human beings who claim to be almighty god especially in this country there are several such people claiming to be god is he one and only but his followers may say no he is one and only let's go to the next test allahu s we know from his biography that you are suffering from asthma from chronic back ache from diabetes mellitus and he says that the american government when they arrested him they gave him slow poisoning imagine almighty god being slow poison the third test is he begets not a noise begotten and we know from his biography that rajnish was born in madhya pradesh he had parents mother and father who later on became his own disciples and in the year 1981 rajnish goes to america and takes thousands of americans for a ride and in the state of oregon he starts his own village known as rajnishpuram later on the american government they arrest him and they put him behind bars and in 1985 he is deported he is sent out of the country he comes back to india in 1985 and the city of puna he starts his own center doshu commune and if you go there it's mentioned on the stone there that bhagwan rajneesh osho rajnish never born never died but visited the earth from the 11th of december 1931 to the 19th of january 1990. they forgot to mention that he was not given visas to 21 different countries in the world imagine almighty god he is visiting the earth and requires visas and the last test there's nothing like him is so stringent that no one besides allah almighty god can pass the moment you can compare almighty god to anyone in the world to anything in the world he is not god for example if suppose someone says that almighty god is a thousand times as strong as anus forstner you know honest washington the person who was given the title mr universe the strongest man in the universe if someone says that almighty god is a thousand times as strong as honest forshankar the moment you can compare almighty god to anything in this world whether it be arnold schwarzenegger or king kong or darasim whether it be a thousand times a million times the moment you can compare almighty god to anything in this world he is not almighty god walamiya kuffan there is nothing like him this is a four line definition of almighty god given in the glorious quran which is the touchstone of theology"
