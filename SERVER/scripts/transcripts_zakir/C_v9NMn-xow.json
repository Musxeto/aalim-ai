  "transcript": "the sister POS a question that is it allowed that can when you hear the news of death of a person and people normally think that only when you hear the news of death do you have to recite this it's a verse of the Quran it doesn't say that only when you hear the news of death you have tode anything which you feel which you feel is not right for example if someone falls on so you can say that doesn't mean that I'm thinking that he's dead some people think when decide this oh he has only fallen down he hasn't died so many Muslims think that you can only recite this when a person dies it's a misconception any mishap that happens any misgiving you can say regarding the question can you say that to a person when you hear the news of a non-muslim Dying what is the meaning of that the meaning of this recitation of the Quran is from him we come and to him we return even the non-muslim has come from Allah subhana wa ta'ala he has not been evolved from somewhere else Allah is his creator Allah is his Allah is his khik alhamdulillah and he will go back to Allah only even if he's a mush so there's no harm in reciting this yes you may not go there and pray for him because if a person dies as a mush you cannot pray for him there's a wor in the Quran if a person dies as a mush after he dies you cannot say oh Allah subhana tala give him J how can you so that Allah says clearly inah chter 4: 48 and Sur 4 116 that if a person di as a mush if a person is a mush Allah will never forgive the sin of shik if before dying if the mush repents Allah will forgive him but if a person dies as a mush he shall never go to jna so you cannot pray for him for jna you can very well say that from Allah he has come and to Allah he has returned there's no problem at all hope that answer the question"
