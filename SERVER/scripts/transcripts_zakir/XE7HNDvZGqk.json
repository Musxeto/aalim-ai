  "transcript": "can be divided into three categories though this is not my topic the other speakers will speak but I have to speak about it in brief so that you understand the implications of in human life is div into three categories I'll just speak one or two lines of each because that's not my topic is derived from the aric word R means Allah subhana wa ta'ala is our creator sustainer and cherisher everything in the world depends on him and he's independent of everything and anything has got five categories number one the description of Allah subhana ta'ala you can only give the way he or his Prophet has described him you cannot give your own description of Allah subhana tala number two you cannot give names to Allah except what Allah and his Prophet have given him you cannot say Allah is Al the Quran says Allah gets angry but you cannot say the angry one because the prophet and Allah never gave that name to him you cannot give the attributes of the creation of Allah to Allah you cannot say he repented like the Bible says God repented that's the quality of his creation Allah cannot repent you cannot give the qualities of Allah subhana wa tala to his creation you cannot say I know a person who absolutely Eternal No Beginning No End that is the quality of Allah subhana tala and you cannot give the name of Allah to any of his creation you cannot call anyone arim if you have to call you have to add ABD before it ABD Rim Abdullah in brief this and means that besides believing in Allah you only worship him and no one else if you believe in the first two categories of at the same time you worship somebody else you're breaking the third rule of he only deserves worship and no one else and the Quran gives this example in Surah unus chapter number 10 verse number 31 that when you ask the pagans who is the one who controls everything from the heaven and the Earth who who is the one that controls the hearing and the sight who is the one who gives life to the death and death to the life who is the one who controls all the effers they will say the mush will reply Allah then why are you deluded from the truth Allah gives a message in zuk chapter number 43 Verse number 87 when you ask them ask the mush the pagans who is your creator they say Allah then why do you worship somebody else so here Allah is giving the example in the Quran that the mush they believed in one Allah they believed in but they worshiped other gods besides Allah therefore Allah says in Surah yusu chapter number 12 verse number 106 most of the people worship not Allah without associating partners with him that means most of the human beings they worship Allah but along with associating partners with Allah so you find that even the non-muslim believe in God believe in Allah but they associate partners with him and if you break any one of the three categories ofed it is called as sh it is the biggest sin in Islam associating partners with Allah subhana wa ta'ala is the biggest thing in Islam Allah says in the Quran inaha chapter number 4 vers number 48 that Allah forgiveth not anyone associating partners with him anything if he pleases he will forgive for anyone who has Associated partners with god with Allah it is the most hinest sin Allah repeats the message in Surah 4: number6 that Allah forgiveth not anyone joining Gods with Allah anything else if he pleases he may forgive but anyone who has joined god with Allah he has strayed far away so shik is the biggest thing in Islam and imab in his book Al even he mentions sh as the biggest biggest sin in Islam Allah says in the Quran in Sur ma number 5 vers number 72 they say that they are doing those who say that Allah is Jesus the son of Mary but said Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is oh children of Israel oh worship Allah who my Lord and your lord anyone who associate partners with Allah Allah will make for him and fire shall be dwelling place and he shall have no helpers in the Hereafter Jesus Christ peace be upon him said anyone who associate partn with Allah Allah will make for him and fire shall be dwelling place and he shall have no helpers in the yearafter so this was in brief the three categories of and if you break any one of the categories you are doing sh which is the major sin in Islam"
