  "transcript": "that after studying it in that 2007 2008 I find out some quranic references and um Adit also explain it some adits even so hadits which are strong adits um that no all Muslims will taste hell they will pass through hell before they get to paradise and I being a Christian I look at it that how can I okay how can I have an offer that says go to paradise directly without a fire and one say you have to go through fire with and after that you go to paradise even some some had this even says that the prophet I heard your question I got a question is that a question just a last one to that question that some some had this even shows that the prophet himself says in some places that even him when it when everybody is born in the um fire of hell it Remains The Mark of worship and Allah will shovel some people out of it and even him is not sure evil will be among those who be shoveled out and same same water be pour on it so I heard your question I heard your question I understood very clearly okay Finish you have too long you only you have a speech here no no no I understood your question 100% I should I yes I want to answer it now okay thank you sir the brother said that I repeat your question in short the brother said in 2008 he was going to become Muslim but he read the Quran and the Quran says all the Muslims first go to hell after hell then they will go to heaven and even the prophet himself will first go to hell brother this is the Quran where does it say this you are telling all nonsense thean the reference listen listen listen I have the reference sir okay give the reference okay first of all you have give the reference give the reference where it says all Muslim will go to hell first where where does it say okay I have read the Quran 100 times more than 100 times you may not hear it in that same word but I'll quote it give me the to maram sorry maram chapter number 19 yes verse number 68 to 72 68 okay and there's another reference also but we'll start with that where does say okay where does it say all Muslim will be put to Hell 71 if you can read it and I can read from here or anybody can bring an English Quran we can read it 68 to 71 if you have if anybody have I have the Quran on my phone but if you want them to bring a physical Quran with English I can come no I'm English English Arabic got both Arabic and English both yes mistake I can check up in Arabic where does 71 say Muslim will go to well okay can you read it or I should read it from here so that we can no where where the word Muslim mentioned here for show me which ay mentioned Muslim it is talking about somebody else it's talking about the evil one who will go to hell first where does it say Muslims okay let me read if if that's not convincing let me read no tell me which ver says Muslim yes let me read it let me read let me number okay good let me let me read it out verse number which let me let me check I read which verse are you reading I to know [Music] 7172 in 7172 the word Muslim doesn't exist okay read now then let me read from that's why I quote my reference is from 68 okay 68 also doesn't go 68 doesn't say Muslim anywhere let me read let me read even I can read from anywhere any any place okay from 66 okay and man says 66 now okay can it be that when I am dead I will be brought alive does man not remember that when created him earlier when he was nothing but your lord we will surely he them and the devil and the and the devil repeat devil devil devil Allah is talking about Devils now and the devil then we will surely bring them around L on their news correct then out of every set we will surely snatch those most defense to to the all merciful no no read correctly you are reading half read correctly again that verse this is this is from read 68 read 68 again again no okay I'm reading 69 I've read 68 before 68 says so but okay sorry sorry but your lord we will surely add them and the devil devil yes yes then we will surely bring them around hell on their knees okay and I continue 69 then out of every set we will surely snatch those most defant to the all merciful correct all those who are against Allah yes so it's not talking about Muslims it's talking about those who are against Allah we have not finished sir we have not finished sir read the full verse correctly read 69 then can we certainly drag out from every sect all those who were vers in obstinate rebellions against Allah most gracious yes I this verse is talking about those who are Allah most gracious no let me continue let me read the Quran first before you give an explan let me read thean do you understand talking about those who are against Allah Zak let me read the Quran alquran this is the alquran let me read the completely first before you give explanation so 70 70 says then we surely know better of those who are most deserving to roast in it okay but every single one of you is born to approach it this has been a decree unavoidable decree of your lord the then we will deliver those who were mindful of God and live onjust in the on their nails so if you if you can read that even in your own English I'm reading I'm reading in Arabic also in English also nobody does a Muslim he's talking about the devil and those who are followers of the devil who are enemies of Islam correct that's why does it say Muslim in the full Arabic there is no muslim in the English text there is no muslim okay why are you trying to fool the people no no sir the had this explain it better we said if you did not get it I can give another Quran I'm not getting it I can understand even in your language no way the word Muslim mention even in your English language it's talking about the devil and those who are obstinate against the most gracious Allah so Allah will bring them and put them in h what is the problem but why did he say is that please don't waste people's time you read you took so much time I give you time you Quran read you can read it from your translation even even what you read the word Muslim is not there you it doesn't have to have be Muslim he saying all sex saying all sex of the devil talking about human being and also the are this okay let me read this so that it can be clearer and another quranic verse that make it clear another quranic vers Quran chter 3 verse 185 Quran 3: 185 also know 315 says Allah will not accept any religion except Islam all those who follow any other religion they shall be put into hell now from here I I want to read it I want to just read it and and and I just we'll just read the ad this to to confirm it it doesn't the Muslims it is talking about those who are against Allah anyone who desires a religion other than Allah it will never be accepted of him every soul shall have a taste of death I I I'm reading here then we read now brother you are close to accepting Islam I think it's a story it's the story it's a story because they wanted to misguide the people brother what's your name brother what's your name my name is Benson Benson yes Benson yes brother Benson I doubt whether you wanted to accept Islam in 2008 I want to my best friend let me let me give you narration about it my best friend who is a Muslim I'm a Christian we share everything in common is the one that we discovered that the only thing we didn't share in but now do you know you made a mystery your friend may not be an expert in the Quran correct my friend is a Christian today 2012 he has become a Christian and he your friend according that the reason your friend that told you doesn't know the Quran and you misguided him no so you misu instead of him taking you to Islam you took him from the right part to to the wrong path I told you first your friend doesn't know the Quran you misguided him and now you're trying to misguide us also correct no sir so if you told your friend I to become Muslim and show you the Quran now Quran says you go to hell now become a Christian you become a Christian because he doesn't know the Quran brother I'm talking to you looking inside okay I want to just read it I'm talking to you looking inside okay no I'm listening to you sir I brother you quoted two verses both the verses don't talk about Muslims in why are you wasting our time do do you want to you have to agree made a mistake say sorry and let's let us give a chance
