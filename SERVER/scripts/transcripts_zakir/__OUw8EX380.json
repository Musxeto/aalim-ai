  "title": "Is it Compulsory for Muslims of India also to Migrate to a Muslim Country? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the third question is from abdul-jabbar from hyderabad india i completely agree with your reply given in the previous session that muslims must not migrate from muslim countries to non-muslim countries for a better living i also agree with most part of a reply regarding muslim living in non-muslim countries especially western countries should mostly migrate to a muslim country what are your views regarding muslims living in india since india was previously ruled by muslims and i would like to thank prada abdul-jabbar in this question he's referring to the reply i gave in my last session where a person asked that is it permissible for a muslim to migrate from muslim country to a non-muslim country for a better living and i'll just repeat in short and i said it is not permissible for a muslim to migrate from a muslim country to a non-muslim country for a better living unless it is for education he can do for that couple of years of education and come back or if he wants to do dawah and he wants to become a full-time die going as a die and giving dawa in a non-muslim countries permissible but for no other reason for a better living or so that you can get more money or you can have a luxurious life besides these two reasons for a better living or anything else it is not permittable for muslims to leave a muslim country and go to a non-muslim country especially referring to the western country and then i went further to say that the verse of the quran also chapter number 4 verse number 97 whereas says that the angel comes to take the life of the person who has died in sin that how was your state and he said that we were weak and oppressed then the angel replies that the earth of allah is vast so why didn't you migrate and those who do not do that allah says they will go to hell and the refuge will be evil so based on this there are three options for a muslim living in a non-muslim country and i gave the reply that muslim living non-muslim countries especially referring to the western countries that if they cannot live openly decline themselves to be muslims or cannot practice some of the islamic aspects or they cannot practice most of it or some of it it becomes further for them to migrate to muslim land the second category those muslims live in a non-muslim country where they can fully practice islam and they have no problem at all and they can call themselves muslims they can do all their eyes there's no restriction at all i don't know any such country there may be parts of some country but as a whole i don't know some countries may be better than the others but if such a situation is there then it is not compulsory for them to migrate to a muslim country it is mustahab that means they can stay but yet better is to migrate and the third condition is if the muslim is oppressed or they are weak or they cannot migrate then allah will forgive them this was my answer of three category but now the brothers pose the question what about india the muslims living in india because india was ruled by the muslims for more than a thousand years so does india also come in the same category as muslim country and that's a very important question and jazakallah for asking this question there are some countries and one of the good example is india that india was ruled for a thousand years and the population of india approximately more than one third about 40 percent of them were muslims then the british has come and they come saying that their own business but they want to control india they started ruling india and then when they left they created a division amongst the indians who were living very peacefully even though the muslims ruled india for about a thousand years the mughal if the muslim rulers would have forced the non-muslim to accept islam there would not have been any non-muslims alive in india many accepted islam because they liked islam many people remained as non-muslims and there was no problem but the britishers they had a policy of divide and rule so when they left the divided india into three parts and they divided the muslims especially and one third of the muslims went to pakistan one third had been in india one third went to bangladesh they didn't give one country they gave two countries and mongalization pakistan which was known pakistanis pakistan they split so no muslims are divided into three in india little bit more than one-third remain maybe about 37 38 39 percent remain in india one third went to pakistan about 33 less than one-third went to bangladesh about 29 30 percent but if you add all together muslims are 40 percent now when partition took place india declared itself to be a secular country it didn't declare itself to be a hindu country and when the constitution was laid down it had a special rule it was a secular country and it said that any citizen of india following any religion that law of that religion will apply as far as several cases are concerned so if muslims are living in india they had a separate law and today also they have known as the muslim personal law the christians have their christian law the hindus they have the hindu law so when this was drafted it gave permission for all the religions to practice their religion freely all the citizens of india india was not at all a hindu country and even today it is not it is a secular country it is a democratic country and it said that any citizen of india whichever religion it belongs to can live here peacefully so based on that india is a unique case in the world a muslim rule for a thousand years and today was according to me the majority of muslims in any country in the world number one is india though statistic advice it says number one is indonesia about 220 230 million muslims number two is india some about 200 million some people say that it is pakistan about 202 million and third is pakistan some say second is pakistan third is india and then fourth is bangladesh according to me the indian government doesn't declare the correct number of muslims they don't count many millions of muslims in assam et cetera i feel according to minimum muslims would be 250 to 300 million today so according to me the country which has maximum number of muslims living in any part of the world number one is india then in indonesia then is pakistan the number of muslims in india would be minimum 250 million can even go up to 300 million now when the partition took place the government that was formed into the constitution says that every citizen of india has the right to preach practice and propagate his religion and it is just about four years back that i left my country and for more than 20 years mashallah for about 25 years i had a dive openly large audiences and india has been a very safe place for the muslims it is recently when the bjp government came to power just hardly six years back in 2014 that the problem started previously the problems were minor and the muslim could live peacefully there was no major problems at all the politician hindu politician many of the bjp which is a part of the rss these are fanatics and faces and they started promoting hindutva and trying to misguide the people and now there are problems made for the muslims but generally for the muslims living in india it is very close to living in a muslim country they have their full rights so muslims living in india it is perfectly permissible for them to live such close example is for example singapore singapore first was part of malaysia where two thirds of the citizens of malaysia they were muslims previously for everything later on the non-muslims came and then singapore became separate and today singapore has about 18 or 20 percent muslims so there also they have a muslim personal law for the muslims so singapore is also somewhere close to india but natural the freedom in india is much more than freedom in singapore so there are certain few more countries like that maybe mauritius or some which may have a muslim personal law so in such countries india is one of the best amongst these countries in this country whether the muslim person in law where you can follow i don't know of any western country where a muslim can follow muslim person law only the criminal law is common in india in these countries but in the western countries certain things the muslims are permitted for example they're allowed to have all the worship but they cannot marry according to the islamic law they cannot have more than one wife the nikkei is not valid the divorce is not according to the islamic sharia innate is not according to islamic sharia you can will it that's a different case and neither can you openly practice your deen as you can do in india yes there are some non-muslim countries which are better than the other non-muslim countries so my answer was basically talking about non-muslim country mainly the western countries and the other non-muslim country so india will come close to a muslim country not fully like a muslim country it's not required for the muslims in india to migrate they can live and you have a lot of history of muslims and if you see the structure that i've created and the rich source of islamic knowledge is there in india so but natural jazakallah asking the question this is a different case altogether like in india and other few countries of the world hope that answers the question"
