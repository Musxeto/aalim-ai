  "transcript": "there is a question on the facebook by shahafad if parents stop their son from keeping a beard then what should the sun do a similar question is posed by i h rusho on the whatsapp so my mother always tells me to cut my beard i am 19 years old what should i do a similar question is posed by tala from pakistan is keeping beard for a muslim optional or compulsory if it's compulsory then will we get a sin every time we shave similar question posed by ramis rahman from west bengal india can i join the army as it is not allowed to keep a bear there the basic question that is keeping a bad compulsory and if my parents ask me to not keep a beard what should i do can i do a job he doesn't have a beard our beloved prophet muhammad said it's mentioned say bihari number seven hadith number five eight nine two a beloved prophet peace be upon him said that do the opposite of what the mushriks do trim your mustaches and grow your beard so this is the commandment from the prophet they do the opposite of what the idol worshippers do trim your mustaches and grow your beard and since it's a commandment and there is no opposite action it becomes further for muslims to keep the beard and there is unanimous agreement amongst all the foreign imam abu hanifah imam malik imam shafi imam abdul humble all the four schools of thought all the four months they agree that keeping your beard is further so it's first for every muslim to keep up here regarding the question if i shave am i doing a sin yes you're doing your sin it is first to keep your beard and all the muslim men should keep appeared what if my mother tells me not to keep a beard allah says in the quran that if you love your parents you have to respect them allah says in surah luqman chapter number 31 verse number 14 they have enjoined on the human means to be kind to their parents and in travel upon travel did the mother both them and in pain did she give them one the next verse luqman chapter 31 verse 15 says but if your parents force you to worship somebody else besides allah if your parents do jihad struggle and strive to make you worship somebody else besides allah of who you have no knowledge then do not obey them so the basic ruling is you have to obey your parents but if the parents tell you something against allah and his result tell you against the teachings of the glorious quran and say hadith that is the time you don't have to obey them so here because keeping a beard is first and if your parents requested not to keep your beard you should explain to them tell them the benefits i've given the talk on if the label shows your intent where it and i've spoken about the beard and wearing the cap and trousers above the ankle but naturally keeping a beard is first and covering your head with the cap is not a fur it's a sunnah so even if your parents say you have to convince your parents that this is the commandment of the creator and if you keep they'll get more serve and that will also benefit the parents regarding can you do a job which tells you not to keep a beard whether it be in the army or whether it be any other job if the job you are doing if they tell you that do not keep a beard you should not do that job because it is the commandment of a beloved prophet it's the further if they ask you something which is haram you should not do it is better to take a job which permits you even though you may get less salary keeping your beard is fun"
