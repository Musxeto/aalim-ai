  "title": "Why is Eating of ‘Prasad’ Prohibited for a Muslim? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh my next question it's about um the prasad and chanamrit that's given in the temple i would like to know how is it different from like when muslims go to hajj they bring dates and zamzam pani so why is it like muslims have to stop themselves from having the prasad or taking the chairman how is it different so that's a very good question she's saying that when hindus go to temple they give prasad when muslims go to hajj they give dates so what's the difference the difference is prasad is food which is put on to gods in hinduism you find the hindus hinduism is separate the hindus what they do they go to the temple and they give the food to god allah says in the quran in surah anam chapter 6 verse number 14 allah feedeth everyone but does not require to be fed how can we human being give food to god furthermore quran says in no less than four different places which i quoted earlier surah baqarah chapter 2 verse 173 so remind the chapter number five verse number three surah anam chapter 6 verse 145 and surah chapter 16 verse 115. that meat blood the flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides allah's name is taken so if you take on a food any other name besides allah's name it is prohibited it's haram when muslims go to hajj or umrah when they give dates no one says this date has been given to almighty god date you know because one of the main fruits of saudi arabia as date so when you go we get that fruit just as a gift no muslim ever says that this date has been given to almighty god to allah and date is very nutritious it's very nutritious and it's very healthy so this is just as a gift how you get sweets you know when you come from india go abroad you give sweets so this is a very delicious fruit and it is the main fruit of saudi arabia it has no link no one says that this data has been given to almighty god if the hindu gives date to almighty god even eating the date is haram if some hindu gives dead to almighty god and says this is prasad eating the dead becomes haram so anyone takes any name besides allah on that date that date will also become haram so that's the difference between muslims and hindus we don't believe that almighty god requires to eat we human being is required to eat hope that answers the question sister"
