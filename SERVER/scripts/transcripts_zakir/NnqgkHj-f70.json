  "title": "Was Jesus (pbuh) Really Crucified? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "how can you prove that jesus was not crucified then how can i prove that jesus wasn't crucified peace be upon him the quran says in surah nisa chapter 4 157 they killed him not needed to crucify him it was only made to appear so so quran is clear they killed him not neither did they crucify him if i have to prove to are you christian brother i am if you read the bible it's mentioned in the bible in the gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 when people come to jesus christ peace be upon him and tell him that oh master show us some signs so jesus christ peace be upon him replies evil and adulterous generation seeking after a sign no sign shall be shown to you except the sign of jonah for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth brother do you know the story of jonah jonah jonah i do you know now almighty god tells jonah that go to nineveh jonah being a prophet of god he says the people of nineveh they will not understand they will not listen to me he goes to joppa it uses going to nineveh so while he's going in the ship in a boat to joppa there's a storm that comes into the sea this is mentioned in the book of jonah because jonah less than two pages at that time there was a superstition that the storm in the sea is due to some person not obeying the commandment of the master so jonah being a prophet of god he volunteers i am the one who is disabling my master and at that time it was a superstition that if you throw the person in the water the water will become calm so jonah volunteers i am disobeying my master throw me overboard i am asking the question when jonah was thrown overboard was he dead alive jonah when he was thrown overboard into the sea when the storm comes was jonah dead alive very good when a person is thrown in the sea where there is a storm a person ought to die walls do not dead alive when you are thrown in the sea he was alive alive if he dies no miracle as tom a normal person dies he's alive it's a miracle a fish comes then gobbles them up a fish comes and follows them up when the fish swallows them up all donuts are alive alive three days and three nights the fish takes him around the sea in the belly of the fish for three days and three nights jonah prays to almighty god while he was in the belly of the fish was jonathan alive nice alive alive alive alive the fish vomits him out jonah comes on to the show was he read our life alive alive alive alive alive alive alive miracle of a miracle of a miracle of a miracle i'm asking the question when jesus christ peace be upon him according to the bible when he was taken down from the cross he was put in the grave in the sepulcher in the sepulcher was jesus dead or alive dead dead if he's dead does he fulfill the sign or not but he was raised to mark in the sepulcher in the grave was he dead or alive dead our life then if he was dead is he fulfilling the prophecy jesus christ peace be upon him said no sign shall be given to you except the sign of jonah for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth if jonah was alive for jesus christ to fulfill the prophet the peace be upon him he should be dead our life dead or alive he should be he should be alive you should be alive and you are the life why do you say he was dead are you trying to say that jesus christ peace be upon him lied if you say he was dead that means you are saying jesus was a liar knows billah that means jesus was alive what has been told to you by the church is wrong do you believe in the church or do you believe in jesus christ peace be upon him the bible says jesus was dead where does it say give me the reference i'm not not that much known but do you know the sign of jonah yes or no yeah was do not dare to alive in the belly of the fish yes alive so jesus christ has to be dead or alive in the earth but why it is not mentioned in the bible that he was alive it is mentioned where does it say he was dead it was assumed the roman soldiers thought he was dead they poked the spear they spoke to us but the other life so if you see my video cassette was christ crucified there are empty numbers of proofs i gave you one proof jesus christ peace be upon him did not say that you know i gave life to the dead therefore i'm a man of god he put all his eggs in one basket as jonah was dead or alive you are saying jonah was alive peace be upon him so jesus also peace be upon him has to be allah why do you say dead just because the priest told you so do you believe mo in the priest or do you believe in the bible i believe in the bible do you believe in jesus christ peace be upon him or the priest i don't believe in jesus so jesus christ peace be upon him said as jonah was in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be in the heart of the earth so jonah was dead or alive so jesus christ peace be upon you has to be dead or alive so the bible still says he was dead and he raised back to life where does the bible say i have to find it but what i'm telling you gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 you know the sign of jonah i know that time you're dead or alive in life when you know the sign of jonah and you don't know where it is said he's dead you have to follow what is in red letter there are many things which are mentioned by paul which is not part of the saying of jesus christ peace be upon him if you know there is something like red letter bible red letter bible means whatever jesus christ peace be upon him said is in reading if you quote me something in blocking i will not believe why that is not the word of jesus christ peace be upon him do you give more preference to jesus christ peace be upon him or saint paul jesus christ what i'm quoting to you is in red gospel of matthew noted down gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 so don't get me a quotation of backing to prove this wrong you have to get me a quotation in reading that's what jesus christ peace be upon him said i request you to go home read the bible and when you're convinced inshallah come to the truth you"
