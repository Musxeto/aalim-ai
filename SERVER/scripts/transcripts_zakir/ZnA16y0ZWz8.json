  "title": "Music in Islam - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is um Benjamin and um I'm a carpenter by profession um I'm a lover of music and my Muslim friend says um any music with instruments it's not good I want to know why it is so or any explanation to that statement the brother has the question that Muslim friends tell him that any music with instrument is not correct why our Prophet Muhammad sallallah Al wasallam said he prohibited the use of musical instrument except the duff the duff is you know one side open drum it's not a drum it's a duffle the reason is that when you play music there are chances that you can get deviated you get carried away in poetry Etc you get carried away they start praising people and they go beyond the limits so music takes you away many times you hear in the songs pop songs Beat It Beat It what does it mean you don't understand yet people are repeating it correct funky town what funky town it doesn't have any meaning only so when people hear music and they start singing they say things which have no meaning and they enjoy it takes you away from the worship of Allah subhana tala takes you away from worship of almighty God that's the reason it is not allowed in Islam brother but these are all minor issues the main issue today we are discussing is about almighty God do you believe there's one God yeah I believe in one God do you believe Jesus Is God no very good do you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God I believe he the messenger of God mashallah so if you believe that there's no one worthy of worship except almighty God and you believe that Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God that means you're a Muslim these are minor issues whether music is allowed or not the main issue is that if you believe there's one God and if you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of God you enter into the fold of Islam would you like to say it in Arabic I came to ask questions please can you let me finish my questions before no your question is I already answered your question didn't answer your question you asked me why is musical instrument not allowed I gave you the answer um that's the first question I have a different oh so you have one more question yeah I have more questions so I should know that I cannot read people's mind okay how many questions do you have brother um should we how many more questions do you have about four four yeah normally we ask one question at a time and for next question go behind the queue if it's short questions I'll take go behind the yes brother what's your next question um believing um Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God makes you a Muslim what about believing Jesus Christ in is the messenger of God very good question if you believe that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God you become a Muslim if you believe Jesus is a messenger of God that also makes you a Muslim you cannot be a Muslim if you do not believe Jesus is a messenger of God I told you earlier that Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest Messengers of God we believe that he was born miraculously without any intervention we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind lepers with God's permission the Muslim and the Krishna G together but we do not believe he's God so if you believe in all the messengers Adam Abrahim isma Isaac Moses Jesus Muhammad peace be upon them all then you become a Muslim and we believe that Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the last and final messenger if you believe this and believe in one God then you become a Muslim next two questions okay sh should I believe in the Bible should you believe in the Bible as far as should you believe in the Bible as the word of God according to me Bible is not the word of God what we Muslims believe is the inil the Revelation the wayi which was given to Jesus peace be upon him but the present Bible is not the original it's a corrupted form all the Revelation that came before the last and final Revelation the Quran the Torah the Zab the injil because they were meant for a particular group of people as I mentioned in my talk almighty God did not think it fit to be preserved it was meant for those people and that time all these books have been changed but because Quran is the last and final revelation of almighty God it was not revealed only for the Muslims or the Arabs it was revealed for the whole of humankind and it's supposed to be followed till eternity because of that almighty God will preserve this book it's mentioned in Surah hij chapter number 15 verse number n that we have revealed the Quran and we shall guard it from corruption so this Quran is in the pure authentic form the present Bible is a changed form it contains words of God it contains words of prophet it contains words of historians it contains pornography it contains contradictions it's a mixture so whatever matches with the Quran we have no objection and agreeing that part is the word of God the last question brother if you believe the Bible is not the word of God then why do you quote from very good question if I do not believe the Bible to be the word of God why do I quote I quot it because the Christians believe it to be the word of God for example the non-muslim doesn't believe the Quran is the word of God but because I believe Quran is the word of God he will point out anything from the Quran I will follow I will not tell him why don't you believe Quran is the word of God because I believe Quran is the word of God I have to follow every word every letter of the Quran similarly I do not believe everything of the Bible to be the word of God but the Christians believe now because the Christians believe Bible is the word of God he has to follow every word every letter of the Bible as I told you some portion of the Bible are correct so I'm trying to bring the commonalities between Quran and the Bible and one commonality is the mention of prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so from the Bible which I feel is ax of correct and wrong things but the Christian beli everything is correct so I'm proving from that Bible quoting Deuteronomy chapter 18 verse number 18 Gospel of John Chapter 14 verse 16 all these verses and proving to the Christians who believe that Bible is the word of God that if you believe in the Bible you also have to believe in Prophet Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam and if you believe in Prophet Muhammad you also have to believe in the Quran so I'm getting him closer to the truth I must student of comparative religion I even quote the vas the Hindus believe Veda is the word of God and from the vas I get them closer to the Quran so I hope I've answered all your four question or do you have one more question there are many questions but I I'll put no but for now you said there are four questions when I asked you earlier you said four now you said many but your basic four questions have been answered correct yeah yeah and I asked you questions earlier two questions do you believe there's none worthy of worship except Allah and you said yes I said yes do you believe Prophet Muhammad as the messenger of Allah I believe he's the messenger of Allah M that means they're Muslim so now what I told you if you agree that there is no one worthy of worship except almighty God Allah and you believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of Allah these are the minimum two requirements for a person to become a Muslim the other things are later on so if you believe in these two things you become a Muslim would you like to say it in Arabic brother would you like to say it in Arabic no I have to make I have to make more research no no when you agree Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God the research you can yet do more research no problem even I study more and more about Prophet Muhammad the more I study the more I like I keep on reading his s one time two time 10 time I love it I'm not telling you after you become Muslim you have to stop reading yet you have to continue even I keep on reading the Quran the more I read the Quran the more knowledge I get correct so I'm not telling you to stop reading but if you agree these are the minimum two things required then if you accept it the chances of agreeing is more you say you want to learn English first you have to take admission to the school correct you can't say I will stay outside and then learn you have to join and once you join you start going regular if you don't join then you don't go regular then the chances of you learning is less correct so would you like to join the religion of Islam you believe there's one God you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God these are the minimum two things according to me already a Muslim according to me you're already a Muslim so Muslim means one who submits his will to God if I believe um mhammad is the messenger of God and I believe there is only one God should I repeat what you say before I become a real Muslim no it's not required once you believe you become it between you and Allah it between you and God you don't have to say it in public also you can even hide quietly and follow the religion no one can stop you but normally when you proclaim the chances you will grow in that religion is more if you life is in danger and you do it hiding it's accepted you don't have to sit in front of the public it's between you and Allah I don't have to interfere with but normally when you Proclaim it the chances you will grow in it and the practice increases better if you say no I don't want to Proclaim it no one can force you therefore I ask is anyone forcing you I ask that question forcing in Islam is prohibited Allah says in the Quran in Sur Bak chapter 2 verse number 256 there's no compulsion religion truth stands out clear from error but it continues if you hold the hand of Allah he will take you from Darkness to light if you hold the hand of the Satan he will take you from light to Darkness but when you see it there are chances more that other people now will come and give you more information you will do more research and the chances of you growing going to standard 2 3 4 10 graduate post e here do you understand so seeing is not compulsory it is preferable would you like to say it according to me you're already a Muslim would you like to say it you want to say say yes otherwise no no one can force you no I don't I don't want to say okay but you believe Keep On Believing it you can practice even individually no problem I would request you to read more and if you believe that there is no God but Allah and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger you become a Muslim and may Allah Grant you good in this world and may Allah put you in J thank you thank you brother most welcome"
