  "title": "Why Should We Pray Salaah & What is the Benefit Praying in Congregation in Mosque? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I'm a degree Student Business just my question is about solar you've mentioned and gave us knowledge about zaka and how it benefits our society so what about Salah why we should Gather in the mosque what is the benefit of it for the community and the society thank you brother the question that in my lecture give the example of the Robert what's the beneficial why should you go to the mosque and have a congregation and Gathering brother I've given a full lecture on Salah the programming towards righteousness it's for about one and a half I don't intend doing that you cannot cover all the points in one lecture Salah is the second important the second pillar of Islam after tahit believe in Allah that there's no one except Allah worship and Mama the second is the first deed that will be asked you on the day of judgment is the body of Salah foreign not praying Falls as the fourth major sin in Islam number one is second is murder third is Black Magic Fourth is foregoing Salah it is the fourth major sin in Islam and beloved Prophet Muslim said mentioned in the book of Salah that if you pray in Jama you get 25 times 27 times so praying in Jabba is 25 to 27 times better congregation and there are several Hadith of our beloved Prophet Muslim it's mentioned inside that the prophet said that people do not come to the mosque for the jumma Salah he felt like telling one of the sabbah to lead the Salah so that he would go and burn the houses of those people who did not come for the jumasala So based on the scholars praying Juma Salah is and if you do it for three times without reason Allah Blocks Your Heart is the 66th majors in Islam not paying praying persistently jumasala and congregation is the 66 major sin Imam also says SIN number 65. once and before that that persistently not praying in the mosque in the congregation Salah with Jama without a validation the prophet said the Hypocrites did not come for the Fajr Salah or the Isha Salah and if they knew the reward they would come crawling I felt like telling one of the sahabas to lead the Salah so that I can go out and burn the homes of the men with them in it who did not come for the congregation Salah so praying in Jama the five times Salah according to very few Scholars it is majority scholar says it is in his book it is the 65th major sin that if you do not pray fight I am Salah in the congregation in the mosque so most of the scholars agree that you have to pray unless you have a valid reason that if maybe you are traveling or if you're sick or normally at the time of the sahabad if a person did not come to the mosque to pray he was either sick or he was a munafic that's what happened so praying compulsory in the Salah in congregation is a must what are the various benefits I can give a talk for one hour only on scientific benefit time doesn't permit me but you can see my video has said you come closer to the Muslim ummah you get guidance increases the best time the best peace of mind is the time of Salah and the best part of Salah is the sujud Allah mentioned in the Quran 92 times but if you know what you will and fruit if you have a taste of it so if you know what benefit of Allah one minor benefit minor benefit I'll tell you you know people say you know the 10 richest men in the world and this goes on Mukesh Ambani number 10 and Warren Buffett and number one goes to Bill Gates now it is Jeff something he's overtaking Bill Gates recently Jeff someone who's the owner of Amazon he's overtaken Bill Gates number one and there was another post that says number 10 Ambani number three Bill Gates number two Jeff number one is who a Muslim who offers because the Beloved Prophet Muhammad sallam said that if you pray to rakasunna before Fajr it is more valuable than the earth and the wealth in it so if you have a Muslim you understand that you will know the reward of that it's the sunna Salah so imagine what would be the reward for the Fajr Salah but how many Muslims realize that many do but not all if you know that you know once a businessman approached me as a billionaire you know I pray four times so I told him that what if you have a meeting tomorrow early in the morning at 5 30 where if the deal clicks will get a billion dollar he said I will not sleep the full night so I told him you know the Sunnah Salah of the Fajr is more valuable than the world and the wealth in it trillions and zillions of dollars so if you have that Iman and if you have that Faith then you will realize what important it is that's what the prophet said knew what was the benefit of coming for the Isha Salah and fajrasala to the most they would crawl coming to it so unfortunately most of us Muslims don't know the benefit but alhamdulillah I'm happy in Malaysia as compared to India the percentage of muslims praying in India is very small in the mosque I would say less than five percent but here alhamdulillah I'm happy that the percentage of Muslim men muslims praying in the mosque is multiple times more than India and Pakistan but as a Muslim the benefit to get the sukoon the serenity the peace it is much more than the wealth so if you know what peace is you will value it if you don't know you won't value it so if a Muslim reads the Quran and the Hadith and understand what benefit is then you will care less for the materials things and you will come closer to the Deen and you'll find the benefit for more details refer to my talk Salah the program introductions hope the answers the question foreign"
