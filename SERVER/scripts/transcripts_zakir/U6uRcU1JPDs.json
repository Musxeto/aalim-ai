  "transcript": "muslim today are labeled as terrorists many a times two different labels are given for the same activity of that same individual about 60 70 years ago before india got its freedom the country where i come from the britishers were ruling india there were many indians who were fighting for the freedom of the country these people by the british government they were called as terrorists but the common indians we call them as freedom fighters as patriots same people same activity but two different levels if you agree with the view of the british government that they had a right to rule over india then you have to call these people as terrorists but if you agree with the view of the common indians that the britishers came to india to do business they have no right to rule over us then you'll have to call these people as patriots as freedom fighters same people same activity but two different labels and such examples you can give multiple such examples in world history adai should know if there are many examples which example should use where so that he understands because quran says in surah imran chapter 3 verse 64. come to common terms as in you the moment the indians when they call muslim terrorists and when i give this example then they understand the picture better two months back i was in uk after the bomb blast after seventh of july there's supposed to be a grand conference tony blair jackson were supposed to come last moment they didn't come but the chief of police was there the mayor was there and there also i used example but my examples were different i said that in the 18th century we know of the american revolution the britishers were ruling america there were many americans who were fighting for the freedom in 1776 they got the freedom and top of the line were benjamin franklin george washington they were called as terrorist number one by the british government the person who was terrorist number one george washington later on he becomes the president of usa imagine terrorist number one become the president of usa and he is an example for all the presidents to follow including george bush this is media terrorist number one becomes the president of the country which we look up upon usa usa's name come most advanced country in the world who was the person who was the first president a terrorist we have the example of nelson mandela before new south africa was formed south africa was relief from the white apartheid government nelson mandela by the white apartheid government he was imprisoned for 25 years in robin island he was called as terrorist number one later on when south africa gets its freedom from the white apartheid government he is made the president of new south africa and later on he gets the nobel prize for peace and he doesn't get a nobel prize for peace for a new activity not that he was a terrorist first and then he did some good activities and a bad person has become a good person no no for the same activity for which he was called a terrorist after a few years he gets a nobel prize for peace it is weird same activity for which he was imprisoned for 25 years he was called as terrorist for the same activity later on he gets the nobel prize for peace so this is how the media can convert day into night black into white hero into a villain and a villain into a hero in short whoever is in power whatever he says turns out to be the gospel truth we know when hitler was invading europe many countries were existing even france they resisted these french people by the german they were called as terrorists this is how the media paints a picture unfortunately we muslims unfortunately we are way behind we should know how to turn the tables over"
