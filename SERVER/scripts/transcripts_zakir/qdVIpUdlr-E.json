  "transcript": "next question Dr zakya relates to the fact that now of course Ramadan is over and the devils are set free many of the youth not to mention other people um adults as well will revert to their bad habits of watching television could you shed some light on the issue of watching television and its harmful effects television does multiple times more harm than good it harms a person's spiritually morally socially and economic wise there are various we can give a talk only on the ill effects of only television number one is that I call it rather it'san it's the footstep of the devil for many reasons number one is that it many a Time prevents a person from offering Salah a person gets addicted to the TV so Muslims though he realizes the time he okay I'll pray after 5 minutes after 5 minutes and he watches the program the soap or the Opera whatever it is and he misses Salah number two there is too much of obscenity on the television normal channels that you see the entertainment channels you find so much ofinity and Allah says in the Quran in Surah n chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his G and guard his modesty whenever a man looks at a woman if any unashamed thought any Breen thought comes in his mind he should lower his gaze the next verse speaks for the woman Sur 24 verse number 31 said to the believing woman that she should lower her gaze and guard her modesty that when she looks at any man and any unim thought comes she should lower the case so now how can a Muslim watch television on which you find ladies without hijab immodest many of them the clothes the way they expose more of the body than cover the body so but natural most of the channels that you see more than 99% you can safely say more than 99% are Haram as far Islam is concerned people give excuses oh why not new Chann Liv news channels the ladies that they come you know they dress up they're not having hijab Etc and the obsin that is there it is tremendous and there are many reports which if time permits I'll tell you later on and the second is obsin on the television number three is the extravagance that when we see any channel the ements the entice of person to buy things which are not required you may see a latest car that launched in the market and your desire will be there to buy it you may want a very big house or things which aren't required of luxury extra vagons as Allah says in the Quran in Surah is chapter number 17 verse number 26 and 27 they do not be extravagant do not be a spend Thrift for verily the person who's a spend Thrift is the brother of the devil the fourth point is that it leads unnecessary there's too much of Glamour and fame the person tries to get involved in that glamorous World seeing the actors and the other people and they try and imitate them they try and emulate them they become the idols and they become the heroes rather than Muhammad sah wasallam and the sahabas number five is that there's too much of violence on the television and that influences the person's lifestyle and there are several reports on that too furthermore there's too much of drug addiction there's too much of fighting Etc which a person gets involved you know oh some people you know it's nice to have drugs when a person a young person sees that he tries to at least try it out and that's how drug addition increases alcoholism increases and there are various just to C sure I'll just give you some of the reports there's a special report done only on the effect of television on children and since 1950 more than a thousand surveys and researches were done on the effects of television on children and young adults and according to a survey which was present in the senate committee of Judiciary in USA in 1999 it says that because of young children and young adults watching television it makes their lifestyle violent they aggressive and they're unsocial according to the report of of houon a service conducted in 1992 and by the time a child reaches the age of and if he watches television the average hours that a person in USA watches he would have viewed 200,000 violent acts on television and 40,000 murders imagine what impact it will have on that young mind according to report of the American Council of Pediatrics in the year 2001 it says that death in children and young adults and Adolescence only due to violence that is homicide suicide and Trauma is much more than the diseases much more than cancer much more than congenital heart disease the deaths caused by these violence and further more into research done by the ker foundation in the 2005 it said that on an average an average American child watches television every week for 44 and 1 half hours that means every day he watches television and sits in front of the computer game or in front of the computer screen all put together for about 6 and a half hours every day that is there's no activity does more than sitting in front of the television screen or the computer screen more than sleeping sleeping is the only thing where you may sleep more otherwise any activity that he does maximum is this and the impact it has on the lifestyle on the behavior is drastically negative there were researches done on what effect does a video album has you know you have a lot of video albums coming up and dancing and singing and music it takes a person away from Allah subhana therefore I say it'san there are researches on the sex shown on this television it's tremendous maximum number of channels on the satellite TV in America it's pornographic channels in UK it's pornography channel the maximum profit the percentage of profit by any channels are the pornographic channels and the cheapest to run a channel is the pornographic channnel and even the entertainment channels have started getting ofinity on it to attract the people and people get slowly and slowly alluded towards it and India which is the conservative country the eastern part of the world maybe a few decades back when we see the way the movies were made in India if they had to show a love scene they used to show two flowers that's it indicating love scene later on we had the hero heroin they're running around the tree to show a love scene now you see them openly kissing on the street Indian movies even sleeping in bed and it's very normal so that's how you know it started with just showing a symbolic love making was fls and then we see today that open openly sleeping and showing all the scenes and all and it's even getting into the normal FM television channels then you have the fashion TV and all the you know therefore we are very particular that in our school all the children who are studying in our school in their house in the family there should be no cable TV even if they want to see peace TV if they have a private dish where only peace TV comes it's permitted but if they have the cable TV along with peace TV for another 100 or 80 Haram channels come we say don't see peace TV Islamic Sharia says let a small loss take place to prevent a big loss so the bigger loss is the Haram channels the small benefit is a peace TV but best is to have only peace TV have a decoder see the channel that's fine and there are very few channels which are Islamic and getting people to the straight path very few the percentage will be less than 1% of the channels so we pray to Allah subhana T that may have more channels and even the Islamic channels should see that they on the Quran Sunnah that's important because even they get deviated with this media the film industry you know trying to get more popular slowly slowly they're try and deviate so we pray that we be on the straight path so this is just in short the few ill effects of TV and we can give a talk on this"
