  "title": "Dr Zakir Naik's View on 'ISIS' Killing innocent Human Beings - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "many times people ask me that what are my comments regarding isis killing innocent human beings and in reply i say that if i say that i am the president of usa will the media report that the president of usa is in saudi arabia and the answer is no because all of them know very well that i am not the president of usa they will say some lunatic is saying is the president or if i speak against his view saying i am the president of usa they will say an enemy of the president of usa is saying this similarly unfortunately unintentionally ignorantly many of us muslims and the muslim media they promote the enemies of islam the enemies of islam have coined this word isis islamic state of iraq and syria and when the non-muslim media says that the islamic state of iraq and syria has killed innocent people many of the muslims they repeat and they say the same thing if you ask me the question has the islamic state of iraq and syria kill the nucent human beings i would say no it is the anti-islamic state of iraq and syria which has killed the innocent human beings because islam condemns the killing of windows and human being quran clearly says in surah chapter 5 verse 32 if anyone kills any no sentiment b whether it be a muslim or non-muslim it is as though you have killed the whole of humanity so how can any muslim kill any no sentiment being so if i say in my speech that the islamic state is doing and killing innocent human being i am actually confirming that the islamic what i will say it is the anti-islamic state of iraq and syria which is killing innocent human being i should not say isis the muslims should say aiss anti-islamic state of iraq and syria similarly in arabic to call them daesh dora islamiyah is totally wrong you should call them the rise to islam because they are anti-islamic i request all the muslims in the world as well as the muslim media please do not help the enemies of islam in attacking islam it is these enemy forces who have coined this word to malign islam please my request to the muslims all over the world and the muslim media next time when you want to condemn this group of terrorists say that the anti-islamic state of iraq and syria don't call them isis the muslims should say iss anti-islamic state of iraq and syria"
