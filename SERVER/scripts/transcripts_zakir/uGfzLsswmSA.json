  "transcript": "the first question is the person says wanna come wanna come is the terminal word which means hello and that's hello to you too i believe the person is the terminal he's asking the question and he writes wasant here i'm a hindu residing in bahrain i am reading and getting knowledge about islam for some time but slowly day by day can you please tell top five aspects of islam which can inspire non-muslims apart from the five pillars as i am aware of them basically brother wants to know the top five points that inspire non-muslim to become muslim get them closer to islam besides the five pillars and let me tell you that the major points that inspire a non-muslim toward islam other five pillars i'll briefly mention some of the points of the five brothers and then come on to the other five important points besides the five pillars according to me the number one point that inspires non-muslims toward islam is taheed it is oneness of allah and the concept of god in allah that it is unique unlike other religions the concept that there is only one god and that we worship no one else besides him alone and he's the all-powerful he doesn't have any associates he doesn't have any partners this concept of tahit not merely monotheism tahith that you worship him alone and no one else it really impresses the non-muslim and the definition of allah is given in brief in surah class chapter 112 verse number one before he says see he is allah allah in short is the touchstone of theology giving the definition of allah in brief and it makes it completely different than the other concepts of god whereas if you see in other religions god can be defeated god has got sun god has got wife the wife gets abducted the god can be killed so all these are not the true concept of allah number one is sahih number two it is the second pillar of islam that is allah that when a person offers allah he gets closer to allah it is better than any meditation it gets you peace of mind it gets to serenity and it demonstrates the best example of universal brethren and when the muslim men when we stand for salah in congregation we stand shoulder shoulder and feet to feet irrespective whether the person next to you is a king or a popper whether it's black or white we stand shoulder shoulder it demonstrates the best example of universal brotherhood five times every day i'm just mentioning some of these alien features of all the five pillars which attract a non-muslim number three it is a zakat that every rich person who has a saving of more than a sub level 85 grams of gold should give 2.5 percent as zakat as obligated charity to the eight categories the poor the masakan etc and here the people feel the closeness and as allah says in surah chapter 59 verse number 7 zakat prevents the wealth from circulating only amongst the rich it gets the closeness between the rich and the poor so this aspect attracts a non-muslim the fourth pillar is fasting into some and we mention all the objectives the fasting all these objectives get a person closer to islam the fifth pillar is hajj a pilgrimage anyone wants the means and the health and the wealth to perform hash to do it once in the last time and hajj is the best example of annual universal method where more than four million people from all over the world from different parts of the world from saudi arabia from india from pakistan from bangladesh from uk from usa from singapore from malaysia from indonesia they gather and the men they're dressed up in two pieces of white cloth unsung and they only come and say la bake along here we come at the service of the lord so this shows the universal brotherhood it shows the equality of all the human beings all dressed up in two pieces of white unsewn cloth this demonstration of brotherhood impresses a non-muslim this was just in brief about some of the salient features we can give a talk for several hours in reply to this question the important points that attract a non-muslim towards islam now coming to the main question what are the five top important points besides the five pillars which attract a non-muslim towards islam number one besides the fight according to me it is the quran the glorious quran is the last and final revelation of allah subhanahu talaha leaving to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him the quran is the ultimate miracle it's a miracle of miracles and anyone who reads the quran even the translation if it's a good translation it brings tears to his eyes he realizes the beauty of life he realizes the purpose of creation he understands allah he understands the deen only giving the translation a good translation of the glorious quran to a non-muslim it will do wonders it is one of the major factors besides the five pillars which attracts a non-muslim towards islam it's unlike any other book in the world unlike any other religious scriptures number two besides the five pillars it is prophet muhammad peace be upon him and according to michael hichard namaste in his book of hundred most influential people in the world from adam peace be upon him till today number one he places being a non-muslim is prophet muslim if you read the seed of the prophet as the quran right he says in surah kalam chapter number 68 verse number 4 that thou art standeth on the highest standard of character that means the character of the prophet is so superior it is the best standard and allah repeated the message in surah azam chapter number 33 verse number 21 that verily in the messenger of allah in prophecy you'll find the most beautiful pattern of conduct his conduct his lifestyle his behavior was an example so much so that even his enemies could not deny calling him allah mean the trustworthy the honest person they respected him so if you read the seed of the prophet there are high chances that if a non-muslim reads with an unbiased mind though there are thousands of books written against the prophet but if you read the seerah you will find that he was the best example best exemplary human being that allah has sent on the face of the earth number three top reason besides the five pillar that a non-muslim accepts islam and gets attracted is the concept of life after death that is believing there is life after death because when you look around us there is so much of wrongs happening there's so much of criminals so much of injustice being done and you wonder how is allah allowing this injustice is he not capable of stopping it allah gives the reply in surah imran chapter 3 verse number 185 that every soul shall have a taste of death and the final recompense will be on the day of judgement and this life is the mere amusement if you enter jannah you have achieved the objective of this life because this life is just mere tools of deception so here we know that the final recompense of that but imagine if you have to think of hitler the person who we know who has killed the maximum number of human beings in the world history terms of six million even if you catch hitler today what management can you give him maybe that that will compensate for one what about the remaining five million nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine human beings are killed the only reply to this is allah will give him the final punishment of the day of judgment allah says in the quran in surah chapter 4 56 that as to those who reject our signs we will cast them into the hellfire and as often as the skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skin so that they shall feel the pain that means in the next life and today we have come to know that the feeling of pain it's based on the pain receptors which are present in the skin so if your skin is burnt and the pain receptors are destroyed you cannot feel the pain and that's what happened in this life a person has a 100 burn injury and if pain receptors have been destroyed you cannot feel pain but on the day of judgment allah says as often as your skins are roasted we shall give you fresh skin so that you shall feel the pain that means if allah wants to incinerate burn hitler 6 million times 10 million times 12 million times we can do it we can't give him such a punishment in this life so there has to be a life after death for justice in this world and the fourth point that attracts the person besides the faithful of islam is that this life that we are leading is a test for the hereafter allah says in the quran number 67 verse number two allah has created that in life to test which of you is best in deeds this life is the test for us for the hereafter many of the question that we ask that how are millions of people dying of hunger there's so much of poverty can't allah give them food and almighty god there are so many people dying in diseases the dying in earthquakes what is the reason the reason is this life is a test for thereafter allah test different people with different things some people test with wealth some people with poverty some people with health some people with diseases and allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 155 that do you think allah will not test you before you go to jannah last to testify allah says we will test you with hunger or with fear of life or with the property that we have acquired allah will test you in different ways and the fifth reason that attracts a person besides the five pillars it is the repentance that the concept of repentance of tawba in islam that irrespective however many sins you do you may do a sin as big as the mountains touching the sky you may sin the whole day whole night but if you truly repent and you ask forgiveness in islam allah will forgive any sin even you have done the worst of the sin so this gives a hope to a human being that now he's bad and now he reads the book he knows about religion so can he turn into a new leaf very well he can he may be the worst human being in the world if he sincerely repents and he asks for forgiveness he does tawba inshallah allah will forgive him and the beauty of islam is if a person was a non-muslim the big sins he does and after he repents the bigger the sin he leaves the bigger bodyguard so imagine if a person is the biggest sinner and he thinks okay now if i accept islam all my sins will get converted to the good deeds mashallah so these are the five points that i can think of the top in priority besides the five pillars of islam so hope this answer is very brief answer you can speak for hours on this but because it's a question answer session i don't want to spend more time because there was a non-muslim asking a question i gave a reply in more detail"
