  "transcript": "the second part of the question can you invest for a short time for a few hours for a day for a week and I'm expert I'm not gambling because I'm doing a calculation see when you buy shares is actually you are becoming a shareholder I'm asking a simple question with all calculation will you physically be a partner not shares physically be a partner of a business only for one hour and the answer is no will with all your calculation will you I want to be a partner for one hour no you cannot physically if you say that I want to share and become a partner for a day would you become of a company no you cannot so Stock Exchange gives us easy flexibility to buy shares but that does not mean you should gamble if it's done for a short period intentionally that I will sell it when it goes off give and you keep it for a few or for a day or a few days it t to gambling if it's done unintentionally that you want to keep it for few years and then you realize something Market has crashed and and then you want to sell it that's acceptable but from first you plan that you're going to sell it as soon as it increases even if it's a few hours and all this is speculation and this is not permitted in Islam so you can involve in stock if it's a Halal stock Halal share but don't speculate don't do it for few keep it for a long term"
