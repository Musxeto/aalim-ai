  "title": "Can I keep my savings in a Fixed Deposit Account and Donate the Interest to free Innocent Prisoners?",
  "transcript": "those are the questions from the youtube now we'll continue the question from the what's up assalamu alaikum this will shall be the last question into a shortage of time this question is from muhammad mohsin i am from bangalore india but working in america dr sahib i salute you my father and myself are your biggest fans for your work of dawa may allah protect you and reward you with the best in this life and the hereafter i mean can i keep my savings in a fixed deposit in a bank account and donate the interest amount to jamiat to help fight cases of innocent muslim prisoners so that they can be released but the muhammad bosan has asked a question that can he keep his money in a fixed deposit which gets interest riba and i understand from his question that he knows that rabbi is haram we're asking the question that can i keep the money in a fixed deposit in a rebar based account and the interest that i get i will donate it to jamyath because jamyath is helping freeing many of the innocent muslims who have been imprisoned and allegations have been put against them so can we use this rebar money for that good cause as far as ribba is concerned allah subhanahu talaha that rabbi is prohibited and allah says in the quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 278 and surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 279 that give up your demands of rabbi and if you give up not your demands of rabbi take notice of a war from allah and his result that means if you indulge in riba in interest by the giving of interest or taking of interest allah says in the quran that allah and his rasool will wage a war against you so taking or giving interest is a major sin imam adhabi in his book the khabar the seventy major sins he places riba as the twelfth major sin and the hadith of the prophet sallam that riba is of various levels the lowest level of riba is like doing zina with your mother regarding a question i understand from your question that you agree reba's haram but the question is that i will not utilize that money i will give it in donation to the jamiat which is doing good work of releasing muslim prisoners who are innocent and against them there are false and fabricated cases brother to give donation to the jamyath first you have to take money from the bank if you keep your money in the fixed deposit itself is haram besides keeping in the fake deposit of haram to give donation first you have to take the riba and only after you take the reba will you be able to give it a donation so taking rabbi's haram so no way can you continue keeping a fixed deposit bank account and thinking that i will get the ripa i will not utilize it the quran does not say do not utilize the money of reba it says do not involve indirapad don't take riba do not give riba and also do not utilize that is one part of it but first you'll have to take to give so according to me it is haram to keep in a fixed deposit itself now you did not know that keeping in a fixed deposit is haram and you have kept the money for few years and now you have realized it is haram and now you're asking me what to do with the money then i can give you the solution number one stop that riba account stop the fake deposit account you can keep in a conventional bank and a current account which does not involve interest or keep an islamic bank but first thing you have to do is stop that rubber based account stop that fixed deposit account now you have money remaining that you don't utilize for yourself that money you can very well give to the jamia or gift for making toilets or for any good cause don't utilize for yourself but this is only in the case where you innocently or ignorantly kept in a riba based account but if you know reba's haram and then if you keep in the fixed deposit it is prohibited because if you keep in a ripa account knowingly rebuy haram example you may be getting negative 1000 points you are helping the jamiat you're getting positive 100 points so they are getting negative thousand points helping the german is plus 100 points your balance is negative 900 points so why keep in a fake deposit so keeping in fixed deposit and utilizing the money for good cause also haram according to me there are some scholars who say it's permitted upon to meet haram because you're indulging in one of the gravest sins where allah says allah and his rasool will wage a war against you the hurmath the prohibition of indulging in rabbah is fast greater alcohol gambling sinner and all put together that's the reason allah says allah and his rasool will wage a war against you so continuing keeping in the bank and year after year taking the interest and giving a charity is also prohibited unknowingly you kept and money is there with you don't utilize it yourself give it in charity for a good call you can also give the germany has no problem but keeping it continuously and then taking out the money and giving for a good cause you're getting more negative than positive points it is haram please stop it hope that answers the question"
