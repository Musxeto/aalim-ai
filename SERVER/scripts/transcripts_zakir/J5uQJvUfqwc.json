  "transcript": "uh there's another question by one of the person on the whatsapp is assalamu alaikum my name is sabiya from dhaka bangladesh question how to become allah's favorite muslim how can i become dr zakir naik i'm a big fan of yours please pray for me so that i can become dr zakir naik and enter janet alfred we bangladeshi people love you and we respective there is a similar question asked so i have asked my team to club the questions which are similar so that more people are happy that i've asked the questions that i've answered the question a similar question is asked by abdul from pakistan sir i'm from pakistan and i'm a great admirer of you my profession is nursing and my question is how can i become like you there's a third question similar to that assalamualaikum sir i am rahul mia from india i want to be a dai sir please tell me what should i do i want to become like you and shake that regarding the basic question all the three people have asked that that all of them want to become a guy like me they want to indigent those let me tell you the outside that it's not complicated to become like me to enter generator for those as far as i'm concerned i i pray to allah let me accept my efforts whatever he can and i consider there are millions of people who are better than me in terms of knowledge in terms of dawah it is only because of the mercy of allah it is only because of the grace of allah subhana wa tala that whatever little bit i have achieved is because of him and when i think of myself that there are you know hundreds of thousands of people are more knowledgeable than me how come people come for my talks how come people listen to me on the facebook on the youtube i wonder and then that reminds me you know that it is three criteria which always says important number one is that allah says in the quran imran chapter 3 verse 160 that if allah helps you none can overcome you if allah forsakes you who will then who can help you so let the believers put the trust in allah number one is having faith and rashford allah number two allah says in surah chapter number 29 verse number 69 if you strive in the way of allah he will open up your pathways second is striving struggling hard work number three allah says in surah chapter 16 verse 43 and surah chapter number 21 verse number 7 first if you don't know ask the person who's an expert the third is the technique so number one is allah's help second is striving and struggling and hard work number three is technique as far as getting allah's help the more you have faith in allah the more you worship him the more you believe in him the more you have trust in him inshallah he will help you imagine i couldn't have dreamt in my wildest dream of speaking in front of 25 people i could have dreamt of becoming the best surgeon in the world the best doctor in the world but in my wildest dream i could not have dreamt of speaking in front of 25 people because as many of you know that i was a stammerer since childhood and people used to ask me what is my name after that my name is so imagine what i cannot dream when i started doing dawa when i went on the stage i realized that i did not hammer most of the people when they go in front of public they get cold feet for me it was opposite when i speak one to one i used to stammer but in public my stamina vanished then later on when i used to speak one to one to non-muslims even that time i did not stammer with muslims to stamber and slowly slowly alhamdulillah my stamina kept on reducing and yet i stammer off the stage allah helps me alhamdulillah and i'm sure most of the millions of people are watching today most of you may have been multiple times better than what i was when i started my dawah you know allah can make such a person who's a stammerer give lectures where large numbers are attending so why can't you do that i don't think so i've really done any great deed neither have i sacrificed something people tell me oh i'm a fool that i left my medical profession some people come and say oh because you sacrificed your medical profession there is no sacrifice giving up a medical profession as compared to what allah has given me in the field of dawah everything people watching the fame which i which was not the reason why we did it the recognition the head of the state meeting me leaving the medical profession is not even the drop in the ocean and allah gave me the ocean so the basic thing we realize is that you should sacrifice the things that you love for the sake of allah if you sacrifice for the sake of allah if you take one step in the way of allah allah will take multiple times more close to you so number one is sacrifice love allah trust allah have faith in him and then ask an expert as far as we have dhawa training programs where we had in the past where we train people but number one help of allah number two is striving and struggling and last is the training training is not a must i did not get training it was allah who helped me that's the least important and to go to genesis phrase follow the glorious quran and follow the say hadith as much as the implement of the glorious quran as much as you implement of the say hadith and the commandments of the prophet and allah there are more chances that you will enter jannah inshallah"
