  "transcript": "why did Allah create human beings when he was knowing that on the day of judgment a large number of people will go to hell jannam does it not raise the question on the mercy of Allah does Allah purposely wants to keep wants to put a large number of people in hell the question is that why did Allah create the human beings and he knew that on the day of judgment a large number will go to hell the human being is a unique and one of the best creation of Allah unlike the other creations all the other creation they submit the will to Allah 100 whether it be the trees whether it be the Stars whether it be the sun whether it be the animals whether it be the birds all of them a Muslim they submittable to Allah Allah created two Creations the Jinn and the men the Jinn and the human being and the human being is a super decoration that they have a free will of Their Own they can either obey Allah now after Free Will is given if a person obeys the Commandment of Allah obey then follow the Quran and say Hadith he is far superior than a person who has no free will and you obey the command of Allah so human being who has a choice of his own had a free will to obey or disobey Allah and then if he followed the command he is higher even than the angels for the angels have no free will to disability so he has created a new creation and when something you want something which is excelling or of a higher quality the chance of success rate is less for example if you appear for an examination of 10 standard you find that most most of them pass when you go to bachelor's degree yet much most of them passed but lesser as compared to 10 standard if you appear for an mbbs degree the percentage of passing the exam is lesser than people passing the bachelors in arts or in science if you go for MD or DM that's the Doctorate of Medicine again the percent of people who chant who pass is less than the person of people who fail because it's a very difficult examination so here also this is the test that we are undergoing and Allah has given a free will it is not Allah who's purposely putting them in Jannah is giving them the option in fact Allah is merciful and he says that you ask for forgiveness I'll forgive you and Brahman is one of the months that you ask for forgiveness Allah will forgive you if you do anything major thing any Let It Be how big this in him let it be as big as a mountain if you ask for forgiveness and if you repent inshallah Allah will forgive you but we human beings we are ungrateful to Allah you do a mistake we ask for forgiveness Allah forgive that then you go back to the sin so this is the test we are undergoing as Allah says in the Quran in Surah al-imran chapter number three shall ever taste of death and only those who are successful were to achieve the objective of the life and those who enter China this life is nothing but mere play and amusement number 67 verse number two so this life is attached for the Hereafter Allah is most merciful he is very kind we are a unique creation one of the best Christian Allah we undergoing a test imagine if in examination in a medical examination a person write the wrong answer you can't expect the teacher to say oh I'm merciful I will pass you if the teacher passes the people in the medical examination what will they do when they pass instead of treating the patient they will start killing them so you have to follow the rule even though you're merciful you have to see what the result of the Testa and based on that test if you pass you go to Jannah if you fail you go to Jannah hope that answers the question"
