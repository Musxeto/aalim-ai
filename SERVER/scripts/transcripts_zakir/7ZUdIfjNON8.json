  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum is it permissible to pray with her in odd count and also can it be one rakah wither linguistically it means odd and in islamic terminology it refers to the night prayer and when is the wither prayer offered the withdra prayer it can be offered anytime after the isha prayer until just before the fajr prayer you can offer wither any time during this time span and if you fear that you cannot get up just before dawn just before fajr then it is better that you offer it before you go to sleep but if you know that you can get up before dawn for example half an hour before fajr 45 minutes before fajr maybe 20 minutes before fajr then it is better that you offer wither before dawn before the fajr prayer and with her it is the most important prayer after the father prayer the prophet peace be upon him he used to offer with regularly so we should see to it that we offer the withered prayer and normally the withdraw prayer is offered after the qiyam when we fear that dawn will approach then we conclude it with with the prayer now how many rakah can you offer in the wither prayer the wither is basically odd so you can offer one rakah you can offer three rakah you can offer five raka you can offer seven rakah you can offer 11 raka so basically it has to be on if you're offering three raka so there are two ways of offering it the first is that you offer all three rakah together and you do not sit in the second rakah for tasha the second is that you offer two rakah you do tasleem and then you offer one raka if you want to offer five raka you offer it together if you want to offer seven rakah you offer it together and you do the sleep in the last rakah this is the sunnah for beloved prophet muhammad peace be upon him with her it is odd it can be offered one three five seven etc and we should try to offer it into the last third of the night because this is the time when adva it is accepted wherein our prayers will be accepted the last third of the night it is the best time to offer the withered prayer we should offer tahajjud the night prayer and then conclude that with prayer"
