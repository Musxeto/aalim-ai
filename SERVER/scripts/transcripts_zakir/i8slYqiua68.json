  "transcript": "the next question is by yogesh ingole from Kolkata India associating partners with God is the number one majors in as per Islam all Hindus do such worship and Associate partners with God Murthy Puja how will it be a major sin for them as they are not Muslim so if Quran If For All Mankind then such non-muslims who never knew that such a sin exist will not build accountable for the sin and on the day of judgment will they be punished for the yogesh has asked a very important question that the Hindus who don't know about the concept of major sin the concept of fear how will they be held responsible on the day of that Point number one all the major religions if you read the scriptures they talk about monotheism believing in one God whether it be Christianity whether it be Judaism including Islam and including Hinduism if you read the Hindu scripture there are various verses talking about monotheism and talking about not to do shirk foreign God is only one without a second it's mentioned in the sweater upanishad chapter number six verse number nine that of that God you have got no parents you have got no mother you have got no father he has got no supported it's mentioned in the swetha of Punisher chapter number first number 19 of that God there is no pratima pratima is a Sanskrit word which means an image it also means the photograph it means the portrait it meets an idol it means the sculpture it means the statue so here chapter number first number 19 is saying of that God there is no image there is no photograph there is no portrait there is no Idol there is no sculpture there is no statue the similar message is given in their way chapter number three to verse number three where it says of that God there is no image there is no photograph there is no portrait there is no Idol there is no sculpture then it will touch you further it's mentioned in your way chapter number 40 verse number nine and that is they are entering Darkness those who worship the Assam Assam Sanskrit means the natural things like water fire air and there was continues they are entering more in darkness those who worship the sambuti those who worship the created things sambuti miscreated things like table chair Idols Etc so it's clearly mentioned in Hindu scriptures that there is only one God and you should not worship the Natural Things neither should you worship the created things without doubt and the Brahma Sutra of Hinduism is only one God not a second one not at all not at all not in the least bit so if you read the Hindu scripture even the Hindu scriptures believe in one God and Hindu scripture is against adenos worship but unfortunately the pandas and the scholars of Hinduism they hide this from the masses for the personal benefit if you hear my lecture and read my book on simulated Hinduism or you can go to the website zakir9.com you will find all these references and coming to a second part of the question that they may not be aware maybe the Hindu he may not be a practicing Hindu and he may be doing adversible in the scripture Allah says in the Quran clearly in Surah chapter number 41 verse number 53 sanuri himself that soon we shall show them our signs in the furthest region of the horizons until it is clear to them that this is the truth so Allah takes it upon himself that before a human being dies he will give this message that there is only one God and he alone should be worshiped very clearly whether you deliver the message or not for the ideal or the message or not whether we read the Holy scriptures or not Allah has taken it upon himself that he will deliver this message to every human being before the person dies but because of the society the person understands the message but he may say okay for now if I follow Islam I have to give up my business I'm have to stop drinking alcohol I may have to stop cheating so all these Associated factors doesn't allow him to follow the guidance he has received so who's to blame he's to blame and if a person is left alone without any interference he will come to the state path and there was a research done on two types the kapaku tribe and the Australian Aborigines and these two tribes did not come in contact with modern civilization till as late as 1950. and when they went and they did recite they found out that they believed everything same concept of the creator of God like Islam but they didn't call themselves Muslims they believed there was one God they believe that making images of God is wrong they believe idol worship was wrong and for worshiping they did decide that they did prostration it was everything what is in Islam but by name about the concept of God that means if you let a person without any external inference of human beings of teachers or philosophers they will believe in tahit this is the dinner therefore beloved Prophet said every child is born in Dino filter he's born as a Muslim later on he gets convinced by the elders by his parents by his teacher then he may start doing idle worship may start doing fire worship so if no external influence is there he remained on the and whether he gets the message or not Allah will give him the message directly then of course on the day of judgment he will never object to Allah Allah's Justice he'll only say that I don't mind giving the full wealth in the world to you to save me Allah I said it's too late he will only say that please give me one more chance Allah so it's too late so that's the reason every human being should read the scripture read a scripture he'll come to the straight path read the Quran and they should worship only one God and should not associate partners with him"
