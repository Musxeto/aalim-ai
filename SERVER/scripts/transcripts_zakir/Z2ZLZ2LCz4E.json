  "transcript": "a similar question asked by shadab khatri London UK are all the Hadith in fearful authentic is actually a misnomer Siesta means six th it is six books of Hadith a is the right terminology for six books of Hadith foreign authentic books the right terminology is six books of Hadith and this is a Muslim Abu dhab IDI so these six books the scholars they say that if you read these six books of Hadith you will come to know most of the rulings in Islam but the Hadith in all the six books are not 100 authentic the only books in which all the authentic and say bukhari number one then it's a Muslim the remaining four books in these four books most of the Hadith but not all hundred percent so these six books the scholars say if you read and you read the Quran you will come to know most of the ruling in Islam most of it not 100 but most of it there's a small group of Scholars said that instead of they should be Imam tamalik so there's another small group of Scholars say the six books should contain besides say buhari say Muslim it should contain Imam just a small group but we agreed that six books are there if you want to join Imam what the Malik it becomes seven but most of the scholars say that abnormal is included in this so all that Hadith of these sales books only the first two say Muslim and say bukhari all authentic the remaining four majority authentic but not all there is a great scholar of the recent time this is what he did he has divided the last four books into sahih and wife and he differentiated the books of Hadith the last four books foreign foreign in the last four books he's done a great work so this is how you can differentiate"
