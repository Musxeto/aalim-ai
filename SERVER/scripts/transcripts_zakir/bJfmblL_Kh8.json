  "title": "Are Students Exempt from Fasting during Exams? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh next question there a gentleman who says he's an engineer final year would be graduate student his final year examination lies in the month of Ramadan we were talking about last Ramadan I believe his mother and his parents have advised him not observe the fast during the month of Ramadan because it may affect his examination results is he Exempted from fasting on this basis a person who does not want to fast only because of the examination it is not a valid reason even though it may be a final exam and maybe the parents make cooks that don't fast because if you fast then maybe your concentration will go down and the results will become less even if the parents Force at this point of time the child the son or the daughter should not listen to the parents because if the parents tell you something which is against the teacher teing of Allah and his that's the only time where they can disobey the parents Allah says in the Quran inah anab chapter 29 verse number 8 as well as in Sur lman chapter number 31 verse number 15 that if your parents Force you or strive do Jihad to make you worship somebody else besides Allah subhana wa ta'ala do not obey them but yet live with them with love and companionship so here Quran gives you permission because that is not a legitimate reason that because the examination is there they don't want to fast so that they can get good marks getting marks in the doing a farise is more important that is the reason this is not a valid reason and the person should yet fast inshallah Allah will help him and he will do better in the examination the help of Allah is more important than any other help and Allah says in the Quran in Imran chapter number three verse number 160 if Allah helps you none can overcome you if Allah forsakes you who will de then who can help you so let the Believers put their trust in Allah subhana tala so my advice is that even if examination let them fast inshallah the concentration better and they'll get better marks inshallah"
