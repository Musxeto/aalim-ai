  "transcript": "nowadays we find that in the western culture they say that manners is building old age homes islam has got no place for old age homes because islam believes that we should love and respect our parents and there are several verses in the quran so luqman chapter 31 verse number 15 sudan kapoor chapter number 29 verse number eight surah annam chapter number six verse number 151 several verses we say that we have enjoined on the human beings that to be kind and good to your parents and our beloved prophet muslim said it's mentioned say bihari verb number eight in the book of adam chapter number two hadith number two they're the person who approached the prophet and he asked him that who deserves the maximum love and companionship in the world so the prophet said your mother the man asked after that who the prophet again repeated your mother the man asked after that who again the prophet said for the third time your mother the man asked after that too then the prophet said to your father 75 3 4 of the love and companionship goes to the mother 25 percent one fourth goes to the father in short mother gets the gold medal she gets the silver medal as well as the bronze medal the father has to be satisfied with the mere consolation price so islam teaches that we have to love our parents and especially as far as companionship is concerned the mother gets three times more so in islam there is no place for old age homes so whatever manners and etiquettes that we teach our children it should be in line with what our creator allah wants"
