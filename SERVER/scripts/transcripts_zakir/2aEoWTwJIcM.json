  "title": "Do Grandchildren who are Orphans Inherit from their Grandfather? If not then why? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "mom will handle elusive Pakistan do the grandchildren who are orphans have any right on the property and wealth of the grandfather in Islam if not then what is the wisdom behind this ruling the question posed is that if there's a person who has children and if his son or daughter dies and leaves or leaves children so can the grandchildren inherit from the grandfather and most of the most of the people think that okay suppose a person has got five children and one child expired and he has children so whatever his shape of the inheritance can go to the grandchildren this is totally wrong in Islam if a person Tata has children irrespective whether the person's children alive or not the grandchildren do not inherit at all so inheriting from the daughter children the grandchildren from the daughter in all cases the grandchildren from the daughter cannot inherit as far as the grandchildren from the Sun if the person has children and if his son has expired leaving children but his other children alive then the grandchildren from the son also do not inherit anything but if a person has got children and from a son he has got children and all this children expire so if all the children expire then the inheritance goes to the other close relatives so in this case the grandchildren from the son will inherit a portion what is the wisdom the wisdom behind Wygant children do not inherit is because these inheritance the shares have been fixed by allah subhanaw taala irrespective of their children a pious or not as long as their children and then the fault of Islam you have the inherit irrespective whether the pass or the not pass whether they take care of the father not fathered the union these are the portions inherit inheritance prescribed in the Quran in surah nisa chapter number 4 verse number 11 in truth there's one who was in the Quran so reminder chapter 5 was not one ran it where it says that before you die you write down your will in inheritance and this was was revealed before certainly such a performer's nominee was number 11 and 12 so some of the focus some of the scholar face that one this was was revealed of surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 11 and 12 giving the shares of the children of the wives of the husbands and of the mother and the parent in detail that was so surah maida and the other was of inheritance they are applicated some scholars say no it's not abrogated yet it's valid and this year refers to those shares a person is allowed to will one-third of his inheritance to people outside those who are actual inators so this caller said this was in encouraging the people to write there was here the share of inheritance maximum one-third they can rent based on a desire on the Shabbos around true founder will my full probably Prophet said you cannot is around over half he said you cannot so I said maximum you can which is the worst is one-third so one-third that maximum you can will outside those who are your actual inherited as mentioned in the Quran and hadith is one third caller say that these grandchildren who do not are not the actual inheritors you can will up to one-third of your share and I also agreed that this was is not applicated why because this share is mentioned in the Quran is applicable Muslim countries who do not make over even if you don't make a below you make a will in a Muslim country which follows the Islamic law or in India which follows the Muslim person in law it will go as per the Quran and the hadith but in countries like like the Western countries USA UK they don't follow the Islamic sharia so here according to me it is compulsory that every Muslim living in these Western countries should mention in their Vysya the share what should be given to the children or to their wives etc as per the Quranic principle and again here they can will one-third of their property to work what they want outside the inheritance so here again the logic here is that if you have children you cannot give them more or less but if you have grandchildren whose parents have expired have died you either grandfather can will them one-third which is a good amount so logic here is and encouraged for those people whose children have expired leaving grandchildren that they bequeathed some of their share to the to the grandchildren so here the logic I believe is that you're seeing the financial situation of the grandchildren the grandfather or the grandmother they can be quit they can write in their inheritance I share according and it can be much more than the share of the other children imagine if as ten children and one of them expires and has got two grandchildren and he feels that the nine of my children are there they can take care of my grandchildren what about this one daughter whose children have died I mean who daughter who are died and the children a life so here he can even will up to one-third so I believe this is a hamdullah good opportunity where a bigger portion of the wealth if they can father wishes again mother wishes again pain wishes can give to the grandchildren"
