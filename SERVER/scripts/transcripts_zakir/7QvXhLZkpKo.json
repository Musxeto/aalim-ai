  "transcript": "next question from Muhammad zisha in Pakistan here in my local area mosques are open but they are not following precautionary measures regarding covet 19. my family members are insisting me to pray at home what should I do the question poses by brother in Pakistan that in his locality the Moss open but his family members fear that the most are not maintaining the precautionary method that should be done for the covid-19 disease and they are asking him not to attend the prayers in the mosque as far as if the mosques are open and the government Authority feels that there is no problem it must keep being open if it's open it is compulsory for a Muslim male that he should offer a five-time Salah in congregation in the mosque there is no excuse if the mosques are closed by the government where they think it is dangerous and then if you pray at home in jamaat it is accepted but if the mosque are open you have no excuse not to go for prayers just because your family members are concerned if your family members are concerned what you can do you can take the extra precautionary methods if you feel that you may get infected you take a precaution number one see to it that you carry your own sajjada you carry your own prayer mat in India Pakistan is called a musallah you carry your own musallah your own prayer might your own sajada number one because that is the most important because when people pray on the common carpet or the prayer mat of the mosque some other person comes and prays the and if a person infected prayers earlier and in your sujud in your sajdah you are there for at least 15 20 30 seconds at that time if you if your nose is on the same place where the nose of infected person was there there are high chances of getting infected so number one precaution is that you carry your own sajjada carry your own musallah carry your own prayer mat number two see to it that you wear a face mask number three please do not scratch your face or your nose or your mouth there are high chances you may infect yourself if your hand has touched certain infection number four carry your hand sanitizer with you so in case of emergency you can sanitize your hand number five see to it that you do wudu at home don't do in the mosque don't go to the washroom in the mosque go to the washroom at your home that is number fifth number six is you try and minimize your time spent in the mosque you can pray your sunna Salah before the first Salah at your home and that is recommended by a prophet number eight you can pray the Sunnah Salah after the far Salah coming back at home you need not pray the Sunnah Salah before the first Allah and after the first Salah in the mosque so that number nine you minimize your time spent in the mosque number 10 see to it you don't shake hand with anyone in the mosque see to it that you do not stay close to a person for long taking all these precautions for the woman it's not compulsory for them to go to the mosque so they can pray at home for the elderly people above the age of 65 if they have certain difficulties and health is not good if they say that I don't want to go to the mosque is accepted because we have come from medical science that people of elderly ages their chances of when contacted when contacted with the disease their chances of dying is much higher as compared to a younger person so if the mosca open there's no excuse for you not to go to the mosque a beloved Prophet said that tie your camel and trust in God tying your camel you take the precautions they've mentioned and Trust in Allah because if Allah wants to protect you no one no disease can harm you that's what a beloved Prophet said there is no adwa there is no contagious disease meaning there is no contagious diseases then you can acquire without the permission of Allah if only Allah Wills will you get the disease if anyone wants everyone in the world wants and if Allah wants to protect you you'll get protected and if anyone wants to save you all the doctors in the world and if Allah wants to see through that you get the diseases no one can protect you so what we have to do follow the advice of the Prophet tie your camel and trust in God take precautions but if the Moss are open it is compulsory for a Muslim male that he should go and pray in jamaat in the mosque"
