  "transcript": "as i was saying our beloved prophet muhammad said it's to say hadees which is mentioned in hadith number 224 our beloved prophet said is obligatory on every muslim seeking knowledge is obligatory on every muslim man or woman now when we give knowledge to our children we have to see to it that we give them proper knowledge knowledge can be broadly divided into two types one is the basic knowledge of islam and second knowledge what is required by the community it is the duty of every parent that he should educate the children with the proper islamic knowledge number one most important is tahit and we should not associate partners with anyone to allah allah should not be associated with anyone else tahit number one then all the pillars which most of us know but we should impart it in the right way to our children about salah about zakat about hajj about fasting it's very important and but natural knowledge of the quran this quran is the last and final revelation of allah which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon you yesterday in bradford i had a talk on al-quran should it be read with understanding and i told there that the best gift that a parent can give to the child is the quran and make the child understand the quran most of us muslims we teach our children to read arabic they can read arabic but they can't understand if we teach them the language of the quran the arabic as a language that is the best gift you can give and inshallah towards the end of my talk i will deal and discuss with that in detail the second type of knowledge is the knowledge required by the community knowledge which makes a person a doctor makes a person an engineer a lawyer a scientist an agriculturist this is too required for the betterment of the community for the betterment of the society but when we are acquiring the second type of knowledge we should see to it that when we acquire scientific knowledge when we learn about mathematics geography history this knowledge should get you closer to allah should not take you away from allah if this knowledge takes you away from allah that knowledge is not correct knowledge it's not correct education it should bring you closer to allah for example when we learn medicine we learn how to save the lives of thousands of human beings but in that same medical knowledge when we learn how to do abortion there are youngsters who are doing zinna and then they want to bot so using this knowledge for activities which are wrong we should abstain from that abortion for saving the life of the mother if she has a health problem islam gives permission otherwise allah says in surah chapter number 17 verse number 31 and surah anam chapter number 6 verse number 151 that killed not your children for want of sustenance killing of children is prohibited so whatever knowledge you acquire it should be for the betterment of humanity and get you closer to allah whatever moral values we are learning we should see to it that when we put our children in the school that school should bring the children properly imagine if we put our children in the condiment school many of those values don't match with the value of allah subhanahu wa it is like we are tying the hands and legs of our children and putting them in water and asking them to swim how is this one so when we put them in a school see to it you put them in a proper school if the culture and society and the school teaches you manners it should be good islamic manners"
