  "transcript": "the next question another question from Ali from Malaysia basically from the Gambia the European Union is putting pressure on the Muslim country the Gambia to accept gay and lesbian rights to do anything they want if they want to marry etc our government if silent or the issue so can you help us by the help of Allah because you have voice and many people listen to you this is a very important question as by Ali who's living in Malaysia and originally from the Gambia and this is a common practice by many of the powerful countries mainly the Western countries they put pressure on the weaker countries to follow the agenda and one of the pressure they're putting lately is proceed to it that they make all the countries including the Muslim countries to agree on the concept of homosexuality to agree with the concept of gay lesbian transgender and to make it legal and this is coming and we find that they they put fresh economic pressure they put pressure by business and other pressures and as far as Gambia's concerned I've been to Gambia few times and alhamdulillah I was very close to the earlier pressure in the previous president of the Gambia and his name was dr. Elahi Jami and and I spoke to him on this issue and he asked me this question when I met him in the first time in 2014 the first I met and he told me that what is your view that the European country are willing to give 30 million euros to Gambia but the condition is that we should make homosexuality legal and I told him it is haram and a vanilla without batting is already that yes that for the win I consider and I told them that take your money back I don't want this money because homosexuality Haram and I will never make it legal in my country al hamdulillah my Allah has graced I have met several heads of state several presidents and prime ministers of various countries and many of the Muslim countries and some are less flows from more clothes and the previous president of the Gambia or rather the Islamic Republic of Gambia it was called at this time he is one of the few heads of states who was very close to me and whenever I meet the head of state I try and give whatever advice I can so that they come closer to Quran they can prove the talisman Alcala and another messenger and amongst heads of state the person who has followed maximum Islamic and why they gave if the previous president of Gambia dr. al Haj Jana Jamie and hamdulillah may Allah subhana WA Ta'ala bless him and may he grant agenda and because it was close to me many of the Western world were against and I feel because we follow some of advice he was forced to leave his position and you know that in the last relation that took place in 2016 December and one month later that he was forced to leave his position and you know how the politics work all the non-muslim countries you know UFA etcetera they got together and they put pressure and they appoint somebody else and though they call it a democratic election first of all the pumping money they try and rig the election and they try and remove the person whose Islamic and they were successful in removing he has been ruling he has been elected as the president for the last 25 years he was very popular but they have debates and they've done that not only in Gambia too many countries many of the Muslim countries when they know that the person who is on the chair is more Islamic than the other they support opposition and they try and remove him and if with all the strategy if they fail and yet the Muslim the person was more Islamic wins the election what they do they do a coup very common and we know lately a few years back they're in a coup in Turkey and I hung my last grace they weren't able to overthrow Alderaan who yet mashallah it was the prime mission now is the president of Turkey mashallah with Allah support so when they find a person who's an Islamic person who wants to be an Islamic change in the country these Western countries they get together and they attacked economically socially by media and therefore they're doing today any Muslim leader who's more Islamic that I and that's what they did to the previous president of Gambia I am NOT saying that you are the very practicing Muslim he had no false I knew him very well they were false but mashallah compared to many of the other leaders mashallah he he was a practicing Muslim mashallah there were faults in him and I guided him and gave many and by then I lose Anila by Allah's grace most of the advice that I gave he followed and maybe that was the reason that he couldn't stay in power in that country and repeated a response Allah that these non-muslim countries who gather together and they try and pressure the Muslim countries are weak as I mentioned earlier in my previous session we all the Muslim countries to unite how there were UN United Nation organization we should have a United Muslim organization you and Mo all the Muslim country to be united and should be united on the basis of Quran and say hadith and secret that we should be a strong force and we should not let these Western or these non-muslim countries put pressure and forces to implement what is Haram in our country and there are many Muslims who willingly just to stay in power they agree with them they do her I'm activities in the country they're willing to sell they can't be there long as they remain in power so what these Western non-muslim do they select a Muslim ooh secular The Selecter Musa Moon are a practicing Muslim and they support him so that the country can go far away from Islam we pray de las manos Allah that may help our Muslim countries so that we can again be the toilers of the world"
