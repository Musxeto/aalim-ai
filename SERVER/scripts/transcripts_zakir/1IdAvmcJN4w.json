  "transcript": "why is it that some people that often when you're speaking to people they say oh my Dua hasn't been answered you know this is a common statement by the Muslim brothers and sisters you meet around the place why is it that certain supplications perhaps are not answered there are certain criteria that required and many of time the supplication is rejected because Point number one maybe the earnings is Haram what is eating is Haram maybe the earnings where he's driving all his lifestyle maybe his business Haram maybe involved in RBA user interest he may be dealing in a business which involves bribing may be dealing in a business which involves lying cheating Etc all these things which are related with Haram things that's the reason it one of the major reasons my supplication is not UN number two maybe he's oppressing someone else causing oppression to another human being number three he may not be enjoying what is good and may not be forbidding what is wrong which is a in Islam and there are some other criteria required for a supplication to be accepted and that's the reason why most of them are rejected one is that we should not say that oh Allah forgive me if you please oh Allah bless me if you please or oh Allah grant me sustain if you please because I beloved Prophet M wasallam he said it's mentioned in s bukari Vol number n in the book ofed Hadith number 7 477 where the Prophet said that do not supplicate do not Pray by saying that oh Allah forgive me if you wish oh Allah grant me mercy if you wish oh Allah give me from your Bounty if you wish because Allah subhana ta'ala he does what he wills and you cannot command him so saying such things is totally wrong which many people do which is a big mistake that the reason the supplication un answered further more people many a time they give names to Allah subhana wa ta'ala which Allah never mentioned in the Quran neither the prophet used any of the had they call Allah subhana tala which attributes the names which are not given by Allah and his that is totally wrong by supplicating furthermore many people when they supplicate they add on on many names and many things for example they say that please forgive my father my grandfather my great-grandfather my mother my grandmother my great grandmother my uncle my auntie keep on you know it become big list instead of that it's preferable to be brief and say that please forgive my family or please forgive my relatives or my brothers and sisters in Islam that's sufficient and one of the other mistakes that people make is they normally supplicate very loudly you know very loud supplicate where Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 7 verse number 55 that ask to Allah subhah wa ta'ala with humility and privacy Allah says in the next verse in Surah 7:56 that call to Allah with fear and longingness so these are the basic mistakes that people make when they supplicate and furthermore many of time when we ask something from Allah subhana wa tala we may follow all the things but yet Allah does not answer our prayers Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 216 that you may dislike a thing which may be good for you and you may like a thing which may not be good for you Allah knows and you do not know there may be a situation where a Muslim may pray to Allah subhana tala that Allah subhana tala give me a motorcycle a BMW I want a BMW th000 C and Allah does not answer his prayer because Allah knows that if Allah gives him a BMW he may go fast he may have accident he may facture his leg so Allah subhana wa ta'ala by not answering his prayer is actually answering him so Allah subhana tala is the knower of the Unseen of the future so he like a thing which may not be good for you Allah knows and you do not know"
