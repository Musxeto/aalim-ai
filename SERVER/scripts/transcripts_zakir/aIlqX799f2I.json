  "transcript": "my name is sarwana kumar i'm working in a bank i understood many hinduism not only because most of the hindus doesn't know what vedas is but do you agree all vedas scriptures and weathers chapters everything is it correct then some section of the people in hindu only learning that vedas not many hindus are learning they are not allowed to learn but those religion leaders also not practicing the same what the weather says is it correct then why they are doing like that please answer me thank you that's a good question the first question what do i believe with everything about the vedas say point number two the vedas only a selected few hindus learned people they read others are prevented from reading why point number one do i believe in everything of the veda if you and life allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 13 verse number 38 allah says that we have sent revelation in every age in every age we have central revelation by name only four are mentioned the quran torah zaboor and the quran the quran is the last and final revelation of allah subhana wa which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad now the person who asked me in bombay also that can i consider veda to be the word of god do i consider veda totally to be correct see by name only four are mentioned torah zabu injeer and quran but there were many books revealed by allah now regarding veda can i consider the word of god since veda has not mentioned my name in the quran on any authentic hadith i cannot say for sure that it is the word of god i can say maybe it is maybe it is maybe maybe not but even if veda was the word of god it was meant for those people and for that time today we have to follow the last and final revelation that is the glorious quran for the whole of humankind regarding your question do i believe everything in the veda who write the book with their own hands and then say this from allah to traffic with it for a miserable price woe to those for what they earn go to those for what they write now we realize that all the previous scriptures of almighty god by the passage of time they have got corrupted they have been changed today we don't have the injury in the pure form the bible that we have it is not the injury which was revealed to israel they have changed in passage of time so even if veda was the word of god today it has not maintained its pure form and all the hindu scholars they agree so allah says in surah chapter 15 verse number 9 that we have revealed the quran and we shall guide from corruption quran is also called as the furqan the criteria to judge right from wrong so what i say that whatever is matching with the quran in the vedas i accept it to be true what doesn't match i leave it aside because veda hasn't maintained its pure form according to hindu scholars so what i say whatever matches with quran i say i've got no objection this part may be the word of god but i don't agree everything of the vedas there are many unscientific points in the veda i can give a talk on that which i don't intend giving i can give hundreds of unscientific things mentioned in the vedas so what i say that this is the furkan the criteria you check with this if it matches with this we agree it to be that part as to be true hope to answer the question you"
