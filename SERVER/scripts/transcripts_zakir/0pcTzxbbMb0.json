  "title": "Is it Permissible to Call Kaafir a Kaafir? â€“ Fariq Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "we will take the last question asan from lahore pakistan he asks is it permissible to call kafir a kafir the word kafir is derived from the root word kufr which means to reject to conceal or to hide linguistically the word kafir means to reject to conceal or to hide in islamic terminology kafir means a person who rejects or hides the truth of islam so a non-muslim in arabic he's called as a kafir so when a person is speaking arabic if he is referring to the non-muslim he will call them a kafir so it is permissible to call a non-muslim a kafir because this word kafir if you translate it into english it refers to as a non-muslim so as i said linguistically it means to reject to conceal or to hide like the farmer he hides the seeds but in islamic terminology it refers to someone who rejects or hides the truth of islam non-muslim in arabic he is called as a kafir if the kafir or the non-muslim they do not like this terminology of kafir then i would request them to accept islam and we will stop referring them as a kafir that is a non-muslim"
