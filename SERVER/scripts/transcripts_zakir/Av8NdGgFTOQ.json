  "title": "Why Islam not Believe in Idol Worship? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh good evening to Dr Zach and everybody present here uh before I say anything I just want to say that what am I asking I do not mean any disrespect to anybody and to anyone I'm a very young person so please excuse me if I say anything inappropriate my question is uh since as as sorry I was heard and know and I've seen around me that Islam does not believe in idol worship so I want to know what are the reasons for non-believing idol worship that's my first question why Islam doesn't believe in ideal worship the reason Islam doesn't believe in worship because it is prohibited Point number one you cannot make Idol of God the moment you make an idol of God you're degrading God imagine you make Idol and suppose Idol Falls what happens to the ideal Idol breaks if the idol cannot help itself how can it help me so but my point here is that if there's an idol of God it might not be the actual actual God that that actually exists but if it helps me in focusing My Worship towards him if it helps me in actually uh in increasing my focus when I'm actually praying to him don't you think it is correct brother said that if that Idol has been focusing God isn't it good for him but when God says don't make Idol of me and yet you tell me it helps me in focusing on God is it right or is it wrong if you love God will you obey God or not if you love God you have to obey him suppose you're working in a company and the boss tells you the boss tells you that come on time you have to come at 10 o'clock sharp you say no if I come 11 o'clock I will sleep I'll be more fresh crazy right or is it wrong that's wrong then some people come at 10 some people live in some people dress no no but you know I know I can work better some people come at one o'clock some people come at two o'clock do you think the company will function correctly no I love my boss very much the boss says come on time 10 o'clock Miss ten o'clock if you don't love your boss then you may come late and maybe write in the register I've come on type that's cheating so God has clearly mentioned in the Quran that idol worship is prohibited it's even Mr in the Hindu scriptures clearly it says as I mentioned earlier in chapter number four verse number 19 in chapter 3 to verse number three of that God there is no pratima there is no image there is no photograph there is no painting there is no portrait there is no Idol there is no sculpture there is no statue so when God is saying there's no statue no sculpture you say no no to concentrate I require God this who says that the Hindu Pandit when I speak to the Pandit that it's clearly mentioned in the way that idler worship is wrong what they say no no initially when you're on the initial stages at the lower level you require Idol to concentrate when you reach the highest stage higher Consciousness idle is not required so I tell the Hindu Pandit the Muslims have already reached the higher consciousness sir so but if it is helping helping me in any way why would God say that do not do it because they're degrading God I am asking your boss comes at ten o'clock no it's helping me if I come at 11 o'clock I'm feeling happy so the boss will tell you if it's helping you get out of this company go and join some other company someone comes at 10 someone 11 someone 12. your employee you take up at 10 o'clock I mean employer says I will come at 12 o'clock I feel happy I feel good about it I'm praising you very good boss will you like it every day says my boss is very good my boss is very good you know that's me you know Rosary my boss is very good either employee comes at two o'clock in the afternoon my boss is very good my boss is very good the boss will say bye you stop praising me you come on time and do your work rather than praising me so your God your creator has told you in your scripture Hindu scripture in the Christian scripture in the Muslim scripture don't make Idol you're degrading God God is so powerful you're making an idol out of and who makes an idol who makes it human being so God will tell I have created the human beings not the human beings are creating me what nonsense it is when God is telling you don't require I did concentrate on God without Idol so we are not creating God when we are making an idol and I'm and I think that we're not degrading him when we make an idol it's just that if you make a form of him and and assume it's a it's a there's a part of him even if it's not there what is mentioned in your Vedas so I am no I am not an Hindu so I do not believe in the various what are you are you Christian James believe in God yes should they do do you know Jennifer Lord mahavira he's not God you don't know your Jainism sir I might know it no not sure if Jainism is an atheistic religion you're mixing Hinduism so I claim that I'm not in Hinduism I know you're not a Hindu but if you are a Jain and you are saying mahavir is God where is it mentioned in your giant scripture is God he's a truth yes sir he is he's not God so but then we worship him and all the others but he is not God did mavi tell that you should worship Him and like that I have not read I don't know that's why I'm telling you you don't know what mahavir said and you're saying isn't it your duty that you should find out what mahavira said yes sir it is that means you're an illogical person sir when you join a company don't you follow the rules and regulation of the company yes sir Jainism is an atheistic religion they believe that someone who comes in life dying birth birth death birth death if you are free from the cycle when you don't have any negative or positive you get Nirvana Moksha there are 24 people who have attained Moksha according to Jainism and mahavir is the 24thanka yes sir 24th he's not God yes sir so that means you don't know your mahavir you don't know Jainism so how can I talk to you about anything sir I'm not talking here that so what I'm asking is that if is idol worship so what you're telling me is that what because it's mentioned in the Quran that iron worship is wrong mentioned in Bible no it is mentioned Quran mentioned in Bible mentioned Hindu scriptures that idea worship is wrong so where do you get this philosophy from so so am I saying my point is that we are assuming here that if Quran is actually what God has told so that means that that's what idol worship is wrong if I say that if I argue it might be a pointless argument but if I argue that Quran is not the the word the words of God then what is the what is the actual logic that why idol worship is very good so what is the word of what you have to tell me if Quran is not the word of God then which is the word of God I do not know that's why you don't know I know now so you follow me if you don't know you ask a teacher now a student tells the teacher two plus two is not equal to four teachers say what is it I don't know have you seen my tips no sir this is the first time attending you I you yes about science were you paying attention so maybe I was not present in the whole that time I'm can you which answer is that if you are not available what I request you you go and see my video because it is the Quran God's word my DVD can you repeat the name is the Quran God's word is the Quran God's word and inshallah if you watch it with an open mind you will inshall accept that Quran is the word of God you will believe that there is one God who doesn't have any Idol and inshallah you'll accept it so go and see that David it's a four hour DVD and inshallah if you have any queries you can write to my email Zakir if.net thank you sir [Music]"
