  "title": "Is it Permissible for a Non-Muslim to Fast? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "fasting is a Muslim only prerogative is that correct that's right it is compulsory only for a Muslim to fast it is not a requirement for a non-muslim or unbeliever to Fast and the reason is that Allah says in the Quran Allah says in Surah n chapter number 24 verse number 39 that the Deeds of a non-believer a person who's a non-muslim the Deeds of an unbeliever is like a mirage in a desert and the Thirsty person thinks that there is water but when he reaches there he does not find anything else but he finds Allah and Allah will pay him for his deeds and Allah is Swift in taking of accounts that means in the Hereafter the unbeliever for his deeds he will get nothing and Allah is Swift in taking of accounts so for unbeliever all the Deeds they are useless in the yearafter because all the Deeds have have to be accompanied with the intention and as we discussed yesterday that one of the criteria an important Criterion for a person fast to be accepted is the ni it is intention and the intention is that the fast should only be for Allah subhana wa tala and no one else so if a non-muslim if unbeliever who does not believe in Allah subhana wa tala where is the question of him doing the Nia doing the intention of fasting for Allah so that's the reason it is not required for unbeliever to fast if he fast without the intention it will just be like anything else it will not be an act of worship it not be a fast as is considered in Islam so therefore the ni the intention is very important so for unbeliever any act of worship until he has Faith until he believes until he believes that there is only one Allah subhana wa taala unless he says the Muhammad that there's no God but Allah and Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the messenger of Allah all acts of worship they're useless for the Hereafter but the moment a non-believer a person who's not a Muslim he accepts Islam for him it becomes obligatory if he accepts Islam in the middle of the month of Ramadan from that moment onwards fasting becomes compulsory for him but the past Allah will not take into account Allah says in the Quran Allah says in Surah anfal chapter number 8 verse number 38 that say to the unbelievers that if they start believing the past will be forgiven that means the moment a non-muslim accepts Islam all his pasts will be forgiven but the moment he accepts Islam from that time it becomes obligated on him to fast"
