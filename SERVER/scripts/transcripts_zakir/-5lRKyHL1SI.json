  "transcript": "the viewer says I pray Twi in the mosque behind the Imam but I want to pray more Raa in should I avoid Witter behind the Imam or should I pray the Witter behind the Imam and later repeat my Witter as far as the practice and the saying of is concerned I beloved Prophet said it's mention Abu da number one book of Salah Hadith number 1 1370 the Beloved prophet he said that when the people asked him to stay longer and pray more so he said that a person who prays with the IM till he ends it is as though he has prayed for the full night and the other Hadith of s bukari number one in the book of Salah Hadith number 472 which says that when the person asks the prophet about Prophet said that you have to pray two raat followed by two raat then two raat then two raat and when you fear Dawn coming then pray one raat and the other says that you can pray as much as you wish so based on these two Hadith the best person can have two options one is that he has to pray till the end of the Imam he can't come away from the Salah and not off of because then he will not be as the prophet said he would not be like a person pray till the end along with the Imam as the Hadith of Abu da 1370 says that if he prays till the end along with the Imam as he prayed the full night so the best is he prays along with the Imam also prays with and then afterwards later on if he wants to offer tud T the same as mean waking up again so he goes home he sleeps and he wakes up again he can again pray but he should not offer with because there's no two wi there's only one with or the other option is is that he prays along with the Imam and when the Imam in the last ra of V when he ends his Salah this person should get up and pray one moreat so when he pray one moreat it doesn't become with and when he goes home prays the tud and then prays the with here he's following the Hadi he's praying till the end with the Imam so he get theab of praying for the full night and then he goes home and he prays and the with is normally the last pray is preferable so he goes home and he again prays the tud and after tud he prays the V that the second option which is preferable but the first those fine"
