  "title": "Islam Prohibits Killing Innocent People - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "uh my name is sha I'm a psychology student okay previously doctor mentioned that Allah is God and not just for the Muslims but also for the non-muslims for the blacks for the whites as Doctor quoted earlier so okay I can accept that Allah is God for everybody but there was an incident a few years ago uh on this date called September 11 when there were two towers which were filled with American citizens um I would presume that they were of the Christian faith these American citizens and these two towers were knocked down by an aeroplane which was hijacked and controlled by from what I have heard uh controlled by Muslims so in that sense what I see is that the brother is killing the brother and uh I just want to know what doctor has to say about that sister asked a very good question referring to 911 September 11 just just passed away a couple of weeks back that the Twin Tower was there it was knocked on by a plane there were majority Christian in it knocked down what she heard and she's very clear masallah she heard that Muslim control the plane sister till now it's only a hypothesis it's a hypothesis that Muslims were there it was 19 Arabs who hijacked the plane and they band to the Twin Towers according to 75 scientists American all of them Christian according to 75 American scientist and professors if you have seen the documentary Loose Change no Loose Change is the documentary made by a young American he takes interviews and these 75 scientist and professors say that we cannot ever believe that 19 Arabs can hijack a plane and knock into the Twin Towers it is an inside job done by the White House White House you know white house now I hear everything I'm hearing from the news Arabs have done it I'm hearing from news that Muslims have done it they found the passport of an Arab in the plane crash which burned the pillars and all the iron rods but did not burn the passport of the Arab so someone wrote that next time they should make the army suit of the Americans in that passport material I've given a full lecture on it's terrorism Muslim Monopoly it is so effective my lecture is so effective that the Western of don't want to be in the country today my lecture is so effective so logical these people these Americans I'm quoting I'm only giving you statistics that they had an interview with the person who made the Twin Towers he said it's impossible that the fuel of the plane can melt the Twin Tower and if you see the photograph it was the Twin Tower came in stages as though there were bombs planted in advance there are many hypothesis for example there's a boy who's speaking on the mobile mother mother I mark bhang I'm Mark bang speaking point to be noted that that time in 911 2001 more than 10 years back mobile could not reach that level Point number one point number two when the son speak to the mother why will you say Mark bang when I will speak to my mother I say Zak I'll not say I'm Zakir Nik speaking when I speak to my mother I say I'm Zakir I'll not say Zakir Nik so what you realize they're trying to make a story and blame and that person on the mobile told the mother that it was Muslims so all these documentaries you see loose chain fenite many documentaries if you ask me who did it I would say I don't know but as a logical person The Logical proof of loose change is much more logical than the proof given to me by the American government and then they want to attack Afghanistan Afghanistan give me proof they want to give proof to Mush why and I speak so openly westerners believe in Freedom of people but they don't like my talk so what they do they prevent me to enter in the country I'm telling you let's have a dialogue as far as the question is concerned who did it keep it aside I know that there were more than 3,000 human beings who were killed in Twin hours if you want the Islamic answer as I mentioned in my talk as for sur MAA chapter number five verse number 32 if anyone kills any other the human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though it's killed the all of humanity so whoever did the Twin Towers whoever did it whether it was inside job whether American did or Muslim did whoever did it it is wrong prohibited Haram I condemn it you that Muslim did I I don't know whoever did it whether Muslim or non-muslim American XY Z whoever did more than 3,000 Americans killed even if there were non-americans in it it is Haram I also go on to say more than 50 people were killed in the tube blast of London in London T blast some say 52 some say 54 so I say more than 50 when more than 50 people were killed I condemn it in Bombay where they were trained Bomb Blast in 2006 more than 180 people were killed I condemn it but I don't put a full stop there I also say that I condemn the thousands of innocent people kill in Afghanistan in Palestine in Iraq now coming to the secret coming to the secret now I condemn 3,000 Americans killed everyone is happy I condemn more than 50 people killed in London Tube blast everyone is happy I condem more than 180 people kill in mumbay everyone is happy but when I say I condemn the thousands of inim people kill in Afghanistan in Iraq and Palestine the Home Secretary of UK doesn't like it so she bans me freedom of speech when you want to criticize the prophet of Islam Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam freedom of speech and I said I condemn the innocent people killed in Afghanistan you know I'm careful you know because I'm a debater because if I say thousands of people oh Zakir is supporting terrorist in Afghanistan so I'm going out of my way to say thousands of innocent people killed in Afghanistan there may be terrorist allaham I don't know so I'm so careful when I said America I didn't say innocent American as any American you kill I condemn in the Twin Towers in the London mom blast in the Bombay mom blast but in Afghanistan I said innocent so it doesn't go down the thrat you know why because Zakir gets large audiences now today the media wants to Maly Islam but if they have a person who's clarifying the picture of Islam they want to ban him let's have a come to come in terms so as far as killing innocent people sister whoever did it is to be condemned but don't follow the media the media today is the most powerful weapon in the world it can convert black into white can convert day into night hero into a villain villain into a hero that's why I said Doctor from what I have heard I agree your question was very I'm not sure you're not sure I'm not sure I I don't think anybody I thank you you're not like the American very good and neither are you like the neither are you like the Home Secretary of UK question question was very clear and my answer is clear whoever did it it is wrong killing any innocent people and just one more I like to give and incidence when I gave a talk in Bombay on is Terror the Muslim Monopoly I gave a talk after the train Bomb Blast the police of Bombay told me Zakia popular among the Muslim I don't give a talk and the Muslim said only Zak is truthful he can talk to the police so I was on the edge of the sword both are telling me to give a talk and I told there while was guiding even the police and the Muslim umah that when you have a doubt about a Muslim and you arrest a few no problem you are rounding up 3,000 Muslims just to catch few terrorist whether you catch those 5 10 terrorist or not you're creating another 100 terrorist if you really have doubt and proof regarding few Muslims catch you he'll cooperate with you but in M you're catching Muslims youngsters and few years back before 2006 in the early part of 2000 there was a genocide a massacre of the Muslims in Gujarat thousands of Muslims were killed thousands of Muslim women were raped and in retaliation that's what the media says in word commerce retaliation there was Bomb Blast in Bombay so one Hindu gets up and tells me Dr Zak Nik if I would have been in the place of a Muslim and if thousands of Muslim were killed and if my mother was raped I would do the same thing what the Muslims have done here and the people started to clap I said brother what you're behaving is like a normal human being emotional I agree with you normal but as a Muslim cannot do that because my religion does not permit me to do that my religion does not permit me to kill a single innocent human being even if some Hindus in Gujarat have killed Muslims it does not give me permission to kill a innocent Hindu living in Bombay I cannot do it I know you're emotionally even I have emotion but I cannot follow my emotion because my Quran does not permit me it does not permit me if I catch the culprit in Gujarat and give him to the law and punish him no problem but retaliating by killing a innocent human being in Bombay imagine the family of that person innocent person who's killed will 100% always be enemy of Islam I'm here to spread peace so in Islam you cannot get emotionally and go against the law of the Creator the law of the Creator is very clear that you cannot kill any innocent human being if you kill even one innocent human human being it's as though you have killed the whole of humanity and if you save one innocent human being whether Muslim or non-muslim it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity hope the answer the questions thank you doctor thank you"
