  "title": "Why are We Created? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "now let's try and answer this question the purpose of creation from a different angle from the angle of the creation from the angle from the perspective of the human being that why have the human beings being created by almighty God and the reply to this question is given in the Quran in Sur chapter number 7 verse number 172 and verse number 173 Allah says that he brought out from the loins of Adam's children may peace be upon him all the descendants and asked them that am I your lord and all said we testify that you are our Lord and Allah continues lest on the day of judgment they will say we were unaware that you are our Lord or lest they may say that our ancestors they worshiped somebody else they did shik they associated partners and we just followed them so they are the Liars we should not be blamed so Allah subhana wa ta'ala before the human beings came in this world Allah subhana wa tala B all the human beings from the loins of the children of Adam and asked them who is the Lord and all of them testified that there's one Allah subhana wa taala and he's our Lord and now is our test in this world Allah says in the Quran and I started my talk bying the verse of the Quran from Surat chapter number 51 verse number 56 Allah says that we have created the Jin and the men not but to worship me that we have created the Jin and the men not but to worship me the purpose of creation of the human beings and the Gin is to worship Allah subhana wa ta'ala now this word worship if you Analyze This English word it is derived from the old English V Skype which means to honor and if you read the new living Websters in Copic dictionary it says that worship means Act of devotion honoring the diety devotional acts honoring the diety and if you translate into Arabic the Arabic word is the Arabic word for worship is it will derive from the root word AB which means a slave and it is the duty of the slave to be obedient to all the wills and wishes of the master so IB means total submission to the will of the Creator Allah subhana wa taala I means total submission to the will and wishes of the Creator Allah subhana wa taala and further if we analyze that even one of the forms of worship as mentioned in the English dictionary is glorification as Allah says in the Quran in Surah anas chapter number 110 verse number three Allah says that means glorify the Praises of the Lord glorify the Praises of the Lord so one form of worship is glorification of the creator of Allah subhana wa taala and one may ask that why do Allah subhana wa ta'ala require the human beings to glorify him is Allah subhana wa tala dependent on the Praises of the human beings see irrespective if all the human beings praise Allah subhana wa ta'ala it will not make him Superior and if not a single human being praise him yet it will not diminish him he's the same whether you say Allah abbar a thousand times or million times it will not make Allah greater or if you don't say Allah abbar also it will not make him less he's the greatest he'll Remain the greatest and Allah says in the Quran in Surah F 35:1 15 that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala doesn't require the human beings it is we who require him it the human beings who require him and he's worthy of all Praises Allah subh does not requires creation it is the Creations who requ Allah subhana wa taala and he's worthy of all Praises so the question is why does he require us to praise him the reason is it is for our own benefit because it is a human tendency that if we praise a person if a person is famous we tend to follow his advice for example if your mother is suffering from a heart problem and there are two options there one option who you have is the best doctor in the world number one very famous everyone knows him number one other person is just a plain mbbs doctor and you have the option of going to any of them both are giving free treatment who will you go to but naturally go to the one who's very famous number one in the world the heart specialist and whatever advice he gives you because he's world famous and you even acknowledge Him to be the greatest amongst all the doctors you will follow his advice that is the reason when we praise subhana wa ta'ala and call him he's the greatest he's the most merciful he's the most kind the moment we praise him whatever advice he has given us in the last and final Revelation the Glorious Quran or whatever advice he has given us through his Messengers and the last and final messenger Prophet malli wasallam we will follow it so the reason we praise him is not for the benefit of Allah subhana wa ta'ala he does not require Praises it is for our own benefit the moment we praise him oh he's the greatest he's the most wise oh he's telling you not to have alcohol then you stop having alcohol the moment you agree that he's the most wise he's the greatest he's the most merciful immediately whatever advice he gives you it human tendency we follow the advice of the person who's the greatest so that's the reason we praise him for our own benefit and that's the reason Allah says in the Quran inah chapter number 20 verse number 14 that verily I am Allah subhana wa taala I am Allah and there's no God besides me so remember me regularly and offer prayer regularly Allah is guiding that offer prayer regularly because today in the world there are so many evils so many distractions we tend to deviate this Salah is a sort of programming towards righteousness this form of worship is a programming towards righteousness we are getting programmed as a doctor says that for a healthy body you require minimum three meals a day so for a pure soul for a healthy Soul you require minimum five times Salah"
