  "title": "What if the Beard does not Suit the Person? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "there are many Muslims on Whose Faith the beard will suit very well if they have a good growth there are many Muslims on a face the beard may not suit I remember the first time and I kept a beard when I was starting the medical college and my growth was very Spar even now it's not thick it is the same but previously it was most pass you know just a few here here and there so when I started keeping a beard one of a Muslim brother said mashallah you have a nurani CH the beard has thrown light on your face and the beard suits you what the Muslim brother was trying to do was to encourage me that I should continue keeping the beer alhamdulillah but I knew that as I looks is concerned the beer did not suit me you know just few hairs here and few head here and a few hair there it didn't suit me even now after so many years it has grown a bit alhamdulillah but not like many of us people who have got a good growth alhamdulillah I had a fast growth but I have a logic and I say that those Muslims who have a good growth and if the beard suits them and they keep the beard inshallah they will get the Saab because they OB beinging Allah and his messenger but those Muslim who don't have a good growth and if the beard doesn't suit them and yet if they keep the beard to follow Allah and his inshallah they will get more Saab because imagine even though the beard doesn't suit me if the beer doesn't suit a Muslim yet he keeps For the Love of Allah and hiso I consider that inshallah he will get more Saab all those who keep the beard will get the Saab but the person on whom the beard doesn't suit and yet he keeps it knowing very well it doesn't suit him for the love of Allah and hiso he will get multiple times more Saab normally if you analyze that all the human beings who keep a beard if you take a survey approximately more than 34 of The Men Who sport a beard they are Muslims more than 75% of The Men Who sport the beard they are Muslims maybe about 25% may be non-muslims but those non-muslim who sport a beard they may have a typical type of beard you know with the mustach curled up so you can make out that he's not a Muslim or may have a particular type of beard resembling some other personality indicating that this is not an Islamic type of beard or he may wear an additional sign like a Tika worn by the Hindus or wear across the sign of the Christians so most of the time when the non-muslims when they keep a beard depending upon the type of the beard or the sign that they're wearing a cross or a Tika you can identify that though this person has a beard he is a non-muslim so when you meet a person sporting a beard majority of the time more than 95% of the time you can identify whether this person is a Muslim or not"
