  "title": "Reasons why Muslims made Many Scientific Discoveries from the 8th to the 12th Century - Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "and we find today that muslims are in the firing line we find that muslims have become backward as far as science technology is concerned as far as education is concerned and the main reason is because we have gone away from the quran in sunnah previously from the 8th to the 12th century it was called as the dark ages dark for whom dark for the europeans the amount of advances the muslim arabs made it is phenomenal and if we read history what we read in school i myself have passed from a convent a school missionary school i've got medication from there it's later on afterwards i realized that what i did in school and in my medical college i'm a medical doctor many things is something different we are taught in school that the blood circulation was first discovered within harvey in fact if you read the quran quran speaks about the blood circulation in surah hell chapter number 16 verse number 66 how does the food enter into the stomach then from there and go to the intestine from the intestine why the bloodstream the various organs of the body including the mammary glands which is responsible for the production of milk it speaks about the production of milk and about the blood circulation in a nutshell and sure in hell chapter 16 verse 66 after i did research i came to know that the first human being who first described the blood circulation was ibn nafees 600 years after the quran was revealed and 400 years before william harvey but when we read in our textbook we are told about william harvey how many of us know about ibn office how many of us hardly anyone knows that nafis was the first person who described the blood circulation we learn about geography but the person who drew the first world map of geography was ali derussi in 1154 what we study the digits in school you know what it's called it is called as arabic numerals the one two three four that we use for writing one two three four it is called as arabic numerals the other is the roman numeral the indians were the people who first discovered about the zero and the arabs took it from there and made it famous to the world by adding a decimal that's how we have the system today we learn in mathematics about the pythagoras theorem that the square of the hypotenuse in a triangle is equal to the sum of the square of the other two sides the pythagoras theorem that we learn in school it was first discovered by al-tusi so we know that muslims few centuries back they were advanced in science and technology but when we read in our textbook today they hardly mentioned who is the father of trigonometry it is al-biruni have you heard of al hindi al-khindi wrote 200 works in mathematics in geometry in logic and at a time when galileo descartes and newton when they said that all physical laws absolute he said that it was relative later on albert einstein did more research and he propounded the theory of relativity when we read history we come to know that muhammad ahmad and hassan shakir these brothers they measured the surface area of the earth by measuring angle at the red sea at a time when people thought the world was flat we learned chemistry and we are told that gebber is the person who discovered alcohol it is when they write in our textbook is gabber gebber sounds like a westerner it is when we read we think it's the western ever and he discovered alcohol and the word alcohol comes from the arabic word al-ghul meaning evil spirit when we're history we come to know about muhammad zakaria he was advanced in the field of medicine and he even wrote books on muses and smallpox when we read medicine we know that alibnia boss he wrote 20 volumes on practice and theory of medicine we are told about avecina i was seen as aristotle of the east it is aalib nisina alibni sina he was called as the aristotle of the east you're the philosopher we are the mathematician so when we go back to history and we see that we muslims we were on top of the world the reason we were on top of the world at that time is because at that time we were close to the quran in sunnah now we have gone away from quran and sunnah and that's the reason we are in the firing line"
