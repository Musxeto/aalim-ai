  "transcript": "and one of the most common allegations today that we have or again top of the list the common misconception is that islam was fed by the sword islam comes from the root toward salam which means peace it comes from the word which means peace which means to submit your will to almighty god and if anyone who submits isil to almighty god to acquire peace he's called as a muslim imagine if you translate the statement islam was spread by the sword it means peace was spread by the sword and islam as a general norm it is against violence but as a last resort force can be used and in every country of the world every country of the world has a police and this police too if suppose the civilian or the citizen or anyone else if they do not follow the law of the country this police it uses force to let peace prevail in that country so when every country has a police and when they can use force they can keep guns and if islam is against violence it mainly promotes peace as a last resort because some people do not want peace and they want to disrupt the peace to control these people as a last resort islam gives permission for the use of force and violence as a last resort the reply to this misconception that islam was paired with assad is given very well by a famous historian by the name of delasi o'leary he writes in his book islam at the crossroad on page number eight and he says that history makes it clear that the legend of fanatical muslims sweeping across the world forcing islam at the point of the sword over conquered races is the most fantastic absurd myth that historians have ever repeated dilation writes in his book islam at the crossroads that history makes it clear that the legend of fanatical muslims sweeping across the world forcing islam at the point of the sword over conquered races is the most fantastic absurd myth that historians ever repeated and we know that we muslims we rule spain for 800 years we did not force anyone to accept islam the power of the sword later on the crusaders came and they wiped out the muslim there was not a single muslim who could openly give the azan the muslims we were the lord of the arab land for the past 1400 years for a few years the britishers came for a few years the french came but as a whole the other muslims were the lord of the arab land for the past 1400 years yet today yet today there are more than 14 million arabs for coptic christians coptic christians means christians and generations these 14 million coptic christian arabs they are bearing witness they are giving shahada that islam was not spread by the sword the muslims ruled india for about a thousand years if they wanted they could have forced every indian to accept islam the part of the sword today after thousand years we find in india that more than 80 percent of the indians they are non-muslims these 80 percent non-muslims indian they are bearing witness they are giving shahada that islam was not fed by the sword which muslim army which muslim army went to malaysia malaysia happens to be a country which has more than 50 percent muslims which muslim army went to indonesia which is a country which has the maximum number of muslims in the world which muslim army went to the east coast of africa which muslim army which sword thomas khalil gives a reply he again is a famous historian from europe and he says which sword first you have to get your sword every new idea originates in the mind of one in one man's head it originates one man against the full world one against everyone else it will do little good that he picks up a sword and propagates it first you have to get your sword he is referring to the sword of intellect as allah says in the quran in surah hell chapter number 16 verse number 125 invite all the way of thy lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching and argue with them and reason with them in the ways that are best most gracious"
