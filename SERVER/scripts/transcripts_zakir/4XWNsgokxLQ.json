  "title": "What is the Textual Authenticity of the Qur'an? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is Peter I'm a student of religion philosophy now my question is on the textual authenticity of the Quran first when Abu Bakr commanded zai to gather the text together he did that but there is also written in al-bukhari volume number five page 96 he was the authority mentioned by Muhammad he gathered a text then Salim the freed slave he gathered a text and also a master reciter mentioned by Muhammad and there are also other people who compiled their test but when Usman became the Khalifa he ordered zayath to make replica seven replicas of his text and sent it to the different parts and ordered those previous texts to be burned now if those Master reciters compiled the Quran and Usman ordered those texts to be burned now there raises a question on the authenticity of the Quran many of the Muslims will not know those names you know now it's easy to go on the internet Jesus Christ peace be up and said in the Gospel of John chapter number eight verse seek the truth and the truth shall free you now when internet is there many people go on the internet there are various websites we're just speaking against Islam they go they get the name and they write no problem brother no problem brother as far a question is concerned the people who compiled the Quran there was a group of sahabas the companion of the Prophet whenever prophet got a revelation he repeated it to these scribes and suppose he got the revelation and Prophet mashallah very good memory Allah sought to it that returned to the memory he repeated it when he repeated this guy brought down the prophet personally verified he was an Umi how did he verify okay read it now correct so Prophet personally verified when he was alive whatever was written down of the Quran whether it was perfect or not and there's personal supervision and these scribes they were selected by the prophet and that's how when the Revelation came in 22 and a half years all was written down and later compiled in one book all supervised by Prophet Muslim even the order now later on there were many other people whenever the prophet said a verse was revealed they used to write in his own notes many many of us but this private notes of the other people weren't checked by the prophet suppose the teacher gives the notes 100 students are copying how do I know whether right or wrong if I'm giving a lecture if some people note down chapter number verse number chapter number verse number how fast can the note down and if I don't verify they say oh Dr Nike you said this reference where did I say it have I checked it so what happened later on there were many variants version of the Quran version means people thought their own notes to be the real Quran and when Islam spread people did not know which was the real Quran so at that time whatever the compiled copy was there when Allah during these scribes it was then in the hand of the wife of prophet saws and then Usman ordered that copy may Allah be with him and had a replication so that it could be sent to different parts of the world and then he said whatever copy you have whether right or wrong you burn it because that hasn't been verified so people had their own notes suppose someone makes notes of my lecture there are people making your notes maybe 80 percent is Right ninety percent hundred percent is very difficult correct 100 is very difficult so 80 percent even if it's 100 correct if I give you now this is the book of my lecture you know you'll be getting a book now Quran and modern science authenticated by me your notes you throw it away why does it require the notes I've given you a book and if you're not getting the full lecture you're getting part of the lecture Quran modern science now that part I'll tell you brother throw that notes away this is correct authenticated by me Dr Zakir Naik my book so same way whatever is authentic about the prophet the Revelation Allah be pleased with him he said all the other copies should be burned that does not mean there was variant Quran there was one Quran that was revealed but people when they wrote with their own notes there were differences so that's the reason now one of those copies is even today present in coptocki museum in Istanbul so this and we check it with today's musaf it is exactly the same what two word letter to letter that's the way even if you try to change it you cannot because today there are millions of people who know the Quran by heart and here in the world if mashallah we have many who know the Quran even if you burn the copy you get all the fast together you get together again the original Quran what to what literally can be reproduced hope to answer the question but isn't it the same with the master reciters at the time of Muhammad and desires text was compiled only after the death of Muhammad that's totally wrong to say that what we have to realize that he was appointed as the chief of the scribes there were many sabbas together he was appointed the chief and this was personally verified by Prophet Muhammad sallam and later on at the time with him it was made into a book form because at that time there was not paper there were no pen It Was Written parchment on Bones on blades on different material then it was later transferred to one uniform material and made into a book form no matter they say that there were different versions so all these scribes even when it was written down again when another dusman when you ordered my life is with him those people who are alive in the group of the scribes he called them and among them again he was appointed as the leader hope to answer the question"
