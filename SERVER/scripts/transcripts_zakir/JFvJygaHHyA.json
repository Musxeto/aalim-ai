  "transcript": "let's discuss the second pillar \nof Iman that is the angels   there is no concept of Angels in Hinduism but \nthey have a concept of super beings which can   do work which a normal human we cannot do in \nIslam the angels are created by Allah from light they always obey the Commandments of Allah they \ndon't have a free will of their own and angels   have been created for particular purposes for \nparticular duties for example Archangel Gabriel   has been created to get the revelation of Allah \nto his various Messengers the third pillar of Iman is his books first we'll \ndiscuss the books in Hinduism the Sacred Scriptures the sacred books of \nHinduism can be categorized into two types one is the Shruti the other is the Smithy Shruti \nmeans that which is perceived which is heard which   is understood which is revealed and the shrutis \nare considered to be the word of almighty God   they are of divine origin and they are \nof two types The Vedas and upanishads   the Veda is derived from the Sanskrit \nword with which means knowledge so   that means knowledge for excellence and \nbasically there are four types of Vedas the exact date when these Vedas \ncame into existence is unknown which date exactly is unknown the scholars \ndiffer according to Swami Dan and Saraswati   the founder of the Arya samaj he says \nthat The Vedas are 1310 million years old   but most of the scholars including the majority   of Hindu Scholars they say that The Vedas \nare approximately four thousand years old   exactly who was the first person in which land it \nexactly came is not known who was the Rishi who   wrote it or whom it was revealed is unknown \nin spite of all these things yet the Hindus   believe that the Veda is the word of God and it \nis the most sacred amongst all Hindu scriptures   the next Authority are the upanishads there are \nmore than 200 upanishads in the Indian culture   puts a number of 108. and principle amongst them \nsome say 10 some say 12 and rather Christian   has mentioned 18 principle of punishers \nhe's compiled them in his book the other type of sacred books are the snooty smruti means that \nwhich is remembered that memory and   the smoothie are less sacred as compared to \nthe Shruti and they are not considered to be   of divine origin they are not the word of \nalmighty God but they are written by human   beings and mainly they contain the rules and \nregulation how a human being should lead his   life and also called as Dharma shastra \namong the smoothie we have the etihas   the two great epic which all of us know most of \nthe Indians know one is ramayan we deal with the   story of sriram which most of the Indians know \nthe other is Mahabharata we deal with the story   of a feud between the cousins the pandas and the \ncover-ups and also deals with the story of Sri   Krishna and most of us the Indians are aware of \nMahabharata the most popular amongst the scripture   is the bhagavad-gita bhagavad-gita is a \npart of Mahabharata it contains 18 chapters   it is part of the bhishma chapter number 25 to 42 \n18 chapters of Mahabharata it is a guidance given   by SRI Krishna to Arjun in the battlefield they \nare the Sacred Scriptures are the puranas puranas   means ancient in Hindi we say purana purana \nancient so purana with ancient it's very popular has compiled eight in voluminous puranas it \ndeals with the stories of gods and deities   and deals with the story of the creation of \nthe universe principle amongst the purana is   the bhavishya purana talking about the future \nthere are various other Hindu scriptures we   also have the Manu smithi the law of Manu and \nwhere is the scriptures but the most sacred   amongst all the scripture Hindu scripture is \nthe Veda if anything contradicts with the Veda   the way they have to be followed it is number \none in authority let's discuss the books in Islam Allah says in the Quran chapter number 13 verse \nnumber 38 Allah says in every age have we revealed   a book almighty God I've sent several Revelations \nbut the last and final revelation is the Glorious   Quran which was revealed to the last and final \nmessenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him   and all the revelations the previous \nRevelations before the Quran was sent   only for a particular group of people and was \nsupposed to be followed till a particular time   period but the last and final Revelation the \nGlorious Quran was not revealed only for the   Muslims of the Arabs it was revealed for the \nwhole of humankind as I mentioned the Quran   in Surah Ibrahim Chapter 14 verse number one \nand sorry Ibrahim chapter number 14 verse 52   in Surah chapter number 2 verse number \n185 as well as in Surah azumur chapter   39 verse number 41 that the Quran has \nbeen revealed for the whole of humankind   this is the most sacred amongst the scriptures of \nIslam number one it is the word of almighty God   and supplementary to the Glorious Quran the word \nof Allah is the authentic sayings of the last and   final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him \nthe authentic Hadith will never contract the Quran   there will never be a conflict between the \nauthentic say Hadith and the Glorious Quran   these two are the Sacred Scriptures books in Islam"
