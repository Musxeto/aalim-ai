  "title": "Living in Pakistan, How To Study Comparative Religion for Dawah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "assalam alikum drum Muhammad Naas University teacher from PESA Pakistan alhamdulillah I have studied the Quran I want to study other religions what way should I adopt to study comparative religion if there are your lectures in which you have taught the way so please share the link the brother said that he has sted the Quran he wants to study comparative religion so can I guide him which lecture should he refer to is there any talk of my any program where I teach about comparative religion there are many of my talks my public lectures which are on comparative religion and there are books written by me since you are from Pakistan you can surely in the religions that you should concentrate more on compared religion is Hinduism and Christianity since these two religion are the religions which are maximum followed besides Islam so if you want to study on compassion Hinduism my talk on similarities between Hinduism and Islam is a very good talk you can even refer to my talk on Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam in the various World religious scriptures you can refer to my talk on Muhammad sahi wasallam in Hindu scriptures there's also a talk of Mind concept of God image world religions regarding Hinduism you can refer to my talk as well as my book on similarities between Islam and Christianity you can refer to my book on Muhammad sallallahu alhi wasallam in the Bible and the other lectures and books on concept of God in major world religion Muhammad s wasallam in the various World religious scriptures and various lectures of Mind are there on compi religion like Salah the programming to righteousness these talks if you hear it is mainly based on one of the important Verses Of Da where Allah says in the Quran in Iman chapter number 3 verse number 64 of book come to come in terms as between us and you which is the first term that we worship but Allah that we associate no part that we erect not among ourselves Lords and P other than Allah then if you turn back that we are Muslims Bo will to Allah tala so this is the master key for da Allah says come to Common terms asend so while doing dawa to a non-muslim it's very important that if you start with common terms inshallah you'll be able to break Di and you'll be successful so you can start talking about common terms and Allah reminds us here in this wor the most important is that we worship them but Allah that we associate no partners with him so while you're doing dawa you can start with things which are common for example science or maybe literature or whatever you feel is Comon between the person you're speaking and yourself or the religion who you're talking about and Islam but your main aim should be you may convince him to be truthful you may convince them not to have alcohol you may convince them not to have poke but if you do not remove the shik from the life of your friend or the person you're talking to your da is useless the most important is you can talk about other things but the most important is if you are not able to remove the shik in his life if you're not able to instill Your da is useless so in comparative religion the most important point of compar religion is the concept of God in major world religions if you are speaking to a Christian you should try and prove from the Bible first you have to prove that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he never claimed Divinity and we can prove from the Bible and I say that in my talk and in my book there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon himself say that he's God or he says worship me he says I'm God or he says worship me and you can hear my talks so similarly when you doing dawa to a Hindu your first concept should be that you should remove the the idol worship from the life of the Hindu proof to him that according to the vas there's one God you should worship him alone almighty God has got no image so the first aspect of dawa ised concept of one God that you worship him alone and no one else so while doing dawa this is the most important aspect so first you should Master the commonalities between the concept of God and Islam and other religion and try and win him over to the second most important aspect while doing dawa which is the pillar of Islam first pillar we bear witness that there's no God but Allah and we bear witness that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of Allah the second aspect of dawa is to prove to the non-muslim that Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger of Allah subhana tala you can start with you know proving him about science if you think he's a man of science no problem but your final goal should be first second isah that Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger as I mentioned earlier I've given talks on this topic Muhammad peace be upon him in the Bible Muhammad peace be upon him in the Hindu scriptures Muhammad peace be upon him in the world religious scriptures and then you can go on for and for Salah and various aspect but these two are the most important aspect and if able to convince the non-muslim on these two aspects he can enter the fold of Islam the remaining will follow as far as knowing the structure or how should you be wellers and compass religion or how should you do dawa I would advise you that you can visit our platform alh alh is the
