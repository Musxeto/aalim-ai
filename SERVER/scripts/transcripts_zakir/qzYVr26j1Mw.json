  "transcript": "many Muslims consider music to be allowed could you just confirm did the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam speak against music there is a great difference opinion as far as the Muslims are concerned where the music is allowed or not whether it's permit or not but there is no worse in the Quran directly prohibiting music but there are indications it says that among them there are those people who purchase Idol Tales without knowledge and without meaning and they mislead the people away from the path of Allah and ridicule the path of Allah these are the people who will receive a humiliating punishment So based on this efficient many of the tafasi says that this Idol Tales without knowledge without meaning refers to an Islamic songs and the musical instruments as far as the prophet prohibiting music there are various so if you read the Hadith then there will be no doubt whether it's permitted or propheted our beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in say buhari volume number seven Hadith number five five nine zero double a prophet said that from among my followers there will be some people who will make illicit sex that is adultery and fornication as well as wearing of silk drinking intoxicants and using musical instruments as legal they'll be among my people who will make some things which are illegal that is adultery fornication wearing of silk having intoxicants and the playing of music instruments as legal now this Hadith when it says that they will make certain things legal and we know that intoxicants is Haram we know very well the adultery fornication Haram because it is mentioned along with these things which are forbidden musical instruments are mentioned along with them it indicates that the prophet have prohibited them but some people will make it legal and we know there are some Scholars who today do permit that playing of music instruments is allowed so this Hadith is very clear-cut in saying that musical instruments are harm but there are other say Hadith which do permit some music instruments especially the duff they're the tambourine if read the Hadith of a beloved Prophet Muslim of volume number five Hadith number four thousand and one where it is said that after consummating his marriage he came and he sat outside along with one of the Sabbath when two small girls were playing the tambourine that is a Duff and they were and when they started praising the prophet they said don't praise me you can say what you are saying earlier indicating that the prophet did not prohibit them from playing the tambourine furthermore verb number two Hadith number 987 where the profit while he was lying down is Hadi generated by libraries with her she says that two small girls were playing the tambourine and they were singing when Allah pleased with him the father of Allah he comes and he says to them stop it was sleeping on a court he tells you with him that let them do it these are the days of Eid you will let them do it furthermore Hadith number 3690 where a beloved Prophet Muslim he says that there was a person who apprecially the prophet and tells him that I had vowed to Allah that if you come back victoriously I will sing and I will play the duff I will bind the tambourine the prophet said if we have wowed then do it if you have not vowed then don't do it so these Hadith do indicate that musical instruments per se Haram except for the dove that the tambourine the prophet did permit it sometimes thank you very much for that answer that final answer today in this what's been very very interesting and informative as usual session regarding the topic Ramadan what is recommended and what is discouraged thank you very much Dr zakira"
