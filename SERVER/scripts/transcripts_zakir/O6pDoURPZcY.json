  "transcript": "you may have known the story of new Alam and I believe most of the Muslims know about the story of new Alam but you may not be knowing about the relationship if you read Surah HUD chapter number 11 verse number 40 to 47 it speaks about Noah and Noak and how it bu dark he told the people that there's a flood going to come rain going to come most of the people didn't believe in surah h number 11 verse number 40 to 47 says that Noah Alam Noah may peace be upon him as the almighty God that you collect one pair of all living creatures and put in the ark and let your family members come and the Believers and he builds the ark and he puts a pair of living creatures the animals the birds he tells his son that there is going to be flood his son does not believe and his son does not believe in his father new Alam son does not believe later on when it starts to rain again new Alam request his son come in the AR he said no father I will go to the topmost peak on the mountain the water will never reach there and he goes to the peak then it starts to pour it poures heavily the water keeps on Rising it rises and Rises and even goes above the level of the peak of the Mountain at that time when his son cries out for help n Alam tells Allah subhana wa ta'ala and reminds him of his promise that yaah Allah didn't you promise that you'll save my family members Allah subhah wa ta'ala in Surah HUD chapter number 11 verse 46 and 47 what reply does Allah give Allah says your son is not amongst your family members your son is not your family member and do not ask for a safety and you do not know Allah says your son is not amongst your family members and you do not know I know then Alam asked for forgiveness I have no knowledge you have the best knowledge here Allah says the relationship of Iman that means he was his blood son but he did not have Iman so the relationship of Iman the relationship of faith is far superior even than blood relationship if you read Surah maram chapter number 19 ver 47 there it is said in the Quran that ibraim Alam prays for his father because he had promised that he'll pray for him but the verse of Allah says that you cannot pray for a person who's a mush who worship somebody else besides Allah after he has died and ibraim Alam after knowing this he stops praying because his father was an idolator so here the son leaves the father who doesn't have Iman for the sake of Allah subhana wa tala you have many such examples if you read Surah chapter number 66 verse number 10 it speaks about the wives of no Alam and Lam they did not believe though the husbands were messenger of Allah subhana tala they did not believe and both their wives had to perish if you read the Quran Surah chapter number 66 verse number 11 it speaks about may Allah be pleased with her who was the wife of Fon she's praying to Allah subhana wa ta'ala yah oh my Lord give me a mansion a house in Jenna close to you and save me from the evil of Fon that time Fon was the most powerful human being on the face of the Earth he used to call himself God he was T the most richest man in the world the most powerful man in the world here his wife be pleas with her she's praying to almighty God that give me a house a mansion in jenah close to you in exchange for the luxury of the husband imagine she wants to exchange the wealth in the world all just for a mansion in jenah close to Allah subhana wa tala all these examples show that the Brotherhood of faith is far superior than any other Brotherhood even the Brotherhood of Blood relationship the of the Glorious Quran from Surah chapter number four vers number one which says oh humankind reverence Your Guardian Lord who has created you from a single person and created of like nature his m alhamdulillah [Applause]"
