  "transcript": "how do we know what are the indications and how do we know whether repentance is accepted what are the indications the indication as far as for repentance to be accepted by Allah subhana wa taala number one is that you do not commit the same sin again and your good deeds keep on increasing and your bad Deeds keep on decreasing this is number one sign that Allah is accepted their repentance number two that you have the fear of Allah subhana wa tala number three is that you regret to Allah subhana tala and you keep on asking his forgiveness number four is that you're humble and you always address him in humility so these are the four signs which show that your repentance has been accepted by Allah subhana tala the signs of non-acceptance of the TOA repentance is deficiency in the person's repentance and he remembers the pleasures of the sins and he gets preoccupied in continuing the sin that's number one number two he's so sure that his repentance will be accepted as though he has got immunity and he's immune to it and surely he'll be forgiven that's number two number three is that his eyes don't cry and his heart is hardened number four there's no increase in the good activities that he's doing no increase in the good deeds and I beloved Prophet mallam said it's mentioned in s Muslim Vol number four in the book of repentance Hadith number 6621 that if the people do not commit any sins Allah subhah wa ta'ala will wipe them out and replace with the people who commit sin and who ask for forgiveness so that Allah can forgive them now here if you understand this Hadith it will look very odd that does Allah want us to do sin if you don't do sin Allah will remove you what it means that there are some people who may do sin and who may ask ask for forgiveness and repent and become closer to Allah subhana wa tala and the good deeds will increase and these people will go to jenah on the other hand some people do good deed and they have conceit they're so proud of themselves and that will take them to the Hellfire so Allah says that if there's a group of people who don't do sin Allah will replace them with the people who do sin so that they will ask for forgiveness and Allah will forgive them that means you should have humility so these are the signs for not acceptance of yourba may Allah tala continue to accept repentance in our TOA Dr zakya there is another question which I have which is just to end this particular session this particular show and that is is there any limitation to the sins that Allah subhana wa ta'ala can accept our Toba for as far as Allah's forgiveness is concerned and his Mercy is concerned every Surah every chapter of the Glorious Quran it begins with the beautiful formula in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful every Surah except for chapter number NBA and Allah says in the Quran in Surah zumar chapter number 39 verse number 53 that oh my servants who have transgressed against their souls despair not the mercy of Allah subhana wa ta'ala for Allah can forgive all sins Allah is of forgiving and most merciful here Allah says that whatever your sin may be Allah subhana wa ta'ala he can forgive any of your sins as long as you repent if you repent the right way and if you ask forgiveness Allah will inshallah forgive you and our beloved Prophet mam said it's mentioned say of ma Hadi number 4 to 51 the Beloved Prophet said that every son of Adam he commits sin and the best is the person who repents if you commit sin no problem problem but if you repent then you're the best person repentance is very important of Hadith number 354 where beloved Prophet wasallam said that Allah says oh son of Adam you may do any sin and I will forgive all your sins even if your sins reach to the clouds in the sky I will forgive them you ask me for mercy and I will forgive you it's further mentioned Hadith of s Muslim Hadith number 6246 where the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that Allah says even if you do sin day and night and ask for forgiveness I will forgive you you ask me from pardon and I will forgive you it's mentioned s bukari b number eight Hadith number 5999 there were some prisoners of War who were released mainly children and women and one lady She searches for a son and she cannot find a son the moment she sees any child she breastfeeds the child then another child she sees she breastfeeds the child finally she finds her own child so the prophet asked the sahabas that will she throw the sun in the fire they said no Allah subhah wa ta'ala loves his servants even if they commit sin more than the lady loves the Child So based on this we realize Allah subhana wa ta'ala is willing to forgive any of your sin as long as repent and just the last quotation Allah says in the Quran Anda chapter number 4 verse number 48 that if Allah subhana tala pleases he can forgive any sin but the sin of shik he'll never forgive here it means that if a person does shik and repents before he dies before the death rattle inshallah Allah will forgive even the sin of shik if he repents and comes to the straight path and believes in one Allah subhana wa tala believes in Allah will even forgive him his sin of shik which is biggest sin but if he dies as a mush after he dies Allah says here that he will not forgive the sin of shik any other sin if he wishes he may forgive but the sin of shik he'll never forgive sh is the biggest sin so from here we come to know that Allah subhana wa tal is the most merciful and is willing to forgive the sins of his servants"
