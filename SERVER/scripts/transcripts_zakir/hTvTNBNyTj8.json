  "title": "Can a Fasting Person Eat or Drink to Save his Life? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "if a person has to eat or drink in order to save his or her life does that mean that they have to make up that fast later on or is it accepted that fast if a person is dying as you say dying of hunger or dying of thirst yes while fasting if he feels hungry and thirsty and if he feels that if he does not take something does not take some food or does not take some water it will damage some of his organs of the body if he feel his life is threatened or may cause a major damage to some of his organs then if he breaks the fast to save his life it is accepted Allah will forgive him but he will have to make up for his fast after the month of Ramadan is over but if someone finds it hard difficult to fast because if you're doing a laborious work or if finding difficulties he's feeling thirsty in this case breaking the fast is a sin but if he's really dying of hunger and then if he breaks Allah forgive him but let's make up for the fast later on"
