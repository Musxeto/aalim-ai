  "transcript": "and the first of those today will be the major of Zen so first of all can you tell me what is the Islamic perspective on Zena and what is the prescribed punishment in Islam for doing that sin means illegal sexual intercourse or when a man and woman who are not married if they have a sexual intercourse it's called a Zena it means sexual intercourse outside the marriage bond and the Islamic Sharia it basic aim is to preserve the honor and lineage that the reason Zena that's illegal sexual intercourse it is a major sin and Allah subhana says in the Quran in Sur is chapter number 17 verse number 32 come not close to zah come not close to unlawful sexual intercourse for it is a shameful deed and evil opening other roots to evil Islam has tried its best to protect the honor of the man and the woman and there are various guidelines given in the Sharia and the Quran Hadith which prevents a person from coming close to Zena number one is hijab has been prescribed and besides hijab for the woman is up for the man also for the woman a complete body should be covered the only part that can be seen are the face and the hands is up to the rest some Scholars say that they should be covered and Allah says about the hijab Allah has prescribed the hijab for the man first in the Quran and then for the woman Allah says in the Quran in Surah chapter number 24 verse number 30 say to the believing man that he should lower his Gaz and guard his modesty moment a man looks at a woman if anyen thought any unashamed thought comes in his mind he should lower his gaze the next verse speaks about the hijab for the woman it says in Sur n chapter number 24 verse number 31 say to the believing woman that she should lower Gaz and guard her modesty and display not a beauty except what appears ordinary of and draw her wh over the bosom and the verse continues so basically lowering the Gaze is very important which prevents Z to a great extent and the punishment for this unlawful sexual intercourse Zena there are two types of punishments depending upon the type of Zena Zena can be of two types number one is that unlawful sexual intercourse done by an unmarried man and woman it's called as fornication in English and if unlawful sexual intercourse is done by a married man or woman it is called as adultery the punishment for both it differs Allah says in the Quran in Surah n chapter number 24 verse number two as for the woman and man who commit fornication as for the fornicator be it a woman or a man flog each with 100 stpes is give them 100 lashes and let not your heart be moved towards them and let a group of Believers witness the punishment that means if any man or woman who's not married if they have unlawful sexual intercourse the punishment is 100 lashes flogging them with 100 lashes and as far as punishment for adulter is concerned unlawful sexual intercourse done by a married man or woman it's mentioned in s bukari volume number8 in the book of hudud Hadith number 6814 a man approaches Prophet M wasallam and says that I have committed adultery and the man he Bears witness four times that he has commit adultery and the prophet he ordered that he should be punished he should be ston to death because he are a married man so the punishment for adultery unlawful sexual intercourse done by married man in Islam it isor to death it's further mentioned s bukari volume number 8 in the book of hudud Hadith number 6819 there was a Jew and a Jewish were caught committing adultery and they B to the Prophet The Prophet asked them that in your religion what is the punishment for adultery so they said that our priest had innovated that the faces should be blackened with charcoal the prophet said get your scripture and show it to me the man gets the scripture and he covers something and then he reads it so one of the sahabah says please remove your hand and the moment the hand was removed it was mentioned down there that rajam turning to death should be given to a person who commits adultery so even in the Jewish scripture even Christian scripture the punishment for adultery is thror into death and the prophet commanded that both of them the and the Jewish both should be thrown to death it's mentioned in s Muslim number three in the book of Hadith number 4191 that the prophet said that anyone who commits zah if an unmarried man or woman commit Zena that is to fornication the punishment is giving 100 lashes and they should be banished for one year and the prophet continues and says that anyone who does Zena who's married anyone does unlawful sexual intercourse does adultery if a person is married man or woman then the punishment is giving them 100 Stripes lashing them 100 times and then s into death so this is the different type of punishment for Zena and it is one of the major sin in Islam and in Al imabi he gives number 10 to the sin Zena adul and fornication"
