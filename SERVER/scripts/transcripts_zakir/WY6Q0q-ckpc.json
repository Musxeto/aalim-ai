  "transcript": "i wanted to know about the kaaba i had an uh question about the kaaba i mean what is its significance scientifically and logically and why do muslims circle around the kaaba we have asked a very good question that what is the significance of kaaba scientifically logically and why do muslims circumvent on the kaaba now many non-muslims think that we muslims worship the kaaba it is that's wrong correct i'll give that answer and even come to a scientific answer every club go together to answer you and the other non-muslim misconception the thing is that kaaba is the qibla the quran says in surah chapter number 2 verse number 44 that wherever you are pray in the direction of the kaaba in arabic direction means qibla so kaaba is only for direction for example today if you have to prayer some will say less face thought some will say not some will say is some will save us so for unity we face towards one direction kaaba so kaaba is our qibla no muslim ever worships the kaaba and when the world map of geography was drawn the first time it was the muslims who do the world map first it was alidroxy in the year 1154 who do the world map and when the muslims do the world map that south pole on top north pole down and the kaaba in the center later on the western cartographers came and they turned the map upside down north pole top south pole down yet the kaaba is in the center so whichever part of the world you are if you are staying in the north you face towards the south if you are in the east to face towards the west if you are in the west you face towards the east if you are on the south face towards the north all muslim throughout the world they face in one direction kaaba kaaba is the qibla now when we go for umrah or when we go for hajj we have tawa we circumambulate why do we circumambulate basically because our god creator because mohammad sallallahu asalam said it you ask me logically what's the reason though it's not mentioned in the quran hadith if i as a logical person wants to think why do we circumambulate the reason i can think is every circle has got one center we circumambulate around the kaaba to testify there is one god because circle has got only one center doesn't have two center we circumvent to testify as one god and the statement of umar may allah be pleased with him the second caliph of islam which is mentioned say bukhari volume number two in the book of hajj chapter number 56 number 675 the second caliph of islam has said this black stone pointing at the hajj what the black stone in the kaaba this black stone can neither benefit me can neither harm me i'm kissing it only because my prophet kissed it this statement proves that no muslim ever worships a kaaba furthermore at the time of the prophet muhammad there were sahabas who stood on the kaaba and gave the assange no idol worshipper will ever stand on the idol he or she worships so this proves that the muslims don't worship the kaaba kaaba is only in the qibla it's only a direction hope to answer the question [Applause] you"
