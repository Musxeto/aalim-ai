  "transcript": "i am abdullah my question is if we do any major sin and uttauba will allah subhana wa tala forgive us but if we do it again and again and uttawaba to allah subhana tala does he forgive us allah subhana wa he will convert his bad deeds into good deeds so we need to ask sincere repentance from allah subhana wa tala if we ask sincere repentance from allah subhanahu wa ta'ala he will inshallah forgive our sins and even if you commit the sin again you should ask repentance from allah again you may fall into the sin again you should ask repentance from allah again but you should not plan that you will commit the sin again and there are four criteria for repentance the first is that you should ask sincere repentance from allah the second is that you should stop the act immediately the third is that if you can undo it you should undo it and the fourth is that you should make a strong resolution that you will not do it again so these are minimum four criteria for repentance whenever you commit any sin you should ask for sincere repentance from allah subhanahu talaha and allah subhana talah mentions in the glorious quran in several places that allah subhanahu ta'ala he is of forgiving he is most merciful but we need to ask sincere repentance from allah subhana wa and we should make a strong resolution that we will not do the sin again and especially when it comes to the major sins we should ask sincere repentance from allah because the criteria for the major sins is that you need to ask repentance from allah for that particular sin the minor sins they can be washed away for example when you do wudhu if you fast on the day of arafah if you fast on the day of ashura between jummah and jummah in these ways the minor sins they can be forgiven but the major sins they require sincere repentance from allah so we should ask sincere repentance from allah we are at home when we are walking we should do the istighfar continuously and the more is the far we do the more we will get reward for this the far that we do we should keep our tongue moist with the remembrance of allah subhana wa ta'ala with the istighfar so whatever sins we have committed we should not despair of the mercy of allah subhanahu talah as allah subhana wa says do not despair of the mercy of allah for allah forgives all sins allah subhanahu ta'ala he is the most gracious he is the most merciful inshallah we will end this session and the remaining part of the session will be continued by my father i would like to end this session alhamdulillah"
