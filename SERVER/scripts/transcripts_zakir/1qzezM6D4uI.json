  "transcript": "i'm here again brother some people call the religious people call god by his name and some other call is superpower and scientists say cosmic energy and parapsychology it says super conscience so super conscious that is this parapsychology subject itself proves that god is existing it is always there brother can you please yeah uh what i'm trying to what i'm trying to say can you please repeat your question slowly yeah somebody see people call god according to their knowledge the level of knowledge right see somebody call super conscience some people say superpower supreme being and all that so let me take the term cosmic energy the energy which existed from the beginning and which created the world according to the scientists i'm talking to you because you know this some people say it's a fabricated one it was fabricated by the roman emperor constantinople in 83 25 in nissan conference they fabricated the teachings and in that they say god rested on the seventh day i don't want to mention the religion's name and if the cosmic energy is going to rest suddenly everything will collapse within few moments and i would like to know what this cosmic energy was doing before the creation and right from the creation till the end of the human race and what is it going to do after this existing thank you brother existence of this world thank you i think the speaker has got this whether that's a question that some people call super conscious some people call superpower some people call cosmic energy whether whatever name you give it should be correct name if it's the wrong name we don't accept it some people give a correct name superpower no problem super being no problem certain names may be correct certain name may not be correct one of the names you say is the scientists say cosmic energy and one of the religions said almighty god rested on the seventh day i'll give you a quotation from the bible book of genesis chapter number two verse number two almighty god rested on the seventh day so if cosmic energy rest holds the collapse i agree with you so we disagree with that scripture and regarding calling god cosmic energy i don't agree god is the creator of the energy of the universe he is not cosmic energy he is more superior than that he has created everything and everything is dependent on him so as far as the religious scripture says god rested we don't agree god doesn't require rest allah says in the quran in italkurasi chapter number 2 verse 255 that allah does not require to sleep it is not required to rest so almighty god does not require rest this definition of almighty god is wrong the right definition if you read in the quran he said doesn't require rest and if you give any name which is correct attribute we have no objection if you have the wrong attributes there's a problem today scientists are not eliminating god they're eliminating models of god hope that answers the question [Applause] you"
