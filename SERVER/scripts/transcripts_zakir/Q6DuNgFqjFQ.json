prophet's mosque in madhya dinambi in medina imagine what a journey from one of the worst states of india to one of the most peaceful cities in the world and alhamdulillah sheikh mohammed ziya rahman asked me he has authored dozens of books in arabic he also authored a book in hindi the encyclopedia of the quran and he also wrote his autobiography in urdu titled from ganga to zamzam but his main and the most famous work i'll come to it and show later on the first time i met sheikh zaraman azmi was in 1997 when i went to madina to study arabic as a language before that one year before that in 1996 i went to makkah and i studied for one month under professor dr nadhvi who was a teacher of arabic language a professor of arabic language indulgary university i could not stay for more than 30 days then later on i tried to find out that who is the best arabic teacher in the world who can teach to non-arabs and i got the reply it was dr abdul raheem and he was the head of the logar department the arabic language department in the islamic university of madina and people told me he's a very busy person and he mainly takes students of the phd so i doubt whether you'll be able to meet him or whether he'll give you time but i said what's the harm in trying so i went to madina and i met dr fab dalhim and i told him that i am a die in this field of islam and i would like to learn arabic so he told me do you know that he gave a talk a few weeks before in madina i said yes i was sitting on the first row for your talk and then i happened to know that mashaallah he attended my lecture and he was very much willing to give me time so much so that he told me that if you spend about six months with me inshallah you will know arabic as a language and he promised to give me more than five hours every day after zohar till just before manchester every day alhamdulillah and that's the time i took out my akama my resident permit of saudi arabia so that i could spend six months in madina that's in the year 1997 but unfortunately i hardly spent one month maybe a few days less than a month where i spent five hours every day with dr abdullah and when i went to his house i realized that he was the close friend of professor dr zeraman asked me and not only a close friend he was also a tenant in the villa that he lived he lived on the ground floor and on the first floor was the owner of the villa that is prophet the doctor zaraman asked me and that's the time i met him and i also became very close to professor dr zaraman asked me and when i questioned him that can he give me time so you agreed to give me twice a week few hours every session twice a week and with him also mashaallah i studied for about a month and my basics of my hadith i acquired my knowledge from doctor prophet z raymond asked me and in the passage of time i became very close to him and when i was studying under him i asked him the question that whenever i say in my lecture that muslims should follow quran and say hadith quran and say hadith do we have all this say hadith compiled together and the answer but naturally was no yes there are many books of say hadith we are saying buhari say muslim then we have the quran etc but we don't have all this hadith compiled together the best work that was done at that time was by sheikh nasir danbani besides the two sahih bukhari and muslim the remaining four books of the quran that is sunnah without sunnah he bifurcated into sahih and saif so you have the salah assay which has compilation of all the say hadith in the balanced books of the seta but to say that all these were compiled many of the people tried in the past but no one completed the project so while discussing with sheikh prophet zeraman asked me this was the time that maybe the seed was sown and after he retired alhamdulillah he spent about 15 to 18 years in this project and he compiled all the sahadis together and according to professor zeraman admin he told me that there are about more than a million hadith that is there if you remove all the duplicates many hazards are duplicate the matter is the same the chain of narrators are different or maybe the mutant the matter differs very slightly so if you remove the duplicate hadith different chains but the matter being the same he told me there are approximately sixty thousand hadith from the sixty thousand hadith he told me at that time approximately sixteen thousand will be sahih and after he retired alhamdulillah he took this voluminous project to compile all the say hadith of all the books not only the question but all the other books of hadith and get them together and remove the duplicates so that anyone who reads this book can say that he has read all the say hadith and he told me that to the best ability he finished this project maybe i think about four years back and that was the first edition that was printed in the manuscript form it was in 20 volumes and this work was given to the salaam for printing and they printed this book which sheikh zayar ahmad called it as jamaica mill the full name is hadees this is a complete name short form is jamaican we say the full name is this is the complete name and it was printed in 12 volumes by darus salam the arabic and it contained about 16 and a half thousand hadith all the duplicates removed and it gave the chain of narrators it also gave the huja why this hadith or why this hadith is life and didn't include it into the main list and he had his own criteria every scholar besides the basic criteria that is there of the say hadith they have their own way of analyzing and they may agree with most of the scholars they may differ sometimes so he gave his reasoning why he deferred when some scholars say it is sahih and according to him it was in sahih it was life he gave his reasoning or some scholars said life and he said it is hassan so the takrij is also there so all this put together the chain of narrators with the takrij it was approximately sixteen and a half thousand hadith and he added another three thousand hadith to it those hadith which were very commonly known it may be safe it may be modu so people should not say that he skipped it and even those hadees which were said to be sahih by famous mahdi seen but he considered it as saif he even mentioned that and that was another 3000 hadith so that no one could say that he missed and i could say that along the life not hundred percent we can safely say that more than ninety five percent of all the say hadith that is available has been compiled in this aljameh camel it was a voluminous work and later on in the next two or three years he spent in revising that and recently mashallah just a few months back the second revised edition has been printed of this al-jamil kamil in pakistan but this time the lettering is a little bit bigger so it is 19 volumes and alhamdulillah i requested him that why doesn't he make a condensed version a mukta sir al-jami kamil so that it can be translated because the main book is good for scholars and for researchers but for normal lay men they are not so much bothered about the takrij their mother about hadith so he agreed and he also made a mukhtar jamai kamil in five volumes which doesn't have the takrij which only has the sanat of the hadith and hadith number he may say this hadith is also there in say bukhari hadith number so and so also then say muslim hadith number so and so also in abu dhabi so also so at the end of the hadith he even gave the references where it's present and the same hadith may be present in three books or in four books or in five books many times more than that so that no one can say that these hadith have been missed so in the mukta takrid is missing but the complete sanad is there and alhamdulillah even this mukhtar sir is complete and it's under the process of translation and i took the onus of having it translated into english and this project we started about four and a half years back after the first edition was completed along with the mukta sir and we gave it to someone who was expert in arabic and english and the project was for three years but unfortunately when the translation was completed i had a check with some other expert and i wasn't happy with the english translation so we are revising it and so far we have reached we have completed the first volume and part of the second volume i think it will take another one or two years because i believe that the translation should be good unfortunately the english translation of most of the books of hadith is not up to the standard most of them are poor some are fair some may be good but not of excellent quality so inshallah we expect to complete the translation of the mukthasar jami kamil inshallah in the next two years and we'll have it printed into english i also requested professor jayaraman asked me to have the full jamaican only in one volume without the sanada which decided he said we as muhammad seen we don't believe hadees can be without sanat i said let's be practical if you want to give it to the layman or maybe a student of knowledge to make it more compact so that only write the name of the sabha who narrated it without the sanat so finally after many years he agreed and he had just started with the project of making into one volume so that it is more condensed and easier for the layman or the common muslim to read unfortunately he could not complete that one volume i'm in touch with some of my common friends and with the children of prophet smith and inshallah we'll try and make this into one volume so that we only have the main hadith with the name of the sabbah so that the hadith becomes much shorter and easier for a common man to read and if we read this we can at least say that we have read the quran and we have read almost all the say hadith so if it's in five volume now mukta sajama kamil it may be in one volume later on it's possible for most of the muslims to read if they want to read but reading all the books of hadith is extremely difficult or next to impossible for a common man inshallah pray to allah that means this one volume of jamaica will also come into existence very soon but at present we have the mukhtar sir jamil kamil and alhamdulillah allah's grace prophesized mean he gave an authority to me he gave a letter to me saying that i have the right to translate his complete al-jami al-kamil into any language what i want and he gave me permission even for the mukta sir jamie kamil to be translated and alhamdulillah he gave me 20 blank letters that i can give permission to any publisher to publish his original arabic version of the jamil kamel but natural i don't intend selling this to anyone but natural for the benefit of the ummah to spread the message of the great work done by dr sarah asked me and i pray to allah that this work that he did it is really voluminous many people in the last 1400 years tried but they could not complete it allah blessed him alhamdulillah that after he retired he spent along with the revision spent approximately 20 years comparing the hadith doing stukridge he had a couple of two three of the phds who helped him in this project but he did it single-handedly alhamdulillah he didn't want any other scholar or any other person to interfere there were some students of phd or some who passed pg did help him in copying that's it but himself wanted it individually and alhamdulillah blessed him and he completed the project though this book is not that famous i am waiting for the english translation to be completed and inshallah then we will market it better so that the whole muslim ummah can benefit from one of the greatest works done by late sheikh professor dr muhammad azmi rahim allah may allah have mercy on him and a prayer allah me"
