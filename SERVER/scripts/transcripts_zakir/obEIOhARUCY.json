  "transcript": "my name is javed and i'm a student i would like to ask any question at one place the holy quran states that man is created from sperm which is in consulate with modern science but at another place it also states that man is made from dust now isn't the holy quran contradicting itself or is it consulate with modern science the brothers pulls the question that one place the holy quran says that human beings have been carried from sperm which translates modern science they are the place human being is scared from dust can you prove it scientifically scaled from dust and is in their contradiction one place sperm one place it says dust the holy quran does say as i mentioned my talk in chapter 75 verse number 37-39 it says that human beings have been created from sperm which has been proved by science the holy quran also says in surah chapter 22 verse number five that we have created the human beings from a quintessence of dust today science tells us that all the elements that are there in the human body they are present in lesser or greater quantity in the soil in the earth so the statement that human being have been created from earth is scientifically proven that whatever components are there in the human body the constituent the elements they are present in the earth in the soil in lesser or greater proportion the second part of the question isn't a connection one place the quran says man is scared from sperm one saves from dust is there any contradiction see a contradiction is two statements which are conflicting with each other which cannot take place simultaneously the quran does not only say man has been created from sperm and the other place from dust it also says in surah khan chapter 25 verse 54 that man has been created from water you will tell me that three contradictions see science has proven that man has been created from dust as well as from sperm as well as from water if i tell you in one statement that to make a cup of tea i require water in the second statement i say to make a cup of tea i require tea leaves or tea powder it's not a contradiction i require both if i want to make sweet tea i add sugar to it if i want to make panicum tea i add less water and more milk if i want to make suleimanity i add only water so there is no contradiction when the quran says human being is created from sperm and dust and water it is actually contra distinction what is the meaning of contact distinction contradiction means speaking two or more things about a subject which are not conflicting with each other for example if i say that this man is honest he's kind and loving it is contra distinction but if i say this man is always a liar and a truthful person then it's contradiction because both are posing if it's not opposing it's called as counter distinction"
