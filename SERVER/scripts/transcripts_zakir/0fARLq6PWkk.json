  "title": "If Islam Preaches Universal Brotherhood then Why are the Muslims Divided into Sects? â€” Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "and there's a question from brother sunil yes when islam preaches universal brotherhood then how come muslims themselves are divided into sex the question posed is that when islam preached universal brotherhood how come muslims are divided into various sects dan says given the glorious quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 103 it says hold to the rope of allah strongly and be not divided which is the rope of allah the glorious quran is the robe of allah subhanahu ta'ala it says that the muslims should hold the rope of allah the glorious quran and the saiya hadith and they should not be divided and the quran says as i mentioned earlier in surah anam chapter 6 verse 159 that anyone who divides the religion into sex you have nothing to do with him allah will tell him about the affairs on the day of judgment that means it is prohibited for anyone to make sectionality of islam but when you ask a muslim what are you some say i'm a hanafi some say i'm a shafi some say muhammad some say i'm a malaki what was the beloved prophet was the shafi or the humbly was he malik what was he he was a muslim the quran says in surah imran chapter 3 verse 52 that jesus peace be upon the muslim the quran says in surah imran chapter 3 verse number 67 that abraham is a muslim and what is the beloved prophet you are the muslim the quran says in surah fusilla chapter 41 verse number 33 muslim mean who is better in speech than one who invites people to the way of thy lord works righteousness and says i am of those who bowed to the will of allah those who say i'm a muslim so when anyone poses a question what are you you should say i'm a muslim i have no objection if someone says i believe in certain verdicts certain views given by great scholars like abu hanifa imam shafi imam malek may allah be pleased with them all i respect all these great scholars if someone agrees with certain views of imam shafi sometimes my lawyer pleased with him sometimes abu hanifah allah pleases him i've got no objection but if anyone poses a question what are you you should say you're a muslim and as the brother said earlier that quran says there will be 73 sects what is referring to is saying of beloved prophet it's mentioned in abu dhabi hadith number 4579 it says that the religion of islam will be divided into 73 sects but if you note the wording of the prophet muhammad peace be upon him he said that the religion will be divided he didn't say you should divide the religion he's prophesying though the quran says don't be divided the muslims are bound to divide and there's another hadith which is mentioned in hadith number 171 the beloved prophet said there will be seventy-three sirika seventy-three sex and all will go to hell except for one and the companions asked which one the prophet said the one that is on the path of the prophet and the companions one that follows the quran and the say hadid so anyone who follows the quran hadees on the true path islam doesn't believe in division every person he's a muslim anyone who follows the quran says the muslim and islam is against dividing the religion into sects and divisions so if you read the quran and say hadith muslims should be united on the basis of quran and say hadith hope to answer the question"
