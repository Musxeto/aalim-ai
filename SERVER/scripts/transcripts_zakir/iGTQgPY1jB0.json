  "title": "Why do women have to make up for their missed Fasts of Ramadhaan due to menstruation ... - Dr Zakir",
  "transcript": "I'm a sister my name is Sumaya from Dhaka Bangladesh why do women need to cover up their fasting or make up for the fasting which is obligatory after Ramadan while they do not need to pray they missed prayers during menstrual process if they need to keep the obligatory Mist fasting before the next Ramadan can they any longer fast afterward like covering up after two to three years missed fast so basic question is that when the Muslim when they miss their Salah during menstruation they don't have to catch up or do not have to compensate do not have to pray for the Salah they have missed but if they miss the fast doing Ramadan which is the first fast they have to make up for it the reason is that the difference between Salah as one of the periods of Islam as compared to fasting Salah is a pillar of Islam that every adult Muslim he has to pray Salah and if he's a man irrespective whether he's sick or healthy he should pray Salah if he can't go to the mosque and if you think you should pray at home if you cannot stand and pray he should lie down and pray if he cannot lie down in prayer to sit and pray there's no excuse for the woman if they are having menstrual cycle then they excused and if if the post little then they may they may have to miss but this Salah which they miss they don't have to complete sit by the reason is that Salah is an act it's a further which is done five times a day if you miss it for any reason and if you're told to fast later on suppose seven days you miss it then if you have to fast if you have to sorry Pray Again it would be double what you are praying every day five times besides the Sunnah Etc and again you pray additional as compared Let me Give an example that if you are hungry and maybe you could not eat for seven days that doesn't mean that once you start getting food you start eating double every day to compensate it you may eat little bit more that's it that doesn't mean you eat keep on eating double instead of three meals a day you have six meals a day for the next seven days so this because it suffered and every day you have to do it so during normal days it will be an additional double burden so it's ah Allah is giving concession so it's leniency to the woman that Allah has forgiven them and so you need not pray and you did not compensate later on in comparison to fasting fasting as I say somewhat like overhauling of the human body like you know when you have a machine or maybe a car certain machine require over oiling once in six months sometime once a year similarly when you have a car so these machine if you allow me to call a human being a machine then human being is the most complicated machine on the face of the Earth no do you think it requires over oiling or a servicing so this Ramadan is a Servicing of the human body once a year for one month now imagine suppose you're doing servicing of a car once a year or once in six months and if you forget and you delay by one month you cannot okay now now I did not service I was supposed to service every January next January came and I forgot so I'll wait for next January no the moment you have a chance to service it you do it if you couldn't do in January do it in February if you can't do it in February do it in in March the earlier the better similarly because you could not fast while you are menstruating the earliest the moment that menstruation is over you start fasting you continue fasting if it is Ramadan you continue once Ramadan is over you compensate for the fast you missed so that your overhauling of the body the servicing of the body is is completed the benefits that you get from the fasting is completed the medical benefits which you can discuss in detail later on and the very spiritual benefits which is only once in a year once a month so to you not to miss for the lady not to miss all these benefits whether it be medical benefits spiritual benefits the blessings and the forgive me that Allah gives it is required that you compensate for the fast preferably before the coming of next Ramadan the earlier the better if not in show all the next month but preferably before next Amazon but for any reason if you're sick for a very long time and if you could not compensate or make up for the first you have missed one in the full year you can surely pick it up the next year but don't delay it faster the better and that's the reason fasting is has to be compensated in which the Salah does not have to be compensated"
