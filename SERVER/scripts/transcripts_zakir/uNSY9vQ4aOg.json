  "title": "Is Saying Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem before Eating a Sunnah? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "we've arrived at the last question for today in the interview phase and it's uh quite a straightforward and simple one you do hear many Muslims pronounce before they eat is this a sunah as far as my knowledge gos I have not heard of any say Hadith I have not come across any say Hadith any authentic Hadith in which the prophet said that before eating you have to say or the prophet said before eating any in fact all the Hadi that I know he only said bismah and even if you read the Hadith of sari number seven in the book of foods Hadith number 5376 the prophet says to a young boy that before eating say the name of Allah Say bah and eat with the right hand and eat what is close to you even the Hadith of AA may Allah be pleased with her it's mentioned Sun Abu da volume number three in the book of foods Hadith number 3758 may Allah be pleased with her Allah be pleased with her she said that when you eat you should say bismah in the name of Allah and if you forget to say bah before eating then whenever you remember say which means that in the name of Allah in the beginning and in the name of Allah towards the end so this is the teaching of the Prophet M wasallam but unfortunately people because of lack of knowledge they say in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful and when I reminded one of the brothers that you know Bismillah is Right authentic what's the is more in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful isn't it better than Bismillah I said if the prophet didn't say it and do you think you want to improve on the prophet so then I asked him the same logic if I use when I'm slaughtering the animal when you sacrificing the animal you sayb you can't say in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful imagine a slaughtering animal and then sing in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful so unfortunately Muslims because of lack of knowledge instead of following the Quran they try and use their own logic and they try and improve which is totally wrong we should follow what Allah and his have said"
