  "title": "Why do People Commit Sins if the Devils are Chained in Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "if all the devils are chained during the month of ramadan how come people continue to commit sins and i do agree with you this is a common question and i remember several years back when i was in school and when i heard this hadith that the devils are chained in the month of ramadan immediately the question that came to my mind and the question that comes to many muslims mind and many non-muslims is that if the devils are chained then how do people how do human beings that commit sins this question is based on the hadith of sallam which i mentioned earlier of muslim ahmed number two page number 230 hadith number 7148 which is also repeated in sunnah nisai chapter number five hadith number 2106 where the beloved prophet said that only people the blessed month of ramadan is approaching and allah has ordained for you that you fast in this month and the gates of heaven will be open in this month and the gates of hell will be closed and the devils will be chained in this month is the night which is better than a thousand months and a person who's deprived of the blessing in this month is truly a deprived person now when we give this hadith it clearly mentions that in this month of ramadan the devils will be changed and it's a logical question if devils are chained then how do human beings commit sins to make the people understand we have to realize that when the devils are chained it does not mean that the devils are slain they have been killed they are present but they are chained they are not killed the power is yet there but it is diminished for a better understanding i like to give you an example that when there is a lion or a tiger who is free there are high chances that he may kill you your life is in ninja but the moment that tiger or that line is chained you are safe you are safe as long as you maintain a safe distance the tiger has been chained if you come too close to him there are chances yet you can be killed so as long as you maintain the distance from the tiger who is chained you are safe similarly in the month of ramadan if you maintain a safe distance from the satan you will be saved and if you read the quran allah says in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse 168 be careful of the shaitaan of the footsteps of the devil for he is to you and about enemy many places allah subhanahu ta'ala says in the quran that be careful of the footsteps of the devil allah doesn't say that be careful of the devil because a normal muslim an average muslim who has average iman when he sees the devil in front of him he will be careful for example suppose there's a young girl who comes to an average muslim a young boy who has average iman if a young girl comes and tells him that let's spend the night together that muslim will say spending the night together with a girl it's haram it is zinna he will immediately object but that same girl if that girl phones that young boy and speaks to him on the phone the boy will say speaking to a girl on the phone there is no problem so he speaks to the girl for a few times on the phone for a few minutes later on the girl says let's go and have some snacks in mcdonald's on kentucky fried chicken having snacks for a few minutes for half an hour with a girl in mcdonald's no problem so he goes and has snacks with a girl and mcdonald's later on the girl says why not have dinner in a restaurant having dinner with a girl in restaurant for a couple of firsts no problem then the girl says why not spend the night together and then the boy says spending the night together with a girl no problem so this is footsteps of the devil this is not mentioned in the quran this is just my own example so what allah warns us is that be careful of the shaitaan the footsteps of the devil if the devil comes directly in front of an average muslim who has iman he will abstain he will run away from it but are the things which are dangerous so what we have to realize when the devil is chained his footsteps are restricted so many of the sins are prevented but if we go close to him then the chances that we'll be overtaken by the devil and commit a sin are very high so what we have to be careful that in ramadan if we keep the distance then the chance of committing sin is less but if we go close to the satan even though he's chained like how a tiger can walk even after his chain same the devil so this is my understanding and the beloved prophet said the devils are chained the devil cannot move but less distance so if we keep the distance we'll be safe the second reason that i feel is that in the month of ramadan though the devils are chained we fail to realize that the balance 11 months they are free and the impact that the devil has on the human beings for these 11 months it leaves those impact that impression in the month of ramadan to give a better understanding i always give the example that there are drug peddlers which try and get customers the youngsters from the colleges from the universities so what they do initially they give the drug free and they entice the youngsters for having drugs later on after some time they charge a nominal amount for the drug later on they charge an exorbitant amount but by the time the youngster is already hooked onto the drug so even if the drug dealer is not there they will try and find where the drug deal is they will go out of the way to find him and get the truck and many of them even if the drug peddler the drug dealer is imprisoned by the law they will go out of the way to find someone else they may go in a chemist shop and buy mandrakes whatever it is they are so much hooked on to it so these people who have become addicts to drugs or rather say addicted to the satan even though the satan is imprisoned the effect is yet there so in this way we understand as a drug dealer as a duck peddler even after he goes the drug addict gets accustomed to that drug so we human beings we are accustomed to the sin and even though the satan is imprisoned we keep on committing these mistakes but mainly those people who have become addicts fall in this category so those who do major sin for this category but the normal muslims the average muslims who haven't become addicted it's easy for them to stay away from sin and the third reason that i give is that though there are some scholars who say that in this month of ramadan the strong devils the marriage they're imprisoned the smaller ones are free so they keep on committing mistakes but on my understanding the third reason is that though the devils are chained by allah they can yet whisper and one of the ways the devils try and get the human beings close to them if by whispering and allah says in the quran in surah nas chapter number 114 verse number one to six they whisper in the hearts of the human beings and they withdraw amongst them the jin and men is talking about the satanist talking about the devils whispering to the hearts of the human being and the withdrawal and among these devils are the jinn and the human beings so maybe allah has imprisoned the devils who are the jinn but the human being v are yet free so one category of devils that the jinns have been imprisoned but the satanists are even amongst the men that's what allah says why it free and yet we have to be careful of the whisper of the devil the versa this wasa mainly is the thing that attracts towards the sin the sins are committed but the chances are less and furthermore it's clearly mentioned for hadith that allah has ordained for you in this month of ramadan that you should fast only if you fast according to me will the devils be imprisoned that's talking about the devils that are going to attract you so allah says if you fast allah ordain for your fasting and the devils will be put in chains so the devils that after you if you fast surely they'll be restricted the criteria for us to be away from the devil is to fast if you fast for the proper nia seeking the world of allah surely the devil will not be able to entice you and the best logical way to prove this is if we check the crime rate of the muslim countries doing ramadan it goes down but if you check the crime rate of the non-muslim countries in ramadan it is the same the reason is that because they are not fasting the non-muslims this devil yet has an effect on them because the muslims are fasting if not all properly at least majority or at least quite a large number so because of that the crime rate in the muslim country than the month of ramadan is low as compared to the other months but the crime rate in the non-muslim country is approximately the same indicating otherwise even the non-muslims they will not commit any sins so the criteria is that you have to fast properly for the sake of allah"
