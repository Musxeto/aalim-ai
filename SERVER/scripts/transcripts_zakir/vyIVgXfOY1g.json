  "transcript": "what's exactly here some scholars say that smoking is haram i'd like to know what's your opinion and does smoking invalidate the fast as far as smoking is concerned several years before when science had an advantage that far most of the scholars used to say that smoking is makru based in hadith mentioned say bihari very number one in the book of aadhaan hadith number eight five five where the prophet said that anyone who eats garlic or onion they should stay away from us and stay away from the mosque prophet said that you know don't come to the mosque after having garlic onion because this bad breath when you're smoking the breath is worse than onion or garlic so based on this hadith therefore garlic and it doesn't become haram it was maku so based on this hadith scholars give the father that smoking is macro but now after science has advanced we have come to know that smoking is nothing but it's a slow poisoning tobacco in any form whether in smoking cigarettes whether bd whether tobacco hookah whether chewing tobacco all forms of tobacco contain nicotine and tar and we know it's nothing but slow poisoning that is the reason most of the non-muslims also they agree that smoking is haram not only the muslim world even the non-muslim that's the reason they put a statutory warning on the cigarette packs they put a statutory warning saying cigarette smoking is injurious to health or in some countries it mentioned general surgeons warning or surgeon general's warning smoking is injurious to health and anyone gives the ad whether newspaper in the magazine or television it is compulsory that they have to highlight the statement smoking is injurious to health so i'm talking about the muslim world even the non-muslim world agrees that smoking is nothing but slow poisoning and today according to statistics the world health organization says that every year more than 4 million people die only because of smoking and if you count the other forms of tobacco it will be much more and today medical science tells us and even i had learned when i was doing my medicine in medical college that more than 90 percent of the lung cancer deaths are only due to smoking whether cigarette obedience whatever it is 25 of the cardiovascular deaths are only because of smoking 70 to 75 of bronchitis and related deaths are only because of smoking smoking is nothing but slow poisoning it blackens your lips blackens your gums your fingertips it damages your lips it damages the esophagus it damages your stomach and it can cause constipation it can cause loss of appetite it can cause loss of libido your sexual power gets suppressed it can cause immunity to the drugs you take and it reduces the defense of your body and you can only give a talk on why smoking is haram and i've given a talk on diety laws in islam and i've covered this topic in detail time doesn't permit me here but based on all these various research there are today more than 400 fatwas the majority of the scholars they agree that smoking is haram and all form of tobacco is haram there may be certain scholars of certain countries including this country where i come from india they say it is mahru yet but most of the scholars otherwise throughout the world majority of them they agree that smoking is in the quran in surah chapter number 7 verse 157 that you follow the prophet the unleaded prophet who is mentioned in your law and scriptures and further it says that this prophet asks you to do things which are good for you tie up for you so take what he gives it to you what is lawful and good and he prohibits things which are habits things which are unlawful things which are bad for you so what a prophet gives what he gives you which is good take and he prohibits of things which are habits unlawful you have to abstain from it this is alone and allah says from the quran in surah bahar chapter number 2 verse 195 make not your own hands the cause of your own destruction indicating they do not kill your own self because smoking is nothing but so poisoning it comes in this category something like suicide slow poisoning every puff you take you reduce your life so based on this there are more than 400 fatwas saying that smoking is haram and furthermore this is one of the major reasons why furthermore allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 7 verse number 31 eat and drink would not be extravagant allah says number 17 verse number 26 27 that do not be extravagant do not be a spendthrift for verily a person who's a spent thrift is the brother of the satan is the brother of the devil and we know that when we smoke in nothing but extravagance it's nothing but taking a pound note or a few pounds or taking a dollar note the green dollar bill or a pound and lighting up with fire when we smoke when we let the cigarette it's nothing but burning money whether it be rupees whether it be dollars whether it be pounds whether it be realized it's nothing but extra wagons which is haram in islam and you can give a list of reasons why it's haram but just to get a shot one more reason that you cannot harm your own neighbor you cannot harm your own brother and in smoking when you exhale out the smoke it causes more damage to your neighbor passive smoking is more dangerous than active smoking when the person who smokes when he exhales out if the person who's a neighbor inhales the smoke it causes more damage to him than the person who smokes that's the reason many countries like singapore said are the band smoking in public places in your personal house you can do it in public places and government places smoking has been meant so based on this haram so smoking is haram"
