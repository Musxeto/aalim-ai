  "title": "Can a Muslim Greet a Non-Muslim with 'Assalaamu Alaikum' - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the asked a common question that can a Muslim greet a non-muslim Witham Alum or if a non-muslim greets assalamu alaykum can you wish back waum asalam and I'm aware that there are many scholars who do say that when a Muslim wishes you asalam alaykum you have to say alum and this answer is based in several Hadith which are given in say Muslim and if you read say Muslim volume number three in the book of Salam chapter number 94 Hadith number 5,380 to 5,390 there are 11 Hadith mentioned in say Muslim regarding this topic but if you analyze the Hadith the first few Hadith say that when the Jews wishum Assam alum in Arabic means May death be on you when the Jews wish youum may death be on you the prophet said wish them back alayum may it be on YouTube so the reference to context is that when the non-muslims knowingly wish evil for youum sounding similar to assalam alaykum when the wish made death be on you you have to wish back thinging alayum on you too but many of the scholars say that when even the non-muslims wish assalam alaykum you have to wish back alayum which if you go into details you can get the reply from the Quran and the let's see what does the Quran say regarding greeting back and I said in my Talk inaha 4: 86 which says [Music] that when anyone greets you courteously wish back more courteously or a greeting which is of equal courtesy because Allah is careful in keeping of the accounts where greeting back is concerned we can greet them back so regarding the question if someone wishes youkum what should you reply based on this quranic verse you can wish back more ly or at least the same that's what the Quran says regarding can you wish them first there are Hadi of beloved prophet and the same Muslim says that when you meet you are a Christian don't wish them Etc and there are various different opinion in the various groups of Scholars but when you go to the Quran Quran and the had is the best example to be followed the Quran says in Surah maram chapter number 19 verse number 47 that when IAH Alam Abra PE upon him when his father who was a mush removes him from his house he says I will pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala to forgive you Quran says that ibraim Alam told his father asum and I will pray to my almighty God to forgive you further if you read inah chap number 20 verse 47 it says that M Alam and Haram Moses and Aaron peace be upon them they were commanded by Allah subhana wa ta'ala that when they delivered the message to pharaoh and his people to wish them by saying peace be on them those who receive guidance and this was one of the way the prophet when he dictated letters he said to the non-muslim kings that peace be on you those who receive guidance further if you read in Surah fan 25: 63 it says that when those approach you who are ignorant tell them tell them Peace So when the ignorant come to you who give vain talks say wish them peace fur chapter 28 verse 55 says that when you in the company of those people who give Vin talks and who speak against Islam tell them to us is our Deeds to you is your Deeds peace be on you wish them Salam mean those who speak against Islam the Quran says wish them Salam so there's no problem at all in wishing a non-muslim Salam and if you read the of the quranic verses if you read the of regarding Sur maram chapter 19:47 it says that regarding the explanation of this verse when Ibrahim Alam tells his father that peace be on you I will ask Allah sub to forgive you most of the scholars the jamhur scholars they say that here the peace was only a form of greeting like saying farewell it wasn't a form of asking protection so they say that this was a form of greeting while in his he says that according toab he said that here it actually means peace and further if you read the statement of Nash he said that it is allowed for the Muslims to wish Salam to the non-muslim though the majority of the scholars say that here the greeting was only a form of agreeing it was not asking for protection and further if you read the statement which kurbi says that I agree more with the statement OFA who said and for his explanation he quot chapter number 60 verse number 8 and say Allah forbids not you from being just to those people who fight you not against your religion nor drive you out of your house for Allah loves those who are just that means you have to be just to the people who fight you not against your religion or drive you not out of your house and he further says that the Quran says in Sur chapter number 60 verse number four that verily in the life of ibraim alam you find a very good example what ibraim Alam did alhamdulillah you find a very good example so when he can wish peace to his father why can't you so based on the scholars if you see the various even of and when he gives the translation and the commentary of Surah 4: 86 it says that this verse which says that when anyone wishes you courteously wish back more courteously does not referring to the Muslim it can refer to any creature of Allah subhana wa ta'ala so if you analyze there are a few group of Scholars who say that it is preferable that you not wish them only say alum but there are other group of Scholars who say that you can wish them you can initiate the greeting as well as wish them back more courtesy I agree more with those group of Scholars who say that you can greet non-muslims because if you read the saying of M M pleas with him when he was asked can you greet Salam to a non-muslim he said yes and he did that to his companions and he said we Muslims have come here to spread peace if you read the saying of Abu Usama may Allah be pleased with him he said that he used to greet the non-muslims whether Christian Jews Etc with peace so there are Scholars majority who do say that you can wish but many scholars who say that's preferable to say alum I agree more with those who say that you can wish Salam to non-muslim as well as wish them back waum Asam hope they answer the question"
