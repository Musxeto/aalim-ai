  "transcript": "most of us are aware of the history of Palestine Hitler incinerated 6 million Jews it was a holocaust many of these Jews they took shelter in Palestine and our Muslim Brothers in Palestine they welcomed them with Open Hearts they welcome the cousins the Jews with Open Hearts come and take shelter in our home they welcome them but what happened many years later these same people who were welcomed by the Muslim Brothers in Palestine they take them out of their own home they occupy their home and when the Muslim brothers are crying please give a home back they are calling them as terrorists and this is common you see this happening many places in the world we know that the britishers the French the Portuguese they occupied more than two3 of the world especially the britishers they occupied many parts of the world they came to my country India when bakar Singh tried to take them out of India they called him as the biggest terrorist at that time they occupied US America and when George Washington fought against for the the freedom of the country the britishers called George Washington as terrorist number one we know the history of South Africa Nelson Mandela when he fought for his freedom he was called as terrorist number one and imprisoned in Robin Island for more than 25 years but we Indians we call basting as a freedom fighter not a terrorist the Americans they call George Washington not as a terrorist but as one of the greatest Freedom f Fighter the South Africans they call Nelson Mandela not as the terrorist but one of the greatest Freedom Fighter same way today when our Muslim Brothers in Palestine they are doing they are protecting the third holiest place of Islam Masjid AA and when they are fighting for the freedom most of the western world and Israel are calling them terrorist we Muslims we call them as Freedom Fighters for more than 50 years in the last one month they have killed thousands of innocent Palestinians women children we condemn this genocide and we ask the world to tell Israel to stop this genocide we pray for a Palestinian brothers and sisters that may Allah subhana wa ta'ala Grant jna to the
