the angels in the \nbattlefield you know Mama held in the Battle of   badar with angels I can go on and on talking only \nabout the prophet of Allah so if you are Hindu   and if you believe in the Hindu scriptures you \nalso have to believe the last and final author   the last and final messenger in Hinduism \nis Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him according to Hinduism the kalki avtar is still \nbeing awaited so are you uh is it that if you   have not I'm just not aware about it you said \nis yet awaited if you have not recognized not   me I have given you so many similarities now \nyou have to disprove it you say my scripture   says Vishnu Yas father's name Prophet Muhammad's \nname what not Vishnu Yas you have to disprove   me now this has been done by pundits of Hinduism \n[Applause] now the Hindu Scholars are preventing   the truth from you they are hiding the truth \nfrom you you as a logical girl as intelligent   girl who's working in a high post it's your duty \nto realize that if your priests are hiding the   truth from you we can have a debate with your \npriest you can call the doctors of divinity you   know I have a dialogues with pandis you know one \nof the very famous he never disagreed he agreed   he agreed with what I said about Oneness of \nalmighty God has got no images he believed in   Prophet Muhammad sallam he did not accept that's a \ndifferent thing because he will lose his following   therefore sister do you have a following so \nyou have no fear to lose the following so   when I've given you so many references with giving \nquotations I'm not pulling a fast one you can very   well go and check and verify but after you verify \ndo you accept in the last and final messenger   do you yes so do you believe in Prophet \nMuhammad peace be upon him mashallah do you believe that there's one God yes I \ndo do you believe almighty God has got no   images yes I do so you believe there's \nGod and he has no images yes and do you   believe Prophet Muhammad is a messenger of \nGod yes I do then you're a Muslim sister what you said is the shahada in English do you \nwant to repeat in Arabic if you want sister what   you said is in English that there's no God but \nAllah and Prophet Muhammad is a messenger would   you like to repeat an Arabic sister I do okay I'll \njust repeat it and you have to continue sister I bet mashallah sister may Allah sister may Allah reward you you have joined \na family of religion of Peace of more than   1.3 to 1.5 billion may Allah reward you and may \nAllah Grant you Jannah inshallah and believe me   sister require guts I feel that masha'allah I \nreally admire your guts more than masha'allah and I pray that may give you and may guide you \ninshallah and sister if
