  "transcript": "satan disobeyed allah only once and he was accused allah forgives human beings in spite of their disobedience frequent disobedience if they repent will allah forgive iblis if he repents today if you read the quran the story of admiral salam and iblees is mentioned several times in the quran in surah baqarah chapter two today are of chapter number seven surah chapter number 15 surah chapter number eight in several places and if you realize in the story the moment adam al-salam adam peace be upon him he realized his mistake he repented allah and allah immediately forgive him and if both of them will be pleased with them all but if you note the story of iblees it's mentioned in surah chapter number 7 verse number 14. when it believed allah says that we said to the angels bowed down to adam all bowed down illah iblees except iblees mentioned surah baqarah chapter 2 surah chapter 7 but instead of repenting to allah subhanahu talibrah says in surah chapter 7 verse 14 that give me respite till the day they are raised up let me respect means please delay my punishment give me respite and see what i do he challenges allah that i challenge you so allah says in surah araf chapter number 7 verse number 18 he gives them respect and says that all those women will follow you i will fill hell with all of you and as far as ible is repenting here the question doesn't come because allah further says in surah chapter 15 verse 34 that he is the accursed one that allah has the knowledge of the future of the unseen so allah knows in advance that this person he will never repent as allah says in the quran in surah chapter 2 7 and 8 allah says that allah has put a seal on the hearts of those people on those kafirs and they will never come to the straight path and similarly we have examples of allah predicts even about abu lahab that you are one of the strongest enemies of the beloved prophet allah tells in advance he reveals the surah the father of the flame he was one of the strangest enemies to the prophet and he says that he will never accept islam and he will burn in hell it was a prediction all he had to do to prove the quran wrong was to say that i am muslim and shahadah ten years he had the portion he did not do it so allah knew they will never repent similarly allah knows that he believes he will never repent so that's the reason he said that he is to you and about enemy allah says in surah chapter 2 verse 168 that yahweh lives in aminu oh you believe be careful of the quran shaytan of the footsteps of the devil for he to you is an about enemy so with all the verses of the quran realize that iblees will never repent and allah knows that therefore he is called he's the award enemy of the human being and he is accused so he will never repent he'll never ask for forgiveness"
