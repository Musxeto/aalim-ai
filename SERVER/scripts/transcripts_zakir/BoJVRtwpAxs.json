  "transcript": "the next question really for me would be why is it such a special thing to seek repentance during this holy blessed month of Ramadan this month is special because Allah subhana WA Ta'ala he forgives his slaves his servants the maximum in this month therefore it is given the title Ramadan the month of forgiveness and a beloved puffiness loss from sin it's mentioned in hadith of Tirmidhi in the book of fasting highly domestic say to where our beloved partner Salah Sam said that then the first night of Ramadan comes the devils and the demons they are chained and the gates of hell are closed not even a single gate is open and the gates of heaven they open not even a single gate is closed and the caller he caused the people that all those who wanted good please come and those who are doing evil please desist and Allah subhana WA Ta'ala he ransoms these slaves and he does that every night of Ramadan and a beloved partner salah salem he further said its mention is a hadith of Timothy hadith number three five four five where the beloved partner salah salem man she goes on the pulpit before given khutba and he says amin amin amin trace the people us that no messenger why so the messenger of allah so allah says that archangel gabriel had come to him and said that anyone who does not have his sins forgiven after i'm done is approached and enters hellfire ask allah to keep a distance from him and then Gabriel says tammam Salam say army vamos a la francaise I mean means it's unfortunate that anyone witnesses the month of Ramadan and does not have his sins forgiven because this is the month of forgiveness and a beloved part merciless from sin this machine is a Bihari one number three in the book of fasting hadith number one nine zero one that if anyone fasts in the complete month of Ramadan with belief and seeking the reward of allah subhanaw taala all these passes will be forgiven that reason i'm dan is called as the month of forgiveness Subhan Allah and dr. Zakia we used to have a saying back in the days before I embrace Islam that I wish it could be Christmas every day and I'm gonna say I wish you could be Ramadan every day now more appropriately"
