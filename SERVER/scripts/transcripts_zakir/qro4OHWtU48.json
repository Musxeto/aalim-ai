  "transcript": "in the field of Medicine previously we did not know that the honey was obtained from the belly of the bee the Quran says chapter number 16. verse number 69 from the belly of the beef we give you a drink of varying colors in which there is healing for humankind it was only 300 years before approximately we came to know that the honey was obtained from the belly of the bee and now we have come to know that honey is rich in vitamin K as well as fructose recently we have come to know that even the honey has got mild antiseptic properties no wonder the Russian soldiers in World War II they use the honey to cover up the wounds which prevented the evaporation of moisture and the healing in the wound was done with leaving of very little scar tissue and due to the density of Honey germs and bacteria were prevented to grow in the wound and if a patient is suffering from the allergy of a particular plant if honey is obtained from that plant and given to that patient that patient starts developing resistance to it imagine what science has come to know today recently Quran mentions that in the honey there is healing for humankind"
