  "transcript": "I am a lady stealer is it allowed to measure a woman before throwing her clothes because I'm the only one who can do that job Alison Goom from Gambia Alison welcome from gamba has a question that is a lady tailor can he measure the ladies before swinger clothes and he says he's the only one who can do the job as far as being a lady still a person teaching the clothes of ladies not haram but the saucy things maybe are you cannot take the measurement of a lady because she's vietnam-era unless you know if it's a Mirim of your wife or your sister by a mother's permitted but taking measurement of a lady you have to put the measuring tape and your touch a body this is prohibited in Islam it's not permitted what my advice to you can be you can have a lady assistant who does that or the best is to have a matter with you like your daughter or your wife or your sister who can take the measurement and dictate to you and you can write down teaching clothes purses not haram but if you measure a lady and you touch her that is Haram if you think you're the best in doing this job as you said I'm the only one who can do the job and you may be a designer so as long as you do not break any of the rules of the Sharia you do it in the way that Sharia allows you are having a Mirim lady with you who takes a measurement and then tells you and then you stitch and she takes a trial and she does basically the talking and you don't involve in you know staring at a woman or you know touching her so if you take precaution of this then you can continue or if you cannot take my advice would to you would be that you change the job"
