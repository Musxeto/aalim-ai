  "transcript": "there is a question on the Facebook by shahe Fahad if parents stopped their son from keeping a beard then what should the son do a similar question is posed by IH Rousseau on the what's up so my mother always tells me to cut my beard I'm 19 years old what should I do a similar question is posed by Tala from Pakistan if keeping beard for a Muslim optional or complicity if it's complicity then will we get a sin every dime we shave similar question posed by Ramiz Rahman from West Bengal India can I join the army as it is not allowed to keep a beard there the basic question that is keeping a beard compulsory and if my parents asked me to not keep a beard what should I do can I do job he doesn't have a beard a beloved prophet or masala Salim said if machines say Bihari 1 number 7 hadith number 5 8 9 - a beloved Prophet peace be upon him said that do the opposite of what the mushriks do premium who stretches and grow your beard so this is the commandment from that profit they do the opposite of what the idol worship was to trim your most wretched and grow your beard and since it's a commandment and there is no opposite action it becomes one of the for Muslims to keep the beard and there is an animus agreement amongst all the 4 I am mines Imam Abu Hanifa Imam Malik Imam Shafi a  humble all the four schools of thought all the four am eyes they agree that keeping a beard is hard so it is hard for every Muslim to keep up yet regarding the question if I shave am i doing the same yes you are doing the same it is fun to keep a beard and all the Muslim men should keep a beard what if my mother tells me not to keep a beard Allah says in the Quran that you love your parents you have to respect them Allah says in surah Rahman chap number 31 verse number 14 they have enjoined on the human me to be kind with the parents and entailed upon traveled in the mother both them and in painless example the next was so no look man chapter 31 15 but if your parents forced you to worship somebody else besides Allah if your parents do jihad struggle and strive to make you worship somebody else besides Allah of who you have no knowledge they do not obey them so the basic ruling is you have to obey your parents but if the parents tell you something against a line is rasul tell you against the teaching of the glorious quran and say hadith that is the time you don't have to obey them so here because keeping a beard is further and if your parents request you not to be playable you should explain to them tell them the benefits have given a talk on if the label shows your intent to wear it and I spoken about the beard and wearing the cap and talks about the ankle but naturally keeping a beard as forth and covering your head with a cap is not a fault it's a Sunnah so even if your parents say you have to convince your parents that this is the commandment of the Creator and if you keep they'll get most of up and that will also benefit the parents regarding can you do a job which tells you not to be prepared whether it be in the army or whether it be any other job if the job you are doing if they tell you that do not keep a beard you should not do that job because it is a commandment of a beloved prophet it's a fun if they ask you to something which is Haram you should not do it is better to take a job which permits you even though you may get less salary keeping a beard effort"
