  "title": "Is Speaking while Eating Discouraged? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "question nine once we invited a guest forar he said it is discouraged to talk whilst eating in the religion of Islam is he correct I don't know of any Hadith of the Prophet malli wasallam where he said that you should not speak while eating Etc in fact Allah says in the Quran in 4:59 that if there's a difference go back to Allah and his there's no text in the Quran which says you should not speak while eating there's no text in the Hadith in which the prophet commanded you should not speak while eating in fact there a Hadith exactly the opposite the prophet spoke while eating for example if you read the Hadith of s Muslim volume number three Hadith number 5093 where the Prophet was served vinegar and he said that vinegar is a good food while eating there other Hadi in which the prophet said that do not eat with your left hand for the Satan eats with the left hand again this is while eating Hadi of s bukari volume number s Hadith number 5376 where the Beloved Prophet wasallam said there was a boy who was eating with the prophet and he was moving his hand around so the prophet said eat with your right hand and eat from what is close to you so this he said while eating so all this Hadith prove that there is no restriction for speaking while eating whenever there's a difference go back to Allah andol and you'll get the answer"
