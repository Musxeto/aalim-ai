  "title": "Six Circumstances in which Backbiting is Permitted - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "backbiting of course is prohibited irrespective weather in Ramadan or outside Ramadan however would a woman who complains to her husband about her mother-in-law will she be considered as a person who has backbited regarding backbiting being Haram and the major thing we discussed in the last episode and there are various Hadith and quranic verses it's one of the major things but as far as a wife complaining to the husband but natural she is speaking something about the Mother-in-law whether mother-in-law would not like anyone speaking about so it does come in the category of like biting is it a sin is a question such incidences where a person complains to someone and thinks and feels that once the complaint is given to the person maybe there is a correction in action like a wife complained to the husband about the Mother-in-law or the wife complained with the husband about a son that he is doing so into things which are wrong so the husband will correct being a father of the child or maybe one of the two brothers is going incumbent to the father that my brother did so and so thing which is wrong it's speaking ill about him behind but that is so that the father can correct the brother so these things have been permitted because the main reason while doing this thing should not be to mock at someone or should not be to belittle anyone but the main purpose should be that the person who the person is complaining about there should be correction in Act and if you read the commentary of Imam and now we as far as the Hadith of say Muslim which we discussed in the last episode Hadith number 6265 in which the prophet peace be upon him he said do you know what is backbiting and the Sabbath said that the messenger knows the best so the prophet said that if someone speaks about another person behind the back which you would not like that's called as backbiting and the Sabbath what if I'm speaking about the person is true the prophet said then it will be called as backbiting if it's false it will be called a slandering So based on this the commentary of this Hadith he said that backbiting gibat in fixed conditions it's permitted number one he says that if something is told to a ruler of the land or to a judge complaining against the act of another human being who has done wrong to the person maybe he is stored in some wealth from you taking your property away while an injustice to you so if you go and complain to a ruler or to a judge against another human being another Muslim this is permitted because you want the wrong to be undone so in such cases give birth is permitted category number two that if you complain to someone who you feel that person has an influence on the person who has that an evil act or a sin and you feel that he will stop doing that evil act you're permitted for example if you know of a friend who is very close to the person who run evil act or done a sin and if you tell him that your friend has the insurance or so and so think or drinking alcohol and you feel that he has an influence on the other person and he can prevent him from doing the sin it's permitted so the question regarding the wife complained with the husband either comes in the first category or the second category either it's an injustice done to the wife or maybe the wife wants to tell the husband that do correct the Mother-in-law it may come in first two categories the remaining four categories which Imam and now we said give birth can be done the third is that if you are approaching a Mufti or a religious person for some religious advice so you may say that my father had done so and so act or my wife had done so and so act and described that and asking what should I do even in this case if you avoid naming the father or the mother or say in the third person that my friend's father doing so and so it is preferable but in such cases while taking religious advice for a particular act it's permissible the fourth category which Imam and Nobi says that giba is permitted if that when you know of a narrator who is a liar and if he narrates any Hadith so it becomes incumbent on you to tell the people that he's a liar or his memory is weak because to protect the Sharia or for example if someone is selling a Slave and if you know that there are some bad habits in the slave or maybe he does adultery so it's compulsory that the person who's selling it should tell to the buyer that the slave has so and so false or if a person asks you that he wants to marry another person and ask you how well the person so that becomes obligated on you to tell the wrong points or the points which are not correct in that human being the intention here is not to belittle that human being your intention here is not to degrade the person but intention is to give the right information whether for marriage or for business so in these cases this is the fourth category where Imam and now we says that is permitted I find the fifth category is concerned that if you know a person is doing a major sin openly I keep drinking openly or if he's cheating openly or if he's robbing openly so then you can tell the public at large that this person is a person who cheats or a person Robs a person who discontinuously or there is a religious person who you know who is going Fatma and you know that he's not a personal truthful so here it's permitted that you can speak against the person and the six category is that while identifying a person if someone asks you for identification at that time to identify the person you may have to use his nickname which the person may not like like you may have to tell that the person who shot person who's tall so here you're using these nicknames to identify the person with the person may not like mainly finding here also if you can avoid this nickname fine fiction is the best but if you can't avoid you can do six categories in which gibat is permitted thank you Dr zakira"
