  "transcript": "you may be the richest man in the world you may have the maximum luxury but compared to the luxury of a in J it will be a billion times better so if you compare the difference between the poorest man who goes to Jenna and the richest man in the world going to Jenna the difference is very less so this world you should not be bothered whether you're poor or Rich whether you're a king or a poer you should be bothered that you pass the test because the Jenna and the prophet said it is more easier for the poor man to go to Jenna than a rich man because the rich man has to give kab he has to give accountability of everything more difficult so comparatively it is billion times better than the richest man in the world and compared to the poor man also it is a billion times hardly any difference and the jam is so worse the description given in the Quran and the Hadith even if you are the poorest man in this world it will be like paradise the fire when comes on your feet your brains will boil can you believe so this is the explanation and this Quran it prevents you to go to jahannam and encourages to go to Jenna that's the reason I call the Glorious Quran a global necessity"
