  "transcript": "from the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam regarding fasting being like a shield a protection could you Enlighten us with a little bit more information about why it's a shield why is fasting a shield the prophet said in say buhari one number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1894 that fasting is a shield the similar message is repeated inside volume 3 book of fasting Hadith number 1904 the prophet said fasting is a shield it will protect you from the Hellfire and prevent you from doing sins the reason a beloved Prophet Muslim said this is because that when a person eats and when stomach is full that's the time he can think of doing other Deeds many of which may be Haram which may be wrong but once a person is hungry he doesn't think of these Haram things only when the tummy is full can you think of doing something imagine if you're hungry if you're really very hungry you not think of going to a movie when you're really hungry on think of listening to music so that is the reason when a person is hungry it prevents him from doing the sins that is when Prophet said that it is like a shield and furthermore beloved Prophet Muslim says number four in the book of jihad Hadith number 2840 the Beloved Prophet said that anyone who fast for one day Allah will keep the Hellfire away from that person for a distance equivalent to 70 years Hadith said it's mentioned in hadithi book of jihad Hadith number 1624 the blood Prophet said that anyone who fast for one day Allah will make a trench between him and the Hellfire whose distance will be equivalent to the distance between the heavens and the Earth so that's why when person fasts it even constricts the pathway of the devil of the Satan and that's the reason it prevents him from doing the bad Deeds the false actions the false speech and that's why the prophet said it's a shield and to give one more example it's mentioned in number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1905 the prophet said that all those who have the means to get married they should get married because it will help them to lower the Gaze and guard the modesty but those who cannot marry they should fast it will give them chaste that means fasting also prevents you from doing the sinful Act of looking at an arm Haram it helps you lower the Gaze and prevents you from your mind diverting towards the illegal acts like adultery fornication but imagine if you are really hungry then no one will think of doing the devil acts that's the reason the prophets that fasting in The Shield thank you very much for the answer there Dr Zach here"
