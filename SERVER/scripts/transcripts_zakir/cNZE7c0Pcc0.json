  "title": "Why is Polygyny Allowed in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is joseph i have two questions to ask why all the muslims men are allowed to marry for four women and the second one is how can you prove that jesus was not crucified there was there's two questions but are you a christian i am brothers two questions that why does islam permit a man to have up to four wives why does some permit a man draw more than one wife and second question how can you prove that jesus christ peace be upon him was not crucified that quran is the only religious book on the face of the earth which says marry only one you read the bible you read the rama and you read the mahabharat you read the veda no religious book on the face of the earth says marry only one besides the quran if you read ramayana the hindu scriptures the father of sriram he had more than one wife if you read mahabharata shri christian how many wives he had four ten thousand ten thousand yet sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives so if shri christian can have sixteen thousand one and eight wives so why can't muslims have maximum up to four if you read the old testament it says that solomon peace be upon him at 700 wives abraham peace be upon him at three wives so old testament tells you can marry as many wives as we want same as the new testament says that you should follow old testament so in hinduism in christianity in judaism you can marry as many as you want it is later on that the church put a restriction that christians should marry only one it is later on rabbi benshimkan yoda passed a sign on and say the jews should marry only one otherwise previously they used to marry as many as they wished it is the indian penal code in india in 1954 that put a restriction and said under the hindu special marriage act the hindus should marry only one but the scriptures put no restrictions let's analyze what does the quran say quran says in surah nisa chapter 4 verse number 3 marry woman of a choice in twos threes or fours but if you can't do justice marry only one this statement if you can't do justice marry only one is only given in the quran and no other religious scriptures let us analyze why does quran give permission for the muslim men to marry more than one woman maximum four the reason is that by nature male and female are born in equal proportion but if you ask any pediatrician he will tell you the doctor of the children that the female child is stronger than the male child in fighting germs and diseases so you have more deaths among the male children as compared to female children so in periodic age itself the females are more than the males as life goes on there is death due to wars due to alcoholism due to drug addiction due to accident in all these cases more men are dying as compared to females so today in the world there are more females as compared to males in few countries like india and china the female population is less than the male population because of female feticide and female infanticide in india according to a bbc report every day more than a thousand features have been aborted after the identified as females if you multiply this figure by 365 you get a total of more than a million fetishes are being aborted every year in india after the identified that they're females according to the tamil nadu government hospital report out of 10 females born alive four are put to death if you stop this evil practice of female feticide and feminine infants and india even in india the female population will become more than the male population even in china if you stop this evil practice the female population become more than the male population today if you analyze in usa alone there are 4.7 million females more than males in uk alone there are 1.2 million females more than males in germany alone there are 1.6 million females more than males in russia alone there are 10.6 million females more than males and god alone knows that how many females are more than males throughout the world if i agree with you that one man should only marry one woman and suppose your sister happens to live in america or suppose my sister happens to live in usa and the market is saturated every man has found a wife for himself yet there will be 4.7 million females who will not fund life partner and if your sister happens to be one of them if my sister happens to be one of those 4.7 million females who have not found a life partner for themselves the only option for them is that she either marries a man who already has a wife or becomes public property public property such a harsh word it is the most sophisticated word i can use i cannot use a better word you know in america today the statistics tell us on average a man has eight different sexual partners before he settles down with one having mistresses in us is very common 5 10 20 30 no problem having more than one legal wife it doesn't go down their throat when a woman is a mistress she doesn't get a right she's dishonored she's not treated well in islam when a woman becomes the second wife she gets the honor she gets her right she is treated well any modest woman if you ask her that would you prefer being a second wife of a man who was already married or become public property they would opt for the first so islam has given permission for some men to have more than one wife to protect the modesty of the woman coming to your second question is it allowed for ladies to marry for men brother you're asking counter question the time is limited you ask two questions now you're asking a third question are you convinced with the first answer i am convinced of the first one mashaallah so you're convinced okay the brother asked that is a woman allowed to have more than one husband if you do that this problem will be exaggerated more i mean muslims in muslims as it is women are more than men if women marry more than one husband the problem will be exaggerated point number one point number two if a man has more than one wife and if the child is born you can easily identify who is the father who's the mother if a woman has more than one husband and the child is born the dna is still alone brother let me finish the answer now you asked the question was interfering was i interrupting yes or no no no so why are you interrupting after the finish you can ask now i'm a medical doctor are you a medical doctor no i'm a medical doctor i know about dna testing i come to it once if a woman has more than one husband two husband and if a child is born and if he goes to admit in the school and if the question who's your father she'll have to give two names you're talking about dna testing i know about it dna testing is recent was dna testing there 50 years back was it there no it's a new recent discovery yet it's not 100 percent even if i agreed 100 percent it is now it wasn't there before islam is there since time immemorial and this is not the only reason even if i agree tomorrow it becomes 100 perfect this is not the only reason today science tells us that man is more polygamous in nature as compared to the female today science tells us that during menstrual cycle the female undergo certain psychological changes it's not possible for her to do the role of multiple wives but a man doesn't undergo these changes it's possible for him to do a role of multiple husbands today science tells us that if a man has multiple sexual partners and all are faithful there is no problem but if a female has multiple sexual partners and all are faithful there are chances of sexually transmitted diseases to emerge and that disease will go back to the male partner so medically it is not acceptable that a female has multiple partners but medically and scientifically it's acceptable that a male can have multiple [Applause] partners"
