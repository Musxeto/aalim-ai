  "transcript": "Dr Zak here could you explain to us in brief or at length depending on the answer what are the main benefits of seeking repentance during this blessed month of Ramadan the benefits of seeking forgiveness repentance Toba is according to IM raani he gives three benefits for a person who repent number one it patches up the fault that a person has and he realizes the point of entry into the heart of the devil he realiz this is the point which is weak through which the devil can enter and this makes a person more aware and evasive of the evil number two is that the person he feels embarrassed and he's fearful of the Lord Allah subhana ta'ala and that brings in him the humility and the humbleness number three a person who has tasted the evil and then comes back to the good he has the taste of both the good and the evil he has the taste of sweet as well as the bitter so when he sees other brothers other human beings committing the same fault he is soft towards them and he forgives them and he helps them according to imim he gives six benefits for a personal number one when a person repents it is the best thing that Allah loves Allah subhana taala loves when a person repents and he ask for forgiveness because when a person repents he's very close to Allah subhana wa tala and you find humility and humbleness number two the act of repentance is one of the best acts of worship where Allah subhana ta'ala he realizes that his slave that his servant he has come back to the true part and he ask for forgiveness and he believes in Allah subhana wa tala and it makes Allah subhana tala as I mentioned earlier that more happier than a person when he find his camel which is lost number three it brings humility and humbleness in a person so he starts believing in the cre Allah subhana tal much more than before number four when a person repents his heart is broken and this is the time when Allah subhah wa ta'ala he hears the duas the repentance as the Beloved Prophet wasallam said M ma volume number three book of fasting Hadith number 1752 that Allah subhana wa taala just the supplication of three people one is a just ruler or IM second is a person who's fasting and the third a person who's oppressed in another Hadith it says that that Allah subhana ta'ala he the supplication of three people who are either traveling fasting oppressed here it indicates that all these three type of people the hearts are broken so Allah subhana tal comes closer to the servants when the hearts are broken and Allah subhana T helps them and gives them Mercy the fifth benefit is that when a person he repent sincerely it is one of the best forms of worship and the saying of one of the salaf that a person he may commit a sin and may repent and Allah forgive him and he can enter Paradise on the other hand a person who does good deeds and he may have conceit and because of that he may enter hell that mean the person may be proud that you know he has made no mistake no sin and that may take him to Hellfire the sixth benefit is as Allah says in the Quran in Surah fan chapter number 25 verse number 17 that all those who believe and they repent and they seek for forgiveness Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala turns to them and he forgives them and he changes their evil deed into good deed for Allah is of forgiving and most merciful and according to Abbas may Allah pleased with him the moment this verse of the Quran was revealed the Beloved prophet wasallam he was the most happy Abbas with him says that the most happy when Allah's messenger was after any verse of the Quran was revealed it was this verse of Surah fan 25:7 as well as of Surah fat chapter 48 verse number one where Allah says that we have given you manifest victory during fat makah and Allah says in Surah chapter number 40 verse number three that he's of forgiving and Allah accepts prance and is the one who forgives and it's mentioned in Surah chapter number 15 verse number 49 that Allah subhana tala is of forgiving and merciful"
