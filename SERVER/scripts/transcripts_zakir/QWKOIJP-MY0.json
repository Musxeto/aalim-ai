When we read history, we come to know that from the 8th to the 12th century, it was known as the dark ages. Dark ages for the Europeans, not for the world. The amount of advances in science and technology the Muslims did at that time, it was phenomenal. But because the European were not advanced, they call it the dark ages. But the amount of invention and advancement the Arabs and the Muslim did between the 8th to the 12th century is phenomenal. We know when we go to school, we learn in school that the blood circulation was first propounded by William Harvey by William Harvey. That's about a thousand years before or about 800 years before. But if you read history, we come to know that Nafi the Muslim scientist, he spoke about birth circulation 400 years before William Havi and 600 years after the Quran was revealed and he got the information from the Quran. Allah says in the Quran in surah Nahel chapter number 16 verse number 66. Verily in the cattle is a lesson for you. We give you to drink from what is within the body. Milk which is pure coming from between the contents of the intestine and excretor. Milk which is pure for you to drink. We know by science today that what we eat goes into the stomach. from the stomach via the bloodstream goes into the various organs of the body the nutrients including the mammorary glands which responsible for the production of milk. So this thing what science has come to know today is already mentioned in a nutshell in surah hell chapter 16 verse 66 400 years ago but in our text books science textbooks we learn about William Harvey but we don't learn about nafi the first human being he drew the who drew the map of the world it was aldrusi in 1100 184. And when the Muslim cgraphers drew the world map, they drew the world map with South Pole on top and north pole down. And alhamdulillah, the Caba was in the center. Later on, the western ctographers come and they turn the map upside down. North pole on top, South Pole down. But yet, alhamdulillah, the Cabba is in the center. We know that there are two types of numerals. Roman numerals and the Arabic numerals. Why is the Arabic numerous called Arabic? Because Roman, you know, it's in lines 1 2 3 lines. The Indians they discovered the zero. The Muslims they put a decimal point and they introduced a new system called as Arabic numerals. So what you read 1 2 3 4 now it's actually called as Arabic numerals introduced by the Muslims."
