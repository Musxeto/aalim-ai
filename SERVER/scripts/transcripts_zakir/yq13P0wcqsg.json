  "transcript": "the next question from hamad uttar pradesh india i was asked by a non-muslim that if music is considered haram in islam as it takes a person away from the remembrance of allah then even sex the recession intercourse should have been haram in islam applying the same reasoning because it also takes one away from the remembrance of allah please apply there is a very good question from muhammad that if music is haram because it takes a person away from islam then even sex sexual intercourse should be haram because it takes a person away from the remembrance of allah let me tell you music is around because the prophet has said musical instrument one of the additional reasons is that it takes a person away from the remembrance regarding sexual intercourse depending on whom you are doing sexual intercourse with then whether sexual intercourse is haram or not will apply if you are doing sexual intercourse outside the marital bonds if you're not doing with your wife but natural and now since slavery is abolished doing sexual intercourse outside the marital relationship it is haram so surely session intercourse is haram because when you're doing it with people who are not your wife or not between the spouses it is surely haram it will take you away from women but if you are doing sexual intercourse with your wife with your legal spouse then you will follow the guidance of allah in the quran and the hadith a beloved partner said that when you are doing intercourse you do do now when you're doing you're coming closer to allah you say bismillah in the name of allah then you read you say that i bear witness that there's no god but allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah then you're remembering allah while you're doing intercourse with your wife you're praying to allah that whatever you give keep it away from the shaitaan so when you are doing intercourse with your wife it is taking you towards the last man of allah in fact doing intercourse with your wife is also charity a prophet said if you do intercourse with your wife and don't do it with someone who is outside the military born even that is the father because they are following the commandments so doing intercourse with your wife is a father it is charity the following but if you are doing sexual intercourse away from your marital relationship with someone who's not your spouse it is haram and surely it will take you away from allah"
