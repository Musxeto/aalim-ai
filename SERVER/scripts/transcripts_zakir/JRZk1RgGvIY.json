  "transcript": "as far as tawa is concerned just to give an example tawa is like if you're walking in a very narrow Lane which has got a lot of thorns there are plants and creepers and trees with a lot of thorns and you walk in that Narrow Lane trying to prevent your clothes from getting stuck in the thorn and getting Tor so how well you do that that is an action of tawa linguistically tawa comes from the Arabic root word which means forbearance which means fear which means abstinence islamically it means fear of Allah islamically tawa is the state of the heart of a human being and the consciousness of Allah subhana wa tala the consciousness of his presence and of his knowledge which makes him do the righteous deeds and it prevents him from doing things which are Haram and makes him Pi that is the reason tawa if you translate one word people translate as God Consciousness or Allah's Consciousness it's translated as piety it's translated as righteousness in short"
