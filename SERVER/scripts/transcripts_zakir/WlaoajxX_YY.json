  "title": "Can a Muslim Believe in the Bible to be the Word of God as well? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "yes brother hello sir my question is uh are there any Muslim people who have believed that both uh the Quran and the Bible are the word of Allah and do you believe that it is possible to do so to believe in the Quran and also the Bible as uh word of Allah what's a good name brother my name is David Balmer Brother David asked very good question that does any Muslim believe that Bible and the Quran both are word of God and is it possible to bring a comparison and you know agree that Bible and the Quran the word of God As far as the word bible is concerned what the present book that we have there are some Muslims who believe that the Bible is the word of God but as far as the Quran is concerned as far as those Muslims who have knowledge of Quran and the ISL Islamic Sharia what the Quran says is that we believe in the injil theah the Revelation which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him a Muslim who has knowledge of the Islamic Sharia he knows for sure that injil that is the Revelation which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him we have to believe in that Revelation and Islam is the only non-Christian Faith which makes it an Article of Faith to believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him no muslim is a Muslim if he does not believe in Jesus Christ peace be upon him we believe that he was one of the mightiest messengers of God we believe that he was the Messiah translated Christ we believe that he was born miraculously without any male Intervention which many modern day Christians really do not believe we believe that he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe that he healed those born blind lepers with God's permission and the Quran mentions that in is the which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him now those who have studied the Bible they realize that the Bible is not the original Revelation which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him any person who's a scholar of the Bible whether he be a Christian whether he be a Hindu or whether he be a Muslim when we study the Bible we realize that this Bible that we have today the word bible come from the Greek word biblos which means the book or the book of books and as you may be aware the Bible is a compilation of books 66 according to one group of Christian Protestants and 73 according to the other group the Catholics other denomination so this Bible is coming from the Greek word biblos so what we Muslims who have knowledge of the Sharia we say that this Bible is not the original word of God this Bible if you study it does contain some part of the them may be remnants of the word of God some portion is the word of the Prophet Jesus peace be upon him some portion is of History some portion I'm sorry to say even contains pornography there are many mistakes and contradictions so we can't attribute these contradictions in the Bible to almighty God we cannot attribute the scientific errors in the Bible to almighty God so what we say that we agreed that inil the Revelation which was given to Jesus J Christ peace be upon Him is verily the word of God but the present Bible is a mixture so as a whole those people who have knowledge of the Quran and the Bible they will never accept the Bible as a whole to be the word of God but yes the original Revelation given to Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is the word of God coming to your second part of the question that can there be conciliation can there be some commonalities I've given the talk on similarities between Islam and Christianity since we agree that the original Revelation which was given to Jesus Christ peace be upon him was the word of God so we are trying to pick up Those portions which match with the last and final Revelation if there's something like the Old Testament New Testament the Glorious Quran is the last Testament of almighty God and this if you apply the other test to it whether it be the test of science the Quran passes the test you cannot find a single contradiction in the Quran you cannot find any mistakes in the Quran so if you put it to test the same test whether to Hindu scriptures or the Quran or the Bible we find out that the Quran passes the test but unfortunately the Bible fails the test I had a debate in USA Quran and the Bible in the light of science along with a person by the name of Dr William Campbell he wrote a book saying there are 30 scientific errors in the Quran and for many years no muslim replied to it so I've gone to Chicago we had a dialogue we had a debate and alhamdulillah by God's grace by God's mercy I replied to all his allegations but when I pointed out 38 scientific errors in the Bible he could not reply to them coming to your second part can we find a Reconciliation I said yes we can what I have done I have picked up Those portions of the Bible which matched the Quran and we Muslims have got no objection and accepting this portion of the Bible as the word of God because Quran in Arabic it is also called as the fan fan means the criteria to judge right from wrong so if we have a scale we can easily identify whether it's right or wrong so when we use the scale and whatever conciliates with the Quran we Muslims as a whole don't have any problem in accepting that portion of the Bible to be the word of God so in the Bible if you analyze there are various similarities time will not permit me to talk about all of them but as I was talking earlier that we Muslims we believe that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him is one of the mightiest messengers of God we believe he was born miraculously without M intervention we believe he gave life to the Dead with God's permission we believe he healed those born blind and Le with God's permission so the Muslim and the Christians we are going together but there are parting of ways there are many Christians who say that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he claimed Divinity he said that he was almighty God in fact if you read the Bible there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible with Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or he say worship me I would like to repeat there is not a single unequivocal statement not a single unambiguous statement in the complete Bible where Jesus Christ peace be upon him himself says that I am God or Hees worship me in fact if you read the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon himself said it's mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number 5 verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as I hear I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says I seek not my will but the will of almighty God he's a Muslim so Jesus Christ peace be upon him he submitted will to almighty God and in Arabic such a person is called as a Muslim Jesus Christ peace be upon him he never claimed Divinity it's clearly mentioned in the book of Acts chapter number two verse number 22 he men of Israel listen to this Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles which God did by him and you witness to it a man approved of God amongst You by wonders and miracles and signs which God did by him and you witnessed it so he was a man but a man sent by almighty God as a messenger to the human beings and if we analyze that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he never claimed Divinity he was one of the mightiest messengers of almighty God so here we say that if we study the Bible there are various similarities for example the Bible mentions that there is a messenger to come whose name shall be Muhammad peace be upon him in several places in the Old Testament as New Testament if you read the Old Testament in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 18 it is mentioned m going to come it's mentioned book of Deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 19 in the book of Isaiah chapter number 29 verse number 12 in the Song of Solomon Chapter number 5 verse number 16 he's mentioned my name he's even mentioned the New Testament in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 in the Gospel of John chapter number 15 verse number 26 in the Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 in The Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 12- 14 that the last and final Prophet to come Prophet muhammmad peace be upon Him is mentioned in the bible so there are similarities if you read the Bible even the main aspects of Salah how we Muslims pray that we prostay is mentioned in several places in the Bible in the Book of Genesis in the Book of Joshua in the gospel of Matthew various places that all the prophets of God they prostrated to Almighty God when they offered Salah so if we see the Muslims the way we offer Salah the major part is even mentioned in the Bible about the other aspects of Islam about ablution is mentioned in the bible we do woo before offering Salah it's mentioned in the bible it's mentioned about zakat is there in Islam is even there somewhat similar in Christianity that give fervent charity for that will wash away your sins even the Bible mentions in the Psalms chapter 84 verse number 4-6 it mentioned that blessed are those people who travel to the valley of baka talking about Makkah further if you analyze that there are various things prohibited in Islam in the Quran which is prohibited in the Bible as the Quran says in no less than four different places in Sur ma chapter number 5 vers number three in Bak chapter number 2 vers 173 in chapter number 6 verse 145 and chapter number 16 verse number 115 it's mentioned Pro for you for food dead meat blood the Flesh of swine and any food on which any name besides Allah Almighty God's name is taken now all these things are even prohibited in the Bible if you read the Bible in the Book of Genesis in the Book of Leviticus in the book of Deuteronomy blood is prohibited it's mentioned in the Bible that even poke is prohibited in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number 8 in the book of Isaiah chapter number 65 vers number 225 having dead meat is prohibited in the Bible in the book of Acts chapter 15 verse number 29 about having any food on which any name besides Almighty God's name is taken even that is prohibited in the Bible in the book of Acts chapter number 15 verse number 29 many things prohibited in the Quran is even Pro in the Bible so as far as the similarities are concerned regarding modesty the way a Muslim are supposed to dress up she should cover her head her complete body except her face and hands can be seen she should be loose clothes she should not wear close that of the opposite sex these are the rules of the Sharia given in the Quran and theth similarly if you read in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 22 verse number five it says that a man shall not wear clothes that which perate to a woman neither shall a woman wear man's clothes all that that do so it is an Abomination for them that means wearing clothes of the opposite sex is prohab in the Bible if you read the first Timothy chapter number 2 verse number 9 it says that the woman should be dressed up with modesty with shamefacedness with sobriety should not have costly array or wear gold or pears and it's mentioned in the First Corinthians chapter number 11 verse number 5 to7 that the woman that prays to almighty God and does not cover a head she dishonors a head and a head should be shaved off means her head should be shaved off there's no words in the Quran or the Hadith which is so strict in modesty there's no verse in the Quran or the says of the Prophet that a woman does not cover her head should be shaved off but that's mentioned in the bible so as far as modesty that is the reason if you see the photograph of mother Mary Allah be pleased with her the way she's dressed up is like how a Muslim woman is dressed up complete body covered except the face and the hands up to the wrist if you see the nuns so if we analyze there are several similarities between the Bible and the Quran so in my talk similarities between Islam and Christianity I say that if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him then we Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves well all this is mentioned in the Bible Bible says don't have alcohol in the book of Ephesians chapter number five verse number 18 in the Book of Proverbs Chapter number 20 verse number one they don't have alcohol Muslims don't have but most of the Christians have Jesus chist was circumcised on the E day according to the gospels the Muslims are circumcised most of the Christian are not so if Christian means a person who follows the teachings of Jesus Christ peace be upon him i' would like to say that the Muslims are more Christian than the Christian themselves so as far as this first part of your question that the complete Bible cannot be considered the word of God your second part yes there are many similarities and we do consider that the part of the Bible is the word of God we have to try and find out which part it is based on the Glorious Quran and then inshallah the Muslim and the Christians we can be one hope that answer the question"
