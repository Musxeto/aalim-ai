  "title": "Do women have a right to divorce in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "good evening sir my name is Simi my question is why are the other ladies not allowed to divorce their husbands in Islam has a question that why aren't the ladies allowed to divorce the husband as far as divorce is concerned sister broadly you can categorize divorce into five categories one is by Mutual consent of the husband and wife both first cat again second category unilaterally by the will of the husband third category that if it is mentioned in the nikanama when a woman is marrying a man if she mentioned the contact by default The Authority is given to the man in the Quran why I'll come to it later on but in the nikarnama since marriage is a marital contract a woman can put down any clause in marriage which is not private in the Quran she can even say that I do not want my husband to take a second wife because marrying more than one wife is not compulsed in Islam if the boy agrees he married otherwise they don't marry she finds a new boy and he finds a new girl but she can put the clothes that I do not want you to take a second wife as long as I'm alive but you cannot put the clause which is against the Quran you can put a clause saying I don't want you to offer prayer because offering Salah is compulsory you can put a clause which is optional similarly she can put a clause that I too want to give unilateral divorce it's called asthma third category fourth category is if she does not mention in the clause but yet he wants divorce she can request the husband I don't want to stay with you she can request the husband to give divorce that's called as Kola and the fifth category if the husband does not agree and if the husband will treats her she can go to the qazi she can go to the judge and she can take that means nullification of the marriage if the husband will treat sir does not give her a rights she can go to the judge and she can nullify the marriage so even a woman can take divorce but under normal circumstances the man has been given the authority why because in marriage the person who's the loser is the man not the woman the woman gains if you heard my talk last week on last Saturday in the talk women's rights in Islam subjugated or protected I mentioned that during marriage the woman is on the receiving side the Quran says in Surah chapter 4 verse number four that give to the woman in marriage a marital gift Maher in marriage it is the husband who gives to the would-be wife an amount of Mahal and matter can be any amount so imagine before she's married it is the duty of the man duty of the father and the brother after she's married it's the duty of the husband and the son to look after a lodging boarding clothing or financial aspects and if divorce takes place it is the duty of the parents to look after her if not the parents it's the duty of the society to look after her if not the society it's the duty of the Islamic State to look after so she's financially secured if divorce takes place the man gives the divorce he loses the man but the woman she's on the receiving end now she has a chance to get married once you get married she gets new man and the man when he has to marry another woman he has to give new man if the full Authority is given to the woman the woman keeps on marrying and divorcing then she will keep on gaining money who's the loser the man almighty God even protects the man's status other I have to give a talk on man's rights in Islam because if a divorce takes place man is more of a loser than a woman financially and otherwise woman gets production from the family from the society from the state man doesn't so because of that Allah almighty God has secured the man but yet if the woman wants she can mention the marital contract she too can give divorce or she can request divorce from the husband called as Kula or if that man he'll treat she can go to a judge and she can nullify the marriage which is called as nikai first hope that answers the question [Applause]"
