  "title": "Was the Quran Revealed Only to Guide the Muslims or the Arabs? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I'm Dr Puja Arora I am from sign hospital I'm a physiotherapist so I totally agree with you just a small question when Muhammad prophet attained his prophethood and he as you said he was a common man before he attained prophethood by that time is it that Quran which is the word of God has enlightened only Muslims because God can't be partial so what was the rest of the world doing when Muhammad prophet was in lighting a small sect of people and is it that such a long time is being taken for the rest of the sector of society to just get enlightened to this word of God and how many years would the non-hin Muslims like Hindus would I totally agree with you it has to be a concept Hindus are believing Idols pictures but or Ram bhagwan Whatever by but it is a concept and they have to be enlightened about it that it is one Hinduism also follows An Almighty which is a power a divine power but unfortunately it has been given in various forms so this Enlightenment if Quran helps a Hindu to know this Enlightenment it is fabulous sister asked a very good question and a very important question she said that if Quran is such a great book if it's the word of almighty God then why when it came to Prophet Muhammad it was only meant for that small group you know Arabs of that time only Muslim might not for the full world how long will it take sister the Quran was never revealed only for the Muslims or for the Arabs the Quran was revealed for the whole of humanity it's mentioned in Surah Ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number one into Abraham chapter number 14 verse number 52 in Surah chapter number two verse number 185 answer is number 41 that the Quran was sent for the whole of humanity peace be upon him he was not sent only for the Muslims or the Arabs the Quran says chapter number 21 verse 107. that we have sent thee not but as a mercy to all the human beings as a mercy to all the worlds as the mercy to all the creatures the message is repeated but most of the human beings yet do not know now this verse of the Quran says most of the human beings they do not know that's the reason sister we are having such conferences it's the duty of every Muslim that should convey the word of almighty God to all the human beings one more thing sir can I take time but better late than never sister better late than never and everyone who claims to be a Muslim may not be a practicing Muslim he may have a name Abdullah Sultan but he may not be a practicing Muslim similarly as you rightly said in Hinduism you don't follow your scriptures but yet the religion which is the maximum followed not only by lip service but in practice today it is Islam number one in numbers Christianity it is close to 2 billion Muslims claiming is 1.3 billion but the people practicing the religion number one is Islam percentage-wise it is the largest so these lectures are mainly those small percentage of Muslims who are not following Islam correctly to get them closer to Islam and to those non-muslims we want to give the message of peace the message of love and prove to the world that there is only one God the ultimate peace can only come if you submit a will to almighty God that's the only way to an ultimate peace in this world and thereafter so that is the reason sister we are having such conferences we have a satellite channel peace TV where every day more than 60 million people they are watching it so at least on the day of judgment we can give Sharda to Allah we did our best whatever we could we at least gave the message every day at 3 to 60 million people and today the message has even reached you sister so tomorrow on the day of judgment I can tell to almighty God I gave the message to the sister whether you accept or not is in your ancestor"
