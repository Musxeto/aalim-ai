  "transcript": "I would like to share with you a classical example in 1920 the US government passed a law Banning the consumption of alcohol law enforcement was put into action the security agencies all of them they strove to try to ban the consumption of alcohol but all of this proved futile bootlegging became rampant billions of dollars were spent in order to pass this law and in order to implement it but no less than 1 million people they were thrown in jail thousands others they died bootlegging had become rampant which led to fatal diseases and which even led to death 14 years later the US government had no option but to live the ban on the consumption of alcohol and I would like to remind you we are talking of the most powerful Nation at that time now let's go back in time 1,400 years ago Allah subhana tala says in Sur MAA chapter number 5 verse number 190 oh you who believe most certainly intoxicants and gambling dedication of stones divination of arrows are an abomination of Satan's handiwork abstain from such Abomination that you may Prosper the moment the sahabah they heard this verse of the Glorious Quran the moment the prophet PE be upon him told the sahabah that alcohol has been prohibited vessels full of alcohol were overturned never to be filled again many people who are serving it they stopped serving it many who were drinking it they spat it out some even went to the extent of inducing vomit immediate obedience by the sahaba many of them they used to have a lot of alcohol but moment the wor of the Glorious Quran was revealed prohibiting alcohol they immediately stopped having alcohol this is the impact that the Glorious Quran has on human lives the prophet peace be upon him he had no police force he had no law enforcement he had no security just one commandment of Allah subhah wa ta'ala was sufficient for people to stop having alcohol this is the impact that the Glorious Quran has on human lives"
