  "title": "Muslims are Lagging behind in terms of Technology; How can They Address this Issue? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "you talked about something very fundamental you know that affects us you know you talked about the role of media in all of this conflict and perhaps what media can also do in terms of champion the course of the the oppressed you know the people that are being killed and so on and so forth but Islam as a religion is facing huge challenge H huge deficit in terms of technological advancement uh to some would say this is also another setback uh you know uh technology uh daming world uh the Muslim um is somewhat left behind why do you think uh this is happening and how can how can this be addressed you know as we move forward you said that Islam is facing a problem of the technology I would like to correct you you should say Muslim not Islam that's Islam is on top the problem is Muslims Muslim they cannot harm Islam Islam is cannot be harmed Muslims can not Islam the Muslim Muslim the problem with the Muslim again you know previously if you see from the 8th to the 10th Century the Europeans called it the Dark Ages if you read History of Science in the scientific world eight to the 10th Century the Europeans called it the Dark Ages that's right but they failed to real that the Muslims were so much Advanced that time the amount of advances we made in in science and technology in medicine in chemistry if you know father of chemistry he's a Muslim ja you have many examplea and I've given the talk on I don't to give that so Muslims on top of the world for that time from the 8th to the 10th Century if you wanted to know science toar Arabic as language it was international language that time the best language that time the Muslims were close to Quran and Sunnah therefore we were on top of the world today we have gone away from Quran and Sunnah therefore we at the bottom of the world not that Muslim not powerful in media Where I Come from Bombay Bollywood produces the maximum number of movies in the world that's right more than Hollywood also do you know one third of Bollywood is controlled by the Muslims the producers are Muslim the best actor Muslims shauk Khan Salman Khan Amir Khan all the Muslims they may not be practicing but they control high quality you go to the Arab world all top channels what you don't get English movies being Rel released in America you get in the Middle East channels so those channels are spending money on top of the world but when it comes to Islamic channels we are mkin MK means very poor we are hardly on one or two satellites yeah we on 2 MB we launched the P TV exactly why I ask you that question we launched P TV6 yes normally the satellite channel what is the MB what is the bandwidth if ask what is the bandwidth of this channel how many MB two three our bandwidth one one satellite is 10 MB we have got four satellite channels P tv English peace TV Udu peace TV banga peace TV Chinese peace tv English alone is on 15 satellites having a viewership of 100 million that's potential viewers 2 billion potential viewer mean it's coming into the house they may watch they may not watch may watch may not watch actual viewers is 100 million P TV Udu was launched in 2009 English 2006 now it is about 17 years old P STV English right or yes 17 years then Udu was launched in 2009 having a viewers of 80 million then we launch P TV Bangla in 2011 having a viewership of 50 million and 2015 we launch PTV with Chinese having a VI of 20 million but the quality what we did we analyzed the channels which are Haram entertainment but we took the technology which is halal but the product content is Haram so we take the technology which is halal and we use it for that and that's the reason the viewership increased but our is not a news channel yeah they are different genes so we don't talk about politics as is more of a edutainment channel edutainment channel we call it Islamic entertainment Channel it doesn't have news like your channel but the quality of us we were the first people in the world right when we launched our peace TV 2005 we used the best broadcast cameras dig beta that's right then we upgrade to now in 2015 we said no we will not use the best camera for broadcast we will use best camera in the world so started using shooting on 4K and 8K which are film cameras we were the first channel in the world no entertainment Channel why right we had a reason that our shuk when our Scholars come and give a talk and when they die this product will be invaluable so we shot on 4K and 8K the best of technology so how can you say the full Muslim yes I do agree with you majority majority are far away okay that's exactly where I'm you know looking at partnership forging partnership you know uh with other like Minds you know other partners around the world beyond the immediate environment talking about India and and and and you know uh neighboring countries perhaps coming down to Africa where there's this deficit in terms of technology and technological knowhow especially within the media industry how much of Partnerships of course last time when I came in 2013 I bought my own cameras I flew about 40 people from India they came with me and they shot m 10 years back here because now the Indian government is against me I did hij from India to Malaysia and they have taken custody of all my cameras I hir from here and do you know the one I bought 10 years back is multiple times better than the Camas I had from here that camera didn't then I went to fx9 they don't have so then I bought my cameras from Malaysia three cameras and the Ballance I bought from Legos technology is way behind 10 years back what I owned is not available anywhere in the country today in the whole of life Nigeria what I'm telling you can buy it but they think if I buy the expensive camera there's no business they fail to realize you do business with Allah if you shoot the high quality what we do we shoot it 4K and 8K and then downgrade it to hdv tast in HD because 4K telecast is not that popular so we shoot on the 4K and 8K with the best of cameras and we downgrade it there is no channel in the world so on the Sony website it came the first TV channel which has 14 4K and 8K cameras is pach TV it came on the website in 2015"
