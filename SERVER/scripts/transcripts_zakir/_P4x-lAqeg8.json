  "transcript": "the next question assalamu alaikum my name is sahar i'm a student at university and live in pakistan why allah subhanahu ta'ala did not directly send the glorious quran so that people can follow it why did allah subhana tala send the torah before the quran in this way we will get confused why should we follow the torah then the bible and now the quran if there is only one holy book the quran all should follow it and there will be no conflicts allah subhana tala says in the glorious quran in surah chapter number 13 verses 38 for each period we have sent a book by name four revelations are mentioned the glorious quran the torah the zaboor the injeel and the quran the torah was the wahid the revelation that was given to moses peace be upon him the zaboor was the wahida revelation that was given to david peace be upon him the injeel was the wahidah revelation that was given to jesus christ peace be upon him and the quran is the last and final revelation that was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him so by name four revelations are mentioned the glorious quran but there were several other revelations for example ibrahim the scrolls of prophet ibrahim but all the revelations before the glorious quran they were only meant for those people and for that time they were time bound but the glorious quran it is not meant only for the muslims or only for the arabs but the glorious quran it is meant for the whole of humanity and allah the book is revealed to thee in order to lead mankind from the depths of darkness and to light allah subhana tala says ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number 52 yar is a message let them take warning turn off and let them know that there's one god let men of understanding take heed allah subhanahu tala says in surah chapter number 2 verse number 185 quran is the month in which the glorious quran was revealed as a guidance for mankind so the glorious quran it is a guidance for the whole of humanity so the glorious quran it is meant for the whole of humanity now why did allah subhanahu ta'ala reveal the glorious quran directly the previous revelations that were revealed they were meant for those people and for that time but allah subhanahu ta'ala did not reveal the glorious quran directly perhaps because the people they would not be able to grasp the message and i would like to give you a simple example when we study in school we study gradually and step by step for example nursery junior kg senior kg first standard second standard third fourth fifth until tenth grade then we have college then we have graduation post graduation etc so it is a gradual and step-by-step procedure you cannot directly study in 10th grade you have to study first grade second grade third grade the student cannot tell the teacher the teacher why do we have to study 10 years why don't i directly study in 10th grade it is a gradual and step-by-step procedure similarly because the people they would not be able to grasp the message so first previous revelations were revealed based on the understanding and capability of the people later on the message kept on getting more difficult based on the grasping power of the people allah reveal the glory's quran previously the people they were not so advanced so that's the reason allah subhana wa tala he did not reveal the glorious quran directly he revealed previous revelations which were meant for those people and allah did not preserve these revelations because he did not think it fit to preserve them they were only meant for those people allah says in surah chapter 15 verse number 9 and it is we who have revealed the glorious quran and it is we who will guard it from corruption so the glory is quran it is guarded from corruption and allah has said that he will guard the glorious quran from corruption"
