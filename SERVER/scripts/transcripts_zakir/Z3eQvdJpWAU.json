  "title": "How Can We Avoid Photography, Despite the Need for it, to Save Ourselves from the Hellfire?",
  "transcript": "it says about uh snaps like the most heavily punished people will be photograph makers so in this um where currently where we when every state it's not uh you know possible to avoid photographs completely because you require photographs for everything so how can how do we act on these hadees as well as the Sharia complaint that's the question that Hadith inside bukhari that the people will be punished maximum are the photograph makers and today in this world we cannot avoid photography therefore how do we reconcile the Hadith whether the nothing that you cannot avoid photography but the interpretation of translation is wrong what the Hadith says the person who makes the tasved software is to be understood at the time of the Prophet photography was in there so the difference the opinion between the scholars whether the prohibition is on photography or other thing there's one group of scholar for example who say that photography and videography both ahram he was a great scholar of the last century of Hadith he says that still photography and videography according to his understanding the first of Sheikh binbas he says there's still photography Haram and videography is permitted his father is that as long as it doesn't go outside the fold of Islam within the poor with Islamic Sharia still photography and videography both a lot and all these three great Scholars the great Scholars that ask the person who knows so these are great Scholars of Hadith but photography is a science and what they say that sin the prophet said tasveer is there and today in Arabic for photography also the word this video is used but at the time of the Prophet photography was in there Haram see the language keeps on developing so we have to first try and identify what was popular in Islam that's more important rather than the word what it meant that time so send that time photography wasn't there you cannot say for sure that the word we photograph though today in Arabic the word photograph so many of the words for example utilize at one particular time it keeps on changing by the passage of time those Scholars who say that photograph is permitted what they say that what the prophet prohibited is the hand painting I am not talking about those Scholars who have gone way away from Quran Hadith they say that sculpture is allowed and everything I'm talking about the authentic Scholars the difference of opinion among the authentic Scholars what they say that what the prophet prohibit what is done by hand makes a painting Allah will ask him on the day of judgment that put life into it but natural they can't so making a picture a painting of these living creatures like animals and human beings prohibited what happens in photography is photography is nothing but a reflection which is preserved on paper he never prevented the Sabbath to look in reflection the water while coming there is not prohibited in photography the reflection is preserved so Scholars say that photography per se is not Haram but if you use photography for wrong things like ideal worship using photography for obscenity using photography making a big blow up of person like Amita Bachchan girls are putting in a drawing room that leads to idler worship so photography person is not Haram but using photograph for wrong purposes Haram so there are Scholars like Sheikh binbas who say they're still photography with Haram and videograph is prohibited now since we're in the field of media I'm aware that videography the shooting is nothing but still photography moving at a speed of 25 frames per second or 24 frames per second so when you move a still photograph at the speed of 24 25 frames per second it becomes motion so to say that still is Haram and moving is permitted if someone can say that moving is private and still is permitted it makes sense someone say that beer is permitted and whiskey is prohibited but if someone says whiskey is permitted because whiskey has got more content of alcohol as compared to beer whiskey becomes privated so with this logic what I say to permit one thing which is lesser as compared to the thing which is much more higher so still photography and videography videography is a higher version Advanced version of still photography so therefore what I say that these are great Scholars but because of the knowledge of science they may not have referred to a person who's a scientist I believe more with the fatwa of who said there's still photography person is not Haram and he says that on certain occasions which is permitted in Islam it's allowed otherwise normally making blocks in Haram or keeping big blow-up size photograph of great personalities that leads to the question"
