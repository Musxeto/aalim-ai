  "transcript": "let's analyze the various types of greetings that we have in the society and the most common of all the greetings in English we say good morning in africanas people sayab in Chinese cha in most of the languages it's a very common greeting good morning and suppose it's a rainy day it's raining cats and dogs and if someone wishes you good morning what is so good about that morning it's raining cats and dogs the city is flooded and yet you say good morning what is so good about that morning and when we go to school and if you're studying in English school every period in the beginning of the day in the morning when when the teacher enters all the students wish the teacher good morning sir it's compulsory and maybe the teacher before he left his house maybe he had a fight with his wife early in the morning he may be cursing that morning in his heart he may be praying that never should such a morning ever come in his life but in spite of this when the students wish good morning sir he has to reply good morning even though from the depth of his heart he may never wish that such a morning should come again yet he replies by good morning what is so good about that morning in which a person has a fight with the spouse the best form of greeting is the Islam greeting Assam alayum may peace be on you irrespective whether it's a rainy day whether it's raining cats and dogs whether you had a fight with your spouse or with your friend yet the greeting Asam alayum may peace beond you is the most appropriate we have another form of greeting especially among the young people who go to schools and colleges when they wish their friend they say hi and if a young friend wishes to his friend across the street High the friend will reply hi and when you ask him what is the meaning of hi no one will be able to reply what is the meaning of high no one will be able to reply in Hindi there are the local language out here high is a form of disgust you know high in English with h i g h High means something which is on a height and another meaning of high is a slang word for a person who's intoxicated and people say I went to the party and I got high I got drunk I got intoxicated is it a courteous greeting in fact I say it is not a greeting at all leave aside it being a Curt is greeting high is not a greeting at all the other common greeting which most of us use is hello and if we look up in the Oxford dictionary the meaning of hello it says an informal greeting and the other meaning given in the Oxford dictionary is that to begin a telephonic conversation to begin a talk to start a talk on the telephone do you know how did this idea come about that to start a telephone conversation you should say hello the person who invented the telephone was Sir Alexander Graham Bell and once when he was leaving his house in a harur the bell rang and to initiate an early response he said hello so that he can greet the person and the person responds fast and he again go out of the house soon this word hello to start a telephone conversation has stuck since that time and even today everyone uses it you use it and even I use it hello to start a telephone conversation but nowadays especially in Bombay thanks to the mtnl that the word hello is used more often in between a conversation because when the sound goes low hello can you hear me hello the Oxford dictionary says hello is used to start a telephone conversation but in Bombay it's used more in between the talk than in the beginning of the talk and since the time the mobile has been invented and when the area of reception is not very clear you have to use the word hello even in between the telephone conversation so maybe in the revised edition of Oxford dictionary they may change the meaning hello can also be used in between a telephone conversation"
