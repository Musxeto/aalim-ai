  "transcript": "the Quran talks about Salah in English people normally translate Salah as prayer prayer if you open the dictionary means to beseech to ask for help according to me prayer is not the appropriate translation of the Arabic word Salah what we do Dua after the Salah that is prayer the Salah is far superior to praying in the Salah besides asking for help we are getting Guided by Allah subhana waala the Arabic word Salah comes from the root word Salah means connection the servant connects with Allah subhana tala so Salam means connecting to God I call it the programming towards righteousness when we pray we read Surah FAA after that Imam is telling us he's giving us guidance don't lie don't cheat five times a day we are being programmed towards righteousness Allah says in the Quran in Surah anab 29:45 recite of what we have revealed to thee of the Quran and establish Salah for Salah restrains you from shameful and unjust deed that means Salah keeps you on the straight path it prevents you from shameful and unjust deed it prevents you from sin so if you offer Salah correctly you will be on the straight path because Salah because the Quran teaches us about Salah the Quran is a global necessity the Quran speaks about zakat it is the third pillar of Islam that every Rich Muslim who has a saving of more than the nisab level more than 85 grams of gold he or she should give 2.5% of that excess wealth every lunar year in charity if every Rich human being in the world gives Z gives this 2.5% charity poverty will be eradicated from this world there will not be a single human being will die of hunger and there are several suras of the Quran multiple times establish Salah and give your Zak multiple times in the Quran Bak Iman the Quran talks about the fourth pillar of Islam s that every Elder Muslim who has has the health and not traveling it's compulsory that he fasts in the month of Ramadan he abstains from drinking or eating food and sex from dawn to sunset in the complete month of Ramadan I call Ramadan as the over hoing of the human body like when you have a car or motorcycle you required to service it maybe every 6 months every year similar Sly if you call this human being a machine it requires servicing at least once a year for one month if you can abstain from smoking from dawn to Sunset you can very well abstain from smoking from the kle to the Grave if you can abstain from drinking alcohol from dawn to Sunset very well you can abstain from having alcohol from the kill to the Grave Raman is a month which encourages you to come closer to tala it encourages you to good deeds and it encourages you to stop the evil deed Allah says in Surah Bak CH 2 vers 183 that fasting was prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people before you so that you may learn self-restraint so that you may learn tawa so that you may learn God Consciousness so that you may learn py so the main reason our creat Allah subhah wa ta'ala has prescribed us to fast for one month in the month of of Ramadan is so that we attain tawa righteousness God Consciousness piety the Glorious Quran speaks about the fifth pillar that is Hajj it is compulsory for every adult Muslim who has health and has the economic means that at least once in his lifetime he should perform Hajj the pilgrimage and travel to the city of Makkah the state of Makkah Mina arafa back to Mina and Makkah in the six days from 8th to the 13th of Z there's a full Surah by the name Surah Hajj chapter 22 in the Quran and this Hajj is the biggest annual gathering in the world where more than 4 million people gather from different parts of the world from USA from Canada from UK from Pakistan from India from Saudi Arabia from Nigeria from Ghana from from different parts of the world and the men they dressed in two pieces of unsown cloth you cannot identify the person next to you whether is a king or a poer all equal in the sight of Allah Allah Allah here I am oh my Lord At Your Service it is the best example of universal Brotherhood in the world the black or white yellow or brown two pieces of unstone cloth all equal in the sight of Allah because the Glorious Quran teaches us about Salah about s about zakat about Haj I say alquran is a global necessity the Quran gives us the criteria for a person to go to jenah to attain salvation"
