  "transcript": "the next question from ansari from india my hindu friend considers both islam and hinduism to be true legions will he go to paradise the question posed by the brother was that my hindu friend considers islam and hinduism both to be true religions will you go to paradise allah subhanahu ta'ala is very clear-cut he clearly gives the message in surah imran chapter number 3 verse number 19 in nadine islam the only religion acceptable in the sight of allah is islam is submitting to allah allah says in the quran in surah imran chapter 3 verse number 85 that if anyone desires any other religion besides islam it will never be accepted of him and he will be amongst the losers in the akhirah so as far as religion allah subhanahu ta'ala sent only one religion for humankind during the passage of time when he sent a revelation he sent a messenger the revelation got corrupted people disobeyed the messenger allah sent a new revelation allah sent a new messenger again people deviated allah sent a new messenger there were 124 000 messengers sent on the face of the earth allah says in the quran in surah chapter 13 verse number 38 in every age has essent a revelation there are many revelations by name four are mentioned in the quran torah and the quran torah is the revelation that was given to moses peace be upon him zaboor is the revelation given to david peace be upon him angel is the wahi the revelation given to prophet jesus peace be upon him and quran is the last and final revelation given to prophet muhammad peace be upon him what we realize that religion is only one even though the scriptures have changed there are remnants of taheed and about coming up for muslim what i do i talk about the similarity between islam and hinduism islam and christianity when i talk about similarity doesn't mean that hinduism is totally right i am telling that if you believe the vedas to be the word of god i believe the quran to be the word of god let us agree to follow what is common so when we do a comparative study based on the verse of the quran of surah ibrahim chapter 3 verse number 64 he says which is the first term allah that worship none but allah here we come to know that all the religions the scriptures evidently talk about the oneness of allah monotheism talks about the coming of whom so i tell them that if you believe that the word of god why don't you believe in one god why don't you worship him alone why do you make idols of that god why don't you believe in the last and final messenger so telling you partly believe in some teachings of hinduism because it matches with islam no problem at all but you say i completely believe in hinduism i can give a longer lecture on differences between hinduism and islam but that's not my purpose so anyone who says i believe both in hinduism and islam completely it can't be possible he believes that allah is almighty god and he believes in the false teaching of christianity that jesus is god even if you believe allah is god and with it believe jesus christ peace be upon him with almighty god it is shirk you have to worship allah and allah alone the moment you worship with allah someone else like jesus christ or say with allah i believe ram is god i believe krishna is god it a shirk so you have to believe in allah alone and no one else and worship him alone and no one else so if someone says i believe in hinduism and islam can i go to general the answer is no you have to believe in islam only and believe those parts of hinduism which match with the quran and say hadith no problem but which is against quran and say hadith you cannot follow if you follow that you cannot go to paradise hope that answers the question"
