  "title": "Is a Pilot while Flying a Plane Exempted from Fasting? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "next question is from one of our viewers who's a pilot and he considers himself to be in a perpetual state of travel every day he's traveling on the plane um long distances and um he's asking is he exempted therefore from all fasts if a person's profession is such that he's a pilot or if he's a sailor and he has to travel and if he leaves his hometown and if he's gone away so but naturally he's considered the traveler he's exempt from fasting but he has to make up his fast before the next of ramadan so if he travels a lot then he'll have to fast the holidays whatever holidays he gets and when he's stationed in home term so if he does not want to fast he's exempted he was considered as a traveler but he'll have to make up the fast as soon as possible before the next ramadan unless you start on a very long flight maybe from india to new york which is more than 12 hours but if the flight is a short flight i don't think so there'll be problems"
