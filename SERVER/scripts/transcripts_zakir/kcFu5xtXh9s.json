  "title": "The Quran says  Allah has Set a Seal on their Minds & Hearts, is there any Scientific Proof ...?",
  "transcript": "foreign we have put a seal on the hearts of those and the various explanations given for this and if you hear Micah said on Quran science which I give a talk in the digital answer is given and my explanation is that Kalb is an Arabic word which has got various meanings one of the meanings of Kalb is heart that is organic heart one of the meanings of kalp is the center Center of understanding the center meaning it is a brain you could call so Allah has put a seal so here we have to choose sometime one meaning of Arabic is correct sometime all are correct you have to choose read recite in the name of the Lord who created who created human me from something which clings Allah means something which clings a leash like substance and a concealed lot of blood today science says all three are correct but sometimes only one is correct so here if you want to take the various meanings one of the meaning is heart organic heart one is the center so Allah is put on the center that most of the translations no translation says I haven't come across the translation but if you translate it it can mean the mark also and there's one more verse in Surah chapter 22 that it is not the eyes which are blind it is blind so now here it says that the heart in the chest is blind that's a counter argument these people these kafir it is not the eyes which are blind it is the heart in the southern now one of the meaning of Southern is a chest and the other meaning of Southern is the center it's a center which is there in the center it can be taken the other meaning this is one of the explanation one of the explanation which can be a literal way of explaining a thing literal by Laura the second way of explaining this is that if we Analyze That a language develops and many things are used in the language which are not literal so literally if you take if you want to analyze this one of the answers that I've given you that one of the meaning of Kalb is Center that Allah has sealed the thinking power the other way if you Analyze That many words are used in every language but the way it's developed literal meaning may be something else for example the meaning of disaster means what is the meaning of disaster a Calamity something bad that has happened but disaster literally means an evil star this Aster means and Evista today we know that is English language disaster we use these words and furthermore we say that today the timing of sunset is whatever it is 7 14 7 15 timing of Sunrise is six zero two we use it or not in a language does the sun rise does the sun rise no many of us are doing science we learned in school that the sun is there the Earth is there the Earth keeps on rotating and revolving around the sun the sun is revolving in the solar system but the sun is not rising and setting but yet even though we know scientifically the sun does not rise yet we use these terminologies you know a scientist I mean we say that you know we tell the people we love our mother or a wife that we love you from the bottom of the heart even the scientist tells his wife I love you from the bottom of the heart imagine the wife telling that the center of life is in the brain you being assigned how come you love me from the bottom of that you should love me from the bottom of the brain anyway that's wrong because the love sentence on the bottom of the brain so but yet as a scientist as a doctor if I will tell my mother I love you I love you with my heart in the heart the love centers in the brain but that's the way language are developed you know we say that memorizes by heart the center of memory is in the heart where is it in the brain but yet in English language you say that memorize that I have learned it by heart you should be have learned it by brain so these are languages I've developed but yet we don't say what language are you speaking you're a scientist you love your mother you love your wife from the heart you should love from the brain so these are languages have developed similarly one is a little meaning I've been the explanation secondary memory in English books you'll find in literally books in scientific books it is mentioned though science says that the memory is in the brain The Love is in the brain yet we say by heart this is a language that develops similarly when we can say that we memorize the heart I don't object to the scientists when the scientists I love you from my heart you're an object similarly this language is the language for the human beings how even Arabs speak when we speak in English we have no problem when the Arab speak why do we have a problem so an Arab will not take out this mistake and Arab realizes when Allah says has proceed on his heart what he means is understanding the question"
