  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum my name is adam i work at the mufti department so my question is what does the quran or islam says about killing for mercy i'll give you an example for example someone is in a very deep or long coma so can we know and the person's life number two what if we have like a sick cat who is really really sick and we pity the cat repeated so can we end the cat's life i'm just asking a question i'm not going to do it the brother is talking about ethanol the english word what is it it's not killing for mercy the right word is tunisia that means if a person is sick and if the doctors say that there is no chance that he can improve and he's like a vegetable he can continue living by putting on a parent life-saving apparatus so is it permitted in islam that you can end the life of such a patient and then it will come to the animal but first we'll talk about the human means then we'll come to the animals as far as eutronization is concerned there are two types of euthanasia one is active and one is passive in active euthanasia if the pers if the patient is suffering from certain diseases which the doctors say cannot be cured and he'll be like a vegetable in active euthanasia you inject a drug and then you put the patient to death in pacific tunisia if the patient is on life-saving apparatus and if we remove that apparatus and if he dies that's called as passive euthanasia as far as activity is concerned injecting a drug to kill a human being that was prohibited in islam it's haram it's not permitted because we cannot take life of any human being it's allah subhanahu ta'ala who cares and gives life as far as passive withdrawal is concerned where a patient is on life-saving up apparatus like fibrillators or ventilators and the doctors say that they no chance he can improve he's like a vegetable and those machines are very expensive every day called cause you may be paying thousands of ringgit in this case if the person cannot afford and the doctor says there's no chance of improvement for you to remove those apparatus because you cannot afford it that is permissible killing actively is prohibited but passive with tunisia where you remove the life-saving apparatus because the doctors have said there's no chance of a survival so passive withdrawals has to be done can be done if you feel they don't have the money you cannot continue with those bills and it's no longer going to survive so when you do passive with another the patient may die after a few hours but after few days may be possible you may not die also doctors what they say is always not correct and passive is that because you have tested for many weeks and months and doctors have given up hope you can remove the parities if you can't afford it that is permitted hope that answers the question in the cat cater same thing same thing if you can afford for the cat you know nowadays people spend more on the cat than than the human beings yes thank you"
