  "title": "Dr Zakir Naik Agrees to Debate with Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my first question would be i i'd like to relate it to you so i've seen your previous speeches before on youtube you are specialists in comparative religion so when you like uh compare islam and other religions like hinduism like quoting scriptures from bhagavad-gita or something like don't you think there is a possibility to misinterpret it and provide misguidance to those who doesn't belong to that faith what's your name brother your name and if if there are it is proven that there is a misinterpretation in your speech does that mean that you failed to carry out your duty as a muslim professional the brother asked a very good question a very relevant question to the topic i'd like to thank him his question is that i am a specialist of comparative religion i prefer calling myself a student of comparative religion and when i quote scriptures of others other religion like whether it be the bhagavad-gita weather veda weather bible and if i misinterpret that scripture then isn't it wrong as a muslim totally wrong i agree with you that's the reason after every lecture of mine we have question answer session most of the religious speaker whether it be hindu whether it be christian whether it be muslim most of the majority more than 90 percent after the speech they have no question answer session was the first one who started and now masha'allah many of us after every question after every lecture we have a question answer session why so that if you disagree with us you are open to ask the question in the question answer time if any speaker including myself if the questioner proves that my interpretation is wrong i if i if they prove to me first i will say i am sorry i will take it back if i make a mistake as a muslim compulsory i would apologize i would first say i'm sorry i misunderstood your scripture inshallah in future i will not quote it never in my life of 25 years of dawah more than has a single question a masha'allah i can't make mistakes i'm a human being i'm not perfect no human is perfect not a single question ever quoted me anything and proved me wrong alhamdulillah i can't be wrong i can't be wrong therefore we say ask the question if he poses a question to me i will counter quote him and give him the quotation from his scholars i will quote what does swami vikrant say i will quote so it is intellectual that's the reason what we say let's come for a debate friendly debate no problem but i'll only debate with someone who has some standing not with every tom dick and harry you understand you know if i can get a million people for my talk largest gathering even if we get two percent twenty thousand i will debate you any time take an area i cannot what my reason is if you want to debate me you should at least be able to gather minimum twenty thousand for your speech if i can get two million you at least get two percent okay if you can get twenty thousand for your lecture i'm willing to debate with you if you cannot get you give it to someone who can get and there are many hindu speakers in the world there are many christian speakers in the world who get hundred thousand and more in india many people you know shishi ravi shankar he gets audiences of hundred thousand i debated with him and you know the outcome of have you seen that debate what was the outcome it was what it wasn't as i expected sorry it wasn't as i expected yeah oh you it wasn't as you expected but did i break any rules of the debate did i break any rules of the debate no did i not answer all these questions did he answer my questions no one of the most famous hindu preacher in the world shri shri ravi many people call him god but but sir how about satguru i guess he destroyed some of your points i guess satguru from a dialogue i will debate him you arrange i will debate him sadhguru is a famous person ask him i will debate him there are some people who have taken speeches and given answers some people not himself if he wants let him arrange no problem i will debate him okay because i know he's famous any famous personality if he wants to debate i don't want to rebuild him he wants to debate me open any topic any topic on comparative religion hinduism islam no problem okay i am welcome and if he points out anything in in my speech which i said which is out of context or which is not as for the hindu scripture i'll apologize i will give him from where i got all my research and not from non-hindu scholars from hindu scholars i give the reference so most of the speakers say yes zakir is right but then the butt comes when hindus say when you hear your speech in two hours i've learned what i have not learned in 40 years of my life was in my speech i give references did shishi ravi shankar give any reference in his speech even one reference he gave did he give a single reference brother in my speech how many references were there so who's more authentic a person who gives the reference the person doesn't give a reference he could have kept a chit there's no objection in a debate you can have notes in front of you right or wrong i don't have notes he can have notes ask if she sees the vishnu will have a second debate with me will he have even if you give him a million dollar he will not have i guess he will but if he doesn't debate you i'm sure one day i will most welcome the day you can get 20 000 people for your audience i will debate you now what you can do question answer did i answer your question or not yeah you did thank you very satisfactory i'm very happy thank you for accepting it and may allah guide you and i'll pray for you that you come to the truth brother thank you very much"
