  "title": "Why do the Christians not believe in the old Testament, as the Jews do? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "I need a clarification I mean I'm not sure about it the Jews believe in the Old Testament is it and the Christians don't follow the Old Testament what is the logic behind this and can you explain I mean why they don't consider Old Testament important and it's the New Testament that they take into consideration well the Jews take on to the Old Testament take on the Old Testament the Christians they're supposed to follow the Old Testament why do they only stick on the New Testament whether just as outline the Bible determine two parts the Old Testament new testament old testament these with the lifestyle of the prophets that came before Jesus Christ peace be upon Him New Testament it starts the life of Jesus peace be upon him and about his Apostles you know so there are two divisions now the Jews are supposed to follow the Torah the Psalms everything that's there that's the complete Old Testament so Jews are sticking to that now theoretically they have to follow both if they don't follow both the whole Christianity will fall apart why because whatever is in the New Testament it is based on the Old Testament the prophecy of Jesus has peace be upon him they claim that he's got it so whatever they claim so they claim is only supported by the prophet of the Old Testament which we disclaim we say this process is about the prophet coming not about a god coming based on the Old Testament in the New Testament without the Old Testament the New Testament on its own doesn't have any value so many of the Christians don't know about this so theoretically without the Old Testament for Jesus says in the gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number seven into twenty think not that I have come to destroy the law and the prophets I have come not to disturb you to fulfill till 11 and the Earth pass away not one jot or title can pass away from the law and will all be fulfilled and whosoever shall break one of the least Commandments shall be called this in the kingdom of heaven and whosoever shall keep the Commandments and treat the same Shall be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven unless your righteousness actually is the righteous of the sky than the Pharisees in no way shall you enter the kingdom of heaven so according to Jesus Christ unless you are not more pure than the Jews unless you don't follow all the laws and command of the Jews you cannot go to paradise so if you take out the laws of the Jews how can you go to paradise the New Testament is built on the Old Testament so theoretically they have to follow if they don't follow they cannot be put Christian they cannot enter Paradise so they have sorry no they have to say theoretical but practically when we argue with them and prove to them that from the Old Testament you come to know about the prophet no we don't follow the Old Testament these people who don't have much knowledge but a knowledgeable person cannot say that because if they don't for the Old Testament the New Testament itself carries no weight because if the New Testament says that you have to follow what is in the law of the Muslim to the gospel of Matthew Gospel of John Gospel of all these gospels what Jesus said that it has been said of the old times thou shall not commit adulthy but I say them to you so what has been heard the whole time something Jesus Christ has made his own statements but as a whole he said that you have to follow each and every law of the Old Testament if you break one judge a little you shall not enter Jannah so if you don't have that law how can you follow so theoretically and practically they have to follow but they don't do it so theoretically they may give importance but practically when you argue with them those who have less knowledge then they say okay we only follow New Testament so we can even prove about the neutral statement we can prove Jesus was not crucified peace from the New Testament so if a valorous is comparative religion even without the Old Testament you cannot convince them what is now from the New Testament if you're available but actually practically they have to follow both answers the question"
