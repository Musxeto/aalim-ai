  "transcript": "Dr zaka regarding elderly people which category of elderly people are exempt from fasting Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 184 that if it is difficult for a person to fast he can either fast or he can give a ransom that is feeding of a poor person as far as those elderly people who are Exempted are those people whose health is so weak that if they fast it will damage the health a person who's reached a very elderly age the age is not fixed whether it is 16 70 or 80 or 90 depending upon his health condition due to the old age if his health condition is bad which prevents him from fasting then is the time where he should feed one Indigent person and there's a Hadith of our beloved Prophet wasallam say bukari volume number six Hadith number 4505 where beloved Prophet said that the old elderly men and women they need not fast but they have to feed one poor person for every fast they skip and similarly there are various Hadi for example if you read Dak two stroke 208 it says that if a person who has to give a ransom he has to feed a poor person one mud of wheat one MTH is is equal to two hands outstretched full of wheat that's what you should feed there's another Hadith which says in D two stroke 270 that anas pleased with him one year when he became very old and he could not fast so at the end of the month he called 30 poor people and he fed them with bread crumbs and meal uh proper meal for 30 poor people so it means that that for every fast you miss you should feed one poor person but coming back to the question that if the elderly person is a sound mind and not healthy that's the time he has to feed a person or give instance but if a person is elderly and he becomes insane if he's not a sound mind then he doesn't have to fast he's Exempted neither does he have to give any Ransom neither he has to compens it because he's like a child as our beloved Prophet said earlier which I mentioned that the pen has been lifted on three categories of people person who's a child reaches puberty so these people again become like children or they become like a person who's insane we say that the person has become senile if he reaches an age in which his mental stability is not there he need not fast neither does they have to compensate the fast later on neither they have to pay any rents"
