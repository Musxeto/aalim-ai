  "title": "Is it Discouraged to Talk while Eating? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "question nine once we invited a guest for iftar he said it is discouraged to talk whilst eating in the religion of islam is he correct i don't know of any hadith of the prophet muslim where he said that you should not speak while eating etc in fact allah says in the quran in surah chapter 4 verse 59 that if the difference go back to allah and the soul there's no text in the quran which says they should not speak while eating there's no text in the hadith with the prophet command it should not speak by anything in fact there are hadith exactly the opposite the prophet spoke while eating for example if you read the hadith of say muslim volume number 3 hadith number 5093 where the prophet was served vinegar and he said that vinegar is a good food while eating the other hadees in which the prophet said that do not eat with your left hand for the satan eats with the left hand again this is while eating either hadith of say bihari volume number seven hadith number five three seven six where the beloved person was allah said was a boy was eating with the prophet and he was moving his hand around so the prophet said eat with the right hand and eat from what is close to you for this he said why anything so all these hadith prove that there is no restriction for speaking while eating whenever the difference go back to our line of the rasool and we get the answer"
