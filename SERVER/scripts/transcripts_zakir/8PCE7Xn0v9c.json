  "transcript": "there is a question from question on the YouTube from sadullah mul I've been struck with a difficulty and it is not going away and it has been two years what should I do so that Allah will listen to my prayers duas please help brother samah Mel has asked a question that there is a great difficulty that has struck him since two years he's spraying to Allah the difficulty is not going what should he do difficulty can be of various reasons whenever difficulty comes to any individual it can either be a punishment for the things you have done wrong or it can be a test whenever there's a difficulty it maybe you have done something wrong maybe you have done some sin and Allah is punishing you or maybe you're on the right part Allah is checking you Allah is analyzing you that even with the difficulty do you have faith or not and Allah is testing you it's a test for you so if any difficulty comes number one is you should isar imagine a beloved prophet wasallam and there are various Hadith in one Hadith it says that the prophet didar 70 times the prophet didar 100 times a day imagine the best exemplary human being on the face of the Earth the best Prophet on the face of the earth is Prophet MMI wasallam there is no better human being that has lived on the face of the Earth other than the last and final messenger Prophet wasallam when he who's the best human being is doing to Allah subhana wa taala and when the sahab asked that Prophet you asking for forgiveness he said how can I be so ungrateful to Allah that he has given me so manyama so much of good things I cannot be ungrateful I have to doar so if the prophet isfar who are you and me you know we cannot compare ourselves to the prophet he is millions and multiple millions of times better than us so number one should be SAR that if it is due to certain wrong Deeds that you have done or certain mistakes you have done you ask Allah for forgiveness and if you're due to the sincere heart Allah will forgive you number two you start contemplating start analyzing that how is your lifestyle is your lifestyle based on the Quran and sayith is your lifestyle according to what the prophet has mentioned what Allah wants you to do you start analyzing that is your income Halal what you're earning is it out of what Allah has told you is it honest or is it of RBA is it something Haram so you start analyzing all the things you do number one you're earning number two how do you lead a lifestyle how do you spend is it on the Halal way is it following the Quran is it against you start analyzing and P wondering all your lifestyle you may find that when you analyze and scrutinize many things you're doing is not as for the Quan and Sunnah you may be taking loan to buy a house you may have taken a loan on interest to buy a car and you may think it's normal interest is the 12th major sin Accord imabi and a prophet said there are 70 levels of interest and the lowest is doing Zena with your mother imagine so many times people lead a lifestyle and think I'm following Quran Sunnah you know I'm doing as per I'm a very good Muslim I'm practice but when you scrutinize you come to know you are doing many major sins so number one you first analyze that are there any major sin or are there any great major sin then you are there any major sin and are there any moderate sin are there any minor sins and you see to it that if you're doing certain things which are Haram you stop it first stop you doing many Haram things stop the great major sins then the major sins then the moderate sins then the minor sins and every sin of course has a degree the scholars have classified into major and minor some say great major sin and if you analyze and you stop inshallah Allah subhana give bar in your earnings Bara in your life and if you analyze and then you start doing more see to it that you don't miss any of see to it that your is very strong you're praying the five time Salah and then when you pray five time Salah see to it that you pray the besides the the in the last one third of night and you told me that you have been praying for two years and your prayer is not answered my question to you is did you pray during tud and when you pray during see to pray towards the last one-third of your night in suud and Scholars say that you cannot say you have left every stone unturned until you pray in tud in the last one third night in suud and tud praying in tud is like an arrow that never misses its Mark so you have been praying but you didn't tell me when you pray there are certain times when prayer are more accepted of course number one it is when you're doing Hajj and araa you know the day on the 9th Z during Ara people are doing Haj that the E day when you pray between ass and M that's the best your prayer will be then because you don't know which is the main night you pray the full 10 nights but Ina Ina you know it you know these few hours are there and if you're doing Haj and you're inaa that's the best then would be even that's equal to a thousand months it is equal to more than 80 years that's also phenomenal but to be sure that you'll get that the prophet said pray all the last 10 nights if not then the odd nights and the Hadith then you have weekly the best day in the week is the Friday one hour after ass the Beloved Prophet said Allah says one hour after ass on Friday on your jum Allah answers the prayers of his servants so when is maybe a few times in your lifetime that is during Hajj one the best time in the year is the the best time in the week it is Juma and the best time in 124 hours it is during tud every day you can do then of course the duas of for travelers accepted Etc and the various you can keep on talking so see to it that your your Salah is is there your Dua is there see that you're giving zakat seeing that you're fasting in the month of Ramadan properly or doing the additional fast and all these things you can keep on talking for us together you are doing a far then you're doing the must the fasting of the must is also there whether it's the day of ARA if you're not doing Haj Fara is the best your two years sins are forgiven the previous year and the next year then of course fasting all first nine days is the best of then is the ashur and the list is long see to it that your pillars are strong so after you analyzed that you're not doing any Haram see to it that you're doing your far see to it you're doing more of the must if you're not going go for H do for omra and all the things and then the more you analyze the more you realize you come closer to Allah subhana tala and not only your major problem even your minor problem will go or Allah subhana help out and as I told you that if there is any Calamity it can be you have done something wrong it can also be a test if you analyzed that okay if you're doing wrong and you're trying to see to it that you stop doing the harams or stop doing the Mak far you have to do start doing the must and then yet it's there think it's a test from Allah subhana tala then you pray to Allah subhana tala as the Ayah the last verse of Surah Bak that lay Allah does not lay on anyone a burden greater than he can bear so it's a test from Allah subhana wa tala and we pray to Allah subhana not to lay on us a burden greater than we can bear so the test are of various types and Allah does not lay on anyone a burden greater than he can beay so Allah wants to test you that maybe Allah wants to put you in Jenna Allah wants to put in F on a higher level so more difficult the test the more great the reward and the most difficult test for all the human beings are the amas all the amias they have undergone a more difficult test than any other nonia human beings of course the level of theas we consider them equal but Allah subhana tala is own that mall and the other so that the reason the Amia because the test was more difficult than us they will get a higher place in the jna than us then you have the then you have the sahabas so we should see to it that we emulate our beloved Prophet wasallam the theas and see to it we come closer to them so Allah accept our effort and I pray to Allah subhana tala may he solve your problem and see to that he removes all the wrong that you're doing in your life and may instill all the far all the musts and grow at Allah subhana tala"
