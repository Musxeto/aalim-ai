  "transcript": "what prophet muhammad peace be upon him is even mentioned in the new testament it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 16 jesus christ peace be upon him says that i will pray to my father i'll pray to almighty god to send you a comforter it's further mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 15 verse number 26 and when i pray to my father and when he sends you a comforter he will abide with you forever it's further mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number seven nevertheless i tell you the truth it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter shall not come for if i depart shall i send him jesus christ peace be upon him says that nevertheless it is expedient for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter shall not come what if i depart shall i send him now this comforter if we analyze in the original script in the language aramaic it is paraclete which means the praiseworthy which is the translation of the name muhammad sallam but they have converted it into parakletos which one of its meanings is a comforter irrespective of whether it's paraklete or parakletos alhamdulillah both these meanings befit the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him but many christians say that this prophecy about the comforter to come refers to the holy spirit now if we analyze the prophecy clearly mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number seven nevertheless i tell you the truth it is experience for you that i go away for if i go not away the comforter shall not come the criteria for the comforter to come is that jesus christ peace be upon him should go if he goes the comforter shall come only after he departs will he send him so the major criteria for the comfort would come is after jesus christ peace be upon him departs from the bible we know that the holy spirit was already there before jesus christ peace be upon him he was there in the womb of elizabeth he was there when jesus christ peace be upon us born he was there in the feast of pentecost so surely this prophecy cannot refer to the holy spirit it refers to no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him it's further mentioned the gospel of john chapter number 16 verse number 12 to 14 jesus christ peace be upon him says i have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that year shall he speak he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me this prophecy again refers to no one but the last and final messenger prophet muhammad it says i have many things to say unto you jesus christ peace be upon him saying i have many things to say unto you but ye cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of fruit shall come he shall guide you onto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that here shall he say he shall guide you to the truth he shall show you things to come he shall glorify me and this prophecy does not refer to anyone but the last and final messenger prophet muhammad i have given a separate talk only on the prophecy of sallam in the bible which you can speak for us together only on this topic"
