  "title": "The Prophet that Lies will Die. Is Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) Alive? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "this is a question by a christian sister you explained deuteronomy 18 18 and 1819 and said that it refers to prophet muhammad sallam but she says that in the verse 1820 it says that how to know about the prophet whether he tells the truth or he is lying and the almighty says if the prophet lies then he shall die so the question of the christian sister is is prophet sallallahu alaihi salla malay because jesus islam and enoch were raised by almighty can you show us throw some light on this brother the question the deuteronomy chapter number 18 verse number 20 says that if the prophet lied he will die if he lies when he lies he will die it does not mean he will not die forever it does not mean that if he lies if he lies he will die on the spot that does not mean that if he dies after 10 years or 50 years 100 years it means that if a person lies on this body will die and that's what the quran also says quran said that if the prophet would have lied we would have caught him by his jugular vein and his heart and will slaughter him that's what the quran says allah says to muhammad that if prophet would have lied he would have caught him by the vein of his neck and would have slaughtered him that's the quran says it's a harsh word that means this is not a lie from allah that does not mean muhammad will not die even jesus christ peace be upon him in his second coming he will die when he comes i don't know when 100 years later 200 years later thousand years later when he comes he'll die doesn't mean he's allah no every human being when he comes has to die every prophet has to die quran says in surah imran chapter 3 verse 185 of sin every soul shall have a taste of death so everyone has to die even jesus christ peace be upon him will die in the second coming so that does not mean that a person will never die if he lies on the spot he will die hope to answer the question but the earlier two verses clearly indicate that this prophecy refers to no one but prophet muhammad peace be upon him because he was like moses peace be upon him and words opened his mouth hope to answer the question [Applause]"
