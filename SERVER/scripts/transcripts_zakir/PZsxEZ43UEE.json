  "title": "The Quran Gives the Formula to Attain Jannah and Solves the Problems of Humanity - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the Quran gives us the criteria for a person to go to jenah to attain salvation Allah says inah chapter number 103 verse 1 to3 that by the token of time man is really in a state of floss except those who have faith those who do righteous deeds those who exalt people to truth and those who exalt people to patience and perseverance these minimum four criteria are required for any human being to go to Jenna number one is Iman having faith number two righteous Deeds number three inviting people to Tru doing da and and number four inviting people to patience and perseverance if any one of these criteria is missing under normal circumstances you shall not go to jenah all four criteria are equally important IM righteous Deeds dawa and inviting people to patience and perseverance so Quran gives the formula to attain Jenna to go to paradise because Quran gives you the formula to go to Jenna to attain Paradise I say alquran is a global necessity our beloved prophet mm sah Al wasallam said it's mentioned in say Muslim volume number 7 Hadith number 7417 the prophet said this world is a prison for the Believers and it is Paradise for the unbelievers there's the incident that once haani may Allah have mercy on him he was a great scholar he wrote the of bukari the second most important book after the Quran when he was going in the marketplace with his entr who the chief khi a poor Jew he comes and he catches the mule ofal and he tells him I heard that your Prophet said this world is a prison for the Believers and it is Paradise for the unbelievers you you are so rich you are leading a luxurious life I'm a poor man he was wearing tone clothes how can you explain the Hadith of your Prophet that this world is a prison for believer like you are so rich and living comfortably and it's a paradise for a poor person unbeliever like me who's poor with tone clothes asani says that I know what's going going to happen in the future and I know that in in the next life for the Believers we will get paradise and if you compare the Jenna to this world What I'm Living compared to the Jenna it is billion times better this world with all the wealth is the present and I know the unbelievers like you who do not believe in Allah in the next life they will go to jam and the Janam will be so bad that even if you are the poorest man in the world if you compare to Janam your this life will be like paradise compared to Janam so this is the explanation of the Hadith of the Prophet M wasallam of Muslim Volume 7 Hadith number 7417 that you may be the richest man in the world you may have the maximum luxury but compared to the luxury of a in jna it will be a billion times better so if you compare the difference between the poorest man who goes to Jenna and the richest man in the world going to Jenna the difference is very less so this world you should not be bothered whether you're poor or Rich whether you're a king or a poer you should be bothered that you pass the test and the prophet said it is more easier for the poor man to go to Jenna than a rich man because the rich man has to give kab he has to give accountability of everything more difficult so comparatively it is billion times better than the richest man in the world and compared to the poor man also it is a billion times hardly any difference and the jam is so worse the description given in the Quran and the Hadith even if you are the poorest man in this world it will be like paradise the fire when comes on your feet your brains will boil can you believe so this is the explanation and this Quran it prevents you to going to Janam and encourages to go to Jenna that's the reason I call the Glorious Quran a global necessity the Glorious Quran has the solutions to the problems of humankind because the Glorious Quran has the solution to all the problems of humankind I say alquran is a global necessity alquran is thean Allah refers to the Quran as fan the criteria to judge right from wrong Al Quran has the solution to the problem of racism one of the biggest problems in the world today is racism Allah gives the solution inat chapter number 49 verse number 13 Allah says oh humankind we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into Nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other not that you shall despise each other and the most honored in the sight of Allah subhana wa ta'ala is the person who has tawa who has God Consciousness who has pety who has righteousness the criteria for judgment in the sight of Allah subhana wa tala in the Glorious Quran it's not wealth it's not age it's not sex it's not color it is tawa it is righteousness it is piety it's God Consciousness according to the Quran no black man is superior to a white man or a white man Superior to a black man no rich man is superior to a poor man or a poor man for a rich man no male is super to a female or a female to a male unless with one criteria tawa righteousness God Consciousness TAA this one verse of the Quran will solve all the problem of racism in the world if the humanity follows this our beloved Prophet Muhammad sallallah Ali wasallam in the fav pilgrimage in VI he said that no Arab is superior to a non-arab or no non-arab is superior to an Arab a white man is not Superior to a black man neither a black man is superior to a white man except by tawa and we demonstrate this every day five times of our life every day in Salah when we stand for Salah We Stand shoulder Tosh shoulder feed to feed whether king or POA black or white yellow or brown rich or poor when we stand for Salah in front of Allah We Stand Together it will abolish all kinds of racism in the world Quran because it has the solution for racism I say Al Quran is a global necessity everyone in the world should know about the Quran and follow it then only will there be peace"
