  "title": "How to Commit Something to Long Term Memory - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "first is Allah's help second is struggling and striving and third is technique there are various techniques for memory which you get when you do MBA courses which is called as mapping and all the others and believe me all these techniques have good limitations the best is help of Allah certain things are there that when you memorize something after about 20 minutes again rehearse it again rehearse it after 2 hours again after a few hours the more you rehearse it and revise it the more chance it will be part of you then next day the more you use it the more it becomes part of memory and once it goes into a permanent memory then even if you don't revise it will be in your memory for example Sur FAA almost all the Muslims all the Muslims know Sur faat even you get up from a sleep and they ask you to recite you can recite because that has gone in the permanent memory so the more you revise the more you practice it becomes part of memory I don't consider my say that I have got photogenic memory what I do is I strive I have to keep on revising I know that if this lecture has about 150 quotations from Quran and Hadith if I don't revise maybe I may say 90% if I revise I may be able to say 99% so before every lecture I try and revise as much as possible so that it is closer to the accuracy so more you strive the more you struggle the more you have faith in Allah subhana tala inshallah you'll be more successful"
