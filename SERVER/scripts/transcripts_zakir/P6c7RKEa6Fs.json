  "title": "What is Meant by 'Free-Will' & 'no Compulsion in Religion'? - Dr Zzakir Naik",
  "transcript": "greetings to you in the mighty and matches name of god my name is paul and i'm a student i have a doubt i mean most people would also have i mean you've already spoken about free will and things like that i have doubts about free will as to what free will is and do we have free will to do what we want to do and as you quoted chapter 2 verse 256 from quran there is no compulsion in religion and the truth will stand out from falsehood right so i am looking for truth and the truth will set me free yeah that is john chapter 8 verse 32. correct you're right i mean i'm not as great as you in quoting things from but i just want to know as to whether we have free will and what free will is and when they say and the quotation that i said that there is no compulsional religion what is compulsion here i mean i don't know sure whether it i've taken it out of context and quoted it what is before it and what is after it because my friends couldn't explain to me what was there before it and after it probably i'll have to read it and when you say there is no compulsion made to do like say suppose you have to say prayers five times a day right do we is it compulsory the brother has two questions the first question what is a free will and as gospel of john chapter eight was trying to say that seek the truth and through shall free you jesus christ peace be upon him said that and he quote from the quran like prophet deen chapter two surah baqarah verse number 256 masha'allah is comparing you know great he says he seeks the truth and i pray to god that may that set you free as far as free evil is concerned free will means what you want you can do for example today i want to destroy the full world can i do it i can try but i will not succeed you understand free will means what is in your capacity whatever is in your capacity you can do whether you're able to do or not that is secondary for example in my capacity to give a lecture you can try like how you try it and you give a quotation whether you can give the full lecture i don't know but you have the free will to try so similarly you have the free will to rob you have the free will to become honest you have the free will to kill you have the free will to save a human life it's your favorite so free will means you can do what you want no one can force you fine no one can force you now coming to the question of la crafidien chapter 2 verse 256 there's no compulsion religion but truth stands out clear from error here means you cannot force anyone to accept islam at the point of the sword i cannot take a gun and put on his forehead and say except islam it's not allowed i cannot force anyone but when i give the logical reasons for example doctor says you have diabetes don't have sugar oh doctor is forcing me not to have sugar yes he's compelling me if i don't want to listen to a doctor i can go and get have chocolate so the doctor is advising you but an intelligent man will not have sugar will have less sugar but the doctor cannot force him brother no i think i'm looking down i'm wondering no i'm trying to concentrate more on you now than anything else fine so the thing is that if the doctor tells you something you can use the word the doctor compelled me not to have sugar but the right word is the doctor advised me and i'm following similarly like is it compulsory to pray five times for a muslim yes it's compulsory is it a compulsion it's not a compulsion with force if he doesn't want he doesn't pray he can say i don't believe in allah no one can force him because he agrees with the system ah if i pray five times i am getting guidance from allah subhanahu wa allah i am on the straight path therefore i am praying five times like how a doctor advises you don't have sugar he wants to follow he follows you have to fast it's advised by almighty god surah baqarah chapter 2 183 fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-restraint but will increase so i'm fasting no one can force me with a gun too fast is it compulsory fast yes for a muslim is there compulsion religion no one can force me i should fast with physical force so that's talking about physical force no one can physically force anyone to do anything it's your free will no but then uh why is it called why is it that we it is compulsory to fast compulsory there are two types of compulsory one compulsory is with reason and logic the other compulsory is with force what quran is talking about compulsion is force like when doctor says don't have sugar is it compulsory yes doctors say compulsory don't have sugar is the doctor forcing you literally yes with logic not with a gun right or wrong so the doctor is saying compulsory no sugar for you if you have faith in doctor you follow if you don't have faith you don't follow the same way this is advice given by almighty god in the quran if you believe almighty god is the creator you follow if you don't believe you don't follow so anyone who's a muslim is a person who submits his will to almighty god the free will god has given i can either go against the commandment of god or i can follow his commandment after god has given me free will if i follow his commandment i am called as a muslim a muslim is a person who submits his will to almighty god there is no physical force on me the compulsion that's spoken in surah baqarah chapter 2 verse 256 is the physical compulsion it is not the logical compulsion two plus two how much four is it compulsory four i mean that's that that is free will yeah it is your choice you can say three also correct you can say five also if i can say it is three then i can i have to prove it right no no even don't prove you can say three anyone can do anything to you i didn't get it sir you can say three or four without proving can anyone do anything to you if you say two plus two equal to three logically what can you do but then they'll say he doesn't know math so what's there but you can say or not can you say yes that is the feeling but people will [Music] so if you say two plus two is four it's not compulsory same way if you pray five times you are a muslim if you say don't five times i'm not a muslim simple so it is a compulsion with reason and logic so as you told two plus two equal to four is compulsory y for a person who knows maths for a person who doesn't know maths he may not say two plus two is four he made the two plus two is five two plus two is six so this is compulsion of reason logic and iman and belief so hope that answers the question no as in why do you have a new question no it's not a new question it's like uh did i answer your question or not yes sir okay you answer the question do you have a new question no problem you can ask okay what i'm saying is it says i mean now you're saying it has we have to do it five times now if i say i do it ten times but i'm not doing it at the prayer time say ah sir i'm not doing it at maghreb i'm not doing it at these certain times but i do it and i do it when i'm when i'm going to eat my food before the meal i i'll say my prayer when i'm sitting when i'm standing when i'm walking when i'm running fine correct so but now why why why is that word compulsory five times that i'm not no doctor say don't have sugar okay doctor i won't have sugar i won't have salt i won't have rice i will die don't that sugar okay i won't have sugar i won't have rice i won't have bread i won't have food i won't have non-veg i won't have veg my son will die so you can't go overboard doctor says don't have sugar okay at this time have medicine you can have sugar at so and so time have limited so this is because doctor knows now you try and become more intelligent than the creator than almighty god he knows better than you and me if you say no no i'll do like that then you will suffer so doctor knows the human body almighty creator knows us better so he's our creator he has given the advice if you follow you will be called as a muslim submitting evil to god if you don't follow there's no compulsion of force i cannot force you to accept some can i force you no you cannot because i have the free will correct with your free will some people like man so they accept it it's not necessary you also have to accept tomorrow if you agree you're a seeker of truth correct you're a secret through shall for you [Music] once you're convinced you're most welcome so i'm waiting for the days that are convinced hopefully inshallah [Music] you"
