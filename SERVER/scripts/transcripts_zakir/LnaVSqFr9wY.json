  "title": "Is it Acceptable for a Muslim Boy to Ask a Non-Muslim Girl to Convert to Islam before Marrying her?",
  "transcript": "this question is from a non-muslim sister she is present in the audience but for security reasons she will not like to come on the microphone i'll be reading a question if a non-muslim girl wants to marry a muslim boy and the muslim boy asks the girl to convert not by force but because he wishes her to accept the religion is it wrong meaning is it wrong on the power of the boy to ask to convert secondly if a non-muslim girl marries a muslim boy without converting but still follows islamic religion as it is supposed to be followed is it wrong on the part of the girl to follow the religion but without converting her name is khushboo she's a teacher by profession the question is anonymous night to ask a question that can a non-muslim girl if he wants to marry a muslim boy and the muslim boy request her to accept islam is it right and if a non-muslim girl follows islam without converting is it acceptable the quran says in surah chapter number 2 verse number 221 that do not marry unbelieving women until the belief do not marry a mushrika until they believe because it further says that it is preferable to marry a believing woman even if she's a bondwoman even if she may be a servant even if she may be ugly it is far superior to marry a believing woman who's a bond woman rather than an unbelieving woman even if she attracts you she may be the most beautiful woman she may be a beauty queen she may be the wealthiest woman but a believing woman is far superior so in terms of is it right for a muslim man to ask the non-muslim woman to convert before marrying it is not right it is a must without she accepting islam he cannot marry her why i'll tell you for example if i tell you that there is a car one tires of a cycle and the others of a tractor will the car run no all the tires should either be off a bicycle you'll have a hand cart at least or of a tractor you'll have a proper director because when you're leading a life the views and philosophies the major thing the goal of jannah should be same coming to a second question that if a woman follows the teachings of islam but does not convert is it acceptable see for conversion you don't have to publicly announce you don't have to come on the microphone and say i bear witness that there's no god but allah it's not a must if you feel your life is in danger if you say within your heart and tell it to almighty god you don't even require any witness it's between you and allah so there is no particular ceremony that is required but proclaiming is preferable so that the people in the world don't misunderstand you but if you feel your life is in danger if you proclaim to allah only and keep it in your heart and follow alhamdulillah following is more important than proclaiming it is preferable for the lady not to mention but yet follow islam than to mention she has converted and not follow islam have you heard man sir it is preferable for a non-muslim woman to practice islam without proclaiming rather than proclaim and not practice islam practicing is more important than proclaiming it's between her and allah so the moment she starts practicing islam it's understood when she offers allah she agrees there is one allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger the moment you say akama it is in the rakama you believe that there is no god but allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger finisher so if she starts practicing she doesn't have to proclaim also so if she wants to do this again practicing is more important than proclaiming but if you want to proclaim it is fine she can proclaim hope to answer the question"
