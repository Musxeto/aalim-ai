  "transcript": "assalam alikum wam my name is tanim Ahmed I'm from B India I am an electronics engineer sir I'm jobless while searching for a job when I mention in my resume that I am a fresher then companies do not short list my name when I mention fake experience in my resume then the company short list my resume and I get the job I want to ask you if I get a job through fake experience letter then is the money earned from it Halal or Haram the question posed by the brother is that he's Electronic Engineer and he's a fresher if he writes in his resume his biodata that he's a fresher he may not get the job but if he writes a fake thing he experience he may get a job so after he gets a job by writing a false statement or a fake certificate that is experience and if he earns money from that job is it haram or is it Halal right now you have to differentiate between both these both these are two different things I would like to pose a question to you suppose there's a person who can't find water what does he do he robs water and with that water he does voo because he wanted to pray he cannot find water so he robs water and he does vooo with that water and he prays will the prayer be accepted or not yes or no robbing is Haram so if he robs he'll get punishment for that but his Woo is complete because he did woo with that water he prayed the Salah also will be accepted so similarly here if you make a fake certificate you'll be held responsible for that forgery you'll get the punishment for making the fake certificate but after you get the job as long as you don't do anything Haram in that job as long as you're qualified engineer and the people happy with you they're paying your salary for the work you do so once you get that job and you work dedicatedly and intelligently and the company is Happy company pays the salary gives you an increment the salary is halal but that initial Act is Haram for that you'll be punished but after that what you did you didn't do anything Haram so the First Act that you did you made a fake certificate is Haram but after that what you earned is halal it's permitted so you have to ask forgiveness to Allah subhana tala for foring that certificate and if you want to go more ahead you can even tell your boss that when the boss start liking you you know boss I tell you one thing that you know now I'm working in the company for 5 years but I tell you one thing that a mistake and hope you forgive me what the mistake that that I forg the certificate if if you're a good employee now you already experienced for 5 years why will he take you out he may start liking you also but there's a risk he may remove you also so if you have done this thing you'll be punished you'll be responsible for one act of forgery but the other thing is halal if you ask Allah for forgiveness Allah will forgive you if you can't go and tell your boss if you really loves you and likes your work inshallah he will he will not mind it and maybe he will think okay now you're honest man you have come and told me maybe give you a promotion also insh"
