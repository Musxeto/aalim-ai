  "transcript": "so let's take the first question Ali from Bihar India but is living in Kyrgyzstan he asks is there any use of the knowledge that we acquire in this world in the akhara the knowledge can broadly be classified into two categories the first is the spiritual knowledge the knowledge of the D in this their is some part of it that is compulsory for you to gain for example how to offer Salah regarding fasting regarding giving zakkah so you need to know this knowledge regarding the ibadat regarding worshiping Allah the second category is the worldly knowledge the worldly knowledge can broadly be classified into three more categories the first is the knowledge that will take you away from Allah for example learning music this knowledge it is prohibited for you to learn because it will take you away from the Deen it will take you away from Allah the second category in the worldly knowledge it is the knowledge that neither takes you away from Allah nor get you closer to Allah and this it is it is optional if you gain it you will not get reward from Allah if you leave it you will not be sinful and the third category in the worldly knowledge it is the knowledge that gets you closer to Allah for example you learn science in order to do dawa to the non-muslims and to prove to them mentioning the scientific points that are mentioned in the Glorious Quran so if you learn science with this intention inshallah you will be rewarded so the spiritual knowledge it will help you in the akhara the worldly knowledge if it takes you away from Allah it will not help you if it gets you closer to Allah then inshallah this worldly knowledge it will help you in the akhara and you will be rewarded for it if the worldly knowledge if it does not take you closer to Allah no it takes you away from Allah this is optional"
