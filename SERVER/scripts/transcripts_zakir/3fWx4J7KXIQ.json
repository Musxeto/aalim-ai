  "title": "Why Allah Punishes People in the Grave as this Person may get Acquitted on the Day of Judgement?",
  "transcript": "the first question on the whatsapp is from riyadh from bangladesh and he's asking the question why allah punishes people in the grave as there is a possibility that this person may get acquitted on the day of judgement similarly a person who is not punished in the grave may be found to be guilty on the day of judgment the question posed by riaz is that why does allah punish the person in the grave maybe on the day of judgment will be acquitted so won't it be injustice and maybe you will not punish a person in the grave and he may be held responsible on the day of judgment so isn't this wrong allah says in the glorious quran in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 that kullu nafsenzai katha moth every soul shall have a taste of death and your final recompense will be on the day of judgment and anyone who is saved from the fire and is admitted into jannah into the garden has achieved the purpose of this life for this life is goods and charters of deception here allah subhanahu ta'ala in surah al-imran chapter number 3 verse number 185 is telling us that the final recompense will be on the day of judgment that means the final hisab kitab the final tally of the reward and punishment will be on the day of judgment that means if you have to get a reward you may get part in this dunya in this world part in the grave part in the hereafter or if you have to get some punishment you may get part in this world part in the grave part in thereafter but the year after is the final recompense the final tally of all these three put together would be what you deserve as a reward or as a punishment the question asked by riyaz that what if you are punished in the grave and on the day of judgment you are acquitted so won't it be injustice or if you're not given a punishment in the grave when you have responsibility of judgement won't it be wrong what brother ryan is asking a question may be correct for a normal judge or if you and me are a judge where you are human beings he fails to realize that allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is in my game do you think allah doesn't know what is the reward every human being deserves and what is a punishment every human being deserves for you and i who are normal human beings we may not be aware if you and i are a judge then we will not know until we hear the lawyers and we know what's happened but allah he is the master of the day of judgement he has in my gap he has knowledge of the future he knows exactly what will a person deserve as a reward and what will a person deserve as a punishment and a beloved prophet muslim said that for an unbeliever whatever good deeds he does his reward will be in this dunya he will not get any reward in the akhirah in the life after death as for the punishment it may be part here part in the grave part in the hereafter as for the believers both the reward and the punishment can be part in this world pardon the grave part in the hereafter so allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has allah knows that this person will get 50 points of punishment so he may give 10 point in this world 20 points in the grave and maybe 20 points in the akhirah it cannot be possible that the person receives 10 points punishment and allah will give 20 points punishment in the grave it's impossible allah he has knowledge of the future he cannot do such a thing you and i the human being can do that so this question is logical for a human being but not for allah because he knows exactly what is the total punishment every human being will deserve what is the total reward that he deserves and all these three put together is the total punishment he deserves and that's the reason it's mentioned in the quran that on the day of judgment no one will object to the justice of allah neither the muslims neither the non-muslims even the kafir even the unbelievers even the non-muslims who would be put in the hell they will never say that they have got injustice they will only ask allah that why don't you give us one more chance and allah will say it is too late this was in brief the answer to the question"
