conference on M and I'll be speaking on the topic of the virtues of alaka Allah subhana tala says in the Quran in Surah Al is chapter number 17 verse number one exalted is he who has taken his servant on a journey at night from mid Haram to Masid AA whose surroundings we have blessed to show him our signs he's seeing and he's hearing Allah says that he has taken muhm Sall Ali wasallam from M Haram in Makkah to Mid AA in Jerusalem where the prophet he led the prayers where all the prophets were present and from there the prophet ascended to the heaven that is Al is and al- Mir we all know that ala is the third holiest mosque in the world after M and M but the difference between M and the other holy mosques that beside the mosque being holy the land where M the AA is a sham itself is blessed and Allah says in the Quran inia chapter number 21 verse number 71 that the land we have blessed for all the world for all the nations and Allah say this in the Quran in several places that this land is blessed Allah says in the Quran in chter number 7 verse 137 Allah said in is CH number 17 verse number one Allah says inia CH number 21 verse number 81 Allah says in sa 34 vers number 81 in several places Allah says in Sur ma number 5 verse number 21 and he calls this land as the holy land so Allah says in the Quran several places about the blessings and the Holiness of this land it's mentioned of volume number six Hadith number 3954 where the Beloved Prophet wasallam said tuba for Asam that mean Glad Tidings for Asam and the has asked that why Allah so the prophet replied that alman's angel they spread their wings over this land it's further mentioned Inari number nth number 7094 the Beloved prophet wasallam he prays to Allah subhana tala oh Allah bestow your blessings on a sham so you have several quranic in Hadi talking about the blessings of sh as far as Jerusalem is concerned it a holy land it's a holy city where many prophets they lived and it is sacred to all the three abraic Faith the Jews they pray towards Jerusalem they pray facing the veiling wall that the Western Wall and they consider the alaka compound which they call as the Temple mount they consider it as sacred as far as the Christian is concerned for them the Jerusalem is also Sacred City It's associated with isaam and in the old city of Jerusalem is the Church of the Holy sea the Muslims we call Jerusalem as Al as the holy house and it is mentioned in mus Ahmed Hadith number 2309 a beloved Prophet mallam said thatal that Antichrist he will prevail over the full earth except Mam and M towards before the end of the world when the will come he will prevail over the full world except mid Haram and M it's mentioned in mus Ahmed Hadith number 22320 that the Beloved Prophet Mall said there will be a group amongst my people my followers who will always openly speak the truth and no one will be able to harm them until the last hour and the sahabas asked the prophet where will they be and the prophet replies in Jerusalem as far as the virtues of ala MOS is concerned we all know that the Arabic worda it means the F so Al MOS means the Fest mosque and as mam is given the title of the old house is given as that's the holy house it's say bukari Point number four Hadith number 3366 that Abu may Allah be PE with him he asked the prophet that which was the first mosque built on the Earth and the prophet replied mid Al Haram he asked which MOS was built next the prophet said Mida so M AA was the second mosque built on the face of the Earth the second house of Allah 40 years after mam it's mentioned sari number six Hadith number 4492 that Al he says Allah with him that we sahabas along with the prophet our we Face the direction of M AA until the 17th month of hij and then we change to M Haram so the first K of the Muslim of M AA up to the 17th month of hij and then it got changed to M and as I mentioned earlier that m is the third holiest mosque on the face of the Earth after Mam and M in makah and Med it's mentioned say Muslim one number one Hadith number 430 that Prophet Muhammad sallallahu Ali wasallam he was transported from to that the night joury and in M AA he lead the Salah where all the prophets were present all the prophets were present and m s wasam did the IM it further mentioned Inari Vol number five Hadith number 38 86 that when Prophet muham sallallahu Ali wasallam told the qur about and they did not believe so Prophet me to alh and Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala in front of him showed him the Masjid AA and the prophet started describing the details of Masjid AA which the qur was sh it is mentioned in the of M Hadith number 5883 that when the sahabas they were discussing which has more blessings is it m or so beloved Prophet wasallam said one prayer in my mosque is equal to four prayers in Masjid AA and we know that the Saab for praying in mji the mosque of the Prophet is 1,000 equal to prayer anywhere else that means if you pray in mid AA you get 250 times more Saab than prayers anywhere else it's mentioned sari one number two Hadith number 1189 that a beloved Prophet malli wasallam said that there are only three places where you can travel for pilgrimage to a mosque and that is M AA the M Haram m and M so MJ AA is one of the three mosque where you can take a journey to it's mentioned ma morning number two Hadith number 148 that a beloved Prophet said that after after peace be upon him when he completed M he prayed to Allah and asked for three things one that let let the Judgment be as my judgment number two do not give a Dominion a kingdom give me a kingdom which you will not give to anyone else after that and the third was when anyone travels to this mosque solely for praying forgive all his sins wash out all his sins as though he's a newborn from the mother's home and the prophet said two prayers have been answered and I pray that even the third is answered and we know that Masjid AA is the only mosque mentioned by name besides Masjid Haram only these two MOS are mentioned in the Quran by name and when we read the history we come to know and most of the scholars say that Masjid AA was built by Adam Alam then it was rebuilt by Abraham later on the main building was started construction Byam it was completed Byam and later in 587 BC the Babylonians came and conquered Jerusalem the king of Babylonian neuch he conquered jerus and he destroyed M AA for the Jews s Mida they called it as the Temple of Solomon it was sacred for them also later on in 167 BC the Jews they rebuil it and in 70 CE the Romans they came and again they conquered the Jerusalem and they destroyed the Masjid AA and so much so they were against the Jews and the Muslims that they made the compound of M AA a plain ground and they used it only for dumping filth dirt and muck it was later on in 637 or 638 CE the second C of isra second CIF of Islam Allah be pleas with him he liberated Jerusalem as M AA the Christian patriar sis he said I will only give the keys of Jerusalem to the leader of the Muslims and with him he came all the way to Jerusalem took the keys and without Bloodshed he he liberated Jerusalem as well as ma AA and he identified the spot where the Prophet had prayed he cleared it he cleaned it with his own hands and he made a mix shift must and he prayed there more than 50 years later in 691 692c it was the OM Khalifa ABD Malik bin Maran who constructed the Dome of the Rock the golden dome that you see that is made on the foundation next to M he constructed that and it was with the Muslims for a long period for more than 450 years until the first first Crusaders came in 1,99 and the Crusaders when they want won the battle they conquered Jerusalem and they massacred all the Muslims even after wining the battle they massacred almost all the Muslims and they killed them the innocent Muslims the Bloodshed that they spilled is known in history but alhamdulillah 88 years later Salu in 1,187 he again in the Battle of H he liberated Jerusalem and the Christians were afraid that this Muslim leader now will take revenge and Massacre all the Christians also like what they had done 88 years back but alhamdulillah the world knows that there was a sparkling difference between Sal AI Allah Havey on him and the crus ERS he forgave everyone so much so that he said that all the non-muslims can practice their religion in Jerusalem if they want to stay the Christians were allowed to stay there and practice their faith the Jews were allowed to stay and practice their faith all those who wanted to go to their country anywhere else they were given safe passage so much so that even the non-muslims they loved him and he's red for his Humanity for his mercifulness for his forgiveness both by the East and the west by the Muslims as well as non-muslims and after that it was under the control of Muslims until 198 when the britishers they came and occupied Palestine and in 1947 there was the UN resolution where Jews were very little less than 10% but they gave them 55% of the land and to the Palestinian only 45% then the first first Arab Israel war took place in 1948 where the Jews they captured about 78% of the Palestinian land and the second Arab Israel war took place in 1967 and they captured the East Jerusalem and they had security outside M there are people that tell us what is the solution people say that the people who are the first inhabitant of the land they are rulers of the land which I disagree I disagree that people who are the first inhabitant of the land are the ruler of the land but even if you agree for sake of argument from from history we come to know that the first people who settled in Palestine in Palestine were the canites they were the Arabs a tribe from the Arabian peninsula in 6,000 BC 600 years after ibraim Alam in 1,400 BC did the Jews settle there that means 4,500 years before the Jews came to Palestine the Arabs was settled there and later on in 70c they were kicked out by the Romans so I don't agree that the person who comes first is the ruler but even if that is the case yes the Arabs are the main ruler of the world if the owner of the full world is Allah subhana wa ta'ala our Creator God Almighty and those people who follow the laws of Allah subhana wa ta'ala are the real rulers and Allah says in the Quran inah CH number 7 verse number 128 that to Allah belongs the Earth the full world and he gives it as a Heritage to whichever of his slaves he wants that mean Allah can give up to whoever he wants and those who are blessed are the ones who are are the pious people that means the real ruler of the lands are those who establish the law of the creat Allah subhana wa taala on the face of the Earth if there is Arab tribe which is doing sh not on doesn't do justice they have no right to rule the world they have no right to rule that Earth the rightful people according to the Quran are the people who are on and on Justice today all the Muslims in the world they we have to unite as one umah these borders of the countries were made later on the Muslim umah is one and the man of Allah and his and we pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala for the Palestinians whose rights have been taken we pray to Allah to free mjid AA it's the duty of the Muslims that we see to it that we beseech we ask for help in suud in the last one-third of the night in tud to protect the Palestinians many of his homes have been damaged the houses have been destroyed many of them have been tortured in the misery that they are and Allah tells us in the Quran inah Bak CH number 2 verse number 214 talking about the people the adversities and the problems they faced that the spirit was broken so much so that the messenger and the Believers they prayed when will the help of Allah come and Allah replies verily the help of Allah is near today the Muslim umah is weak we are very feeble and we don't know what to do and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter number three verse number 139 that despair not let not your heart be broken Superior is the one who's on faith so we Muslims should stick to our faith and in inshallah Victory will be us as Allah says in the Quran in Iman 3:3 hold to the Rope of Allah strongly that is the Glorious Quran and the authentic Hadith of MMI wasallam and be not divided if you Muslims are united and if you're not divided inshallah and we on the Faith with ta and inshallah victory will [Music] be I pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that may he liberate Palestine and may he give us an opportunity at least to pray once in before we die I'd like to end my speech with the quotation of Quran Allah say in is number 17 verse number 81 when truth is in falsehood falsehood perishes falseit it's by its nature bound to [Applause] perish"
