  "title": "Was the Fatwa of Imaam Khomeni against Salman Rushdie Correct? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "salaam alaikum i'm my name is yashar payami i'm from iran really and i want to know exactly is that you must have read salman rushdie's satanic verses and as a muslim i nobody would have liked that book but so what do you think imam khamenei did was what he did was correct asking for the people for fatwa that was my main point what imam romania told about the fatwa that uh against fatwa against salman rashid was it correct award whether the question that what imam khamenei said regarding the fatwa of salman is right or wrong my basic question is that why did imam khomeini give the fatwa one year later the first country to ban the book of salman rajiv satnik versus was india and i congratulated rajiv gandhi for doing that act why should khomeini give the fatwa of killing salman rajdhi after one year because he was getting out of the news all politicians politicians if you wanted to give the first five should have given the book was reviewed by so many parts of the world so many countries banned it and then he gives the father should be killed whether right or wrong is afterwards all the political gains all political gains all these things are political gains but what rajiv gandhi did maybe he didn't know about it and i've given a talk on this issue of satanic verses though this book is banned in india i've read that book you know who claims that for namesake is a muslim he did not leave anyone in his book he even abuses queen elizabeth and the same british government who had banned an american author for using a four-letter word father uncle cousin king for the policy of margaret thatcher that same salman rashdi he makes it active and use inc and yet the book is very popular so one american author they banned because he uses the four-letter word for margaret thatcher this another person salman makes it active ing for the same market touches policy but he gets an award why because these maligning islam was very happy and do you know he even did not leave rama and sita you know these people are respected by the majority of the indians he even abuse them i don't use that word he abused them as you don't leave them and many of the people are supporting so maybe rajiv ghandi didn't know but later on if you read that book you realize he did not leave anyone so if a person who keeps on maligning etc allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 5 verse number 33 ask to anyone who wages the war against allah and his messenger there are various options given that you can either execute him you can crucify him chop off opposite limbs or take him out of the country and this law is not only in the quran it is even in the bible if you read the book of leviticus it says that anyone who bless him with the law you should stone that person to death even a passerby was a stranger should stone that person to death who blessed him with the law so this lawyer then all the religious scriptures not only there in islam in most of the ages scripture for blasphemy whether it be christianity whether it be islam whether it be judaism for blasphemy if it's a confirmed blasphemy if it's that part of the country we cannot give fatwas here they should kill him etc if it's an islamic state of law if anyone blasphemeth there are certain laws and rules and regulation laid down but what politicians do whether it be a muslim politician or whether you've been non-muslim politician i'm sorry i don't again want to hurt any politicians per se if not all i say majority you find somewhere the other they compromise for their own world bank and that's the reason that it is said the religion and politics that polls apart they use religion and the plank to see to it that they get fame etc and that's what people do which we people should be aware that were given by khomeini it was just a political gimmick according to me but banning the book what rajeev gandhi did was perfect he abandoned he was the first and now they're thinking of removing the ban i don't know the ban has come out or not there's another statement that they're trying to remove the ban but if anyone blasphemed the lord in islam in christianity that person according to christianity should be stoned to that in islam there are four options you can even exile him because he had no option christianity only responding to that in islam there are four options you can choose in christianity you have to stone that person to death [Applause]"
