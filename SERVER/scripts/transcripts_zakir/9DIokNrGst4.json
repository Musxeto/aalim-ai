  "title": "What Good Deeds are Done on the Day of Eid - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "now we'll discuss the last and the fourth point that is that is the Eid or the day of sacrifice the ease of sacrifice or the day of sacrifice and we know that Allah had asked Prophet Ibrahim that what do you love the most in this world but natural after Allah he said my son Ismail and Allah tests Ibrahim that can you sacrifice him for me and Abrahim Islam goes and tells his son Ismail Islam and he said don't worry father you will find me steadfast and on the instruction of Allah when he's about to sacrifice replaces him with the sacrific and this is what we remember every year that we should be able to sacrifice anything in this world for this day of sacrifice of sacrifice if you have the means we sacrifice an animal for one person it is a goat or if you want a big animal like a cow or a camel it can be for seven people and it's mentioned verse number 37 it is not their meat or blood that reaches Allah but it is a party which is so we don't sacrifice so that the blood and the meat is but we do it for our partition and what do we do with the sacrifice when you sacrifice the animal we distributed amongst the poor people amongst the friends among relatives and keep some for ourselves normally it is recommended that minimum one third should be given to the poor people one third to the family and friends and the maximum you can keep yourself with one third this is a practice let me tell you the feeling features that should be done on either number one that have a bath early in the morning number two put perfume on yourself it's a Sunnah number three is that where the best of your clothes number four number five preferable do not eat anything before the each prayer number six go to pray early number seven that it is recommended that all the women including the children including the menstruating women should go for the Eid fella even if they don't have to offer Salah or they don't have to go to the masala and when you come back from eat prayer see to it that you take another route not the same route in which you went for the Salah and preferable to pray in a Muslim an open ground which is called as now what is the reason that Prophet recommended that all the women and the children including the menstruating women should go for the eat Salah even if they don't have to offer Salah even if they don't have to go and pray what is the reason why the prophet said that you go from one root and when you come back take the other route why did he say that pray in a large place is for all this we come to know that the reason is so that it boosts the morale of the Muslims normally we Muslims or for five times in congregation the mosque once a week in Juma we have a bigger congregation we pray in the Juma mosque the congregation is multiple than bigger than what congregation you have during the fight time Salah and twice in the year during the event the prophet recommended that to pray in an open ground known as the idka why so that a larger number can gather imagine if you are living in a village and during the East shall I come to know there are 30 000 Muslims there are forty thousand Muslims the morale of the Muslims is boosted and if you are living in an area which has a non-muslim also the non-muslims will think 10 times before interfering with the Muslims oh the Muslim the 30 000 in number 40 000 in number imagine if you're living in a big city and if you pray in one ID in which hundred thousand gather or a few hundred thousand gather imagine the scenario it will boost up the morale of the Muslims and at the same time would give a non-muslim thought that they better not interfere with the Muslims this is the psychology for which what is the reason that the Beloved Prophet even told the woman and the children to go even the woman is demonstrated when you go through one way come to the other way not the same way why so that the other people in the other locality of that Village of that town or that City no the Muslims are going in large numbers if you go through route a come back through root B so that the people of ruti also come to know the people of root to be also come to know that Muslims and large number the next important point when you come back if you have the means you sacrifice an enemy if Allah has given you the means later on you go and meet your family friends it's the day of Celebration and when you meet the greeting is from us and from you normally in India Pakistan they say Eid Mubarak or other words the Sunnah is to wish except The Good Deeds from us and from you you can face Mubarak it is the right thing is as the sabbas wished each other and the day of Eid this should be a day of Celebration be happy be cheerful let me tell you the important points of the eat Salah before I end this talk there are 14 important points of vithala number one the eat Salah is further for every Muslim who is an adult and Hussein number two it is offered between the time after the Fajr Salah and before the dwar Salah but the earlier we offer the potatoes number three it should be offered in an open ground also known as number four that if Eid Falls on ajuma then praying Juma on that day is not further but it is Sunnah it is recommended if you pray it is good but if you want you can abstain from Jama Salah at that time you should pay only the Zohar Salah next Point number five is that there is no Adan or no Akama before the Salah number six there is no Sunnah before the Salah or after the Salah number seven is of turaka number eight there are six extra tagbirat in the first rakat before Surah Fatiha besides along with that there are total seventhirat in the first takat before Surah Fatiha in the second rakat after you get up from the sujud in the starting of the second rakat after seeing the taqbir there are five additional before the Surah Fatiha in the second ninth point is that it is Sunnah to recite Surah Allah in the first in the second the 10th point is it is also a Sunnah you can recite Surah off in the first and surekamar in the second the 12th is that after the eat Salah there is the 13th point is it is recommended that you hear the of the Imam after the Salah but it is not offer them it is highly recommended and the 14th point is when you go for Salah from one root see to it while coming back you take the other route these were the 40 Salient points of the Salah and I've covered in brief in as short a time as possible the importance of the first 10 days of religion"
