  "transcript": "foreign [Music] i welcome all the viewers of the peace tv network the phd in english the phishing urdu the peachtree bangla and the phd in need as well as my four social media platforms which are the facebook the youtube the instagram and twitter i welcome all the viewers with islamic greetings assalamu alaikum and i welcome all of you to the second part of this program ask dr zakir and his son farik season two session two i would like to thank for answering the first two questions and inshallah from here i'll be answering the questions just to remind you you're most welcome to ask your questions in brief on any of the social media platforms but the best would be to text your message on the whatsapp in brief along with your name your profession your city and country of residence to the whatsapp number plus 60 double one two six nine five three eight nine five i repeat plus six zero double one two six nine five three eight nine five here you are most welcome to ask any questions on islam compared to religion or question that any non-muslim or any atheist may have asked you regarding islam and your unable to reply or any question or query that you find on the media if you require any answers dealing with islam reason logic and science this is the opportunity the first question is from rf kazi from london uk the month of dulhija is after four to five days what is the importance of the first 10 days of the rija and that's a very important question i would like to thank brother arf for asking this question because according to me the importance of the first ten dollar are the forgotten sunnah of the beloved prophet unfortunately most of the muslims throughout the world have forgotten the importance of the first entities of the nature most of our muslims very well know about hamdan and we prepare for the month of ramadan and we know most of its advantage most of the blessings of ramadan but unfortunately very few of us muslims are aware of the first 10 days of the leader allah by dawn and by the ten nights here allah is taking the oath of fajr and by ten nights here the mufassin say that is by the ten nights it is referring to the first ten days of the ninja now people will wonder why does allah use the word nights when he's referring to the days of the first 10 days this is common in many languages if i have to say in english that i was 10 days in new york i spent 10 days in new york but naturally when i say i spent 10 days in new york it means i spent 10 days and 10 nights in new york it's understood when i say days many times the night says included similarly in arabic when days are mentioned the nights are included and when nights are mentioned many a times even the days are included it can only be night it can be day and night also it can be only day depending upon the context so when allah says here he's taking the oath of ten nights the mufassirin they say it refers to the first ten days of the nature and if you read it says that the first 10 days of dollar are the most important days in the complete year there are no days besides these 10 days which are more important these 10 days in the full year are the most important days of the year even more important than the last 10 days of ramadan but the last 10 nights of ramadan are more important than the first 10 nights of the ninja because in the last 10 nights of ramadan is the length of qatar because falls in the last 10 nights of ramadan the last 10 nights of ramadan are the most important 10 nights in the full year and the first 10 days of golijah are the most important days in the full year it's mentioned in sai buhari volume 2 hadith number 969 the prophet said there are no deeds better than the deeds done on the first 10 days of the witcher there are no deeds done on any other day better than the deeds done on the first ten days of the lecture so the sabbah asked the prophet what about jihad the prophet said eve in jihad the deeds done on the first ten days of religion are better even than jihad except if jihad is done with the wealth and the life of the person and the person returns back without any of the two that means if a person goes for jihad with his wealth and his life and he is martyred that is the only deed one deed which is better than the good deeds done in the first 10 years a similar message is repeated in hadith number 1925 it's narrated by ibn pass that the prophet peace be upon himself the deeds done in the first days are the best deeds there is no other deeds done on any other day which is better than the deeds done in the first 10 days of the day and when someone asked the prophet what about jihad the prophet said eve in jihad unless the person goes for jihad which is wealth and life and comes back without both of them that means unless a person is martyred in the battlefield while doing jihad that's the only need which is better than the good deeds done in the first 10 days of the nature that means the first 10 days of villager are the most important 10 days in the full year there is no doubt about it and unfortunately most of us muslims are unaware of this fact it's mentioned inside muslim volume 3 hadith number 2747 with the beloved prophet about the fasting on the day of arafah the beloved prophet muhammad said that fasting on the day of arafah expediates the sins of the previous year and the coming year the most important fast after the fast of ramadan is the fasting on the day of arafah it's the most important there are some scholars very few who say fasting of maharam the fasting of ashura is the most important after the first pasta from because the hadith of the prophet in salallahu and ashura is the most important fast after the fast of ramadan but in this fast the prophet said the sins of the previous year is excited is forgiven but if you fast during the day of arafah then the sins of the previous year and the next year the following year two years of argument that's the reason most of the scholars say that the most important fast after the fasting of the further fast of ramadan is the fasting of arafah but it is unanimous that these two fast the fasting of harafa and the fasting of ashura are the two most important fast after the first that the wives of the prophet said the prophet fasted during the first nine days of the nature and he fasted during ashura and three days every month the first monday and 2 30 we come to know from this that the prophet fasted all the nine days the first nine days of the ninja that means besides the ninth of the lijja the day of arafah it is mustahab it is sunnah to fast all the first nine days of the ninja if someone say i cannot then at least fast besides rf monday and thursday but the best is fasting all the first nine days of the rija because these are the best days of the year one may ask why not fast the ten days why only first ten days the reason is a beloved prophet muhammad said let's mention inside that the prophet said it is prohibited to fast on israel and either both the egain in the after ram and that is the 10th of the luncheon these two days are the days of it so the prophet said it is prohibited too fast on the two days of fear that is the reason it must stop to fast on the first nineteenth of july it's further mentioned inside muslim that the prophet said you should not fast on the ayaman tashree that means the three days following because these are the days of eating and drinking and the prophet also said it's mentioned say muslim that if you are slaughtering an animal then that person should not cut his nail or cut his hair from the first day of the ninja till he sawtells the animal if you are doing karma if you are slaughtering then it it is sunnah that should not cut your nails up at your head from the first day of the liver till the time you saute them but if someone is slaughtering on behalf of someone else then that person need not follow if this rule slaughtering and if somebody's slaughtering on my behalf then i need not follow this rule if i'm slaughtering myself then this will happen before it is further mentioned in football that the prophet recommended that during these first 10 days of the rija you should say that and it's mentioned that the third period is allah 5446 when the prophet said that according to omar abdullah may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet said there are no deeds better than the deeds done on the first tense of religion therefore same thing allah it further mentioned inside bukhari word number two page number 65 that abdullah binomial he said and allah be pleased with them that abdullah umar and abu harev they used to go out in the marketplace during the first 10 days of the rija and loudly say the padmirath and when the other sahaba is figure then they should repeat it by themselves now do we see any muslims in the marketplace in the mall in the soup saying that loudly during the first 10 days maybe in some countries maybe some of the gulf countries but normally in india pakistan malaysia indonesia we don't find muslims going out to the marketplace and saying loudly allah most of the viewers are like tell you that the first 10 days of inshallah will be after four or five days in malaysia in saudi in the gulf countries inshallah it will be from the 22nd of july from wednesday four days from today other countries it will be up to five days maybe india pakistan and bangladesh and some countries maybe one day later see to it that we follow these sunnah and revive the sunnah and do not let the first ten days go east this topic of the first 10 digits actually requires a big talk for a few hours time is limited i will just mention the important good deeds that a person should do during these first 10 days of the ninja i'll not mention all and mention the important 35 months number one is that you should pray your all five times daily for the salah in jama in the mosque number two if you have not done hajj and if hajj is first on you if you have the means and the wealth and the health and you're an adult then doing hajj is fun even if you have done it if you do it again it is musta it is good you can do it but unfortunately now we are going through the pandemic the coronavir is covered 19 that there is in the foreigners those who are outside saudi but the saudis and the foreigners in saudi they can do but only a limited few only a few thousand i think will be permitted this hajj inshallah we'll hope that allah gives us the chance next year inshallah to do number three that do not do any haram during this first ten days of the you should not do haram throughout your life but be particular not only the major sins avoid totally even the minor sins during these 10 days you have to not do sins throughout your life but be more particular during the first 10 days of zuluja that even by mistake do not do any sin leave aside the major sin do not even do the minor sins the fourth point is fast during yamul arafa the ninth dulu ja the day of arafah inshallah your previous year since and the next lesson will be forgiven inshallah expiated would be forgiven inshallah but natural when the hadees says your sins will be forgiven it's understood the minor sins not the major sense point number five it's preferable you fast the first nine days of the luja all the first nine days if you cannot for any particular reason at least fast on arafah and monday and thursday but preferably you fast all the nine days the first nine days of the lecture the sixth point is that slaughter an animal if you have the capacity on yamuna that is on isla or the three days following on ayam with the shri seventh is say the thus be subhanallah as many times as you can during all these 10 days the more you say the better it will be and you'll be rewarded a lot for this eighth is pray your tahajud during the last one third of the night and recite long verses of the quran the longer you do the better at least read eight rakat tajut followed by the witad and for long hours during the last one third of night so totally there are 12 sulita mohada and the prophet said that anyone who read these 12 sunata mukhetha regularly inshallah he will go to jannah and get a house close to the prophet pray your salah doha preferably four o'clock you can even pay to rakhat after sunrise anytime after 20 minutes till before 20 minutes of the sun reaching its highest point see to it that you do maximum charity during these 10 days besides your further zakat do as much of charity as you can do dua before iftar and since we'll be fasting sudhua before iftar is acceptable do as much as do as you can during all these 10 days do as much of zika as you can during these 10 days read as much of the quran as you can during these 10 days do the love of quran if you can you do memorization of the quran read the quran if you don't know arabic as the language read along with arabic portion read the translation in the language you understand the best read the tafseer of the quran if you can teach quran to others the 11th point is that ask allah for forgiveness as much as you can do is take far do during these first 10 days of religion do as much recite as much as of the dua of the prophet muslim all the dua which are recommended and the best book to refer is the fortress of the muslim that hispan muslim where the authentic dwarves are mentioned do as many other good deeds as you can in these 10 days of the lecture as much as you can whatever small deed medium deeds big good deeds do as much as you can follow as much as of the sunnah of the prophet as you can during the first 10 days for example when you wear the footwear with your right foot when you remove the footwear remove with the left foot when you enter the mask enter with the right foot when you step out of the master ball from the left foot when you're wearing the clothes put your right hand first when you're removing the clothes removed with the left side first the other somnas when you are drinking water sit down and drink water as much as of the sunnah can do it is better during the first 10 days of the nija then do task enough purification of the soul this is the 15th point purification of the soul the sixteenth point is that read as much as say hadith you can of the prophet forgive people's fault as much as you can avoid all the makuru as much as the makru discourage acts you can avoid please avoid and don't do it do islam with the other muslims as much as you can do dawah with the non-muslims invite them to the fold of islam invite them towards tahit read the sunna the sun at 10 in the full day 2 rakat sunat after the zohar then two plus two four akkad before the asar salah two rakaat before the maghrib salah and two raka before the isha salah totally there are ten sonata keramoto attend as many live lectures as you can of scholars the gurus the lectures the question answer session of the authentic scholars if you cannot attend personally then watch them on the videos on the social media on the youtube on the facebook you can hear them on the audio on the audio tape on the dvds on the social media you can read books of the seerah of the prophet you can read books of the authentic scholars give as much time as you can for your family members because the prophet said the best muslim is he whose best to his family especially his wife do not waste a single minute during this first end of zulu because these 10 days are the most important days of the year you cannot afford to waste a single minute be kind and nice to people be good to the neighbors be happy and cheerful and be nice and courteous to all the people living around you this was in brief about the 35 important points that should be done during the first 10 days of religion there are many more you can add but since time is limited these are the important points i mentioned and inshallah for more details you can refer to my facebook and to my other lectures on this topic and i hope i've done justice in brief to the importance of the first ending of the lecture the next question is from muhammad sheikh chicago usa what are the virtues of arafah due to limited time i did not cover the more details of arafat except one important detail but the next question is asking me to mention the virtues of arafah so alhamdulillah allah has given me more time to spend on this topic again the virtues of arafah you can spend hours together discussing it i will just mention seven important points of the virtues of arafah allah says in the quran in surah chapter 85 verse number three what shall he do by the witnessing day and by the witness day your allah is taking oath of the witnessing day referring to friday and the witness day referring to yamal arafa and if you read the hadith in jamaica midi word number six hadith number three three three nine the beloved portion of salaam said that when allah speaks about the yamal mashood the witness and when allah is referring to the witnessing day allah is referring to friday so according to this hadith in jamaica we realize that when allah says in surah 85 allah is taking oath in verse number 3 by the witnessing day referring to friday and by the witnessed day allah is referring to your arafah allah is taking further is mentioned in the hadith of muslim ahmed hadith number 2455 that the prophet said that allah brings out the children of adam from the loins on the day of arafah and he asked them the question that who is your lord and then the same thing is mentioned allah says in surah number 7 verse number 172 and 173 that allah brings out from the loin of adam the children of adam and asked them that who is your lord who is your and all the children of adam they bear witness that allah is kara and allah says so that on the day of judgment you will not say that i did not know who is my lord or you will not say that my parents they used to do idol worship so this excuse will not be accepted here it's mentioned in the hadith of muslim also as in the quran in surah chapter 7 verse 172 and 173 that allah brings out from the law and the children of adam and asked them and they bear witness that allah is there allah is their lord it further mentioned in say buhari or number one hadith number 45 that once a jew approaches um the second caliph of islam and says o chief of the believers if what was revealed in your scripture was revealed in our scriptures we would have celebrated it as an eid a day of festival so um the law one asked the jew which verse are you referring to then the jew quotes surah maidah chapter five verse number three on this day have i perfected your religion for you and i've chosen for you islam and have completed my favor on you tomorrow he says this day we know it was revealed to the prophet on a friday on yamal arafa that means this day the day this verse was revealed so reminder chapter five verse number three and most of the muslims say this is the last verse of the quran that was revealed it was revealed to the prophet on yamal arafa and it says that this day have a perfect religion for you and have chosen for you islam and complete my favor on you it is further mentioned in sunnah point number three hadith number 2419 that the prophet said that means the ninth day of the yamala rafa and yamuna the idol and the three days following ayam with the shri are the days of festival are the days of eid it is of eating and drinking those people who are doing hajj for them on the yamaha arafat yamul arafa is hajj according to the prophet and it is like eid it is the day of feasting and drinking and eating and people are doing hajj they should not fast for your arafa the first thing which i mentioned in my early answer is only for those who are not doing hatch but those who are doing hajj it is not recommended for them to fast it is the day of eid day of eating and drinking it is further mentioned 3006 that the prophet said that there is no day in which allah subhanahu wa ta'ala frees his slaves male and female more than the day of arafah that means on this day allah subhanahu wa ta'ala frees the maximum of the people from hellfire male and female and this day is the best day of forgiveness and your is the best day of the year without doubt like the best night of the year island the best day of the year is allah frees the maximum of slaves from the hellfire male and female is the best day of forgiveness is further mentioned in media hadith number 3585 where the prophet said that yamul arafah is the best day and the best dua to be done on this day is all things this dua according to the prophet is the best dua and during your arafah doing this dua as much as you can it is recommended you can do during all these sundays but during yoga arafat specifically this dua the prophet recommended and said that if you do the dua it's the best one and the seventh virtue the last which i mentioned earlier is also that it is mentioned in say muslim volume number three hadith number 2747 that the beloved prophet muslim said that fasting on the day of arafah expiates your sins of the previous year and the next year your previous year and the next year sindh are forgiven if you fast on your alpha so inshallah the 10 days will be starting very soon after four or five days and normal rfi inshallah will come after about two weeks and we see to it that we do as much as the sunnah and we revive the sunnah and we do the good deeds in the 10 days of as well as specifically on yamalaka hope that i'm stupid we have on the facebook abuzar khan um [Music] we have amina shri sabuna oromo that's on facebook abdullah lots of love lots of love to you also they adding to us for you too and may allah grant you generation on the youtube we have muhammad aziz yaya pathan reward all of you inshallah the next question is from jabir haruna from nigeria i am a police officer is it allowed for a public officer to accept gratification and gifts from public which one does not demand for another question from anonymous india but living in dubai if anyone accepts bribe for some years and he then repents and makes toba how can he refund or compensate as he has collected money from too many people by doing fraud brother has asked a question that if he gets gratification or without demanding some gifts as a police officer then is it accepted or not i believe what prophet muhammad said it's mentioned say bihari one number nine hadith number 6979 that the prophet told one of the persons to go and collect zakat so when he comes back he tells the prophet this is your money of zakat and this is the gift i received the prophet replies that will you go and sit at the home of your father and the home of your mother and do you think you'll get these gifts and the prophet gets very angry and immediately when he's addressing the people he tells oh my people i had appointed one of you to do an important task for me which allah had entrusted on me referring to collection of zakat that person comes and gives me and says this is the zakat money which is for you and this is the gift i received i told him that will you go and sit at the house of your father and the house of your mother and do you think you'll get these gifts then the prophet says that o people you do not take a single unlawful thing otherwise you will carry that with you on the day of judgement the prophet said do not take any single thing unlawful otherwise you will carry that thing with you on the day of judgment to allah and the prophet said i do not want any of you to be seen carrying a camel which is grunting or a cow which is moving or a sheep which is bleeding that means the prophet has prohibited anyone from taking anything extra and unlawful it's further mentioned in the hadith of sunnah abu dhabi verb number three hadith number 2943 that the prophet said that the person who we employ for administrative work and when we give him provision if he takes anything besides that it is meaning embezzlement meaning fraud meaning bribery it's further mentioned in the hadith number three hadith number 2945 that the prophet said that if we employ anyone for administrative work and if he comes with his wife if he doesn't have a servant he may have a servant if he doesn't have a dwelling he may have a dwelling and abu bakr allah continues that the prophet said that anything above this is treachery and theft it's further mentioned in muslim ahmed hadith number 23601 that the beloved prophet said that anything received by employee of the government it is rule embezzlement it is treachery from all these hadith we come to know that any employee of the government or provided by the government or as for that matter any company besides the salary what he gets and besides the perk what he gets anything else he received from anyone outside it is equal to bribery it is equal to guloon it is equal to embezzlement that means any government servant in any country today muslim country or any other country if he receives anything besides the salary and the perk which is mentioned in the contract anything above it may be you know we call in india chai pani pakistan chai pani meaning water and tea some people say sweets some people say oiling of the palm or greasing of the palm some people say under the table all these things gifts any gift direct or indirect besides the salary and the perks that has been given officially in the contract anything above that is bribery so as far as the first question is concerned asked by the brother in nigeria if you are a police officer or working at any post of the government besides your salary and the perks that is given by the government anything else is counted as bribery as for matter of fact if a person is working on a high post or any post in a private company as a manager of the company he's getting his salary he's getting his perks he's getting his allowance above that if any of the client gave him any gift or watch or anything else this is counted as bribery according to the beloved prophet muslim it is counted as embezzlement regarding the second question a similar question that is asked by anonymous india that if anyone accepts bribe for some years and he repents and makes taubah how can he refund or compensate as he has collected money from too many people by doing this fraud and as you know that bribery is the 32nd major sin in the book of al qabar by imam dhabi amongst the major sins imam dhabi lists bribery as number 32 it's mentioned in the glorious quran in surah baqarah chapter number 2 verse number 188 that use not your wealth as bait for judges in order to eat other people's wealth it's mentioned in jamaica media hadith number 1337 that the beloved prophet muslim said that anyone who gives bribe or anyone who takes bribe allah's messenger has cursed them so bribing is a major sin if someone now wants to repent and do tawbah what can he do for doing so bad there are five requirements number one he should agree what he's doing is wrong number two he should stop it immediately number three he should repent and ask for forgiveness number four he should not do it again and number five if possible you should undo it for example if you have taken bribery from many people if you can remember the amount or the name of the person and if you can give back that's the best if you do not remember if you have taken too much then follow the first four things at least the degree it is wrong stop it ask for forgiveness don't do it again and what you can do is you can give charity what you think you have collected in all these years give that in charity to the poor people ask for forgiveness inshallah allah will forgive you we have on the facebook munira abdullah on the youtube we have the man abdul-jabbar billionaire fahad may allah reward all of you i would like to thank especially the subscribers of the youtube mashallah just a few days back

similarly the facebook followers mashallah has reached more than 22 and a half million i would like to thank all the followers of the facebook two and the priority that may he guide you to the straight path and inshallah reward you there's a question from faisal ahmad from lucknow what can the child do for one's parents after they die so both the child and the parents benefit in the hereafter our beloved prophet salallahu said that after a person dies when he goes to the grave everything is gone only things that return are the good deeds we have done the knowledge that he has spread and his pious children praying for him so the three things that is arya are the good deeds and the wealth that the person has spent the knowledge that he has spread and his pie is children praying regarding the question that what can a child do for the parents so that both benefit the best thing you can do is become a pious human being and once you become the pious human being he should pray for his parents so if he is pious and if you pray for the parents inshallah the prayer will be accepted then you pray for your parent for january so you become pious be a good muslim do all the farah's stay away from all the haram activities do as much as mustapha do dawa in your life and if you're pious and pray for your parents for their for your hera for jannah so that you and your parents and the company of prophet sallam then inshallah that will be the best for you as well as the best for them the next question we have on whatsapp is from chaya new delhi india she says earlier

summarized version by darussalam if you want to read books of hadith i would recommend that you read um in which the akamata mentioned read the seerah of the prophet the life history of the prophet there's a book by the title sealed nectar which is the translation of sin nectar by saphir iman mubarak puri it's a very good book the translation is available in english from dharasalam regarding

which is the most authentic and the best in replying to questions on islam is islam qa dot info and hope that answers the question the next question from ursalan kursid bihar india is covering one's head during salah or sunnah or a culture first we'll discuss whether covering the head is sunnah or a culture and then come to covering the head in salah there is a verse in the quran in surah araf chapter number 7 verse number 31 which says that or children of adam take your adornments for every time and place of prayer telling to the mani adam that take your adornments your beautiful appearance at the time of prayer and the place of prayer this is the only reference you get regarding the clothes of prayer in the quran as far as whether covering the head is a sunnah or a culture the difference opinion some group of scholars they say that covering the head is a sunnah some group of scholars says it's only cultural but all the scholars unanimously agree that if it is in the culture that covering the head is respectful then the muslims should cover the head but if it is not considered as respectful in the society like western society it may not be that respectful covering the head so then if you don't come it's okay but in india pakistan in the eastern part of the world in malaysia indonesia it is respectful to cover that so at that time it is better than you cover that so the scholars are divided whether it is a sunnah or not but according to nashville in albany sheikh nasi he says that it is sunnah to cover your and the prophet and the sabbath covered that islam he said the sahabas always covered that the prophet covered that so it is not from the sabbath to uncover your head so according to islam hypnothermia covering the head is a song even a found nikai he says that the prophet won the turban without the cap he wrote the cap without the turban and you find several hadith we say that the prophet over a turban the prophet or a black turban the prophet foreign the prophet or a cap the prophet or a white cap the seven hadith so based on these hadith this group of scholars say that covering the head is sunnah it is from the salah from the salaf it is that we should cover the head so according to sheikh nash may allah have mostly on them all it is soon not to cover that as far as i'm concerned also i believe that covering the sunnah irrespective whether you're in the eastern part of the world or whether in the western part of the world since the prophet covered the head since the salaf covered that i believe in those group of scholars that say that covering the sunnah regarding the question of covering the head during salah is it sunnah is it a culture as far as covering that is concerned there is no proof no hadith no quranic verse that is the first to cover the head during salah so it is very clear-cut that covering the head is not a further while offering salah it's not a requirement but those scholars who believe that covering their generally is a sunnah they also say that covering the head is mustab during salah imagine if a person come from the western part of the world and he wants to be a mom in india pakistan and he uncovers his head it would be very weird because this part of the world covering that is not only a culture they consider it a sunnah that's the reason even if the muslims when they don't cover the head in the normal times in india pakistan bangladesh at least by salah they cover that but recently in the last few years five or ten years you find many of the muslims coming from gulf countries and they want to show the people that they have knowledge and because it's not further to cover head and salah now you find people reading salah in the mosque without covering that previously maybe 15-20 years back 99 of the people in the mosque always the head were covered now you find at least 15 20 percent or maybe a little bit more because they've gone to gulf country they come back and they want to show the people that they have knowledge so obviously they don't cover that while offering salah which is not a good practice if covering people consider covering the sunnah even if you don't belong to that group at least it's in the culture so at least while offering salah then why [Music] let me tell you it's not far to cover your head the prophet said only our should be covered and if you have two pieces of cloth one piece of touch should be over your shoulders and the other piece of thought should cover your aura this is the minimum requirement but natural according to many scholars covering their sunnah and even according to the hanafi school of thought covering the sunnah and according to many focus so i believe that company that is sunnah and a lot of rings around so it should be covered and even by offering salah it is preferable that the head should become this is in reference to the gems i'm talking about but naturally for the woman covering that is further in front of the name error and offering salah also but natural for the woman covering the head is the father the next question from marine from kashmir india can women read the quran during memphis there's a different opinion where the woman can read the quran during menses unanimously all the fukahas all the scholars agree that the woman during menses cannot touch the musa of the quran cannot touch the copy of the quran this is unanimously agreed upon all the scholars also unanimously agree that women during the menstrual period they can recite dua than if that dua contains a few words of the quran or a small section of the quran like bismillah or indian it is permissible there is no difference opinion the difference of opinion is in that can the woman recite the quran during menstruation most of the most of the scholars they say that women cannot read the quran during menstruation and the reason is based on menstruation is like janaba like major ceremonial impurity major sentiment imperative means after essential intercourse so after nightfall or where there's a mission after the sexual intercourse it's called as janaba so these scholars say that menstruation is like and they quote hadith that the prophet said that during menstruation the woman and during janaba both men and women they should not recite the quran now this hadith according to most of the muha the scene it is so this hadith in which the prophet said that the woman during menstruation and during janaba male and female both they should not recite the quran in the day so you cannot base your fatwa on this so based on this according to the maliki school of thought the women are permitted to recite the quran during the menstruation especially if they are doing gifts of the quran if they are students and imagine the menstruation can last for four days five days seven days two weeks for longer period and imagine you are away from the quran even one view of humble is that a woman can read during menstruation the glorious quran and sheikh nathamiya he believes in this view of imam ahmed namal that a woman during menstruation can recite the quran and even sheikh shahani he agrees that a woman can recite the quran during menstruation but naturally here the woman can only recite what they know from memory because they cannot touch the quran but now alhamdulillah if they have to touch they can touch with gloves or they can have some wood or a box in between etc but alhamdulillah lately since the last several years we have got quran on a digital platform and all of them agree that if you read the quran from a mobile or from ipad or on the computer a woman in menstruation can read from a mobile the quran can touch the mobile can touch the ipad can touch the tablet can't touch the computer this ruling that women touching the moosa is not applicable here because it's a digital format so even though all the scholars agree that women cannot write the quran during menstruation but according to imam malik and one view of imam number and imam and some others their view is that women can read the quran during menstruation but she should not touch it but naturally if she has a mobile or a tablet there's no problem from that she can read she can recite and i also agree with this view of imam malik and imam abnetimia as well as imam shakani that women during menstruation candidate the quran but they should not touch the quran and best now is to read from the mobile or from an app application or tablet and inshaallah so that during these few days whether it be four days five days 10 days 15 days they can be in touch with the quran and but naturally they can also read the translation of the quran they can read the other aspects the fascist etc hope that answers the question the next question is from syed aways from gujarat india i am 23 years old alhamdulillah and currently i am handling my father's business in today's fast paced world corruption and wrongdoing have become necessities to run a successful business as a muslim how can i practice my faith as well as handle my business without compromising in my team it's a very important question as by brother syed always and he said that today you cannot run a successful business without doing malpractice without corruption without lying i do agree with you partly but not completely i do agree that there are many businesses if you do malpractice if you do corruption if you tell lies you'll make a better profit but i don't agree with it completely there are occasions mashallah that if you're honest if you're truthful you will have a better clientage in the long run it will benefit you in business it will give you more profit but i do agree with you that by corruption by cheating many people make a lot of profit but for a muslim allah says in the quran in surah chapter number 67 verse number two allah has created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds this life that we are leading is a test for the hereafter and allah is testing you how do you lead your life and allah says in the quran that if you seek this dunya allah will give you this dunya but will not give you but if you seek for the akhirah allah will give you akhra and the dunya so as a muslim you should not involve in any activity which is haram you cannot do corruption you cannot tell lies you cannot fabricate i'm aware that in many businesses if you lie you get a better profit if you cheat you get a better profit if you fabricate but as i told you this is not the case always in the long run if you're honest you benefit more if you're honest the clients keep on trusting you better irrespective whether it benefits you in this world or not as a muslim if you follow the teachings of the quran being honest do not cheat in the weights do not cheat in the measurement do not lie be truthful if you do this insha allah you will benefit in the akhirah and allah will even give you benefit in this world and that's the reason we find that many of masha'allah the muslims who are very strict to quran and sunnah they may not be very well qualified in the business acumen but because they follow quran and sunnah you find that the business flourishes a lot and irrespective whether you benefit here or not so if you're handling your father's business and if you really care for your father first thing you have to do is think about akhirah it will benefit you and your father in yahara and after benefiting inshallah it will even benefit you and i always say and i give these examples to the muslims that if you are doing a business then make allah subhanahu talaha a partner in business what you should do you should say that whatever profit i make i will spend part of this profit in charity you start with small why don't you start with okay ten percent of my profit i will give in the way of allah maybe if you make a profit every month of supposed ten thousand dollars once you start giving ten percent you give thousand dollar every month in charity inshallah your profit will increase to twenty thousand then what you do okay increase your child to fifteen percent so when you are getting ten thousand you had only ten thousand with you the moment you started giving thousand dollars ten percent profit your profit increased to twenty thousand from the twenty thousand you're giving ten percent two thousand yet eighteen thousand is with you now instead of ten thousand you have eighteen thousand with you now momentarily twenty thousand you start getting fifteen percent profit now from twenty thousand you are giving three thousand dollar in charity in the way of allah yet seventeen thousand is with you 11 increase the profit would make it to 30 000 the moment allah keeps on increasing whether allah increases or not you keep on increasing the share of allah subhana wa tala the share in charity and inshallah the balance remaining with you will be a bigger amount than the previous balance the more percentage of profit you give in the way of allah your percentage reduces but your total amount increases and i can be a witness the best example is myself alhamdulillah in my earlier stages of dawa my parents and my brother supported me completely 100 percent i didn't have to think about my living but the moment i started doing my own business i have to just spend maybe a couple of days in a month a few hours a week because i'm a full-time guy i dedicated my life full time for the last man with allah and the baraka that allah gave me in business initially i started giving 25 of my profit in the way of allah then i started giving 51 percent and i kept on increasing the moment i kept on increasing my profit the percentage of profit to allah i will not tell you till what limit i i started earning millions of dollars in a year and sometimes million dollar even in a month al hamdulillah so allah subhanahu wa pressed me so the bigger percentage you give to allah your percentage becomes small but the money remaining from it is mashaallah so i request you that when you're handling your father's business see to do not break any rule of the quran or the sunnah be very honest inshallah allah will give you barka in the year after as well as dunya next question from brother kursid akbar from karnataka india allah says in the quran that if all of you from the first to the last come and worship me it will not increase in my greatness if this is the matter then why does he order us to worship him what the brother is asking that if all of you come and worship me will not increase my greatness this is not a verse of the quran there are similar verses i'll come to it later on what the brother is referring to is a hadith inside muslim word number six hadith number 6572 where a beloved partner said that allah says oh my slaves if the first of you and the last of you if all the men and if all the jinns if they were equal to the most pious person whose heart is the most pious heart in the full world if the part is equal to that party of the most pious man on the face of the earth it will not increase in my dominion that means it will make no benefit for me and allah continues oh my slaves first of you and the last of you the men and the jinn if all of you are equal to the most evil person the evilest person in the whole of humanity if all the men and equal to the most evil person it will not reduce even a bit from my dominion oh my slaves if the first of you and the last of you if the jinns and the human beings if all of you gather together on a strip and if they ask me whatever you want and if i give everything for water you want it will not reduce in my dominion the loss would not be greater than when a needle is dipped in an ocean i am recording and will repeat all this to you so that if you realize you will pray the last allah if you don't then you will be to blame from here we come to know that irrespective whether you're very pious or you worship allah it will not increase in allah's greatness or in dominion if you are very bad if you're evil it will not mean any loss to allah if you ask anything what you want and allah gives you everything yet it will not reduce in the dominion of allah it is like if you dip a needle in the ocean even that much will not be the loss in allah dominion there's a verse in the quran in surah and kabut chapter number 29 verse number 6 which says that if you strive for your work allah does not require any of the wants of any of his creations does not have the need of any of its creation allah repeats a similar message in surah chapter number 35 verse number 15 that it is you who are in need of allah allah is not in need of anyone and is free of all wants so these verses of the quran say allah doesn't require anything from his creation coming to the question then why is allah asking us to worship him allah says in not but to worship him what is the reason the reason allah subhanahu wa ta'ala wants you to worship him is not so that he will benefit it is because you will benefit and how will you benefit if you worship him see when we worship the best form of worship is salah in our salah the most important thing that you have to recite without which the salah is not complete it is surah surah fatiha consists of seven verses it is the first chapter of the glorious quran it is called as um quran the mother of the quran it is called the major quran if you read surah fatiha the first three verses it says praise be to allah the lord of the words the merciful the gracious malik the master of the day of judgment the first three verses of the quran are praising allah the most merciful the most gracious the master of the day of judgment here why are we praising allah the reason we play is because it is human psychology the moment you start praising someone you start following him for example if your mother is sick and if someone on the street a person comes and tells you do this treatment so that your mother who has got a heart attack she will be cured and there's another person who you know is the most famous heart specialist in the world he comes and tells you regarding the treatment for your mother who had a heart attack who will you follow will you follow the unknown person on the street or will you follow the advice of the heart specialist a famous heart specialist in the world but naturally you will follow the advice of the heart specialist because he's famous the moment you know that he is the person who's the best heart specialist will follow the device similarly here when you say allahu akbar allah is the greatest allah is the most wise allah is hakeem he's the most merciful we are praising allah not because it will benefit him because the moment you start praising him then surah continues it there when we says the alone we ask for him after the first three verses of praising we are telling that we only worship allah we only ask [Music] here we realized that the first three was the first chapter of the quran is praising allah then we are saying you only ask him for help and no one else and then we say show us the straight path and then the part the most important part of the salah then the full quran is the guidance of allah what we should do and what we should not do you have to use a heart you should do hajj you should fast you should not cheat you should not murder all these things so alhamdulillah the reason allah is asking us to worship him is because the reason allah is asking us to praise him if we say allah or a thousand times it will not make allah great at all it's already the greatest even if you abuse allah knows it will not make allah know allah is always the greatest he will remain the reason we praise him is because then we praise him we follow his advice and the full quran is the advice to the human being how you should lead your life so the reason allah asks us to worship him is not because we benefit him it will benefit the human beings we praise him so that we realize we have to follow one who's the greatest with the most wise with the most knowledgeable so it will benefit us it will keep us healthy it will insha allah take us to generative faith so the reason we worship him we praise him it's not for his benefit he doesn't require it it is for our benefit the next question from uttar pradesh india i was asked by a non-muslim that is considered haram in islam as it takes a person away from the remembrance of allah then even sex the recession intercourse should have been haram in islam applying the same reasoning because it also takes one away from the remembrance of allah please reply this is a very good question from ahmad that if music is around because it takes a person away from islam then maybe sex sexual intercourse should be haram because it takes a person away from the remembrance of allah let me tell you music is around because the prophet has said it's haram musical instrument one of the additional reasons is that it takes a person away from the remembrance regarding sexual intercourse depending on whom you are doing sexual intercourse with then whether sexual intercourse is haram or not will apply if you are doing sexual intercourse outside the marital bonds if you are not doing with your wife but natural and now since slavery is abolished doing sexual intercourse outside the marital relationship it is haram so surely session intercourse is haram because when you're doing it with people who are not your wife or not between the spouses it is surely haram it will take you away from women but if you are doing sexual intercourse with your wife with your legal spouse then you will follow the guidance of allah in the quran and the hadith our beloved partner said that when you are doing intercourse you do do now when you are doing you are coming closer to allah and prophet muhammad is the messenger of allah then you are remembering allah while you're doing intercourse with your wife you're praying to allah that whatever you give keep it away from the shaitaan so when you are doing intercourse with your wife it is taking you towards the last one of allah in fact doing intercourse with your wife is also charity a prophet said if you do intercourse with your wife and don't do it with someone who is outside the marathon bond even that is the father because they're following the commandments relationship with someone who's not your spouse it is haram and surely it will take you away from allah hope that answers the question i'm gonna short of time and that would be the last question i've answered and let me tell you inshallah that those questions which have not been answered i'll pick up one question and inshallah i'll give a call to one of the questioners whose question have not been answered on the whatsapp video for inshallah so don't be surprised if you hear from me and inshallah till we meet next saturday same time for this program ask dr zakir and his son till then assalamu alaikum walked"
