  "transcript": "good evening doctor sales manager from Shipping Company is the hull and Paradise are there how has a common person I believe I don't believe in any religion whereas the question that how do I know this hell and heaven how will a common man believe I don't believe in a religion brother what is the definition of religion religion is the way of life how you lead your life many people say that I don't mind I'm just a human being I'm born I will do test and error and I will know how to lead a life for example you go to a forest you are going to a forest the first time you don't know whether the fruits are poisonous or not if you start eating any fruit you may end up eating a fruit which is poisonous and you may die what do you do you ask an expert right or wrong when you get sick who do you go to brother when you are sick who do you go to why your doctor is an expert in treating sickness correct you can't say that I am a human being I will treat myself no that's what the Quran says in Surah similarly to lead a life we have to ask the expert now who is the expert who's the expert the person who created us who created us it's almighty God so we have to follow the Commandment of almighty God if you do not believe in almighty God you should listen to my video because it is the Quran God's word where I've proved logically and scientifically the excuse of Allah if you are an atheist are you an atheist brother are you an atheist pardon me are you an atheist no no not any atheist so what do you do you believe in God actually I believe in the power but fine that means we believe in God I want to call it power you want to call it Supernatural you believe in God it's like I believe something somebody you don't know the name that name is God you may call it power you may call it anything if you don't believe in God then you listen to my video because it is the Quran God's word if you don't know who that power is yet you listen to my cassette is the Quran God's word where I've proven scientifically undoubtedly existence of Allah and the Quran is the word of almighty God now coming to your question if you say about power that means you believe in religion because religion by definition according to Oxford distance religion means a belief in a supernatural controlling power power word is there that means you believe in a religion religion according to Oxford dictionary means a belief in a supernatural controlling power a personal God or gods that deserve obedience and worship that means you believe in religion you don't know the definition of religion so don't say don't believe in religion religional English word brother religion is English word if you open the Oxford dictionary it says religion means a belief in a superhuman controlling power and you believe in a power or a personal God or God that is a worship obedience to know more about that power you see my video because it is a Quran God's word now coming to your question basic question how will I prove that there is hell in heaven now if you hear my video because I said I've proved many scientific aspects in the Quran if you use science to the Quran what we come to know that whatever the Quran has said today 80 percent can be proved to be 100 correct scientifically Quran speaks about various scientific facts which we came to know recently books about astronomy it speaks about the spherical nature of the earth it speaks about the big bang it speaks about the light of the moon it's not its only reflected light it speaks about the water cycle it speaks about biology it speaks about botany speaks about zoology peaceful embryology all these things now today is the age of Science and Technology if we put this test of science to the Quran what we come to know 80 percent whatever the Quran has said is 100 percent perfectly correct the balance 20 percent is ambiguous neither right neither wrong out of that 20 person not even point zero one person has been proved to be wrong by scientific fact it is ambiguous so what my logic says when 80 is 100 correct and not even point zero one percent of the twenty percent is proved wrong so my logic says that inshallah even that twenty percent will be correct it's a logical belief I am being a medical doctor Quran speed of astronomy embryology genetics everything perfect then you ask me brother you being a doctor you believe in hell you believe in heaven you believe in Jinn you believe in life after death so my logic says inshallah even the other 20 in the Quran which science hasn't reached up to that level fans cannot prove it maybe science will prove 50 years later or 10 years later but today science hasn't reached that level so in this way I believe whatever 20 percent visance hasn't proved to be right or wrong inshallah in that will be right this is one way to prove about brother I am asking a simple question is robbing good or bad throbbing is good or bad robbing is bad bad yeah raping a girl is good or bad no no bad bad okay now I'm asking you a question logically I suppose happen to be the biggest Mafia hypothetically I am a big robber you prove to me logically and scientifically I am a very logical person I am a scientific person I am a logical person and scientific person you proved to me why robbing is bad for me and I will stop robbing only one reason you give me one good reason why robbing is bad for me and I'm stop probably it hurts others it hurts people it hurts others what different does it make to me if it hurts if I Rob if I rob a thousand real it's benefiting me I can see movie I can go to a five-star hotel what difference does it make when it hurts others does it hurt me I told you proof to me why it is bad for me not for others I am please bother about the others why is it bad for me when I'm dropping thousand if it hurts him no problem what difference does it make to me if it hurts somebody else doesn't make a difference to me I can enjoy I can see movie I can eat chicken biryani I asked you give me one logical reason why it is bad for me not why it is bad for others I am a big Mafia I'm powerful I am a scientific person logical person prove to me One Good Reason logical why robbing is bad I will stop robbing come on another try brother another try one more try why it is bad no answer no answer right right there are 20 30 reasons 100 reasons you can give you know I actually as you said the religion means the way of life not religion why robbing is bad tell me don't go to religion I'm coming to the point no not Point first tell me where opening is that it will come back to your point afterwards I'll come to your point afterwards when that is the way of life not way of life tell me why robbing is bad according to you why it is bad for me I will stop robbing up to me you know it hurts others so but what difference does it make to me when her father has hurt me of course you know it's bad for me not why it is bad for others once we come to the says okay once you come to her to face them I'm facing them I'm facing them what is bad for me the society won't respect us what difference does it make with the respect or not I can eat chicken biryani I can go and see a movie I can go to a five-star hotel what difference does it make to view Society respects or not imagine someone respects Society the poor person doesn't have food to eat he'll be happy no you require food to eat or not you require food to survive only Society respect in the person is starving to death you know in India thousands of people are starving to death what difference does it make I must give me one good reason why robbing is badass top robbing why it is bad for me can anyone else help him out why robbing is bad [Music] why robbing is bad there are various answers I'll help you out you may say police will catch you good logical reason police will come and get you correct right or wrong get it ah but you didn't give the I'm helping you out but brother I told you I'm a powerful Mafia the police is in my pocket ministers are in my pocket big Mafia see all the top Mafia the police in the pocket dial on my payroll the police is on my payroll what will they catch me small rubber like you should not drop you'll get arrested I am up top Mafia the police is on my payroll even the ministers or my payroll they're in my pocket so small robber like you should not rob Big Mafia like me can drop another reason I'll help you out maybe somebody will come and rob you yes no one cannot be because our 100 bodyguard all of them heading behind the stage bodyguards small robber robs somebody will rob him no one can drop me because I've got bodyguards hundreds of bodyguard with ak-47. so logically you cannot prove at all why robbing is bad with all your science and technology you cannot prove robbing is bad so shall I take it in that way you know it is to make people fear that you know if you do the wrong things then when you die what wrong thing where is robbing wrongful to prove it is wrong nah is wrong when you prove robbing is wrong then you can say don't do wrong thing therefore what is good what is right you require a Creator to tell you do you require a doctor to tell you what food is good what food is bad this fruit is poisonous this is healthy for you apple is healthy for you wild berries are poisonous for you a doctor tells you there's no better doctor than Allah logically speaking logically speaking brother that Mafia has got bodyguards no one can harm him and believe me there are many examples he dies a very comfortable death but I am asking a simple question now brother don't you think that there should be Justice brother yes Justice someone should punish him or not Allah is there but the law cannot punish every human being here why there are many mafias in Italy there are many Underworld people in India and the law can't do anything to them but the law is in their pocket but yet you as a common man don't you think you should be punished raping is good or bad there are many people who rape they rape the girls no nothing the Lord cannot catch them so don't you think he should be punished yes or no but there are many people you see in this world who are big Mafia that are comfortable that they are rich they are millionaires there should be some justice the reply is given by Creator Imran chapter number three verse number 185 Allah says every soul shall ever taste of death but the final recompense will be on the day of judgment this life is the chapters of deception if there is no life after death this life is of that the total Justice would be on the day of judgment our great almighty God will give Justice I tell the person fine you may be a big robber for example you are that Mafia now I am a Muslim no one can harm you police in your pocket then ask you justice it required yes if someone drops you no one cannot be agree but don't you feel they should be Justice there are many robbers there are many evils there are many criminals who go scot-free unless there is life after death you cannot prove robbing is bad you cannot prove raping is bad unless there's life after death no Humanity no book on Humanity no Mother Teresa no Mahatma Gandhi can prove robbing is bad without the concept of life after death because I'm asking you a question Hitler history tells us Hitler incinated six million Jews how many Jews suppose the law catches Hitler what punishment can you give Hitler so that you can compensate for he has burned 6 million Jews alive can you give him any punishment brother we have to put him in jail till his life okay will it be equivalent to burning 6 million Jews is burning better off putting in jail better it's burning is of course so maximum you can do is burn in my life but that will be equal to one out of 6 million what about the remaining 5 million 999 999 people what about that what Justice is your lord going to do but the Quran says chapter number four verse number 56 as to those who reject our signs we shall cause them in the Hellfire and as often as the Skins are roasted we shall give them fresh skin so that they shall feel the pain if Hitler tell the Six Million Jews Allah says he can put him into Hell Fire and give him fresh skin again six million times not here in the year after in the hell so only where I can prevent Hitler from Kelly 6 million Jews is tell him that here you kill six million Jews Allah will burn you 12 million times in the year after you can't give him that thing here what do you realize without the concept of hell and heaven you cannot prove robbing is bad you cannot prove raping is bad that's the reason our great almighty God who has created the human beings he tells us what is good what is bad for us and he tells us the rules and regulations this is called as religion so first you have to find out which book is the authentic book which has been revealed by this almighty God and when you do research you will come to it that is the Quran all the scriptures speak about almighty God and all these scriptures they point out to the last and final Revelation the Quran and last and find messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him hope that answers the question thanks"
