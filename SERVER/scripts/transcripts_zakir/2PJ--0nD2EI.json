  "title": "Why do Non Muslim Scientists Accept Science but do not Accept the Qur’an which Speaks about Science?",
  "transcript": "i am ibrahim uh i am from bangladesh \nand uh now i the student of unimap   nowadays um non-muslim scientists scientists \nnon-muslim scholars even non-muslim educated   people knows the truth that there is a significant \nuh relationship between modern science and quran   but my question is they accept science \nbut not except quran and islam why brothers the question that the people now know \nthe relationship between quran and science   they accept signs why they don't accept quran \ni don't think so everyone knows many know   not every scientist knows about the relationship \nof quran and science many know out of those who   know some of them they are guided to the truth \nand they accept islam like the names i took   i told you about the quran \naccepted islam and there are   hundreds of scientists accepted islam now many \na time when you come to know it's the truth   you may agree with the truth but yet you \nmay not follow because you may be worried   what will society tell me if i change \nmy religion what will my parent tell   me what will my wife tell me so the societal \npressure prevents him from accepting the truth so once you know it's the truth you have to accept \nit but everyone doesn't accept the truth so this   is a test after hearing the lecture if a person \nis a non-muslim and if he's a student of science   he has to do research what kind of book is this \ntalking about astronomy talking about what cycle   talking about geology about zoology about biology \nabout botany about embryology about fingerprinting   method you can go on and on so a person who's \nreally a seeker of truth and a truthful person   he will be guided to truth but many people aren't \nbothered okay now if i accept islam then i'll have   to stop drinking alcohol who wants to accept \nislam if i accept islam then i cannot flood   i cannot do zina i cannot do adultery if i \naccept islam i have to pray five times today   so these things may stop them from accepting \nthe truth but our job as muslim is to convey   the message to non-muslims whether they accept or \nnot at the hands of allah we as muslims have to   convey the message if they accept alhamdulillah \ndon't accept no problem we can't force anyone   but at least on the day of judgment we can give \nshahadat on the day of judgment i told my friend   therefore on the day of judgement no no \nnon-muslim will ever complain to allah   that why am i non-muslim they will only say \ngive us one more chance allah says it's too late   so this world is a test for the hereafter   this world is the test for thereafter once \nyou know the third you have to accept it   i tell anyone if anyone proves to me a religion \nbetter than islam i will convert today ah kafir i know my religion alhamdulillah i know my islam i was a muslim until the age of 20 because \nmy father was a muslim after that i studied   many religions i am a student of comparative \nuniverse and i say that anyone can prove to me   a religion brother islam anyone shows me a book \nbetter than the quran i will change my religion right or wrong you don't say that because \nyou are not a student of comparative religion   i am a friend of compass \nreligion i've read the scriptures so that's the reason but those whose hearts \nare on truth when they hear and you find   alhamdulillah every day thousands accepting \nthousands only because of peace tv hundreds for the people to come on the straight path \nhope that answers the question thank you   people love you so much thank you you"
