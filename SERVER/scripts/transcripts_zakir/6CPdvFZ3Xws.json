  "title": "Is not God Unfair to One who Dies Earlier as he has less Time to do Good Deeds â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "question from younus from holland i have watched almost all your videos and debates i am a big fan of you and inshallah one day i will become like you inshallah inshallah better than me someone dies at the age of 20 and while some at the age of 60 is it not unfair for the one who died at 20 because the one who died at 60 had more time to receive hassanath it's a good question brother that if there are two people one person dies at the age of 20 one person died at the age of 60 isn't it unfair for the person who died at the age of 20 that he had less chances of doing good deeds and getting hasanah the same thing can be posed in another way that isn't it unfair for the person at the age of 60 that he died after so many years he was distracted by the devil for a longer time by the shaitan and had more time of doing evil as compared to the person who died at the age of 20 whether it depends upon the perspective how you're looking at it whether that the age of 20 or 60 i do agree with you there are chances of doing good deeds if you live longer but there are chances of doing bad needs also you may not know that the person at the age of 20 was very good on the straight path later on in divorce and at the end of 60 he starts doing things which again the sharia started with shirk and goes so it is not depending upon how long you live it is how well you live is important when you have an examination you study for the full year some papers only for one hour and the full year's test is taken by the teacher in one hour some examination people are for three hours some my examination people are two parts part one three yes part two three hours irrespective of that depending upon the type of question asked the judgment is given for the full year similarly whether you live for 20 years or 60 years allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has ilmegal he has knowledge of the future for him to test a person he can test even in one minute what you cannot test in maybe 80 years he can test in one minute well that's very easy so according to me it doesn't make a difference whether the test was for 20 years or for 60 years and it does not advantage need the disadvantage it is one type of a test so based on what you have how well you need is important rather than the time so it is not unfair at all it is not unjust at all it is pros and cons depends upon it and is the best to judge he's the most wise he knows how to judge and on the day of judgement no human being will ever complain to allah do unjust they'll only say that please forgive us allah will say it's too late so the justice of allah's mantra is so accurate allah says in the quran surah nisa chapter 4 40 allah is not unjust in the least degree hope that answers the question"
