  "transcript": "the next question poses by junaid india but living in kuwait if a medical doctor gives some medical advice which is contrary to the advice from our prophet muhammad peace be upon him what will we have to do i ask this question because my wife she's pregnant has been advised by the gynecologist to lay down by directing towards her left side in order for the baby to have blood circulation but i heard that in islam sleeping by pointing towards our right side sunnah could you please educate me sir as far as if a doctor gives you advice which is contrary to the teachings of islam teachings of allah or teaching of the prophet what should you do basically in islam there are five categories of things one is which is first which is compulsory one which is mustabe as we say as sunnah which is recommended the third is muba that is permissible optional and the fourth is makru that is discouraged and the fifth is haram which is prohibited when you do what is further if you do it you get plus point if you don't do it you get negative points in the mustap in the sunnah which is n correct if you do it you get plus points if you don't do it you get no negative points moba is permissible optional whether you do it or you don't do it there's no negative there are no positive points as far as macro is concerned which is discouraged if you don't do it you get positive points if you do it you get no negative points and the last is haram if you don't do it you get positive point if you do it then you get negative points if a doctor gives you advice and tells you to do something which is first it is good suppose the doctor tells you fast forward complete month and it's ramadan either do they have to fast the doctor tells you or not the doctor tells you something which is first but the doctor tells you not you have to do it if doctor tells you something which is a sunnah or which is most perhaps for some doctor tells you sit and drink water it is good for your health and you sit and drink water whether the doctor tells you or not sunnah and the muslim should do it as far as possible so there's no problem at all if doctor tells you something which is mubara which is permissible optional no harm if the doctor is an expert as long as the doctor is qualified follow it now the basic precaution comes in the last two sections if the doctor tells you to do something which is makru or something which is haram if the doctor tells you to do something which is makru you have to first analyze why is the doctor telling you and if the doctor is telling you something which is not recommended by the prophet it is not encouraged you have to do a research and see what the doctor is telling correctly and you follow it because if you do something which is makuru you don't get negative points if you don't do it you get positive points but the quran at the same time tells you first chapter number 21 verse number seven and surah chapter number 16 verse 43 that as the person is knowledgeable so if a doctor is a knowledgeable person you have to confirm that he is a good qualified doctor he is not a quack and not just telling something which is out of the way there is no harm in doing what the doctor tells you even though it is makarov if doctor tells you something which is haram then you have to weigh the pros and cons that is it something which is life-threatening for example if the doctor tells you that take this alcohol into the only medicine that will save your life having alcohol is haram but it's the only medicine that can save your life so what you have to do you have to do little research that what the doctor is telling is it really true if the doctor is telling you something which is generally haram anything which is haram but because the life is in ninja automatically that becomes halal for that time like allah says in the quran in no less than four different places in surah bakra chapter 2 verse number 173 in surah maidah chapter 5 verse number 3 in surah nahal chapter 16 115 and surah anam chapter number 6 verse number 145 that if unwillingly you disobey allah then allah is after dead meat blood the flesh of swine and any food then allah's name is taken these four things are prohibited but the worst continues if unwillingly if you disobey allah as a requirement then allah is against you for example if you go in a boat and there is no food and you have been out at the sea for several days and the only food available is pork is haram but that time to save your life having pork becomes permitted because you're going to save your life but the moment you come to sure okay becomes prohibited so similarly in this situation the doctor tells you that alcohol is the only medicine that can save you you have to research if the doctor what he's saying is right is there any other alternative if there is an alternative for example the homopathy medicine contains alcohol but homebody medicine is not the only medicine that can cure you so if you go out of the way and have mumbai medicine it is not islamic because most of the homepage medicine contain alcohol suppose if you have cough and if the cost syrup contains alcohol you should not have that there are other alternatives if you're feeling cold and doctor tells you have alcohol have beer beer keeps you warm have honey honey will keep you more warm so if there is an alternative for the thing requested by the doctor to the alternative if there is no alternative and that the only thing that can save your life so if in the situation of life and death or detrimental point it becomes permitted for you quran has given the permission if the doctor is telling you something to do which is mahru then do your research and weigh the pros and cons is the treatment really required ask me something which is against the sunnah would not get a blessing based on that if you do something which is makuru it's not a sin at all it is permitted in this case a prophet did tell the muslims that when you sleep you sleep on the right side and today scientifically we know that when we sleep on the right side the right lung is larger than the left lung if we sleep on the left side there is pressure of the lungs on the heart so if we sleep on the right side it is preferable it is better scientifically to sleep on the right side and our prophet has recommended that now in the situation where a lady is pregnant what happens that the liver is on the right side so if a lady sleeps on the right side there is pressure of the liver on the uterus and there is pressure on the baby so the doctors many a time when required they recommend the pregnant woman to sleep on the left side so that the pressure of the liver is not down the uterus and that is beneficial for the baby and increases the blood circulation so in such cases when there is a requirement and the doctor says sleep on your left side it is not haram at all it is sunnah to sleep on the right to sleep on the left side is makru but it is permitted especially if it's going to be beneficial for the baby and if it's a requirement then at that moment at least till the baby has problem or till you deliver sleeping on the left side is preferable then you sleep on the right side we have to weigh the pros and cons and then take the decision hope that answers the question"
