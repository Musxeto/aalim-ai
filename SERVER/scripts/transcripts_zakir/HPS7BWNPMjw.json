  "title": "Was Guru Nanak a Muslim? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "my name is gagan sethi i'm a job seeker in my religion uh as as you know that guru nanak is the founder of our religion is he a muslim that's my question our young brother who is a sikh comes from india he says that he's a sikh and the founder of his religion is guru nanak he asked me the question was guru nanak muslim or not brother muslim is an arabic word which means a person who submits his will to almighty god anyone who submits his will to almighty god he's a muslim now since i did not meet guru nanak personally i cannot say definitely whether he is a muslim or not but i have read the guru granth sahib that is the sacred scripture of the sikh and sikhism is a religion which believes in 10 gurus the first who's the founder is and the last is guru gobind side brother asked me the question do i consider guru nanak to be a muslim if i read the guru granth sahib if i read the first verse first volume first verse is known as japuji of guru granth sahib the first volume first verse is called as japuji it says that almighty god is true he is the creator he is free from fear and want he's self-existing he's eternal he's great and he's compassionate now based on this it is somewhat similar to the verse of the quran of surah class the absolute and eternal is he begets not noise begotten there's nothing like him again if you read in sikhism sikhism is a religion which is a monotheistic religion and it caused almighty god as a komkara in unmanifest form and manifest form is called as omkara and there are various attributes he given to almighty god in the guru granth sahib in sikhism almighty god is also called as akal eternal he's called as khartar the creator he's called a sahib lord he's called as parvati the cherisher he's called as raheem the beneficent he's called as kareem the benevolent he's called as wahi guru the one true god now based on these readings of guru granth sahib based on these i think that guru nanak was a muslim muslim means a person who submits the will to almighty god but what the scholars say that this sikhism is religion that emerged in the latter part of the 15th century in the land of punjab in the land of the fire world and scholars say it's an amalgamation of islam and hinduism that's what scholars say that based on these verses guru nanak believed in one god he believed that god was begotten he had no images he was all powerful i personally have not read about guru nanak where they believed in prophet muhammad peace be upon him or not i don't know personally personally i haven't met him but based on these teachings it seems to be that he is a muslim seems to be whether he was not i don't know but unfortunately as time passes there is corruption in it like if you ask me was jesus christ a muslim undoubtedly jesus christ peace be upon him for the muslim why quran says that imran chapter number three verse number 52 that is a muslim but there's no verse in the quran saying guru nanak will be a muslim so based on the verse but if i read the bible if i read verses of the bible what jesus christ says it proves that he's a muslim but there are other interpolation in the bible there are concoction in the bible which undoubtedly cannot be the word of god so i cannot attribute this to jesus christ peace be upon him but if i check what is right whether what the bible says because quran says i believe islam was a muslim abraham islam was a muslim imran chapter 3 verse 67 he was not a jew or a christian you are a muslim so because the quran clarifies i've got no doubt as far as guru nanak is concerned because quran does not clarify but seeing the verses i consider you maybe he was a muslim but what you have to realize later on as i said there was corruption in the bible even here what we find that people have started worshipping the guru grantham guru nanak didn't say have to worship the guru grantham they even have if you go to the sikh temple other things which are deviations so based on these deviations i cannot say that they're muslims but go back to your scripture if you go back to a scripture and believe in almighty god who's not begotten who's one who has got no images and worship him alone then you will go back to the original faith that is islam hope that answers the question"
