  "transcript": "today which muslims in the world are persecuted the maximum can you guess muslims in which part of the world are persecuted the maximum can you guess from where myanmar palestine according to me today [Music] maximum that muslims have been prosecuted is in vigor singapore yes muslims are being persecuted in myanmar a lot in palestine a lot but in china it is on different levels at least in palestine the muslims can praise allah correct they can say allah they can fast they can read the quran they can get the content but in the heart they are being persuaded without doubt but in china they are systematically trying to exterminate them if you know history in the middle part of the 20th century you know a lot of part of turkey was taken over by the countries some part was taken by russia and this part singhan was taken over by china they actually turkish people eastern turkestan and they made it part of china illegally and many countries are doing that you can easily make out the difference you can look at their face and tell them these are not chinese but but allah wa ta'ala has blessed that land with rich minerals it has got wealth so china is trying its level best to see to it that muslims are exterminated from there and they started in 2015 according to reports it wasn't known to the world it came out some of the human rights organization came to know in 2016 and it came out in the media in 2017 it started coming out became more popular in 2018 what do they do there are two types of muslims in china one is the vegan muslims the other is the han muslim the han muslim the chinese muslim they have problem but very less compared to the weaker muslims because the haan muslim look like chinese they have problems but compared to the ugar muslims very little the ugar muslim nowadays most of them cannot even offer salah they are not allowed to fast they are forced to have food during ramadan many are forced to have alcohol they aren't allowed to learn arabic and if they don't listen to the authorities they are put into concentration camps the chinese government says this is re-education re-education many of the ego muslims in these concentration camps they are tortured they harassed they asked to give up the religion they asked to follow communism and those that are outside they are being tracked by cameras by face recognition and this has been leaked by the human organization almost all of them they are non-muslim organization so much so that one month before in july there were 22 countries that wrote a letter to un objecting on the human rights violation against the weaker muslim in china 22 countries there are about 195 countries in the u.n 22 countries wrote a letter to you and saying there is human rights violation in china against the weaker muslims and do you know out of these 22 countries there was not a single muslim country which objected all of them were non-muslim country mostly european country isn't it a shame there are about 56 countries in the world 20 more than 25 percent of the countries in the world they have majority muslims it were 22 non-muslim countries who objected to the violation of human rights in ukraine and [Music] when interviews were taken of some of the heads of states and some did say that muslims are weak it will not benefit as much to object to tell you the fact they may be right what they're doing if you did not object and kept quiet they may be using the rule of the sharia let a small loss take place to prevent a big loss the sharia gives you permission in islam it's for fool that let a small loss take place to prevent a big loss if you think by objecting you will not get any benefit but there may be retaliation there may be problem in your country and if you do not take the best or the second best option of stopping with the hand or stopping with the tongue you remain silent this if the situation is like that really that if you object there may be retaliation and if you take the decision of keeping quiet sharia gives you permission that among the 56 countries no one at the guts but 22 non-muslim country had the guts here the story doesn't end the story which is really disheartening is few days later 37 countries give a letter to un saying what the chinese government is doing is correct they are not torturing the muslims they are not violating human rights they are educating them they are doing anti-terrorism 37 countries out of these 37 countries 15 countries were muslim countries more than 40 percent of the countries which supported china saying that what you are doing is right against the muslims what are touching them is correct it is anti-terrorism they were muslims alhamdulillah malaysia wasn't one of them [Applause] i don't want to take the names of the country which gave a letter because i want to wake up the muslims by allah's grace i meet the heads of most of these countries whenever i meet the head of state my job as a dahi is to convey the message of allah whether they follow or not it's in their hand i don't want to take the name because i don't want to embarrass him but my request to the heads of states of this country that our beloved prophet said if any muslim is in problem it is like if one part of the body is in problem the all the rest part all the cells go to defend it this is the ummah if any muslim he may be any other part of the world he is a muslim he is your brother in faith you have to support him how can you support the enemies of islam just for a small benefit this is not permitted in the sharia keeping quite accepted we are weak you are keeping quiet you may be the lowest level of moment but yet you're a moment but supporting a kafir who is killing your muslim brothers and you're supporting them what is happening to our scholars i am not a scholar i am a dhahi the job of adai is to listen to listen from the scholar and convert to the masses the scholar may be very intelligent knows islam the job of adai is to make it simple and convert to the mass i am not a scholar and i told this two days ago and i'm telling it again that please don't exchange what are you doing for a seat in this world for power in this world for wealth in this world you are cheering you are exchanging your seat in jannah and you are purchasing your seat in hell fire you are a very bad businessman the jannah is the true happiness and i gave the details in the first talk i gave in clan than on the 7th of august day for yesterday what's happening to the muslim ummah we are deteriorating there was a time when the muslims were on top of the world when the quran was revealed the muslims were looked down upon it was called as the days of the ignorance the arabs did the tawa from the kaaba naked they were jahil people allah reveals the quran and make them the torchbearer of the world the muslims became on top of the world europeans called from the 8th to the 12th century dark ages dark for them not for us the advancement that the muslims made in science and technology it is phenomenal we were on top of the world today muslims and large number more than 25 percent of the world population are muslims we are about 2 billion muslims but we are looked down upon we are abused we are criticized we cannot do anything why because that time at the time of the sahabas of the khalfa rashid muslims were close to the quran and sunnah today we are far away from the quran in sunnah at that time we didn't have riches we were poor but we are the deen with us today the muslims are the richest in the world we have the black gold but we are looked down upon why because we are away from the quran and sunnah i request my muslim brothers all over the world this
