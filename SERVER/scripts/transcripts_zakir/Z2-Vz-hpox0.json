  "transcript": "good morning ladies and gentlemen um welcome to this very short video I just really want to tell you guys what's really happening with me here first I have to begin with my health uh since I came here I have a little bit filling bad like I mean I've not been feeling well and there are reasons for that uh my doctor told me that I am going to apparently survive traveling to Qatar and then returning without going to the hospital but I think oh that was not the case I felt you some few days ago and I went to the hospital uh where I received or some treatments uh one thing that really happened was that I never planned about you know going to the hospital and because I do not have a Qatar ID I came in here to the higher card I have to pay through my nose to offset the hospital bill well it's really not easy for me um it's it's difficult so I was really on my way going out or applying to travel out of guitar because I I would have given up trying my best to see Dr zika and like now there are three things I did when I came into this city first I went to the Islamic Center hoping that they can offer me virtual advice on how to meet Dr Zaki and I when they told me there was not um helpful I was meant to understand that there was no need of seeing doctors that can like or meeting him then all of the money I spent coming to Qatar to fulfill my dream I thought actually went down drain I started to blend myself so I also went to the Malaysian Embassy here in Qatar in Doha and it was a successful as well you know they were saying that security details surrounded him might not allow him to you know see me or Dare about also went to the qataria Embassy or Ministry itself to ask questions and tell them my situation but the same thing keep going on I hope it's not possible to sing so I got my man off after finishing from the hospital I said okay let me go back to my city and I booked my flight tickets because the other one was booked the 31st of December and you know what it means I have to stay until that time to be able to access that ticket and I went back she asked them to bring it closer like make it earlier that I wanted to travel out of the country they asked me to pay about 6 300 real that's about two thousand dollars that they're about you know so it was so much for me because I don't have this type of money in my account so I talked to them so I booked a new ticket and I wanted to travel yesterday was a day I was supposed to leave this country and I was the sitting on my couch thinking about what to do especially the financial part of everything and I was surprised I got a message from the son of Dr zakira Knight first I thought it was a scam you know some of this uh very bad messages that people sent knowing your challenges especially when I asked your guys to help me come to Qatar I got some fake messages that never replied to me despite my challenges so I reply to the message because I never want to like judge the person who sent the message or said they sent me your number so that I can be able to reach you directly so he sent his number and I called him and to my greatest surprise he was the son of Dr Zakir Mike honestly it was a very great moment because I never believed that dreams can come through maybe have really tried the best to see Dr zakena bet with our success I was very happy elated you know what he asked their driver to come pick me up from the free zone where I resided and bring me to this very large a beautiful place then asked me to stay here and promise to even help me with my flight ticket invest a problem with it in fact I never told you guys that initially the message the email contained information about helping me to fly into Qatar because he I I don't think he knew I was already in Qatar he was telling me about helping me get a visa and fly into Qatar to see Dr Zakir Mike you know those are people who really understand people's dream and really understand the power of someone dreaming that it's possible anything is possible provided Allah has decreed it for you and that's my desire and I think Allah has actually made it come to pass well I think everybody I thank all of you who have been praying for me because I know your prayers are part of the reason why things are happening this way so I thank all of you for your prayers I think those who donated for my journey I especially thank the mitsuhito and a couple of other guys like Lieberman who you know out of their generosity assured that I am here today I also want to get one or two doctors again for allowing me to see him and fulfill my dream take my shahada with him it's really an amazing fit honestly I respect and ask God to keep him alive for us to give him more Health to give him more wealth you know bless his children bless his family and bless the entire Muslim Umar thank you so much guys I'm going to be seeing Dr zakarnak today thank you for watching"
