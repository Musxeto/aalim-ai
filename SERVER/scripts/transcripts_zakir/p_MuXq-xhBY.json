  "title": "A Christian is Trying to Prove Polytheism from the Quran - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "can I greet all the dignitaries who have graced this occasion uh good afternoon Dr Zakir Nik I greet my fellow student I'm a 300 level student of mass communication Nal State University Ki my name's AOS yakubu um in the course of your sermon Dr Zak what's your name what's your name brother my names are Aang yaku yak yes sir yes are you a Muslim or a Christian I'm a Christian okay yes brother continue um in the course of your sermon you gave the concept of God in different uh religion which Islam is one of them which you say Islam believe in Ted which means Islam believe in one God and in many verses in Quran you uh see that when God is speaking he used the pronouns of we we even when he was creating like in Quran chapter 95:4 he said that we created man in the bir design he used that uh pronoun as in we uh which means that it is not only one it was not only one Divine being that was speaking which means there are he was with other beings you understand and I understand your question very well I'll give the reply brother yakob yes sir I know Christian are called Jacob first time I'm meeting a Christian called yakob half Muslim already inshallah we pray to Allah to give you you already changed from Jacob to yub now from a false Christian to a true Christian inshallah brother yakub has asked a question that the Quran says V the Arabic word he wanted to tell is nahu we the Arabic word is nahu which means we so when the Quran refers to we doesn't it mean more than one God so even the Quran talks about multiple gods that's your question let me remind you brother yakub do you know English well yes do you know in English language there are two types of plural one is a plural of number if there are more than one we say we one is the plural of respect when the Queen of England speaks she says V when the royal family when the have you heard the Queen of England speaking or the king of England Prince King Charles not he will not say I he will say we even in Udu Udu there is plural of number plural of respect when someone of the royal family he'll not say my he'll say h v so anyone from the Royal Family when they speak in in most of the languages whether it be English whether it be Udu whether it be other languages most of the languages there are two types of plural one is plural of number and the other is plural of respect so if you have not heard the Queen of England speaking or the king of England speaking they say V they are one how many King of England do you have one but he says we so this is the language if you don't know language what can I do the same thing in Arabic in Arabic when Allah says n when Allah is saying we no Arab will say there are two gods or three Gods because the Arab know Arabic Arab know Arabic you know English so you should understand that this is also Royal plural hope the answer the question can I say something have you understood the answer I understand what you're saying so do you understand the Quran refers to we as a royal P one single correct yes but I want to say something if you have a next question no problem for say okay thank you I've understood the first answer then you can go to the next question unless you don't say understood the first question I will not allow you to ask the next question I understand very good good but I want to now you can ask the next question um uh like during the creation when Allah is creating the Earth because sorry during the creation yes when Allah is creating the Earth he used the just like we say he used we like creation it is only God that is capable of creating other things so why didn't he use that I created man in the best design instead of using that because he's the only one I told you the answer yet you're asking same answer why did Allah not say I that's Allah's wish when King Charles is speaking sometimes he says I sometimes he says V that his prerogative who am I to interfere are you God God can call sometimes he calls I sometimes he calls V that is the beauty why did he that that's God correct I'm I'm I'm a doctor correct sometime people call me sh Zak no problem sometime people call me akak brother Zak no problem sometime people call me doctor Zak oh why don't you call him doctor always I have no problem why do you have a problem do you understand yes I'm a doctor medical doctor and a PhD doctor both correct now when someone calls me shake Zak no problem someone called me no problem brother no problem so when Allah want sometimes he uses V sometimes use that so what's your problem so now now you half Muslim do you believe there's one God now do you believe there's one God I believe there is God is uh one in being and three in person that's what I believe because I'm a Christian you you believe in Trinity yes sir can you point out one verse in the Bible which speaks about Trinity the Trinity doesn't doesn't exist in the Bible do you know that the word Trinity doesn't exist in the Bible but but the word Trinity is there in the Quran do you know that do you know that that the word Trinity doesn't exist in the Bible you give me reference I will agree tell me one place where the Bible says the word Trinity what the Quran says even though there is not the word Trinity in the Bible this is the problem you don't follow the Bible I follow Bible but that doesn't I follow Bible more than you that's the reason I said brother yakob therefore I said I'm more Christian than you because I follow Bible more than what you follow okay you let let me educate you let me educate you the Bible doesn't talk about Trinity Quran talks Quran says in Sur chapter 4 verse number 171 don't say trity stop it's better for you Quran is telling you don't say trinity the word Trinity in the Quran stop it it's better for you Quran repeats the message in chapter number 5 verse number 53 they are doing kuur they are blaspheming those who say God is one Trinity but why is it that me is not mentioned in the finish is not me do you want to learn about the Bible or not you are not telling me anything I'm a Christian Christian not following Bible I'm teaching out the Bible no want to listen that means you're interested in becoming a better Christian correct when someone is talking to you about the Bible you want to keep this is the problem can I say that mean you programmed to create problem correct can I say something you know you cannot say okay you cannot say because I want to educate you you mentioned you are saying I believe in it something which the Bible doesn't say so how come you said you a Christian you mentioned but can you give me one verse from the Quran that mention so that I just want to know say that one verse chapter number 112 verse number one is Allah one and only what is the problem but you didn't mention when you are reting yes it is I had he just he didn't mention the in that verse that he CAU it that's I'm telling you the word I mean the word the word the worded is not in the Quran the worded it is not in the Quran can you give me from the word vah if I say V is the Arabic word coming from the root word v means believing in unification the word in the Quran if you don't know Arabic words you have heard from some Christian Miss thing so it is not repeating the word in the Quran you you don't know you don't know Arabic that's your problem I'm still insisting there is not the word I'm telling you it is there you know Arabic you don't know Arabic the word is there in the Quran V is the origination of the worded meaning to unite to unify to consolidate now coming to your question of Trinity the one verse in the Bible which doesn't say trinity but some very close close to Trinity a first Epistle of John chapter number five verse number 7 for there are three that be record in heaven the Father the Holy Ghost and the word and these three are one first Epistle of John chapter number five verse number 7 for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the Holy Ghost and the word and these three are one this is the closest but do you know according to the scholars of Christianity even this verse is a fabrication so in the revised Standard Version this verse first Epistle of John chapter number five verse number s has been removed from the Bible as a fabrication as a concoction as the interpolation by whom not by by Muslims not by Hindus by tidu Scholars of the highest Eminence backed by 50 different corporate denominations if you read the RSV Bible revised Standard Version of the Bible this verse has been thrown out from the Bible because Jesus Christ peace be upon when you are last Jesus Christ peace be upon early mentioned in the Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 28 my father is greater than I Gospel of John chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than All gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 I cast out Devil with the spirit of God Gospel of Luke chapter number 11 verse number 20 I with the Finger of God cast out devil Gospel of John chapter number five verse number 30 I can of my own self do nothing as here I judge and my judgment is just for I seek not my will but the will of my father he never claimed divinity when he was asked which is the first of the Commandment it's mentioned in the gospel of Mark chapter number 12 verse number 29 isra the Lord our God is one God"
