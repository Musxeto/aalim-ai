  "transcript": "yet again a demonstration of the balance in Islam alhamdulillah next question uh what is the ruling for drinking whilst a person may be standing um in Islam there are no less than six Hadith only in say Muslim which forbid a Muslim from drinking well standing aboved Prophet M wasallam said it's mentioned in say Muslim volume number three in the book of drinks Hadith number 5017 the prophet disapproved drinking while standing say Muslim volume number three book of drinks Hadith number 5018 the prophet forbid a person from drinking while he standing it's further mentioned in s Muslim volume number three in the book of drinks Hadith number five 020 the prophet warned from drinking while standing it's also mentioned in s Muslim volume number three in the book of drinks Hadith number 5022 the Beloved Prophet said None Shall drink while standing so all these Hadith that disapprove of a person from drinking while standing immediately the next five Hadith s Muslim volume number three book of drinks Hadith number 5023 to 5027 the next five Hadith say that the prophet drank zumzum water while standing and also mentioned in s bukari volume number two in the book of Haj Hadith number 1637 the Beloved Prophet malli wasam it says that he drank zumzum water while standing So based on this Hadith all the scholarly agree that drinking while sitting is must and you can stand and drink only when you have zamzam water this is what some of the scholars they have given the ruling but there are various other Hadith which also show that besides zum water the prophet even dry the normal water while standing it's mentioned in s bukari volume number seven in the book of drinks Hadith number 5615 it says that Ali be pleased with him he walked towards the courtyard of a mosque and he drank water wise in and he said I know that many people think it is disapproved it's Mak it's disliked for a person to drink while standing but I've seen the prophet drink while standing the way I'm drinking now and further it's mentioned in the Hadith of mus Ahmed volume number one Hadith number 797 which says that Ali pleased with him that once he was drinking while standing and the people looked at him and they stared at him and he said that why are you looking at me I'm doing what the prophet did I drink while standing because I've seen the prophet drink while standing I also sit while drinking because I've seen the prophet sit and drink and it's mentioned in the Hadith ofi Hadith number 1881 that Omar may Allah be pleased with him he said that he along with the prophet in the company of the prophet he many a Time used to eat while walking and to drink while standing So based on this Hadi we come to know the major of the scholars they agree that sitting and drinking is must is the act which is preferred because it is a commandment of the Prophet as I mentioned earlier whenever a commandment and action of the Prophet contradicts the Commandment carries more weight because commandment is the normal ruling an action maybe there was a requirement it was urgency whatever it is so the must is to sit and drink but because the prophet even sometimes stood and drank standing and drinking is also L but comes in the category of makru that is it is detestable you'll not get any punishment but you can stand and drink because the prophet also stood and drank so as I mentioned earlier that it was a need therefore standing and drinking is not Haram some people have misconception that standing and drinking is Haram so it's not Haram it's maku it's preferred to sit and drink"
