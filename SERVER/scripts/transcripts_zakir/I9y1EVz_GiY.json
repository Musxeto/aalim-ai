  "title": "Is Suicide Under any Circumstances Justified in Islam? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "under any circumstances justified in Islam without the question that is suicide under any circumstances justified in Islam my counter question what do you mean by Suicide so you send me the person wants to end his life and most of the cases suicide per se is the person who's Fed Up of life he has got so many problems you know he doesn't have money or I've gone in loss of business whatever and then he ends his life this Islam ending your life purposely because of troubles in this world is Haram but on the other hand you say that I want to fight for that enemies effort again the prophet and we say I'm going we know that we are a small number we have 300 they are thousand three ten more the chances in normal terminology so that type why now to fight for the and while doing that I'm ready to die that's a different question so you'll become a master the question of suicide per se you should Define what does it mean and I know that your reference may be in contact to Suicide bombing foreign that if you kill any human being unless it be for murder or for kidding Mischief in the land it is as though you have killed whole of humanity and if you save any one human being it is saved the whole of nation so killing and human being unless it before murder or for creating Mischief it is Haram but now under circumstance if you analyzed what they did if you call it modern terminology it's called as suicide so what we have to realize that individual person taking a research the scholars are divided some group of Scholars say that under any circumstance a suicide bombing is Haram flashes all these three great stalwarts who expired recently all of them say that suicide bombing suicide killing under any circumstances Haram but there are other Scholars like Sheikh Salman one of the great Scholars of this time he says that if under normal circumstances it's Haram but if the situation demands like in Palestine every day they have been killed and thousands are being killed throughout the year so it is rather that they have to fight yourself defense and if they know that they use an attack in which the chance of dying are there and if they nearly cause the damage to the opponent I have a last resort with guidance from a scholar who has not that one individual person gets up in the night and says okay fine I'll go out so with guidance of the Quran and Sunnah as the last resort it can be used and they give examples they give examples from Hadith giving their own logical argument you analyze that there was once when the fort was being taken up by the enemies and the Sabbath they said you throw me over and then I will go on to the spirit so chance of dying was there yet they went he didn't die and he opened the door so there are exceptions to the rules so Scholars differ one group of Scholars says totally Haram in any circumstances some Scholars say at the last resort if you're done with guidance there's no other alternative because the person doesn't want to end his life he wants to fight for the cause of haq for truth and while doing that the chances of his dying is very high and I know the one person was arguing with me a lot of the person you told me under any circumstances so ask him a question then Suppose there is someone who comes to attack the prophet hypothetical and if you are present in between and you come in between in between the crossfire he's fighting you know that if you jump in between I'm gonna die but why language save the problem of course I'll jump but that's inside for the prophet I'll do it how come you come in between and there are various other options nobody changed he said no you know people who are good in arguing the change no but there the trigger wasn't pulled when trigger was pulled by somebody else what I'm telling if the triggers pulled by the person himself by the enemy suppose the person who's very good Hefty Etc he's there he wants to kill the prophet and you come in between and you catch his hand and now what happens that the gun is turned and to kill him you have to kill yourself also and he pulls the trigger you will die and the person will die and the prophet will be saved then what will you do will you pull the trigger or not Allah and the prophet more than himself his wife and his family he's not a woman will you pull the trigger he said yes imagine and it's a situation which happens it can happen not that it is vague you are there and if you pull the trigger you'll die and then and you are pulling the trigger you're killing yourself and killing him and the profit will be saved so I do agree with Sheikh Salman as a last resort if on a certain circumstances you know that the loss that is there is less and the gain is more following all the rules of the Sharia following the Quran say Hadith at The Last Resort under guidance you know they get up in the morning and take a decision in that context as the last resort it can be used hope that's the question"
