  "title": "Should a patient of COVID 19 Fast in Ramadhaan? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Khan if a person is covid-19 positive then really fast this Ramadan Ramadan doing lockdown first let you so let me explain to you that if a person is positive covid-19 suffering from covid-19 most of the people suffering from covid-19 they are asymptomatic all the symptoms come a bit late or most of the people they are Mild they may have a mild cough they may have a dike off they may have a fever so if they are affected and their mild symptoms and they can keep the fast they will keep the fast but if the fever is too much and they cannot feed the hand they cannot keep the fast or if they feel they are feeling nauseating or they cannot it is perfectly all right because the Quran clearly mentions in sorry bakra chapter number two verse number 185 187 187 that if you are traveling or if you are sick then you need not fast we can compensate later on but if the asymptomatic they're feeling fine and if the carbon 19 positive if they fast it is better if they can or if they have got severe symptoms whether it has gone to pneumonia or maybe they are into admitted or if they're on ventilator or if that will drive you of course if you cannot take it please don't keep it Quran gives you permission if you're sick it includes the sickness of carbon 19 you can always compensate later on when Allah gives you health but if you're fine and if you want to continue on to fast you can keep it like the prophet said that a traveler need not fast but if you can fast while traveling if you don't want to fast and compensate later on option is it so same way with carbon 19 positive if the symptoms are less and you can first it's preferably fast if you can't then you can competition later on"
