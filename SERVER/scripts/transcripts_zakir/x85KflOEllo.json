  "transcript": "the next question my name is Arman I'm from India my question is Islam has prohibited to shake hands with the opposite gender because in Islam it is prohibited to touch a namam so my question is can a man shake hands with a woman while wearing gloves please answer as soon as possible the question posed byan is that it is prohibited in Islam for a man to touch Anam woman and he agreed with it's Haram but can he touch a woman after wearing gloves means if you're wearing gloves can he shake hands with a woman and we know the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad Sall Al wasallam is very clear that the prophet PE be upon said it is better to hammer a nail or a needle into the head rather than touch an the Hadith is very strong it's very bold it's very direct it is preferable to hammer a nail or a needle in the head rather than touch a nam woman so therefore touching namam is completely Haram it's not prohibit it is prohibited and it's not permitted regarding a question that can you touch a woman wearing gloves now there are some Hadith in which the prophet is said to have shaken hands of ladies beneath a cloth there are a few Hadith but all these hadiths are Z they are weak there is no authentic Hadith in which the prophet ever shook hands with ladies in fact there are various Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her who the wife of the Prophet saying that the prophet in his life has never touched any Nam mov So based on this it is not permitted to shake hands with woman neither is it permitted to shake hand wearing a glove because yet even if you wear a glove and you shake hands of course it's Haram there going to be feelings you cannot say nothing is happening to you so it's not permitted to shake hands with glove or without glove both are prohibited"
