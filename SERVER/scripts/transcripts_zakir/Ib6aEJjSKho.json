  "transcript": "the first is say he Allah one and only number two Allah Allah the absolute and eternal he begets not noise he begotten there nothing like him this Sur is the Touchstone of theology Theo is God logic me study theology study of God and Touchstone you know when you go to buy and sell gold jewelry you go to a Goldsmith and you want to verify how pure is the gold so the gold smith takes the gold and rubs it against the Touchstone and depending upon the color he tells you whether this gold is 24 karat gold whether 22 karat gold whether 18 karat gold or it may not be gold at all because All That Glitters Is Not Gold so surlas is the Touchstone of theology the God you are worshiping you put into the test of surlas if the God you are shipping passes the test of surlas he's a true God if he fails the test he's a false god"
