  "transcript": "the Quran talks about Salah in English people normally translate Salah as prayer prayer if you open the dictionary means to beseech to ask for help according to me prayer is not the appropriate translation of the Arabic word Salah what we do Dua after the Salah that is prayer the Salah is far superior to praying in the Salah besides asking for help we are getting Guided by Allah subhana tala the Arabic word Salah comes from the root word Salah means connection the servant connects with Allah subhana tala the Salah means connecting to God I call it the programming towards righteousness when we pray we read Surah FAA after that Imam is telling us he's giving us guidance don't lie don't cheat five times a day we are being programmed towards righteousness"
