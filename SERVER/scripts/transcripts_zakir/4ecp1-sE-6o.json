  "title": "Misconceptions About Islam 11 - Muslims Worship the Ka'bah",
  "transcript": "now we'll discuss the 11th most common question asked by the non-muslim is the 11th misconception in the mind of the non-muslim is that if Islam is against idol worship why do the Muslims bow down to the Kaaba the reply to the allegation is no muslim ever worship the Kaaba Kaaba is the Qibla is the direction 144. that wherever you are bow in the direction of the Kaaba the Kaaba is the Qibla for example if the Muslim want to offer Salah here some will say less face not some will say South some will say is so for congregation for unity all the Muslims face towards One Direction that is the Kaaba is and the Muslims they're the first people who drew the world map and Allah in 1154 while the first human being who do the world map and when the Muslims do the world map they are the salt poor on top North Pole down and Kaaba in the center later on the western cartographers came and they turned the map upside down North Pole top South Pole Dawn yet alhamdulillah is in the center so whichever part of the world you and if you're in the north you face towards the South if you're in the South you face towards the north if you're in the East to face towards the West if you're in the west to face towards the east Kaaba is the center now when we Muslims go to Makkah and during umrah or Hajj or while doing we circum ambulate around the Kaaba now why do the Muslims circum ambulate around the Kaaba because it's the Commandment of Allah and our soul we do it but the logical reason that I can think of is that when we circum ambulate we know that every Circle has got only one Center so when the circum ambulating we are testifying that God is only one furthermore the statement of the second caliph of Islam Allah he said it's mentioned volume number two in the book of Hajj chapter number 56 Hadith number 675 said pointing at the black stone this black stone can neither benefit me can neither cause many harm only because I've seen the prophet kiss it that's the reason I'm kissing it this statement that the black stone can neither benefit any Muslim nor harm any human being is sufficient to prove that we Muslims don't worship the Kaaba and furthermore during the time of the Prophet there were many sahabas who stood on the Kaaba and they gave the Azan no ideal worshiper will ever stand on the idol he or she worships this is sufficient proof to show that we Muslims we don't worship the Kaaba the Kaaba is only the Qibla"
