  "transcript": "your Center is your Society some people are Society centered they only bother what their neighbor are doing they're in competition with the neighbor only with the neighbor there's an anecdote Once An Angel comes and asks and tells a person whatever you ask I'll give you but I'll give you a neighbor double so he said oh Angel give me a Rolex watch so he gets Rolex watch very happy but the neigh gets two Rolex watch he says oh Angel give me a Rolls Roy so the angel gives him the Rolls-Royce and give the neighbor two rollsroyce H then he prays to the angel angel give me a very big Villa Bungalow of 10 bedroom Angel gives him a villa Bungalow of 10 bedroom but give the neighbor two he's thinking what is happening then he says oh Angel Break My one eye so that I cannot see attitude he's telling the angel to break his one eye you know why so that the angel will break both the eyes of the neighbor he's more bothered about winning with the neighbor than his own lifestyle this is neighbor centered competition with the neighbor imagine he doesn't mind making his one eye blind so that his neighbors both his eyes are blind this is the problem you're more bothered about your friend pleasing your friend not pleasing Allah you're more bother about pleasing your colleague not Allah you are material centered many people are materialistic material centered they want to whenever they meet with their friends they talk oh I have a watch tago tago I have omega I have a Rolex HBL what is a basil how many Diamond does it have I have a latest of PK Philip oh PK Philip so the main discussion is watch it if you go to higher level they are discussing what cars you have I have a BMW Porche no no I have a mayak or Ferrari lambogini oh I have a Bugatti so this is the main discussion they spend hours on that if you go higher level yacht I have a luxury ler you go higher level you have jet planes talking about jet planes which plane do you have I have a private jet plane how many seater 13 I have a bigger one which one do you have Gulf Stream oh I have a 373 oh this is the time always discussing materialistic things they are material centered some people are Fame centered they want to get famous they want to get popular so they give money for degrees you know you give money you get degree doctor you can get that also you can get if you have money some Fame centered popularity how many followers do you have on the Facebook on the YouTube on Instagram what is the following you have got this is the discussion popularity a true Muslim is only Allah centered and when you're Allah centered all this is combined together you get everything of all what I spoken if you Allah centered what do you think you'll not be self-centered Allah says a Believer will always want something similar what he wants for his other believer a Believer will always want the same so you'll never be self-centered so if you're Allah centered self- centered means I will want good for my friend for my believer so I will benefit so this is self- centered if you're Allah centered family centered if you're family centered you will love your parents because the prophet said Paradise Lies Beneath the feet of her mother you'll respect her but if they tell you do against Allah and his you will not follow them if you Allah Center you will take care of your parents of your wife a beloved Prophet said the best moment is he the best believer is he who's best to his family especially his wife so if you're Allah Center you love your parents your mother your father your wife your children it's a package you'll be Society centered you love your neighbor the prophet said you're not a Believer if you sleep with a full stomach and your neighbor sleeps with an empty stomach the sahaba asked who's your neighbor the prophet said 40 houses next to you so here you're competing with your neighbor neighbor better watch better house you want to break your eyes so that his two eyes are broken here you want to secure your neighbor he's a good Muslim who's a good neighbor so if you're Allah centered all these things completely change if you're Allah centered you wonder that the fame you're getting who is the most famous man in the world M sallam did he do it for it no he always did far always asking forgiveness a person who have been forgiven by Allah the best human being in the world the best messenger in the world yet he's asking Allah for forgiveness every day minimum 100 times the sahabas were worried that will their popularity make them gu less reward in the so they're afraid of popularity they don't want to become leaders today people want to become leaders they'll do anything to become the leader yeah there the sahabas used to run away from becoming the leader because they knew it's a responsibility so if you're Allah centered every Muslim should be Allah centered and believe me all your problems of your life will vanish and you have an example in the Palestinians they Allah centered if you become Allah centered if I become Allah centered believe me all your problems will vanish because Allah has a solution to all the problems of humankind if you're Allah centered you'll always say alhamdulillah you'll always praise Allah"
