  "transcript": "if we could just U now clarify what is the the best time in one's life to seek repentance is there a Best time indeed Allah says in the Quran Ina chapter number four verse number 17 that Allah accepts the repentance of the person who has done sin in ignorance and he asks for forgiveness quickly Allah subhana wa ta'ala is most merciful and is the most knowledgeable and wise now here based on the commentary of this verse of the Quran according to mujahid Allah have mercy on him he said that the sin in ignorance means that any sin done knowingly or unknowingly unless the person does not come away from the sin it is ignorantly that means all the sins Allah forgive as long as a person repents quickly as far as quickly is concerned according to Hassan basri may Allah have mercy on him he said quickly here means before death and with him he said quickly here means that before a person has a sickness which is mentioned in the Hadi of a beloved Prophet Muhammad wasallam Hadi ofi book of applications Hadith number 3537 that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will accept the repentance of his servant till his death rattle begins that means till the time he goes on his death bed unless he is in the last stage of life when he's on death bed that is the only time Allah will not accept the repentance any time before that he will accept so that means all the schol agree that quickly here in this quranic ver Sur 4:1 17 means that we should ask forgiveness before that Allah says in surum 39 verse 54 58 it says that turn to your lord in Repentance before the penalty comes before it's too late unless your soul says that I have done a wrong deed and I mocked or the soul may say that please give me one more chance but it will be too late Allah says in Surah 23 verse 19900 that when the time is over when the time when the death B has come and then you say that oh Allah subhana tala give me one more chance and Allah said that it's too late there cannot be another chance given so the time for repentance should be that if any sin is done in ignorance you should repent as soon as possible and Allah subhana wa taala from his Mercy from his Bounty he will forgive you"
