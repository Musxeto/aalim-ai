  "transcript": "the first question is from other Frazee from London UK the month of dhul hijjah is after 45 days what is the importance of the first one name of the region and that's very important question I would like to thank brother RF posthumous question because not going to me the bottoms of the first then bully Jaffa ah The Forgotten Sunnah of the beloved prophet unfortunately most of the Muslims for the world have forgotten the importance of the first and Indonesia most of us live there even know about from Don and prepare for mentor from that and we know most of its advantage most of the deaths occur from 9 but unfortunately very few of a Muslim in the way of the first 10 days of the Legion alas Muhammad Allah takes an old injuries crime it was refriger chaplain which name was the morning - well that says well fighter well I am it much by budget by gone and by the 10 nights yes alas 100 dollar estate in the port of wager and by 10 nights your facility and elastic in the hood for the unimpassioned that is by the 10 nights it is referring to the first 10 days of the region people wonder why didn't I use the word nights when didn't fall into the days of the first 10 days each other this is common in many languages if I have to say in English that I am worth 10 days in Europe I spent 10 days in you but natural I spent eight days with me on between I spent ten days and ten nights in you know it's understood when I say days many a times the night century similarly in Arabic when they commissioned the Knights included and when I stopped mention many a times even the living true it can only be night they tell me they're my consult and only they depending upon the context so in Allah failure is taking the boat of ten nights the more facility they fail it refers to the first ten days of the region and if you read the syllabus I see it says that the first ten days of the ninja are the most important days in the completely there are no bays besides these ten days which important these ten days in the full year are the most important days of the year even more important than the last ten days of Honda but the last 10 nights of ramadan are more important than the first 10 nights of the nature because in the last 10 nights of ramadan if the language of qatar because metal cover falls in the last 10 nights are from damn the last 10 nights of ramadan are the most important 10 nights in the foyer and the first 10 days of ganesha are the most important days in the folio it's mentioning same valley forum to hadith number 96 9 the profit center there are no deeds better than the deeds done on the first 10 days of the region there are no these are not any other day but it's done on the first invisibility to the Saba asked whatever jihad the prophet that even jihad the ditch none of the first ten days of the Lydia a better even than Jia except if jihad is done with the wealth and the life of the person and the person returns back without a Newton that means if a person goes for jihad with his wealth and his life and his mattered that is the only day one bill which is better than is a good deed done in the first 10 days of the region a similar message is repeated in dari me and is number one nine to five it's narrated by the Apostle that the Prophet peace be upon him said the beams done in the first people's religion are the best leaves there is no at the beach than on any other day which is better than the deeds done in the first 10 days of religion and when someone asked the Prophet what about jihad the prophets and even jihad unless the person goes for jihad which is wealth and life and comes back without both of them that means unless the person is modern in the battlefield while in jihad that's the only need which is better than the good deeds done in the first 10 days of religion that means the first 10 days of village' are the most important 10 days in the Fria that is no doubt about it and unfortunately most of us Muslims are unaware of this fact it's mentioned it is a Muslim one two three and the number two 7470 with the beloved prophet musa listen last about the fasting on the day of Arafah the beloved prophet musa ler some said that fasting on the day of Arafah experienced the sins of the previous year and the community the most important fast after the fact faster from them is the fasting on the lake of fire it's the most important there are some scholars very few who say fasting of Muharram the fasting of Ashura is the most important after the first pastor from now the hadith of the province and Salim we say that fasting in Muharram Hashanah is the most important fast but in this path the prophets say the sins of the previous year in this age is forgiven but if you fast during the day of Arafah then the sins of the previous year and the next year the following year two years of a given that will be the most of the scholars say that the most important fast after the fasting of the father faster from now in the photographer but we didn't Animus that these two fast the fasting of Arafah and the fasting of Ashura are the two most important fast after the fact fast it's further mission it's soon enough well maybe three I think them but 2:47 that the wives of the Prophet sent the Prophet fasted during the first nine days of nature and he fasted during Ashura and three days every month the first Monday and 2:30 we come to know from this indeed that the Prophet fasted all the nine days the first nine days of the nature that means besides the ninth of the leisure the day of Arafah it is maha it is Sunnah to fast all the first nine days of the ninja if someone say I cannot then it please past beside her money intently but the best is fasting all the first nine days of the region because these are the best days of the year what mask mine or father take is my only first ten days they really did a beloved prophet Musa Vincent matrix I have indeed number one nine nine one that the Prophet said it on it will filter and evil mother won't detain you fitter they after Amnon and if the mother that is the tenants of the lecture these two days are the days of it the prophets that it is probably too fast on the two days of you that believe in it it was stuck too fast from the first landing on Sunita it further mentioned in famously that the Prophet said you should not fast on the I am with the Sri that means the three days following the real mother because these are the days of eating in Trinity and the Prophet also said it's a mission that if you are sponsoring an animal then that person should not cut his name or cut his hair from the first day of the ninja till you've sort of if then if then myself you should see the message is repeated in Worcester Hammond and hit number five four four six the Prophet said that according to every moment of the revenue no man may Allah be pleased with him he said that the Prophet said there are no better than the beach done on the first ten days of the Raja therefore see the tangy lion Highland see the fat we all our since the time we thank Allah Allah but Allah surely like so it is recommended that all these ten days you say that that be the value is at I mean it's further mentioned inside 201 we do pain over 65 then of the life no man and our element I believe that the book that of the line Omar and Abu Huraira they used to go out in the marketplace during the first ten days of the Rita and now we see the puppy odd and when the others are about this figure then this repeated by themselves now do we see any Muslims in the marketplace in the mall in the zoo same the time we loudly during the first 10 days some of the guys can kill but normally in India Pakistan Malaysia Indonesia we don't find Muslims going onto the marketplace and say loudly la perla would but I will not love Berlin the new thing so insha'Allah most of the viewers online tell you that the first 10 be the village' inshallah will be after four or five days in militia in Saudi in the Gulf country inshallah it will be from the 22nd of July from mentally for this company other countries it will be up to 5 days maybe their Pakistan and Bangladesh and some country may be fundamental features that we follow these so now and divine Sunnah and do not let the first 10 days vanished this topic of the first thing this woman's actually require a big talk for a few hours time is limited I will just mention the important good deeds that a person should do during these first 10 days of the region I am NOT rich it all and mentioned the important events number one is that we should pray of all five times the fella in JAMA in the mosque number two if you have not done that and I just forgot you if we

permitted this hutch inshallah will hope that Allah give them the chance next to inshaallah to do number three that do not do any harm during this first and religion you should not know haram throughout your life but be particular not only the major sins avoid totally even the minor sense during these ten days you have to don't do sin throughout your life but be more particular during the
