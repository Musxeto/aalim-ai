  "title": "How will a Person who is Cremated be Asked Questions in the Grave as he does not have a Grave?",
  "transcript": "the next question it's come on the Facebook again by zedin Eric he's a non-muslim and he says that if a person is cremated then how will he be questioned about the questions asked in the grave as he does not have a grave that's a very good question and many people are confused that because the Hadith that after you die you'll be question in your grave and there's also mention of the other the punishment in the grave and it also says that the people who are better they'll be questioned you have to understand that what this Hadith means when the prophet said that after your buried it means that because today we know that most of the human within the world they are buried the Christians the Muslims majority of the human in the world today if you do a survey they are buried less people are cremated some are given to the vultures when the statement is made it is mainly meaning after you die you'll be questioned if you're married it's in the grave if not wherever you are that doesn't mean that if you are not bad you will not be questioned there are chances that maybe wild animals May kill you and you don't get buried there are chances you're drown it doesn't mean you won't be questioned no because for questioning two things that require the soul in the body the body if you realize even when you're buried it gets disintegrated it gets merged into the Earth so the main concept is that if Allah can resurrect you on the day of judgment why can't he yet whether you have a body or not whether they are buried or whether they have drowned whether they are cremated like and yet if he wants to give you pain want to give you punishment that in the Quran in Surah in Sun chapter number 75 verse number three that if those people who think that Allah cannot recite them on the day of judgment how can Allah reassemble our bones on theory of judgment so Allah says tell them that Allah can not only reassemble the bones he can reconstruct in perfect order the very tips of your fingers talking about fingerprints Allah can even get your fingerprints which is not even identical in a million people so when you can resurrect on the day of judgment why can he do in the grave so it is basically telling you that after you die whether you earn the grave whether you are gone whether you are cremated there will be a minor question and answer session there will be some punishment there may be some rewards but the final recompense of Allah says 185 is the final recompense is on the day of judgment hope the answers the question"
