  "transcript": "Dr Zak n allow me to read to you about your comments about the people of the book only limited to the uh Jews and Christian this is a commentary by PR Hashim Kamali I think he's quite an authority in Sharia it's based on the verse of the Quran those who restrict the category of Ali alab to Jews and S sry sorry what is the name you took which is the name of the famous person you said just now what was the name of the commentary who wrote it Prof Hashim Kamali Hashim Kamali I haven't heard of him first time I'm hearing yeah please Google him no no you said he's very famous he's a chairman of uh Institute of Advan Islamic study Malaysia may be famous in Malaysia he may be he may be good scholar I'm not saying bad I'll pass you his book you can read but right now just for the uh benefit I haven't heard of him he may be a good person he may be a good scholar I'm not disagreeing with that but I personally haven't heard of him you can read the commentary okay okay this is based on the Quran he says that those who restrict the category of Ali alab to the Jews and Christians quote in Authority the Quran chapter 6 verse1 156 which declares that books were revealed to two groups before but the context where this phrase occurs actually questions rather than endorses the spirit of such limitation let us briefly examine the context the verse chapter 6 verse 156 immediately follows two other verses one of which affirms the veracity of the Torah that contain guidance and life the succeeding verse refers to the Quran itself has the bless bat and an authoritative source and then comes the verse 6 156 lest you should say bracket thing that books were sent down to two bracket groups of people bracket only before us and for our part we remain unacquainted with a reveal B the tone of the discourse brother brother brother all this doesn't make a difference I'll give the reply again to you all this doesn't make a difference to me even I'm a student of the Quran let me tell you one thing I want to repeat the answer which you have not heard correctly I told you by meaning means people of the book it can also mean people of the Revelation that context even Muslims Allah has sent many books Quran says in 13 verse number 38 in every age we have sent a book that's definition but when Quran uses an edmab it only refers to Jews and Christian no one else if I agree with that person I don't know what context he's talking about then there will big chaos among theab there are those who say this and sayab believe in law and gospel meaning Torah and the injil with these there are many verses in the Quran with this it is 100% sure that whenever Quran refers toab it only refers to Jews and Christian as an idiom other wise there are many other people who are but when the Quran refers to it and I give you the example when Quran says oh Prophet tell your wives and the believing woman you ask me who's the prophet Adam is Prophet Noah is prophet Abraham is Prophet M Alam is Prophet Jesus is Prophet but when Quran says Prophet it specifically refers to no one but Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him I gave you the answer you didn't hear it I hear you but I hope this is the answer I disagree because if I follow with that there'll be contradictions in the Quran I don't agree this contradiction in the Quran Quran says believe in Torah and the inil now you will say Buddhist believe in Tor and in they cannot I I think we should learn how to agree to disagree not agree to disagree what you're saying if I agree with you I have to believe I'm not asking you to agree with me I'm just sharing with you disag sh an imminent of an imminent uh bu uh imminent Muslim Scholars there are many imminent people who can make mistakes and there are many good Scholars who have made mistakes I don't disagree he's not eminent I'm not saying he's not eminent okay say abdah this Abdullah Yu Ali which I quote this abdah Ali brother brother you want to keep on speaking have you come here to give a speech this book which I refer the translation abdullahu Ali according to me the best translation available there are mistakes in this also just because he best it doesn't mean because women being the bound to make mistake I'm a human being I can also make a mistake but the point to be noted is when we do research if we find one mistake I don't reject everything because he then claimed to be God this translation is one of the best translations even this translation has got mistakes so what we have to realize that a human being cannot be perfect so that person may be eminent but I disagree with his interpretation you might not disagree so why are you coming and hopping again to I've given you reason why I disagree what you have to do okay fine this verse of the Quran interpret this way you have to counter my argument you're not countering your reading from the book reading from the book is a waste of time for us and for everyone because I've give you quotation from the Quran which says about alab and refers to Jews and Christians only also from the Quran and it states that actually you should have an open interpretation and can I ask you a question Dr Zakir are you also a human of course I'm a human so are you also bound to make mistakes I can make but to prove I made a mistake you have to prove where my mistake is that that's why that that is why I stat you from a commentary from a imminent Muslim scholar from my own interpretation that but that iminent is not matching with the Quran my interpretation what I'm talking is based on the Quran and majority of the scholars majority J Scholars of Islam believe means only Jews and Christian there are so many I can name 20 quing one which I never heard of you you read all of them say what do you have to realize I'm quoting I'm quoting all these top commentaries all of them say that even abdah Ali even Abdul Maadi all of them say Jews and Christian now you get one Malaysian F you may respect him I've got no objection to that therefore when you see you have to give evidence that evidence doesn't hold good for me that's the reason I say that I believe with the commentary given by eminent not one 100 Scholars 100 so when one is against 100 if it has proof if it's worth considering I consider if it's not worth considering I don't consider if you want to believe in it you have full right no one can force you hope that answers the question [Applause]"
