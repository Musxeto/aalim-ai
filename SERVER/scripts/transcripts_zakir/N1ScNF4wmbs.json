  "transcript": "Moses and Muhammad peace be upon them both were born naturally Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born miraculously he was born without any male intervention and that is also mentioned in the bible as well as the Quran the Bible says in the gospel of Matthew chapter number one verse number 18 before they came together that is before Mary and Joseph they came together by the power of the Holy Ghost a similar message is given in the Gospel of Luke chapter number one verse number 3435 when the Glad Tiding was given to Mother Mary may Allah be pleas with her that she will have a son she replies how shall I have a son when I knoweth no man so the angel replies that the Holy Ghost will come upon thee and the power of the most high will overshadow thee a similar but much Sublime much Noble message is given in the Quran in Surah al- Imran chapter number 3 verse number 45 to verse number 47 when mother Mary peace be upon her when she was given the message Glad Tidings that she will have a son she replies how shall I have a son when no man has touched me the Bible says how shall I have a son when I knowe it no man knowing a man mean sexually here in the Quran she says how shall I have a son when no man has touched me touched me me sexually the angel replies Allah created what he wills and when he decrees a matter Allah decre the matter he just says to it be and it is comparing both the messages are similar but the words of the Quran are much more Sublime much more noble because if you read the Bible in the Bible Gospel of Luke chapter 1 verse number 34 says when Mary peace be upon her says how shall I have a son when I knoweth no man so the angel says the Holy Ghost will come upon thee and the power of the most high shall overpower thee you know it gives a mental picture which is disturbing it is not very Sublime but the quranic message is more Sublime and Noble when Mary peace be upon us says in Sur Imran 3 verse number 45- 47 how shall I have a son when no man has touched me so the Angels reply Allah created what he will it and when it decrees a matter he just says be and it is it the most Sublime but both the Bible and the Quran say that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was born miraculously without any male intervention so if we analy as far as the birth of all these prophets are concerned Muhammad peace be upon Him is like Moses peace be upon him and Jesus peace be upon Him is unlike Moses peace be upon him"
