  "transcript": "hello good evening i am joshua from the philippines and before that i would like to share that many hundred years ago the philippines are mostly muslims and before the spaniards came now we are mostly christians mostly catholics in my country there's a lot of religions different kind of christian religions and most of them claim that if you follow the religion and we come to join them you have a better chance to be saved to go to heaven and i am a catholic for me i think religion is just a a guide it is not the religion who can save you i think it is you you can save yourself if you do good things whatever religion you are in so my question is islam is the same as this religion claiming to be the one true religion that if you embrace islam you have a better chance to go to heaven that's my president the second one before i go to the second question i realize that islam is all about peace and righteousness not the other way around that i used to think many years ago and i'm sorry for that and uh i'm really grateful and uh thankful to the uae especially dubai and all its leaders for giving us the freedom the opportunity to live here peacefully and exercise our faith whether you are a christian buddhist hindu i thank you and i think dubai the uae is the number one example of peace and unity where all ethnicity religion come together work in peace and harmony peacefully together thank you so i would like to say god bless uee and all its leaders bless islam god bless christianity god bless buddhism hinduism and all other religion in the world god blessed all of us and peace to all of us so my second question is sorry i want to talk about jihad brother this is a question answer time and normally a question is only of two or three sentences if you speak for more than two or three sentences it becomes a speech i request the non-muslim brothers and sisters this is a question answer time not a speech time for speech inshallah after everyone gets over we can sit in the modulus in the guest room and we can talk i don't mind but there are martial arts tens of thousands of people here so let's respect the time okay brother asked a question i just want to talk about if you have any questions yes please only post the questions this one two or three centers brother i want uh to know what really jihad means because i've seen a lot of television there's a few individuals using jihad in in harmony so what really jihad means to islam and you know since this is about peace i request the non-muslims that it will be preferable if you pose one question at a time for the second question you can go behind the other non-muslim you don't have to go behind the complete queue so that you know not like yesterday many non-muslims couldn't ask the questions i request a non-muslim ask one question if it's interlinked question two is acceptable but if you ask six questions three question four questions it will be difficult to fulfill and answer all the questions the brother asked two questions the first question he said that he believes religion is a guide but he doesn't believe that everything is truthful that it can take him to heaven he wants to know what is the position of islam and can islam take him to jannah and what is the quran and the second question is what is the meaning of jihad as far as the first question is concerned if you believe that bible is a guide if suppose when you're appearing for an examination maybe for bachelor's degree many a time for every subject there is a guide would you like to follow a guide which is an old edition or a guide which is the latest addition brother which guy you'd like to follow old edition or latest edition i would like to follow both both so previously science used to say the light of the moon is its own light today's sign says light of the moon is reflected light which you believe in hold on you brother you're from philippines i thought filipinos were intelligent people which will follow hold on you previously people thought the world was flat they did not go too far like they would fall over today science says that the world is spherical which will you believe flat of hearing both which i'll follow than you if the old is correct no problem many a time there are certain things which are correct in the old so if you compare both and if you find commonalities you can follow part of the old and the new one completely but you should verify whether the new one is correct or not the earlier question asked by the brother how do you come to know this guide is truthful and i told you that today with the help of science we can prove the only religious scripture which is hundred percent perfect and matches with established scientific fact it is the quran so based on that if you follow a wrong guide you may not be successful in the examination this world brother is a test for the hereafter allah says in the quran in surah chapter 67 verse number two it is allah was created death and life to test which of you is good in deeds so when you appear for the test you should even read the correct guide and the last and final guide for the human beings it is the glorious quran after this no other guide will come no other messenger will come so this is the only book that will take you to salvation that will take you to heaven it will take you to jannah as far as the second question is concerned that what is the meaning of the word jihad the word which is maximum misunderstood in islam is jihad it is not only misunderstood by the non-muslims it's even misunderstood by the muslims most of the non-muslim then muslims think that any war fought by any muslim for any reason whether it be for money whether it be for wealth whether it be for personal gain whether it be for fame whether it be for land is called as jihad jihad does not mean any war fought by any muslim whether it be for wealth for land for fame jihad comes from the arabic word jahada which means to strive which means to struggle in islamic context jihad means to strive and struggle against one's own evil inclination jihad means to strive and struggle to improve the society jihad also means to strive and struggle in self-defense in the battlefield jihad also means to strive and struggle against operation jihad basically means to strive and struggle for example if a student strives and struggles to pass in the examination in arabic we'll say he's doing jihad many people have a misconception that jihad can only be done by muslims there are no less than two places in the quran which say that even non-muslims do jihad allah says in the quran in surah luqman chapter number 31 verse number 14. we have enjoined on the human beings to be kind to the parents interval upon travel the motherboard you and in pain did she give you birth the next verse surah luqman chapter 31 verse number 15 says but if your parents do jihad strive and struggle to make you worship somebody else besides allah of which you have no knowledge do not obey them but yet live with them with love and compassion quran repeats that message in surah and kabut chapter 29 verse number 8 that allah says we have enjoined on the human means to be kind to the parents but if their parents do jihad strive and struggle to force them to worship somebody else besides allah then don't obey them here allah is talking about non-muslim parents who are forcing the children to do shirk to worship somebody else besides almighty god so here allah is saying that the non-muslim parents are doing jihad but this jihad is jihadist militia what we muslims should do is so whenever the word jihad is used it is normally used and understood that it is otherwise so jihad basically means to strive and struggle and many a time the orientalists they translate the word jihad as holy war holy war in arabic is harmon this word mukaddasa does not exist anywhere in the quran it does not exist in any hadees of the prophet this word holy war was first used to describe the crusaders the crusaders who spread the religion of christianity with force and killed thousands of people to spread the religion today this word is used for muslims for islam which is totally wrong nowhere does the quran say [Music] that jaz means holy war and quran is very explicit allah says in the quran in surah maidah chapter 5 verse number 32 that if anyone kills any other human being whether it be a muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity there is no religious book in the world which says that if you kill one human being you have killed the whole of humanity and if you say one human being you have saved the whole nation so how could such a religion which says you cannot kill a single innocent human being promote terrorism this is mainly the work of the media which is spreading misconception about islam hope this answers the question that's right so now do you believe that islam is a religion of peace yes yes i truly believe do you believe in one god yes do you believe jesus is god as for my religion yes i believe he is god he is son of our lord is there any text in the bible where jesus christ peace be upon himself says any unequivocal any unambiguous statement that you know of in the bible where jesus christ peace be upon himself says that i am god always says worship me if you can point out any verse in the bible unambiguous unequivocal where jesus christ peace be for himself says that he is god or he says worship me i will join you in your faith [Music] [Applause] brother can you point out a single unequivocal statement from the bible where jesus christ peace be upon himself says that he's god only one not two i am a student of the bible brother have you read the bible that is the truth i'm not good in the bible so yes how come you're following a religion where you have not read the bible i have read the bible and i'm telling you there is not a single unequivocal statement in the complete bible where jesus christ peace be upon him says that he's god always says worship me in fact if you read the bible jesus christ peace be upon him said it's mentioned in the gospel of john chapter number 14 verse number 28 he says that my father is greater than i gospel of john chapter number 10 verse number 29 my father is greater than all gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse number 28 i cast out devil with the spirit of god gospel of luke chapter number 11 verse number 20. i with the finger of god cast out devil gospel of john chapter number five verse number 30. i can of my own self do nothing as a year i judge and my judgment is just for i seek not my will but the will of my father anyone who says i seek not my will but the will of almighty god is a muslim jesus christ peace be upon the muslim it's clearly mentioned book of acts chapter number 2 verse number 22 e men of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles and signs which god did by him and your witness to it a man approved of god amongst you not god a man approved of god amongst you by wonders and miracles and signs which god did by him and your witness to it so when it's clearly mentioned in the bible that jesus christ peace be upon him was a messenger of god but not god so how come you are believing his god because it is what a religion teaches someone taught you if someone teach you the 2 plus 2 is equal to 5 will you believe in it [Music] yes or no no no no so now when i'm quoting you so many references from the bible do you think i'm lying to you [Music] maybe maybe so what i request you you go home and check all these references gospel of john chapter 14 verse number 28 gospel of john chapter 10 verse 29 gospel of matthew chapter number 12 verse 28 gospel of luke chapter 11 verse number 20 and you take my dvd on similarity between islam and christianity there are several preferences which can prove that jesus christ peace be upon him said that you should follow the last and final messenger prophet muhammad peace be upon him and inshallah you will be a better christian i believe that muslims are more christian than the christian themselves because we follow more of the true teachings of jesus christ peace be upon him than the so-called christian"
