  "transcript": "Define the term dawa and to from our last show on Isla how does that differ from dawah alhamdulillah as far as the word dawa is concerned when anyone hears the word dawat especially the people from the subcontinent India and Pakistan the moment the year the word dawat immediately they start thinking of mutton Biryani or chicken biryani they start thinking of a lunch party dawat does not mean a lunch party dawa or dawat means and invitation and today we will not be discussing about an invitation to a lunch party or dinner party we are discussing about the Islam the invitation to Islam and an invitation can only be given to an outsider so dhava that's the reason can be only done to a non-muslim when we give information about Islam to a non-muslim inviting him towards Islam that big word used is dawa and the meaning of Arabic word Isla is to repair it means to improve so when we speak about Islam to a Muslim giving him more information about Islam the more appropriate word is Islam though both these words are interchangeable but if you want to specifically the word Issa is used when we speak about Islam to a Muslim giving you more information and dawa is a word used when we speak about Islam to a non-muslim inviting him towards the fold of Islam"
