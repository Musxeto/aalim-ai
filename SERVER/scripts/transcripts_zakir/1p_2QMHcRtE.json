  "title": "Killing of Innocent Human Lives from an Islamic Perspective? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Dr Zakia in your list earlier on you mentioned that the unlawful killing of innocent people is one of the major sins now unfortunately the media often portrays the Muslims as promoting the killing of innocent human beings could you just clarify exactly what is the Islamic perspective on this killing of innocent human lives Allah subhana tal clearly mentioned in Sur MAA chapter number 5 verse number 32 that if anyone kills any of the human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity so Quran is very specific if anyone whether Muslim or non-muslim kills any other human being whether Muslim or non-muslim unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity so killing any innocent human being is prohibited in Islam what the media portray that Islam promotes killing innocent human being Etc terrorism is totally a misconception and most of the religions they do say that killing inent human being is wrong but Islam goes a step further and continues in the same verse in Surah MAA chapter number 5 verse number 32 continues and says that if anyone saves any human being it is as though he has saved the whole nation that means if you save one human life whether Muslim or un Muslim it is as though you have saved the whole of humanity so Islam not only condemns killing innocent human being it promotes saving the life of human beings Allah further says in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 151 that take not life which Allah has made sacred unless by way of Justice or law that means killing as mentioned of a human being you can't kill human being but if a human being commits murder but natural it doesn't mean that anyone can go and take revenge or can retaliate and kill the murderer or if someone is spreading corruption you can go and kill him you have to take him to the law and if it's an Islamic country take him to a court of Islamic law take him to the kadi and then he will pronounce the Judgment that if he deserves to be killed he'll be put to death but that doesn't mean that any Muslim can take the law in his own hand he should go to the Islamic court of law if it is Islamic country or to the law of that country and in general as I mentioned killing any innocent human being it is prohibited and that's what is mentioned by Prophet wasallam it's mentioned s bukari number n Hadith number 6871 the prophet said the biggest of the major sins are first associ part Allah subhana tala number two is taking a life or murdering or killing any innocent human being so generally you cannot kill any human whether Muslim or UNM Muslim there are many other verses which say specifically that you should not kill Muslims also General verses not killing any innocent human being there specific verses which say that you should not kill Muslims Allah says in Surah n chapter number four verse number 93 that if anyone intentionally kills a Believer he will be in Hellfire forever to abide therein forever and Allah's curse and wrath will be on him and he will get a deadful penalty so killing any believer unless for the cause that is mentioned unless he commits murder or corruption killing is prohibited it's further mentioned in the Hadith of malli wasallam it's mentioned in s bukari volume number one in the book of faith Hadith number 31 the Beloved Prophet mallalli wasallam said that if two Believers fight amongst themselves with swords and if one believer kills the other believer both the murderer and the murdered person they will go to hell so the sahabah asked the prophet that we can understand that the murderer goes to hell why does the murdered believer goes to hell so the prophet said that the murdered person also had the intention to kill the believer that's the reason both will go to hell and it's further mentioned inkari Vol number n Hadith number 6862 the Beloved Prophet said that a Believer is at Liberty and free until he unlawfully takes the life of another human being that means taking the life of any human being whether Muslim or non-muslim is prohibited and condemned in Islam it is one of the biggest major sins it comes number two in the 70 major C"
