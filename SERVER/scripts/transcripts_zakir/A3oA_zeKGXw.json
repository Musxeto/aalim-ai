  "transcript": "next question what are the dangers of backbiting and gossip mongering during the month of Ramadan one of the major things in Islam it is slandering and backbiting and Allah says in the quranza chapter 104 verse number one to every kind of bag biter and slander that you have to go to everyone who back bites and sandals that avoid suspicion because sometimes suspicion is a sin do not speak ill about anyone behind the back are you ready to eat the meat of your dead brother and Allah continues and say that about it here Allah gives the example that a person who backbites it is as though he is eating his own brother now eating the meat of your own Brothers Haram and further it says eating dead meat eating dead meat is all Sahara so if you back by documenting a double sin not only eating the meat of a brother eating the Flesh of your dead brother so it is a very grave sin and a beloved Prophet Muslim said it's mentioned in say Muslim way number four Hadith number 6265 where Prophet Muslim asked the Sabbath that do you know what is backbiting they say that the messenger of Allah knows the best so Prophet Muslim says that if a person speaks about somebody else behind his back which he would not have liked that is called as backbiting speaking about somebody behind his back which the person would not like is called as backbiting son of the Saba he asks that o Prophet what if the thing has spoken is the truth or the fault which I mentioned does exist in the person so the prophet said that if what you have spoken is the truth and the fall does exist it is called as backbiting otherwise it's called a slandering so backbiting is a grave sin there's another say Hadith mentioned in sunnan number three in the book of manners Hadith number 4857 the wife of the Prophet she speaks about safia and says that she is such a such thing meaning she is short statured the prophet immediately says that what you have said if your words were mixed in the C it would spoil the full C further it's mentioned in sunnan Abu Dhabi verb number three in the book of manners Hadith number 4860 where it's mentioned he says that Prophet Muslim said when you have taken up to heaven that he saw some people whose nails were made of copper and they were scratching their faces and the breast and when he asked that who are these people to reply was these are the people who backbited indicating that backbiting is a grave sin and it is one of the major sins which people should abstain from and many of us they do it unknowingly not realizing that it's grave sin we should abstain from it and the prophet also said if mentioned to say bukhari verb number eight in the book of Madness Hadith number 6056 manga he shall not enter Paradise so these hadiths we come to know that we have to be careful we should guard our tongue especially from backbiting and gossiping"
