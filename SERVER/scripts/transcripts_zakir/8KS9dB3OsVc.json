  "title": "Nilima Asks Dr Zakir, â€œIn Bhavishya Purana 50% of the Prophesy is not Fulfilled by Muhammad (pbuh)..",
  "transcript": "good evening sir i'm a lecturer by profession and also a research scholar in islam and comparative studies may i know your name please i'm neelima i respect your great enlightenment sir but i have a small qualification to be made like uh let us go back to the bhavishya purana part three khan three rdi three and slokas five to eight uh before going to this i would just like to mention that maybe you already know because every prophet who comes in the name of god will fulfill the prophecy which is made for him so any prophet who fulfills 50 percent of that prophecy is not qualified to be a prophet i mean this is a simple logical thing so now coming back to the bhavish purana you talked about the malaysian leader saying that he is none other than muhammad okay now i accept the first half of the thing of the sloka you said but the second 50 percent which is still ignored now sir let me tell you malaysia the word meaning nature it is derived from sanskrit dictionary i mean the meaning and the meaning means non-aryan or sinner or wicked person these are the three different meanings given to the word malaysia so according to this can muhammad be a sinner or a wicked person the second part is the second condition of the prophecy is that he will belong to marusthal and in sanskrit land of death because maru i mean it is derived from ru is death and definitely is does not according to the land of arabia because it is a barren land or it is a battlefield and next coming to the third point of faith this prophecy also mentions that that nature leader will take bath in panchagavia and in river ganges and it is a common truth we know that ganges means ganga river and we all know that ganga is not in arabia but it is in india it is a universal fact and coming to the taking bath in panchagavia the meaning of panchagawa is five products of cow and the products of cow is milk curds ghee urine cow dung and now sir coming to this part exclusively this prophecy must be fulfilled by muhammad wherein if you show me at least single reference from quran wherein muhammad has taken bat in either in all these five products that is milk curds ghee urine and cow dung i'm ready to accept islam today thank you sir sister has rightly said that if the prophecy that you give if more than 50 person is not fulfilled then the prophecy is wrong i agree with your sister i agree with you and i will answer all your three queries let's see whether you accept islam or not today that's a different thing that you may not agree with the truth i will speak to you i agree with you malaysia i agree with you all your three definitions malaysia one of the meaning is non-aryan meaning a foreigner one of the meaning is sinner one is a wicked person that's the reason like the hindus they call the muslims as malaysia when they say that they mean actually wicked and sinner but the other meaning is also foreign as far as when i speak when i quote from any scripture while quoting and while taking the meaning it's not necessary that if the word has got four meanings then more than two meaning should be correct no even if one is correct the meaning is right for example the quran says that don't have pig today if you open the dictionary one of the slang meanings for pig is a cop means a policeman so one meaning is pig the other meaning is a police man but naturally the quran and the bible when the bible says in the book of leviticus chapter number 11 verse number seven and eight in the book of deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number eight and the book of isaiah chapter number 65 verse number two and five when it says don't have pig it doesn't mean don't have a policeman if you're a student of comparative religion if there are ten meanings even if one is correct you have to choose the right one two may be correct three may be correct all ten may be correct but even if one is correct out of ten it can fulfill the prophecy so here i agree with you sister malaysia does mean non-alien to indian it will be a foreigner and i said in my speech when i translated a malaysia means a foreigner now you want to go in the wrong way and say malaysia means wicked here that is a misunderstanding sister if you say the bible says and the quran says don't have a police man that means you're not a student of comparative religion you are a novice if any one of the meaning fulfill the prophecy one more thing if there's a doubt there are ten points i mentioned all the others can't be refuted your second meaning marustal one of the marusthal i do agree mar means that but the other meaning of marustal in sanskrit is a sandy track you go back to the dictionary today and open in our islamic research foundation we have a sanskrit dictionary also sister i am a student of comparative religion i do agree one is a place of death the other is a sandy track so why are you taking the wrong meaning that means you're going out of the way so if you see the permutation and combination all the other points i mentioned 100 correct here also you have to choose the right meaning so one of the meanings of marustal means a sandy track or a desert coming to your third question and you accepting islam inshallah the third question that i mentioned in the prophecy that prophet muhammed took a bath in the panchkarv in the ganges now here we analyze that when we say in the hindu terminology when you say bath in the punch guard in the ganges it means to purify one means actually you dip yourself in the ganges which i don't expect the prophet came and dipped himself in the ganges it means to purify i did not give the explanation because the lecture is very long i can speak on this topic for the full day i did not give details of everything i can speak on each prophecy for another few minutes even for us together so here having a bath in the punch curve means purify so depending upon the context it doesn't mean a physical path and even if you physically have a bath in the punch curve in the ganges not necessary you will be purified it is the philosophy of the hinduism so here when the prophecy says that prophet muhammad peace be upon him had a batch in the panchagar it doesn't mean he came here in the ganges it means that he was purified by almighty god and we believe that all the prophets of god all whether it be moses jesus christ peace be upon them and prophet muhammad sallam all of them were masoom they were innocent they were pure so all the prophets of god of almighty god which he sent down all of them we consider to be innocent to be massum to be pure so this answers the question and i hope inshallah you'll accept islam's sister i would just like to throw some light the sister had asked early question three questions and that reminds me that my daughter who had come last she had said a song don't talk to me about mohammed you know peace be upon him and the coordinator said please pay attention to the words what she's saying and if you heard the words carefully it's the seerat of sallam that once minimal solomon was going he finds a companion as a stranger she starts speaking against the prophet oh the prophet muhammad sallallahu is a bad person don't talk to me she's telling muhammad sallallahu that person doesn't know the person is talking to she tells to the stranger that person on the road that prophet muhammad is bad don't listen to hey me causes disharmony he teaches only about one god blah blah blah that's what my daughter was saying in that song later on but she says oh you are a very good person but i'm warning you don't listen to that man muhammad peace be upon him he's a rogue knows bella he's a very bad person knows bella and so on and so forth but she says you're a very good person you're so kind you're so loving please know your name then she says pardon what did you say am i hearing correct your name is muhammad then she says so when the traveler realizes that this person is actually prophet muhammad peace be upon him i have heard from other people that he's the wrong person this person is so good she immediately accept islam so our dear sister when she posed so many questions again i thought it reminds me of my daughter when she was narrating the seer of the prophet in that song the person in the travel attacking islam attacking the prophet muhammad but when she comes to know the truth she says the shahadah so inshallah the assist also will share the shadow and ideally ask allah to open a heart [Applause]"
