  "transcript": "greetings to Dr Zaki Naik and all my brothers and sisters here in the name of our Lord creator well it's an honor to meet you sir Dr Zaki Nayak well my name is Mahesh and I work as a customer service officer in Dubai and I'm a born-again Christian my question sir today is how confident is Islam that it is not deceived by Satan or the Jal that Jesus was crucified for all our sins asked a question that how confident is Islam that it's not deceived by Satan and Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was not crucified brother Islam means peace acquired by submitting a will to God and anyone who submits civil to God he is a Muslim as far as our create Allah is concerned he has illegal we have knowledge of the future Allah says in the Quran very clearly in Surah Nisa chapter number four verse number 157. Allah says that they boasted the Jews that we kill Jesus the son of Mary Allah says they killed him not needed to crucify him well I can should be alone and anyone who differs is full of doubts son which only conjectures to follow Mama for assured they killed him not so Quran is very explicit confident without a single doubt that Jesus Christ peace be upon him he was not killed neither was he crucified it was only made to appear so all those who differ are full of doubt being a Muslim is concerned I am 100 confident because Quran says that but to make you also confident I can prove it to you from your Bible that Jesus Christ peace be upon Him wasn't crucified so that you will come to know it is not the Muslims who are deceived it is the so-called Christians who believe that Jesus was crucified peace be upon him are deceived if you read the Bible it's mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 12 verse number 38 that people come to Jesus Christ peace be upon him ask him oh Lord O master show us wonders and miracles and signs people came and asked Jesus Christ peace be upon Him show a signs which show was Miracle to prove that a messenger of God so Jesus Christ peace be upon him he says you evil and adulterous generation you seek in after a sign no sign shall be given to you except the sign of Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth Jesus Christ peace be upon Him puts all his eggs in one basket he does not say that I will show you the miracle you know that I give life to the dead I heal those who are born lepers he puts all his eggs in one basket and says I shall give you no sign but the sign of Jonah for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the Earth now to know the sign of Jonah you have to go to the Bible and by the book by the name of Book of Jonah it is less than two sides in the Bible and if you've read the Bible you know that almighty God commands his prophet Jonah that to go to Nineveh now Jonah being a prophet of God he said that people of Nineveh will not understand he takes a ship to Joppa now while he's going there's a storm at sea and there was a Superstition at that time that anyone who doesn't obey the Commandment of his master because of that a storm will come so Jonah being a prophet of God he owns up and volunteers that I am the person who has disobeyed my master so because he owns up at that time it was a custom it was a Superstition that if you throw the person overboard who is disturbing his master then the storm will come Jonah being a prophet of God he volunteers so they don't have to tie his legs they don't have to tie his feet they throw him overboard in the storm I'm asking a question brother when Jonah was thrown overboard from the ship into the sea was Dona dead or alive whether I'm asking you the question was Jonah alive when he was thrown overboard in the sea yeah I I got your question but I am I you got my question you haven't given my answer according to you in the Bible when Jonah was thrown overboard was he dead or alive well it is out of my question so if you can I'm giving the answer to your question I am answering your question Jesus Christ peace be upon him said he puts all his eggs in one basket for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be treated and three nights in the heart of the earth I am answering a question why aren't you answering my question was Jonah dead or alive well I'm pretty much not sure with that and well you haven't read the Bible I've been reading I have not come across a single Christian who does not know the Book of Jonah he may not know the other parts of the Bible because this you even learn in Sunday school even a small child knows the story of Jonah how come you don't know sir I appreciate your effort that you're answering but I'm asking the question if you have read the Bible if you know your Bible if you don't know your Bible then what's the use of me talking from your Bible a simple question like 2 plus 2 is equal to how much and you cannot reply that means you're afraid of the truth no sir was Jonah Dead or Alive Dead or Alive either said that or either say alive what are we no I cannot guess but if you're sure with the Bible please go ahead okay so you don't know you don't know you don't want to answer I don't want to answer but want you to answer ah correct why why you don't are you afraid two plus two is equal to how much brother for exactly what exactly you can say Jonah was dead or alive you don't know when you're thrown overboard was he dead or alive you know the answer but don't want to answer why are you afraid of the truth I feel the devil is deceiving you now the devil cannot deceive poor devil cannot deceive you why because I believe in Christ the lord Jesus you do not know the sign of Jesus Christ peace be upon him you do not know the Bible how do you believe in Jesus Christ I love Jesus Christ more than you do you know that more than you you only theoretically are saying I know the commandments of Jesus Christ peace be upon him in the Bible you don't know so who's a better believer in Jesus Christ people you are me a person who follows the Commandment of Jesus Christ peace be upon him as a better believer or a person who does not I think we are going apart from the question I am not going apart the devil is deceiving you I want to take the devil away from you the devil is saying don't answer if you answer you'll get caught if you answer then you'll get close to the truth no sir my question was to look at a view from Islam if how confident they were 100 confident how confident are you you are not confident that Jesus Christ peace be upon him was crucified that's the reason even after knowing the answer you're not answering it is devilish if you ask me a question if I know the answer and I'm not answering that means I'm afraid of the truth why are you a fear of the truth when Jesus Christ is with you when Jesus Christ is with you why are you afraid of the truth and I know you know the answer I know you know the answer and I know that if you answer you will get exposed that Jesus has peace be upon him was not crucified yes let me be honest I really don't know the answer but would look forward to have your explanations do you know about the sign of Jonah have you heard about the story of Jonah yes I did do you know that he was thrown overboard alive I can guess maybe he was dead when he was thrown where did you read this in which Bible as I told you I challenge you you show me any verse in the Bible which say that Jonah was dead when he first thrown alive I'll accept Christianity your devil is not even allowing you to answer the truth I challenge you open the Book of Jonah it said that Jonah was alive so why are you giving the wrong answer doesn't your Bible says that Jonah prayed in the belly of the fish was he dead when he prayed him was he alive when he was praying he must be alive so why are you saying dead I was not sure with the Book of Jonah sir I have not met a single Christian who doesn't know this answer you know the answer but purposely you're deviating because you don't love Jesus Christ peace be upon him I'll go it with the story when Jonah was thrown overboard he had to be alive then there's a storm in the storm when a human being is thrown out to die he does not die because that's a miracle if he dies it's no miracle if he does not die it's a miracle a fish comes then gobbles him up a fish come then follow them up a person ought to die but Jonah is alive peace be upon him if he dies it's not a miracle he's alive it's a miracle three days and three nights the fish takes prophet Jonah around the sea a person ought to die does he die or not as you told he is alive now because if he has to pray he has to be alive to pray yes dead men don't pray you're the life so it's a miracle of a miracle of a miracle later on the fish vomits him out onto the show when the fish vomits prophet Jonah what he did our life alive alive alive alive a miracle of a miracle of a miracle of a miracle for Jesus Christ peace be upon him said yet as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the fish so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth I'm asking the question when Jesus Christ peace be upon him and he was taken down from the cross and when he was put in the Sepulcher in the grave while Jesus Christ dead or alive he was dead that means Jesus Christ told the LIE he said as Jonah was three days and three nights so shall the son of man be three days and three nights so Jonah was alive and Jesus was let that means Jesus Christ lied so do you believe Jesus can slide no sir definitely not so why are you going against the person who you love I will never believe that a messenger of God can lie that means he was dead or alive it says Jonah was three days in the belly of the fish three days and three nights don't cut okay three days and three nights so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth yes so when Jonah was alive what was Jesus Christ peace be upon him so but the main purpose is he being in the heart of the earth which is fulfilled the prophecy says life he was alive as he told so Jesus also has to be alive plain simple reading why are you following the devil's footsteps simple if Jonah was alive Jesus Christ has to be alive peace be upon him if you say he was dead that means you are saying Jesus Christ peace be upon Him lied that means he's not a man of God so the prophecy says that so as Jonah he shall be three days in the belly of the earth three days and three nights via cutting brother you don't know English okay I am not cutting let it take it as three days and three nights yes very good but uh Dr Zach okay wait wait do you know the Bible when was Jesus Christ peace be upon him put on the cross which day was it it was on Friday when when was he taken down at night at night Friday night correct so he was put in the supply government maybe at night Friday night correct when was the tomb empty when did Mary Magdalene found the tomb empty Sunday what time morning afternoon evening well at night I guess [Applause] morning Sunday morning yes okay so if you count Friday night he was in the Tomb one night a Saturday morning full day was in the two one night one day Saturday night he was there two nights and one day does two neither one day equal to three days and three nights technically no sir so technically why are you telling Jesus Christ he's a liar peace be upon him so technically you're calling Jesus Christ a liar no sir but I no sir no sir no sir here why are you accusing my beloved Prophet Jesus Christ peace be upon him I wouldn't like anyone accusing my Prophet to be a liar once twice why because I don't see a valid reason why they have to make it false of Jesus crucifixion you are making force not I Quran is very clear he was not crucified neither was he killed even in the Bible he was put on the cross but he did not die on the cross crucifixion means the person should die on the cross c-r-u-c-i-f-i-x-i-o-n but a new word has to be coined he was put on the cross but did not die it's called as crucifixion c-r-u-c-i f i c t i o n it's the fiction so if we dive it's called as crucifixion if he does not die it's a fiction it's a story so if you read the Bible in the Bible Jesus Christ peace be upon did not die on the cross if we die that means he's lying so if you say he died that means he's a liar I would prefer calling my Prophet as a truthful person rather than a liar so what your talk did is the teachings of the Church of your priest you are more bother about following your priests and following the messenger of Allah for you the teachings of the church is more important than the teachings of the Bible so to fulfill the teachings of a church you are calling Prophet Jesus a liar I would not like to call my Prophet a liar brother do you understand English yes so do I so you have to agree that Jesus was alive and Jesus wasn't crucified everything is matching what you are talking is the teaching of the church not the Bible so but as you think for a Redemption of sin why would one want to lie about the crucifixion of Jesus but where did Jesus Christ peace be upon him say that he will redeem people sin quote me any one verse in the Bible where Jesus Christ peace before himself says that he's got to worship me nowhere does it say in fact Jesus Christ peace be upon him said in the gospel of Matthew chapter number five verse number 7 to 20 that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scaven the fire Seas you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven so if you want to go to heaven you have to follow all the rules and laws and Commandments of the Old Testament yes so Old Testament says God is one it doesn't say three in one it says God has got no image God has got no Idol yet many of the Catholics worship they make an image of Jesus Christ peace be upon him it clearly says that when a person came to Jesus Christ peace be upon him in the gospel of Matthew chapter number 19 verse number 16 17 that a man approaches Jesus Christ peace that good Master what good things should I do so that the entire turn in life so Jesus Christ peace before he replies why thou callist me good there's only one good and that is almighty God if you want to enter eternal life you keep the Commandments he never said you believe that I'm God he never said you believed I died on the cross for your sins that is the teachings of Paul not of Jesus Christ peace be upon it Paul says in Corinthians and all that believe in Jesus why did Jesus cast peace be upon him say he said that if you want to go to heaven you keep the Commandments so are you going to follow Jesus Christ people upon him or somebody else Jesus Christ so where did Jesus say that you have to believe that I died for your sin show me one quotation where he himself said it in massive I'm not sure with the verses but he says about the loss he has come to fulfill the loss if someone comes to fulfill the loss does it mean that he died for his sins if I have come to fulfill your loss if you don't understand I'm trying to fulfill your loss that doesn't mean I become God that doesn't mean that I have come to die for your sin yes he came to guide the people and even I believe in that where does it say that he died for your sins so like John 3 16 says that for God so loved the world he gave him one and only son Lord Jesus what you're quoting is Gospel of John chapter 3 verse number 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him shall not die but of everlasting life do you know this word begotten is it the position it's a fabrication it's a concoction according to the revised standard edition of The Bible the divised standard devotion of the Bible revised by thidu Christian Scholars of the highest Eminence it says this word begotten is interpolation it's a fabrication it's a concoction and they're thrown out of the Bible so this word begotten is a fabrication and again for God's soul of the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth in him you have to believe in him not believing Paul so where is the problem where am I saying don't believe in him even I believe in him I follow him Jesus Christ peace be upon him was circumcised brother are you circumcised I'm circumcised who's following Jesus you are me who's following Jesus Jesus Christ peace be upon himself we have to follow the Old Testament it's mentioned in the book of Ephesians chapter 5 verse number 18 don't have alcohol it's mentions Book of Proverbs Chapter number 20 verse number one don't be drunk with alcohol brother do you have alcohol no sir you have alcohol no mashallah this party are following Brother do you have poke yes I do it's mentioned in the Book of Leviticus chapter number 11 verse number seven in it not to have spoke in the book of Deuteronomy chapter number 14 verse number eight not to have spoke in the book of Isaiah chapter number 65 verse number two to five don't have four who's following Jesus for you or me but I'm asking the question you are following Jesus more than me so you forgot to quote another verse in New Testament I'm not sure with the verse numbers but it says what you have with your mouth doesn't defile your body and it was from Jesus but where does it say that we should have spoke Jesus Christ people five verse number seven to twenty it says if you want to enter the Kingdom of Heaven you have to follow all the laws and Commandments of the Old Testament same thing what you have doesn't defile that does not overrule that you should not follow the laws and command the Old Testament where does it say Jesus Christ people cannot contradict if you break one jot or Turtle Gospel of Matthew chapter 5 verse number seven to twenty I have come not to destroy I've come not to destroy but to fulfill anyone who breaks one of the least Commandments He Shall be Called least in the Kingdom of Heaven whosoever shall keep the Commandments and teach men to do so will because get in the Kingdom of Heaven unless the righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the sky than the Pharisees in no way shall you enter the kingdom of heaven so here Jesus Is Telling even if you break one jot or title from the Old Testament you shall not enter Jannah you should not enter Paradise so where did Jesus Christ say that you have to have poke well sir as I told you he again mentions that it doesn't defile your body of what goes does they talk about poke no sir but it's clearly mentioned in the gospel of Matthew chapter 5 verse number 7 to 20. if you don't understand English it's whose problem your problem my problem in the Bible Book of Leviticus chapter 11 verse 7 to 8 book of Deuteronomy Chapter 14 verse number eight in the book of either chapter 65 verse number two to five says it should not have spoke so if I don't have poke am I following Jesus I'm better than you or not so I also follow New Testament even I follow New Testament no one does the New Testament say nowhere that Jesus Christ will be upon saying the New Testament to have spoke where does it say give me the reference he in specific doesn't tell to have I want to follow specific when specific Old Testament says you should not have never will Jesus Christ peace be upon Him contradict anything from the Old Testament if you contradict that means he's lying in Gospel of Matthew chapter 5 verse number 17. because he says I've come not to destroy the law of the prophets I've come not to disturb but to fulfill fulfill me follow everything of the Old Testament so why do you want to make Jesus Christ peace be upon him a liar no sir I definitely not tell him so please go back home read stop having pork stop having alcohol believe in one God don't do idle worship believe me the messenger of God and not God and that will take the devil out of you inshallah hope that answers the question God bless you sir everyone [Music]"
