  "transcript": "Allah says in the Quran in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse number 108 revile not those abuse not those who they worship besides Allah abuse not those who they worship besides Allah lest in the ignorance they will abuse Allah subhana wa tala our Quran does not give you permission to abuse revile criticize Gods who they worship is Allah lest in their ignorance they will abuse Allah subhana tala while doing dawa you should never abuse or degrade the gods who they worship even it may not be the true God you are not supposed to abuse or revile it lest in the ignorance they will abuse Allah subhana tala if you understand the concept of God in religion and if we spad this correct concept of God in Islam in Christianity in Judaism in Hinduism in parm in sism it's the same this is the only factor that can unite all the human beings under one manner under one umbrella if we agree that our creator our sustainer our cherisher is the same one God our differences will be resolved but due to passage of time the followers of the religion have deviated from the true concept so it's our duty to get them back to the original concept and the Brotherhood which the Quran speaks about the word Arabic word is umah when we call about the Brotherhood the Arabic word used in the Quran is umah the Brotherhood that Quran speaks about does not only travel horizontally throughout the world that all the human beings in the world are brothers it even goes vertically up and vertically down this Brotherhood includes all the Believers who were there in the past and all the Believers who will come in the future so this Brotherhood of faith of Iman which the Quran speaks about the umah includes all the Believers in this world all the Believers that came in the past and all the Believers that will come in the future and this Brotherhood of faith is far superior even than the Brotherhood of Blood relationship Quran tells us and I quoted many verses that you have to respect your parents Allah says in Sur is chapter number 17 verse number 23 and 24 that we have ordained for you that you worship only one God and that you be kind to your parents and if one of them or both of them Reach old age do not say o to them do not say a word of contempt but rather low to them your wing of humility and address them in honor and pray to the Lord that cherish them as they cherish me in childhood Quran says you have to love your parents respect your parents and if they become old one or both of them do not say of to them because our creator knows that in old age the person becomes anile and may say or do things which may not be acceptable by normal human being but Allah says don't say off to them but rather pray to almighty God that bless them as they cherish me in childhood Allah says in Sur lman chapter number 31 vers number 14 that we have enjoined on the human beings to be kind to the parents in travel upon did the mother B you and in pain did she give you birth besides saying respecting and loving your parent that is Brotherhood of Blood relationship but Allah also says inah chapter number 9 verse number 24 say whether it be your fathers all your sons all your brothers all your spouses husband and wife all your relatives Allah says the weth that you are masked the business in which you deal the house in which you live if you love all these eight things your fathers your sons your spouses your relatives your brothers the wealthy of a m the business in which you deal the house in which you live all these eight things Allah continues if you of all these eight things more than Allah more than his rasool and more than doing Jihad striving and struggling in his way Allah says until Allah brings aboutto you and Allah gues not the fic people when he says you have to love and respect your par at the same time he says that if you love your father if you love your son if you love your brother if you love your wife if you love your relatives if you love The Wealthy of a m if you love the house in which you live if you love your business more than Allah his rasool and doing J in his way you wait until Allah brings about his destruction unto you and Allah guides not the fic people here Allah is giving importance to Allah his rasool and striving in his way more than your blood relationships Allah says inah number 4 vers 135 oh you believe stand out for justice as witnesses to Allah subhana wa ta'ala even if it be against yourself against your parents against your relatives whe they be rich or poor Allah protects all and we have several examples in the Quran great evident examples which prove that the Brotherhood of Iman the Brotherhood of faith is far superior even than the Brotherhood of Blood relationship"
