  "title": "Is it Sunnah to Cover Ones Head during Salaah? â€“ Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "the next question from arsalan kursid bihar india is covering one's head during salah or sunnah or a culture first we'll discuss whether covering the head is sunnah or a culture and then come to covering the head in salah there is a verse in the quran in surah araf chapter number 7 verse number 31 which says that oh children of adam take your adornments for every time and place of prayer telling to the bunny adam that take your adornments your beautiful apparels at the time of prayer and the place of prayer this is the only reference you get regarding the clothes of prayer in the quran as far as whether covering the head is a sunnah or a culture the difference opinion some group of scholars they say that covering the head is a sunnah some group of scholars says it's only cultural but all the scholars unanimously agree that if it is in the culture that covering the head is respectful then the muslims should cover the head but if it's not considered as respectful in the society by western society it may not be that respectful covering the head so then if you don't come it's okay but in india pakistan in the eastern part of the world in malaysia indonesia it is respectful to cover that so at that time it is better than you cover that so the scholars are divided whether it is a sunnah or not but according to nationals in albany sheknas with money he says that it is sunnah to cover your head and the prophet and the sabbath covered that islam he said the sahabas always covered that the prophet covered that so it is not from the to uncover your head so according to islam hypnothermia covering the head is assumed even upon with nikayu he says that the prophet won the turban without the cap he wore the cap without the turban and you find seville hadith we say that the prophet owed a turban the prophet or a black turban the prophet for a profit the prophet or a cab the prophet or a white cap there's seven hadith so based on these hadith this group of scholars say that it is not to cover that as far as i'm concerned also i believe that covering the sunnah irrespective whether you're in the eastern part of the world or whether in the western part of the world since the prophet covered the head since the son of god said i believe in those group of scholars that say that covering the haderson regarding the question of covering the head during salah is it sunnah is it a culture as far as covering that is concerned there is no proof no hadith no quranic verse that is referred to cover the head during salah so it is very clear-cut that covering the head is not a further while offering salah it's not a requirement but those scholars who believe that covering their generally is a sunnah they also say that covering the head is mustab during salah imagine if a person comes from the western part of the world and he wants to be a mom in india or pakistan and he uncovers his head it would be very weird because this part of the world covering that is not only a culture they consider it a sunnah that's the reason even if the muslims when they don't cover the head in the normal times in india pakistan bangladesh at least by salah they cover that but recently in the last few years five or ten years you find many of the muslims coming from gulf countries and they want to show the people that they have knowledge and because it's not further to cover head and salah now you find people reading sallah in the mosque without covering that previously maybe 15-20 years back 99 percent of the people in the mosque always they had were covered with cap orbit compulsory now you find at least 15 20 percent or maybe a little bit more because they have gone to gulf country they come back and they want to show the people that they have knowledge so obviously they don't cover that while offering salah which is not a good practice if covering people consider covering the sunnah even if you don't belong to that group at least it's in the culture so at least we're offering salah then why they are going out of the way and praying sarah without covering your hand let me tell you it's not far to cover your head the prophet said only aura should be covered and if you have two pieces of cloth one piece of touch should be over your shoulders and the other piece of cloth should cover your aura this is the minimum requirement but natural according to many scholars covering their sunnah and even according to the hanafi school of thought covering the sunnah and according to many focus so i believe that company that is sunnah and a lot of things are also it should be covered and even when offering salah it is preferable that the head should become this is in reference to the gyms i'm talking about but naturally for the woman covering that is further in front of the number and offering sana also but natural for the woman covering the head at the front"
