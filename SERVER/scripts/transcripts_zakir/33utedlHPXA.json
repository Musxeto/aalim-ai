  "transcript": "Allah says in the Quran in Anam chapter number 6 verse 165 Allah says that he has given more sustainance to some of the human beings over the other some of the human beings Allah subhana wa ta'ala has given more sustainance as compared to the other Allah says this in Surah Nel chapter number 16 verse number 71 that he has favored some of the human beings over others in sustainance Allah repeats this message in Surah Anam chapter number 6 verse 165 that Allah subhana wa ta'ala has given more gifts to some of the individuals and based on what he has given you he will test you now there's a question that people ask that how can Allah subhana tala be just that some people are born in a poor family some people are born in a rich family some people are born healthy some people are born with diseases it is unjust Allah subhana wa tala is unjust how can he make this differentiation between different human beings we come to know that this world has life and death there is health and disease There Is wealth and poverty all these are tests and Allah says in the Quran in Surah anfal chapter number 8 verse number 28 Allah says that surely your wealth and your progeny your children are a test for you and Allah says in chapter number 63 verse number 9 that let not the wealth and your children deviate you from the remembrance of Allah subhana wa ta'ala Allah subhah wa ta'ala test different people in different way one of the test one of the best deed you ask anyone that what are the good deeds and the Good Deeds that all human beings whether they believe in God or not they'll say the Good Deeds are charity it is contentment charity will be there amongst the few that he names so how can almighty God test whether some people are charitable or not if all the people have the same wealth then where is the question of the test the test will only take place if some people are poor and some people are rich so Allah subhana tala test people in different ways maybe some people are born in a rich family they have a lot of wealth some people are born poor but the person who is Rich according to the Islamic Sharia one of the pillars of ISL is zakat that every rich person who has a saving of more than the nisab level 85 g of gold he or she should give 2.5% of that saving every lunar year in charity the person may be a millionaire may be a billionaire he may give the required amount then he will get passing marks he may not give the complete amount he may give portion small portion maybe 20% of what is required to give a part of what is required to give he will fail some people may not give zakat at all absolutely fail the poor person he does not have to give zakat at all he get full marks but we human we say oh b poor man you know so much problems he has in his life and we look up to the person who's rich our beloved Prophet said that it is more difficult for a rich man to enter Jenna than a poor man as the Quran says in Surah anal chter 8:28 that the wealth is a test for you it's a test we are fools that we think okay you know this person is Rich Allah has blessed him it's a test if he doesn't use the blessings which Allah has given him it's a blessing but the chances of him failing the test is very high for example in one of the question papers which came last year or two years before in 2002 a very difficult question came and most of the student could not reply next year that question does not appear it would be foolish for us to say oh how sad this question did not come you should be happy it did not come so wealth is a test so those people who don't have wealth it is actually easier for them to go to Jenna than a rich man so Allah test different people in different ways therefore Allah says that let not your wealth deviate you from the remembrance of Allah subhana wa taala it's a test for him"
