  "transcript": "regarding Hinduism compared to that is Islam in the Hinduism it is also said that there is only one God whereas the same is said in Quran also is it good to go with Islam or with Hinduism masha'allah it's a very good question brother says that he is a Hindu he knows the Hindu scripture says there's one God even Islam says there's one God is it better to follow Islam or is it better to follow Hinduism the reply is given in sole Imran chapter 3 verse 64 May almighty God says come to Common terms has been us and you so it is agreed to follow what is coming the first is now I'm giving you an answer that will satisfy both the Hindu and the Muslim the first step to do is where the follow what is coming what is different we'll discuss tomorrow so when you're following what is common in the Quran and the Hindu scriptures neither the Hindu will feel offended neither the Muslim will feel offended the problem is neither do the Hindus know neither do the Muslims know very well what is common in both the scriptures first thing most important is that you already know you already agree that there's one god alhamdulillah let's go to the other point the other point that is common is that Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him is the messenger of God the Muslims agree Prophet Muhammad messenger of God if you read the Hindu scriptures there are hundreds of references I can give you only from the Hindu scriptures talking about sallam I can give a talk time does not for me to give a long talk of a couple of hours but if you read the Hindu scriptures it's mentioned about the coming of Mama it's mentioned twenty seven about sallam it's mentioned 21 to 23. [Applause] number 20. he is called as Ahmad means one who praises that was the other name of prophet Muhammad sallam he is mentioned my name as Ahmad in Psalm with uttarchik Mantra number 1500 he's mentioned as Ahmad in some ways Indra chapter number two verse number 152 he is also mentioned in yeah book number eight hymn number six verse number ten he's mentioned book number eight hymn number five verse number 16 book number 20 hymn number 126 verse number 14. he is mentioned by name as narashansa in Sanskrit means I [Music] can keep on and on quoting only references from the Hindu scripture about so if you are a good Hindu you should believe in Prophet Muhammad I'll just give you one reference more about he is mentioned in kalki purana chapter number two verse number four five seven eleven and fifteen it says that this kalki purana is the last and final antim Rishi is the last and final messenger his father's name will be Vishnu Yas Vishnu means god he asked me servant it's me servant of God in Arabic it's Abdullah and you know the name of prophet father was Abdullah it mentioned his mother's name would be sumathi Serenity in Arabic it's Amina and that was the name of the mother of prophet Muslim state he'll be born in the city of Peace referring to Makkah he'll be born in the family of the priest of that City we know was born in the family of quresh he will be a universal antim Rishi he'll be Universal as the Quran says in Surah chapter 21 verse 107. that we have sent thee not but as a Mercedes whole of humanity to all the world to all the creatures it prophesies that he will get the Revelation in a mountain we know he got the Revelation it says he will migrate northwards and come back migrated from Makkah to Madina northwards and came back it further says that he will have for companion is talking about the first kulfur rashidin um [Music] so all these prophecies mentioned in the scriptures point to No One But the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad so if you are a good Hindu besides believing in one God you also have to believe in the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him it's mentioned in both the scriptures that you should not have alcohol Quran says chapter 5 verse number 19 not to have alcohol it's mentioned Manu smriti chapter number nine verse number 235 you should not have alcohol chapter number nine verse number 238 you shouldn't have alcohol number 11 verse number 55 chapter number 11 verse number 94 should not have alcohol so if you're a Hindu or a Muslim you should not have alcohol both the scriptures say that you should not gamble so remember chapter 5 verse 19 the Quran says that manuscript chapter number nine verse number 221 to 228 says it should not Gamble if you read the rigved book Number 10 hymn number 34 Verse number 3 to 13 says you should not Gamble so if you are a good Hindu you should at least follow what is coming and the basic thing in both the scriptures that there's one God he has got no image he has got no Idol and Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of this almighty God the last and final messenger so I would tell you initially follow both and after that your scripture says that follow the last and final messenger that means we follow the Hadith of the messenger Prophet Muhammad sallallahu and the last and final Revelation which was given to him do you believe that there's one God yes sir do you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God yes sure hundred percent mashallah so these two things these two things brother are sufficient for you to enter the fold of Islam to enter the fold of Islam and after that you have to read the message and the guidance of this messenger and what was revealed to this messenger that is the Quran and the sahadi sir I have another one small doubt can you my question brother but do you believe there's one God do you believe is a messenger of God yes sir these two are sufficient for you to enter the school of Islam sure doubts will always be there okay then thank you no but I'm asking the question do you believe in these two things yes do you have some doubt that before that you want to yes I do want to ask one more question one more question yeah in Islam it is stated that there is no idol worship okay that is number one whereas in India I see people who are doing on this vertical uh dargas performing all types of pujas like Indians Hindus okay what is your answer for this brother you are a Hindu you told me yes you know that mentioned in your scripture idol worship is wrong yes yes yet in India I know millions of Hindus who do idol worship yes that means they are not following the scripture similarly agree with you there are many Muslims in India who are not following Quran and Hadith that that is that is my question that is my question that is my answer that is my answer like Hindus are not following the scriptures there are many Muslims are not following the scripture any Muslim who breaks any law of the Quran or any commandment of the Prophet Muslim he's not about Muslim but brother I want to tell you that you want to be a practicing Hindu no yes no practicing means you believe that almighty God does not have any idols yeah I do accept that there is no ideal worship and you believe Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God yes so do you want to enter into the fall of Islam yes please but there is anyone forcing you to accept Islam is anyone forcing you to accept Islam nothing said I have come on my own Masha so do you have a free will 101 percent masha'allah so inshallah I will I will say Arabic and repeat it inshallah sure go ahead Allah I bear witness I bear witness bad that there is no God there is no God but Allah but Allah and I bear witness and I bear witness that that Prophet Muhammad prophet Muhammad is is the messenger of Allah the messenger of Allah and give you the best in this world foreign"
