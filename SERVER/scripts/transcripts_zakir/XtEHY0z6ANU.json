  "transcript": "this is a question from a non-muslim \naudience her question states that we   see on television many women being tortured \nin Afghanistan why do Muslim men torture or   degrade women in Islam sister that's the \nquestion that we see on the television   you know that Afghanistan Muslim men are \ntorturing women so why in Islam Muslim   men torture and negate the woman sister this \nquestion was replied just a few days earlier   on the second day of the conference on Saturday \non Saturday 31st of October I gave a talk woman   in Islam protected or subjugated and I gave \nthe talk in detail so ask your friend to   watch that tape watch the DVD inshallah it \nwill answer all the queries regarding your   main point that she saw on the television that in \nAfghanistan Muslim men they are beating the woman and once when I was traveling I came across \na Malaysian couple both of them were doctors   they said that they spent more than a month \nin Afghanistan and they told me that what   they saw on television the talibans \nbeating the woman they aren't talibans   so I asked them how do you know they told me \nthat we have been in Afghanistan we have spent   more than a month we know how the Taliban tied \nthe turban you know when we see an Arab we feel   all Arabs the same emirati Saudi Kuwaiti but \nthey themselves know that a Saudi Tales the   qatra in a different way and emirati ties in a \ndifferent style if you go to a Kuwaiti different   style so similarly the talibans they have a \nparticular style of time determined so what   she told and what she told the couple that what \nthey shot even that they didn't do properly that   means they could shoot The Parting of the \nsea in Hollywood you know Ten Commandments   Moses peace be upon a party of the sea but \nthey made a fault when they show Muslim men   in Afghanistan between the women so therefore \nthe Quran says chapter number 49 verse number   six whenever you get the information you check \nit up before you pass around to the third person   what we realize this is the gimmick of the media \nand in the last conference 2008 my last talk was   media and Islam war of peace and I showed how \nthe media goes out of the way to Milan Islam   I'm not saying all Muslims 100 good Muslims there \nare black sheeps in a community but what the media   does picks up this black sheep and portray as \nthose exemplary Muslims and many a time they   show things which absolutely nonsense it does not \nexist in Islam so ask your friend to watch my tape   woman writes in Islam protector subjugated \nand media and Islam war of peace [Applause]"
