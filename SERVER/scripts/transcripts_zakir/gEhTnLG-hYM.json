  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum wum Salam I am ha from Pakistan why Allah has revealed four Islamic books or Revelations why did he not complete his religion in one book as he knows the knowledge of future he could have revealed only one book which could be useful for all the periods of times like till K only Quran will be implemented upon so that there were no divisions in religion for let me correct you brother H that Allah has not revealed only four books Allah says in the Quran chapter number 13 verse number 38 Allah says in every age have we sent a revelation but by name only four are mentioned in the Quran the Torah the zabur the in and the Quran Torah is the the Revelation which was given to Moses peace be upon him is the the Revelation given to David peace be upon Him inel is the the Revelation which was given to Jesus peace be upon him and Quran is the last and final Revelation which was given to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him but there were many other Revelation besides these four which are mentioned in the Quran for example s ibraim the books given to Prophet ibraim peace be upon him but by name only four are mentioned in the Quran now your basic question that why did Allah reveal so many Revelation why doesn't reveal only one book and that's it till it's like my son telling me ABA father I want to become a doctor so why don't you admit me directly into a medical college why should I go to Nursery then go to kindergarten then go to First standard then primary school then secondary school and then go to a Medical College why don't you give me admission directly into a medical college so similarly Allah subhah wa ta'ala and his Divine wisdom he revealed best what was required at that time first he revealed the Torah then he revealed the Zur then he revealed the injil so Allah subhana ta'ala knows that earlier if we had revealed the Quran people may not be able to understand it may not be be able to follow it so what has Allah done when Allah knew at this age 14400 years ago at this time alhamdulillah human beings can understand the Quran and can follow it and can implement it so Allah and his Divine wisdom because he is the creator of the human being he knows it so when at the right time when Allah subhana tala realized 400 years ago that this is the time that human beings can absorb and can Implement he revealed it before that he revealed the other scriptures the basic message of was there but it was different so 1400 years ago Allah subhana tala reveal the last and final Revelation which Allah knew at this time the people can understand it can implement it and follow it so this is the hikma of Allah subhana wa ta'ala he revealed the other scriptures first and then last he revealed the last and final revelation of the last and final revelation of Allah subhana wa tala the Glorious Quran at the right and appropriate time hope they answer the question"
