  "transcript": "so fantastic I think we have something very common coming from all of you masha'Allah is the fact that we're talking about the month of ramadhan being a month of mercy so maybe we would our viewers would like to understand a little bit about why is called a month of mercy and in fact you know the theme of our event this here is remarkable upon so obviously mercy is a huge component on which the believers rely upon Allah Allah and the prophets blossom said nobody would enter into gender except at the mercy of Allah so if a Ramadan is such a special occasion for us what makes Ramadan this month of mercy how does it stand out from the rest of the eleven months in a year so maybe if we could throw some light on that please okay first of all the month of Ramadan is a season and like all seasons there is great things great deals that one can achieve when you have an a sale that's offering you 70% of the tag price that's a huge opportunity for us to buy for those who still have some cash to buy after the lack the lock down but and ham Dalila rama body itself is a big season to the extent that allah says whoever or the Prophet said as for some whoever fasts a day in the cause of Allah Allah will distant his face from Hellfire the journey of 70 years one day you fasted this what happens then what happens if I fast the whole month if you want to look at the blessings of Allah in this month and I would be any I would be unfair to my colleagues and the Messiah if I give it all in one yeah a topic and I start burning all of our cards but there are so many things whether you talk about charity and how the Prophet was I'm so charitable during the month of Ramadan whether you talk about the Koran whether you talk about the the the night prayer and the beauty of standing in front of allah azza wajal in submissiveness and expressing your poverty but all of this is summarized in expressing your service to a larger your slavery to Allah soldier this is the beauty of it and this is the utmost level of mercy when you believe in Ramadan that I am NOT a peer to Allah soldier I am a servant and a slave and whatever Allah does to me la Sol does what He wills so you feel the content the content in your heart to whatever is happening around you there's no mercy better than this but when you fail to find this content in your heart in your object and you start to whine and complain then the mercy is far away from you so I don't want to take the time from the Messiah who would love to leave what they have the beauty of Ramadan is symbolized in you acknowledging that Allah Azza WA JAL is your Lord and that you are his servant and that you are complying with whatever he tells you to do even if you are out of your comfort zone all of our lives decades of our lives were spent in the messages praying to Allah we bring tea am staying after fajar prayer until the schlock sitting between us ER and maghrib and opening or FR and breaking your fast in my written in the message so strong connection now we are saddened that we're not going to be doing this anymore this coming Ramadan but this is a test to all of us know whether we're doing this out of a bada or odda are we going to the message because we worship Allah soldier or it's just a habit are we offering night prayer because everyone else is doing it or because we love to now because you are in your home this is going to be a very very strong and serious test because the temptations in your home are far greater than in the Masjid if any so you'll have a new flavor to your mother in this coming Ramadan I pray to Allah Allah that he gives the strength the sincerity and the success to worship Him as he loves and not to fail in the test of our being alone not being watched by others accept him as elegant I mean"
