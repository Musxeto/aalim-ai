  "transcript": "Ishaq from India Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh, Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, I had a question. So what if a person let's say has a source of income Let's say he's salaried, but he has a lot of expenses to take care of And he has a lot of debts and by the end of the month His salary is almost zero or he only manages to make little savings So is this person eligible to receive the zakat money from her from his wife on her gold? If this person is unable to make ends meet Which means that at the end of the month he has zero in his hand Yet he needs to buy groceries to pay the rent to pay electricity bills, but he cannot afford this Then he's eligible to take his wife's Zakat on her gold or on her cash and Allah knows best"
