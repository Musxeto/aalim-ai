  "transcript": "Maaz from the UK. So Sheikh, whenever I've heard the Prophet ﷺ saying that do the opposite of what Jews and Christians do, I've taken this to be a must, a fard on us. So I was just confused about a hadith where he said that dye your hair because they don't do this. So I'm not sure what does this actually mean? Do we like make our hairs red, blue or what does this actually mean? Jazak Allah Khair. First of all, the instruction to go against the Jews and the Christians and the idol worshippers, usually this is an order. And in Islam, in Usulul Fiqh, the order verb is an indication of obligation unless there is another evidence that reduces it to recommendation. So an example, the Prophet ﷺ says, I used to forbid you from visiting graveyards, now visit them because it reminds you of the hereafter. The verb visit them is an order. So by default, any order is an obligation. But the scholars of Usul say, well actually this is true unless there is evidence to reduce it into a recommendation. What is the evidence? The evidence is any order that comes after a restriction, this restores it to the case it was before the restriction. So before prohibiting us from visiting the graveyards, what was the scenario? They used to go to graveyards if they wanted, this is not obligatory, this is not prohibited, it's permissible. So after the prohibition was uplifted by the order, it takes the same ruling before the prohibition which is permissibility. Another case, Allah says in the Quran, Fa-itha halaltum, fastado. Once you are out of the state of Ihram, you may hunt. Fastado is an instruction, a verb, go and hunt. So does this mean when I clip my hair or shave my hair after Ihram, I take my shotgun or my rifle and go and look for a game to shoot? No. Because before Ihram, which is a prohibition for hunting, what was the ruling? Hunting is permissible. It's neither obligatory nor recommended, it's just permissible. In this case it goes back to the same status. Now, coming back to your question. The Prophet says, alayhi salatu was salam, go against the Jews and the Christian idol worshippers, grow your beard, honor your beard, let go of your beard. Any hadith reducing this to a recommendation? Nope. Then it's a must, it's mandatory. Okay, the Prophet said, go against the Jews and the Christians and dye your white hair for they do not dye. Okay, this is an order. Any hadith reducing it, the answer is yes. One, the Prophet himself had white hairs, he did not dye. Two, the Prophet himself said that do not pluck the white hairs you have on your face or on your hair because they will come as light on the Day of Judgment. And many others. So these hadiths show us that having a white beard or white hair is okay. The recommendation is that you dye it. How to dye it? You can dye it with any color that is suitable and that does not make you stand in a crowd. Nobody says okay, what about green or pink? No, this is a little bit, a new wave type of colors. The norm is to dye it with brown or with hinnah as it is the recommendation in so many things in the Sunnah. So hinnah is quite reddish sort of or orange color. So if you mix it with al-katm, it becomes dark brown but the prohibition is from dyeing your hair with black and this is totally prohibited and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
