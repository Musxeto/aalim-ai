  "transcript": "unas from Germany so um if we if we pray behind n and we like 80% certainty doesn't purify himself properly is the prayer valid or not I don't understand if if we pray behind an IM you know and we like 80% certainty doesn't purify himself properly mashallah you went with him to the toilet no but I know him very very well well this 80% of yours is still doubtful and you can't keep on judging people like this because he would on the other hand say I will never pray behind you because your head is full of OCD and doubts and weird ideas you're not qualified to lead the IM the the Salat as well so no 80% is not uh a valid percentage and you have to pray behind him"
