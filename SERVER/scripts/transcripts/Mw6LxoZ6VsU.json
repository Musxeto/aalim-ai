  "title": "Is it permissible to diet in Ramadan or have that intention in your mind to lose weight with fasting",
  "transcript": "my question is is it permissible to have the intention other than fasting in ramadan but also to like lose weight is that okay nutty man from lebanon she says if we intend to fast but at the same time we have the intention of losing weight is this permissible there's nothing wrong in that if i were to ask you and say what are you doing you wouldn't never say i'm losing weight you would say i'm fasting so losing weight is a byproduct of fasting but your main intention is to fast yes i love to fast because it gets me closer to allah it furthers my face 70 years away from hellfire and it helps me lose weight there's nothing wrong in that insha allah"
