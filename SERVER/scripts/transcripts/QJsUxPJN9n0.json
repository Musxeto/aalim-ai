  "title": "Can a young person who has white hair dye hair black (teens, 20s, 30s)",
  "transcript": "amateur life from the uk um my question is um if you've been getting random white hairs growing in your hair since your late teens um is this considered a defect and are we allowed to color them using hair dye because i know um you can't dye the hair black but if the the hair dye is like a different shade of black like soft black or light black is this permissible can you repeat the question uh how old is that person um in the early 30s and they they have white hair yeah like random white hairs in like since their teens they have been getting the random white house coming out so is that considered a defect okay and if it is can we dye it using a hair dye that is like different shades of black okay first of all it's a rule in sharia that a defect can be removed so it's not changing the creation of allah a person has a sixth finger instead of five so is it permissible to operate and restore the norm back to his hand the answer is yes a person is born with a crooked lip or a rabbit lip i don't know what it's called in english and it's a defect by birth can we do surgery to restore a normal look definitely yes likewise a teenager in his teens or early twenties and he has random white hair his hair is black there's no problem in dyeing the hair black because this is not cheating others like when someone in my case dyes his hair black and i look okay whoa if i dye my hair black i would look like 25 or 30 years younger because till now alhamdulillah the grace of allah i don't have any apparent wrinkles on my face so people would think that if i have black hair black beard that i may be 30 years of age or 35 years of age that puts some uh takes off some mileage off of me which is okay good no this is cheating haram but a person who's in his teens or early twenties to do that this is totally permissible in their thirties this is when white hair starts to appear and that would be a little bit dubious and therefore it's best not to do it however you can change that i can change that avoiding black so if i dye my beard with dark brown yes if you under the spotlights in the sun you can see it's dark brown or reddish there's no problem in that it's totally halal but to diet in black this is what is not permissible and i hope this answers your question you"
