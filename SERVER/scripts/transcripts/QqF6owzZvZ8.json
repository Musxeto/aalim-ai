  "transcript": "Yassin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I wanted to ask you like if can you pray Salah which is not prescribed for example I feel like I want to pray two rakat to Allah and it's in a period of time where there's no prayer like between Isha and Fajr for example. Jazak Allah Khairan Between Isha and Fajr this is a recommended time to offer as many prayers as you wish. This is known as Qiyamul Layl. Your question would be logical if you were to ask me what's the ruling on praying between Asr and sunset or after Fajr prayer before sunrise if I just feel like praying two rakahs. Here I would say no these are time of prohibition. You cannot pray at these specific times where the Prophet told us Alayhis Salaam not to pray any prayer that has no justification or a legitimate reason. What are these times? After you pray your Asr until the sun sets and after you pray your Fajr until the sun rises by 10 to 15 minutes and just five minutes before the Adhan of Dhuhr when the sun is at the meridian exactly on top of your head and Allah knows best. you"
