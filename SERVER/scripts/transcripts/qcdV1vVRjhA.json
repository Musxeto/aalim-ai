  "title": "Repent for speaking without knowledge for advising a standing man to pray 2 rakat Tahiyatul masjid?",
  "transcript": "Ilyas from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Ya Rabbi Sheikh I was sitting next to a man in the masjid and he was standing up waiting for Salah So I wanted to promote Al-Mu'uf and I said it's best when you come that you make two rakats but he told me if he makes then he has to break his Salah when the Adhan starts for Ikamah so I said you can make your Salah and then finish it then just join but he spoke of a Hadith where the Prophet ﷺ said you must break whatever you're doing and join I said accept that for the Salah and I think I did speak without knowledge but could Sheikh explain on this ruling and must I repent for speaking without knowledge to Allah? You have to repent to Allah Azza Wa Jal for speaking without knowledge. First of all, if I come to a masjid and I just don't want to pray two rakats, I just want to stand, I don't like people to poke into my own business and say Akhi, it's best if you pray two rakats, JazakAllah khair, it's best for you to read a chapter of the Qur'an. So it's best to stay out of people affairs because the Prophet ﷺ said in the Hadith and correct me if I'm wrong, when one of you enters the masjid he must not sit down until he prays two rakats. Okay, did I sit down? No. So why are you telling me to pray two rakats? Akhi, it's best to do so and so. I said yeah but it's best to mind your own business with all due respect Zani. I want to stand, what's eating you up? So this is point one. Point two, the brother's concern is not legit. If he were to ask me, Sheikh if I enter the masjid and the iqamah is maybe in a minute or so, what is best for me, to pray two rakats and when the iqamah is done I break it or to remain standing up? Personally, no, go ahead with the two rakats. There is a huge possibility if you pray it in a bit quick fashion that you will finish it and the iqamah is not done. In so many times you see people standing up hoping that the iqamah is going to be made in about 40-50 seconds and it takes like five minutes and they start you know swirling right and left because they're tired of standing up. You should have prayed but you chose not to, it's your right, it's none of my business. So he should have prayed two rakats and if the iqamah was done while he's in the first rakah, he breaks his prayer. If the iqamah was done while he's in the second rakah, he can conclude his prayer before the imam starts the takbir and it's a win-win situation and Allah knows best."
