  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Salam wa Rahmatullah. So I want to ask you a question about Zakah. If someone wants to give Zakah in another country, and you have to pay fees to transfer the money, and when you transfer to the person that is going to be receiving the Zakah, let's say there are like five of them, the bank also charges for transfer. So does that come out of the Zakah money, or it has to come outside of the Zakah money? JazakAllah khair. So basically, a person's Zakah is approximately, let's say $100. And in order to transfer it to another country, they have to pay $7 or $10. So should they send $90 as Zakah and $10 as a service charge or transfer charge? Or should they pay $110 where the $10 goes for the transfer money and the $100 is the Zakah? The answer is the latter. You cannot deduct from the Zakah the transfer money or the service charges. You have to give the Zakah as it is, and it has to reach the poor and the needy and those who are entitled to receive it as it is. Whatever extra charges there are, you have to pay them from your own pocket."
