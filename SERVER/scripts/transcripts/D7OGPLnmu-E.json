  "transcript": "That is what was hated by the Prophet ﷺ. And finally, the Prophet ﷺ hated to delay and postpone good deeds. One day he was praying, leading the prayer in Asr prayer, and all of a sudden after he finished the prayer, he immediately stood up and went to one of his homes. And the companions were frightened by the speed of the Prophet ﷺ after concluding the prayer. Not saying the Adhkar, immediately standing up, there must have been something wrong. So when he came back, they told him, Oh Prophet of Allah, we were frightened by the speed that you stood up. We thought that there was something wrong happening. What was it? The Prophet ﷺ said, I remembered some raw gold that was given to me before Salat for Sadaqah, for charity, and I did not like the idea, the notion, that it was in my possession this long. So immediately after Asr, I just went and ordered it to be given in means of charity. And this shows you that one must not delay good deeds. When are you going to take Umrah? Oh, Inshallah, next month, maybe the month before. Why not now? When are you going to memorize the Qur'an? Maybe after Hajj. When are you going to wear the Hijab, oh sister? She said, Inshallah, when I reach 40. This is not what the Prophet ﷺ used to do. He used to hasten to doing good things and never delay or postpone them. We have a short break. Stay tuned and Inshallah we'll be right back."
