  "transcript": "[Music] so basically something happened to someone i know and they were wondering if they've uh committed act of shirk so what happened is that um there was an instagram post and they wanted to comment under it but then they were kind of thinking whether or not that would bring more benefit and they didn't want to analyze too long so what they did is that um they decided they'll go and see if their comment is still there if it is they'll go ahead and comment and if it's not then um they will take that as a sign that they shouldn't and something like that and then a few seconds after they did that they realized that this is similar to what um to throwing arrows and they were wondering if that's checked okay i will answer inshallah pay down is it shirk to check the comments you had done on an instagram post to see if it's useful or not there's no shirk in it and lots of the people have a a big issue of ocd when it comes to shirk sheikh is holding the pen in this way different than holding it in this way and would i be committing shirk if i do this the shirk is to associate others with allah where is the shirk in it no i don't know because i had the whispers of shaytan he's telling me if you don't do this his shirk so if i do it he says nah you listen to me now it's shirk and if i don't do it he says he didn't do it you have to say the shahada and it's a vicious circle that shaytan messes up with your head big time he's playing with you like children play with the football exactly tossing it to one another he's laughing he's having a good time and all due to you you"
