  "transcript": "So we have Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Qaqusi? Dobro Alhamdulillah Sheikh Qaqusi Alhamdulillah Yes Sir? Mashallah Sheikh if we help someone in the past to do a sin by giving them something haram or showing them a way to do it or something like that and we repented from that is it a condition for our repentance to be accepted to tell them what we did for them is haram especially if those people have much bigger sins in their lives and our warning for them would not stop them from doing this particular haram Barakallahu Fikum Barakallahu Fikum First of all part of your repentance is to try and rectify the sins that you have made and collaborated upon to the best of your ability but if you know that these individuals would not pay heed and they would not even listen to you and they have bigger fish to fry than these trivial things or they would mock you and make fun of Islam no reminding people who would be benefiting from it is a must those who do not benefit and there is no value of speaking to them in the first place it is not mandatory and Allah knows best"
