  "title": "OCD with urine incontinence & how to remove doubts",
  "transcript": "Alzam from India. Sir, Sheikh, my question to you is, I am suffering from urine incontinence, which lasts only after I answer the call of nature, and later on during my whole day, I get doubts whether I am in purity or not. I wash myself every time before I pray. I am getting doubts. I am not sure whether I am in purity or not. What should I do? You should ignore all of this, Akhi, because there is a legal maxim in Islam that governs mostly everything in our lives. This major Fiqh rule states that certainty is not affected by doubt. When you make wudu, this is certain. You cannot say that I broke my wudu except with a certain action. So, you pass wind, you hear a sound, you find a smell, you drop drops of urine that are visible, not just a feeling. This breaks your wudu. Other than that, a mere feeling is a speciality of shaytan. This is how shaytan is messing up with your head. The sad news is that you are the one who is allowing him to do this. You are opening the door and inviting him in. Shaytan has no control over you, but you are listening to him and responding to his call. So, you have to close this door and assume that certainty is not affected by such doubts. How do we know it's doubts? When you hear yourself repeating these phrases, I feel something came out, I think that I've dripped, I'm not certain but maybe something came out without me knowing, so I have to go and check. All of these are from shaytan. Once you urinate, no urine drops are coming, soak your private part with water, damp it with water, sprinkle water on your underwear and move on. Whenever you get this feeling, say to yourself, this is the water I damped my private part with and sprinkled on my underwear, it's nothing. If you keep on doing this without checking your underwear or your private part for four or five days, I guarantee you that this would leave you and you will be relieved. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
