  "transcript": "We have Mohammed from Pakistan. Mohammed. Then we haveâ€¦ Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. And you are? Mohammed from the UK. From the UK, not from Pakistan. Okay. What can I do for you, Mohammed? Sheikh, my question is regarding the ruling on the coin that's going to be released on the 1st of September in the UAE called the Islamic coin. So, it's a cryptocurrency that has gold backing alongside everyone knows the founder and has association to the UAE royal family. Jazak Allah Khairan. Jazak Allah Khairan. This is something I have no knowledge of. Generally speaking, cryptocurrency and the likes are not permissible due to the great huge ambiguity surrounding it and the lack of financial backing from central banks and financial institutions. This is why till date the vast majority of scholars say it is not permissible to deal with it. Until we see this currency in the market being dealt and accepted by central banks and the vast majority of the population on earth, they accept it and it is stable and no ambiguity surrounding it, this becomes permissible. The thing is if it is backed by gold and if it's backed by other currencies, why have it in the first place? What's the point in having another currency that is backed by gold or backed by dollar or euro or any other currency if it's going to carry the same backing and level of trust? Might as well go to the dollar, to the euro or to the dinar or the dirham. Why take this new gimmick just because it's something new? It doesn't make any sense. So, we have to wait and see who accepts it, where is it being exchanged, who can deal with it. If it's acceptable worldwide, then it is like any other currency and Allah knows best."
