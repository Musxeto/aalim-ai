  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bosnia. Sheikh, if one \nhas a halal job and the company asks him   to post his work on their Facebook page, \nand the work is halal from this person,   but the page has some Haram stuff from other \nadmins, would it be permissible for this person to   become one of the admins and only post his halal \nworks without ever sharing this page or telling   people to visit it? Barak-Allahu-Feekum Sheikh. \nWa-Barak-Allahu-Feekum. Unfortunately, this is   very common nowadays in many companies that are \ninvolved in halal activities, yet they insist on   including some of the haram activities as well. So \nif a person has a halal task in a halal company,   and he's instructed to share his products \nor his line of work on a Facebook page   which may include other haram stuff, but the \nmaterial he's posting is his and it's halal,   I pray to Allah Azza Wa Jal that this is halal \nas well and Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala knows best."
