  "title": "Main Duas for Protection from Evil Eye & Black Magic? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "my question is that sudha tv is broadcasting the program fortress of the muslim may allah reward you for that as there are many to us to recite so my question is can you please highlight the name of the duas only that i should respect protection from the evil and black magic this is a little bit difficult because no one can pinpoint exactly what will protect you from evil eye or black magic or gin as this is a package deal the minimum we do is the last three hulls and ayatel kursi these are the crown of all duas of protection and then there is the dua dunya to the rest so these are highly uh graded duas but the more you do the more you're protected and there isn't one single dua that would suffice otherwise what's the need of the others so you try your level best to memorize them all to dedicate 15 to 20 minutes after fajr prayer and maghrib prayer or as a prayer depending for your athkar and say it and inshaallah you'll be fine you"
