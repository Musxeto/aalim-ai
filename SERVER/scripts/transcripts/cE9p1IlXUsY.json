  "transcript": "[Music] the following question is what to say to someone who says they're not celebrating new year but are attending parties because it's just their day off first of all we have to understand that a muslim has his own identity this was clearly illustrated and portrayed when the prophet allah came to medina migrated from makkah to medina and he found that the people of medina were celebrating a feast so he asked about it and they told him that this is a feast we've been celebrating for ages so the prophet haslam prohibited them from doing this and said allah the almighty has substituted you with two days to feast and celebrate every year the eid of futher and the eid of al-abha so there is no such celebrations for us muslims except in these two festivals these are religious feasts so when a muslim degrades himself and celebrates christmas new years halloween easter thanksgiving and the whole nine yards that are not related to his culture or religion then he has fallen into sin some people say that we gather on new year's eve because it's a public holiday so it's a chance for me to get together with my cousins and my relatives and we gather for a dinner or a get-together i would personally recommend that you don't do this why we're not celebrating new year's we're not celebrating christmas we're not doing any of their rituals we're not putting any trees and lighting it and some socks by the fireplace for santa to come and put his gifts no we're just gathering this bit by bit would lead you to celebrate how resembling the disbelievers in their events even if you have a good intention is not permissible it was reported in muslim that a man came to the prophet asking him permission to fulfill his vow in sacrificing a camel in an area known as bowana so it is some distance out of medina so the prophet asked him two questions number one is there any idol being worshipped he said no then the second question is there any feast for the idol worshipers or the disbelievers that they gather on that particular day or event or place the man said no so the prophet says islam fulfill your vow which means that resembling though i'm slaughtering for the sake of allah but because there's an idol people who don't know you may think that you're sacrificing for the idol people who don't know you think that you are slaughtering this animal to feast with them on their day of holiday or feast therefore the prophet prohibited that ali other than that it's permissible and hence if you gather and have parties and enjoy yourself just because it's new year's eve and it's a day off those who don't know you would think that you are celebrating new year's and this is prohibited allah knows best you"
