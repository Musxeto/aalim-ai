  "transcript": "So Brother Yahya says, if I pray Isha and Fajr in a Musalla which is a prayer hall or a prayer room in congregation, do I get the rewards for praying the whole night or is this only applicable for a masjid? It goes without saying that praying in the masjid is far greater than praying in a prayer hall and the reward is more superior. Nevertheless, the hadith in Sahih al-Imam Muslim which was narrated by Sayyidina Uthman Ibn Affan, may Allah be pleased with him, says that whoever prays Isha in congregation and not necessarily in masjid, the hadith says whoever prays Isha in congregation as if he has prayed half of the night and whoever prays Fajr or Subh in congregation as if he had prayed the whole night. So Inshallah, this is also applicable to those who pray in a Musalla or a prayer hall. Ameen."
