  "title": "Why do Imam in the Haram look forward or at the microphones instead of looking at prostration spot",
  "transcript": "i want to ask that as we know that we have to put i'm looking our eyes into the place of sujood right when while yes correct so as we know that many of the mosques have microphones so when the imam resides in the microphone his eyesight is straight as we see in the haram navy many places so what's the ruling on this okay i will answer inshallah finally um why do people in the haram and some imams when they recite not look at the position of prostration and look forward this is their their problem not mine you're asking me how did the prophet pray i'm telling you you're asking me what's the right way to pray i'm telling you have to look at your area of prostration if these imams do otherwise then they're not following the sunnah and not necessarily everything they do is according to the sunnah they are human beings they're not great scholars of islam that are followed in every single thing they do first of all second of all some of them as i've heard because they recite the quran they want their voices to be beautifully uh coming out so they have to raise their heads and look in front and this is a lame excuse no way that you go against the way of the prophet assam and say that well this is for necessity it's like people when they recite and they want to go for record some imams do this they go to the microphone everybody is in roku and the guy is just interested in his voice coming to the microphone and then he goes for the court this is totally bogus and not from the sunnah so follow the sunnah do not follow the people and allah you"
