  "transcript": "Ahmed from the U.S. My question is, what is the best way to buy a car from a dealership? Where? In the U.S. Okay, first of all, I don't know how they deal in the U.S. because to my limited knowledge, they do not sell you a car directly without getting it financed through a bank, and this is a riba interest-based loan. It is prohibited. If there is a bank, that is, if there is a car dealer that is willing to sell you this Escalade V for $150,000 cash, and if you're unable to pay it cash, they're willing to take $175,000 over the duration of five years, not a penny more, and no penalty for late fee penalty. So $175,000 is fixed. It cannot be increased. They're the one who's selling it to you because they trust you, they have guarantees, etc., but the price is fixed. There's no problem in that. Is there any who does such a thing? I have no idea. You have to look around, but I very much doubt it. The other way that is found there is to lease a car, and this is what most people do. They lease a car for two, three years, dump the car, and then lease another one. So they do not actually buy a car. Rather, they lease a car and pay a monthly payment without the intention to possess it or own it, and again, if this is a fixed amount that you pay every month and they take care of the maintenance like any rented car, there's no problem in that, inshallah, and Allah knows best."
