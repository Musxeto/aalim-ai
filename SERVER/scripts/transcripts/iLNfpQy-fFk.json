  "transcript": "Sahib from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is that is it permissible to work in a neo bank like Revolut? Yes, neo banks are different than traditional banks because it generates its revenue through card and interchange fees, subscription plans and foreign exchange and wealth services. So will my income be halal if I work in like Revolut? I cannot judge such a bank without looking into their transactions. The bulk transactions and income of conventional banks are from riba loans, from interest-based loans. So no matter what other subsidiaries they have or small transactions, wire transfer or buying and selling, the main job of a conventional bank is interest. They give you money and they charge riba on that depending on the duration and the amount of the money. And this money is not theirs. It's a depositor's money that they've kept with the bank and the bank is giving them a small portion of such interest. So to them it's a win-win. We are giving the depositor's interest, 1%, 2% and we're charging those we've lent 5%, 7% and the difference is profit. This is totally haram. So I can't judge this institution whether it's halal to work for or not until I look into it and Allah knows best."
