  "title": "Are we hypocrites or apostates if we don't love some acts of worship or find them difficult?",
  "transcript": "if there are some uh acts of worship in islam which are difficult and compared to others for example fasting or maybe waking up for fajr prayer or doing tawaf in hajj so how does someone go about loving these acts of worship and if they don't love do they become apostates first of all we have to address if these people are muslims or not because your love of allah makes everything else easy so a person who finds fasting difficult who finds prayer a form of hardship who does not understand the benefit or the logic be behind going seven times around this black structure in mecca why would we do hajj why would we shave our heads this person is not a real muslim these questions come in the mind of a hypocrite they such resentment can be present in the mind of a an apostate real muslim doesn't have these feelings yes we may find it a bit difficult to wake up at four o'clock am to pray but we don't have any resentment or hatred yes we may fast for 19 hours a day if we are up north and we find this difficult but even the children they love it because they're doing it for the sake of allah nobody has this inner feeling of resentment or this is difficult why why not like other religions you just do the crossing you're forgiven nobody thinks like this except someone who has the seeds of hypocrisy or he is a full-fledged hypocrite so this is a cause of alarm and one should really go back and check upon himself and about upon his iman allah knows best you"
