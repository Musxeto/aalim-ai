  "title": "Should a woman accept a proposal from a man who is knowledgeable but not financially capable?",
  "transcript": "juelia says in choosing a spouse which is the best option to choose for a female one he's stronger than her in Deen but not financially capable - he's financially capable but with lesser knowledge in the deal compared to the lady please note that the lady is not financially capable again - because she lost her money and job in her previous marriage well this is not something easy to give a straightforward answer if a person is financially settled and capable but his knowledge is not as strong as his wife this doesn't mean anything knowledge does not mean anything extra in a marriage this is a marriage not an academic academic institution or university you're getting married you're not going there for a degree so what counts is not his knowledge but rather his religious practicing if he is literally practicing he prays on time he doesn't do sin except him if a person is a great student of knowledge a scholar and Imam has that's good that's great but if he's not financially capable then what would I do with his Islamic knowledge I would ask him instead of putting food on the table to give me a lecture every single day no not logical yes it's good to have someone who is knowledgeable then someone who's not but at the end of the day you have a marriage to cater for children to bring up and without being financially capable life would not be that easy for both of you so again the answer has to do with a number of ins and outs and this differs from one person to the other"
