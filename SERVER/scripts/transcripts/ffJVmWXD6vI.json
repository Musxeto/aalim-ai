  "transcript": "her second question is related to the same topic but she as an administrator may the condition that no one should post something unless it is authentic however some of the members in this group may sometimes send something that is weak or something that is not authentic maybe something that is an innovation or a code for someone who's deviant and not a real good scholar so she says what is the issue in it can we or as an administrator can I just turn a blind eye dan says no you need to bring that to their attention you need to tell them that what you're doing is not permissible the authentic hadith is so and so so you have to correct it because what they had done is that they publicly pub posted something which is wrong so now it's I cannot go privately and discuss this with them I have to also publicly say to everyone that ok that was wrong and the evidence is so and so and so the authentic hadith is so and so and so this is an innovation and the Sunnah is so and so and so if they were hurt or offended tough bananas this is their problem but as an admin it's your responsibility to ensure that everything is published is not something against Islam yeah maybe there is some room for manoeuvre when they publish something that is disputed upon and the dispute is not so serious or the hadith is something that is not that weak this is debatable but you're the admin at the end of the day if they don't comply simply block them"
