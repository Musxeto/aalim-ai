  "title": "What if a woman as a very strong and foul body odor, can she wear perfume? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So my question is, I know as women we're not supposed to use perfume when we go out. What about if a woman has a very strong offensive body odor? Can we use something to cover that? Jazakum Allah Khair Jazakum. So basically, the hadith of the Prophet ï·º states that any woman who wears perfume and passes by non-mahram men who could smell this fragrance from her, she is an adulteress. She is a zaniyah. So this hadith prohibits a woman from wearing perfume when there is a chance for non-mahram men to find her scent. Such as in the case when she goes with a driver, or with a non-mahram relative in the car, or she passes by men at the mall and they find this scent. If a woman has an offensive odor as was mentioned in the question, this is usually gone by taking a shower. Self-hygiene would take this odor away. And there is nothing wrong in applying deodorants. Because deodorants cannot be smelled as when you put and apply perfumes and wear perfumes. So deodorants would restrain and prevent such odor from appearing. But usually such an odor comes only from using the same clothes repeatedly. Or when a person does not take a shower regularly and Allah knows best."
