  "title": "My name is Vishnu, and I'm a revert  Am I sinful if I change my name against my parents' wishes?",
  "transcript": "Vishnu from Canada So my question is regarding the name change. Actually, I am a revert to Islam. So my name is Vishnu which contains actually shirk, a false god name. So I am planning to change my name. However, my parents won't accept this like changing the name. Does this make me sinful if I go against them and change my name? No, it is not at all sinful because having the name of a false god is not permissible. So you can change your name without any problem, even if your parents who are by default kafir and mushrik themselves are not happy with it because you can't seek their permission in things related to Islam. Such as marriage, such as going for hajj, such as praying on time. Even if they oppose you and they want you to stop and threaten you, you should not listen to them. They're kafir. But things related to their well-being such as serving them or buying groceries and carrying stuff for them. This is permissible inshallah."
