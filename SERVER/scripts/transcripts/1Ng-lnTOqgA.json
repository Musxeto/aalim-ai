  "transcript": "Ahmed from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So where I'm from, Turkey, we have a palace, historical palace from the Ottoman Empire and in the palace they display religious relics that belong to the Prophet Muhammad and other Prophets so among these relics there are supposedly the staff of Moses and the arm of Prophet Yahya so do you know any information regarding the authenticity of these religious relics? All of these relics Akhi or artifacts are not authentic and I've been to that museum and it's a nice place to go to. You see a lot of nice artifacts and it's a tourist attraction I don't know if it's top copy or something like that whether it's in Taksim or Arab it's been ages but it's fun it's nice but everything there is bogus. They say we have the sword of the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, we have the helmet, we have the cloak of the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam and all of this is not true. To have the staff of Moses, I don't know why they missed the Ark of Nuh peace be upon him as well that would have been mighty fine maybe they could not find anything else but that big. Akhi all of this is not authentic. All of these things they were fabricated it's only for people to draw money from the ignorance or the poor and innocent people. It's like when they come to for example Jeddah and they see this huge bicycle which is I think the largest bicycle in the world and they tell the pilgrims that this is the bicycle of Adam when Adam descended and he was looking for Eve so he had this bicycle this is where it landed. Come on give me a break and some of the pilgrims oh I'd like to take a selfie maybe take some barakah oh let me take some cloth and wipe over it and take it back home and then I wash it and I drink it and I pray to it. All of this is shirk and shaytan is having a blast. May Allah protect us."
