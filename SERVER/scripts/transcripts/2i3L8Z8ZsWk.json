  "transcript": "Abdullah from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, during Jumu'ah prayer, when the masjid gets filled to capacity, there are people who pray on the staircase because of lack of space. So is this permissible? As long as they can stand properly facing the Qibla, and when they prostrate, make sujood, they can make sujood on their seven limbs, this is permissible In Sha Allah."
