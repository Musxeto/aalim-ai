  "transcript": "Gazelle from Djibouti Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Yes, so my question is, is it permissible for someone who is from a Muslim country to take the nationality of a non-Muslim country, of a secular Muslim country like Turkey? Okay, first of all, the issue of changing your nationality from a Muslim country to a kafir country is not permissible, unless there is a necessity, such as a person being prosecuted or there is turmoil and fighting and civil wars, etc. And there is no place for him safe to stay and there is no Muslim country that would take him in. Now, taking the nationality of a so-called secular country, the vast majority of the people in such secular countries are Muslims. So, it takes the ruling of a Muslim country and hence it is permissible to acquire their nationality and Allah knows best. Thank you."
