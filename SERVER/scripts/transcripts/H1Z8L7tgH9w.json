  "transcript": "Final question for today is from Adil from Hong Kong. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Speak up Akhi, I can't hear you. Can you hear me now better? Yes. Okay, I have a group of friends who are participating in a football tournament that has an entry fee and also prizes at the end, which I understand is it comes under the ruling of gambling. So I will be participating in this and what I offered was to pay for all of them on their behalf and I thought that would lift the burden off of them, but then I realized it probably won't lift the burden off of me. So in this case is the only way to make this halal is if I withdraw from the competition and then pay for them, because if I don't do that most likely they will continue with the tournament and just pay themselves, so they will continue with this sin. Of course you have done wrong by participating or by paying off the entry fee on their behalf and this is totally wrong. You have to ask Allah for forgiveness and withdraw from this competition altogether and if you can take your money from them, that would be the right thing to do. If not, then just repent and show remorse and there would be no sin on you, but from now on you should have asked before attempting to do such a haram action without inquiring about the permissibility of it and Allah azawajal knows best. This is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow at four o'clock. I leave you in the Aman of Allah. As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh."
