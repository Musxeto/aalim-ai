  "title": "People being dragged into Jannah while being chained! assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The Prophet ﷺ once laughed and when they asked him, why are you laughing, O Prophet of Allah? He said, I am amazed by people being dragged into paradise while being in chains. How is this possible? How can people be dragged into paradise in chains? We know that people enter paradise willingly. Well, scholars explain that this is in reference to prisoners of wars, concubines, slaves who fall in captivity after the jihad, after the war between the Muslims and the non-Muslims, and they fall into captivity. They are imprisoned, they become slaves and sold as slaves. They are in chains, but then they see Islam, they embrace Islam and they become good Muslims and they die to enter paradise as Muslims. Whereas if they were left to their own old religions, they would have died and went to hell. These chains which was sad to them to be in captivity after being free, these chains led them to paradise. So what an irony, the Prophet ﷺ laughed about this."
