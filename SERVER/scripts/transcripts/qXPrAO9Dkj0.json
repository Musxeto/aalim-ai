  "transcript": "before we we end uh for those there's a controversy going on here without the Q a about the woman's voice so maybe you can answer that today or tomorrow inshallah you want it today yes if you can inshallah they will end with this okay the voice of a woman is not Tower no one had ever said that a woman should not speak actually in the Quran Allah addressed the mothers of the Believers our mothers the wives of the Prophet salaam that when they speak they must not soften their voices so that a person with illness in his heart would not be tempted which means that women by Nature have a soft voice and subhanallah my wife always makes an issue out of that and she says whenever someone calls you on the mobile for questions I know if it's a man or a woman so I said subhanallah how do you know that he said by the way you replied to the Salam so if it's a man you say now and if it's a woman you say now and of course this is her exaggeration I do not do this actually the sisters that call me know for sure that I don't give them any slack and I don't take it easy on them because shaytan is there sometimes sisters call just to vent or to complain of their husbands or of betrayals or so on and they need someone to talk to they need a shoulder to lean on and this is where shaytan comes this is why I don't open the door at all to such incidents but this is what the observation of my wife is so generally speaking yes the voice of a woman has an impact on men and this is why Allah told women not to soften their voices when a woman talks normally there's no problem sisters daughters call me on the phone all the time asking questions no problem sisters called telephone operators they called the hospitals the doctors they call asking for groceries they talk to the driver they talk to the pharmacists no problem So speaking is no problem when there is a legitimate reason for it but when a woman comes and recites the Quran she's not going to say alhamdulillah [Music] like the old church we used to be touched by their beautiful recitation though some cultures would say oh what is this kind of recitation the women was going to say in a beautiful melodic voice that would turn men's head around and this is not permissible so the most authentic opinion is that the competitions that we see on TV or on videos where women come and recite the Quran in front of men this is totally not permissible and this defies the purpose of true Andrea hijab and Allah"
