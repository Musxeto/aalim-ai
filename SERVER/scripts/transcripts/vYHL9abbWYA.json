  "title": "If a person cries thinking how sinful he is, would that get him forgiven if he does not verbalize it",
  "transcript": "says if a person cries thinking of how sinful he is would his crying get him forgiven even if he doesn't say anything from his tongue this is in allah's hands the prophet said there are two eyes that will not be touched by fire an eye that wept out of the fear of allah so even if the guy does not ask allah for forgiveness doesn't show remorse but he cries out of the fear of allah cries out of the fear of his sin thinking of what will happen to him after death this is inshallah a sign of forgiveness however no one in his right mind would simply rely on crying without seeking allah's forgiveness without showing remorse and being regretful of what he had done so what you're asking about umar is a hypothetical question that it cannot be imagined how would a person cry out of the fear of his sin without saying oh allah forgive me this is not logical"
