  "transcript": "alfred from usa yeah uh check i have a few questions but for today i'll only ask one okay so yeah from the same country at where i came from so a day on it he took me to a house and they i visited him so if the woman broke yes he gave me food he just considered me i said his son but now something i have doubt in my uh in my mind i don't know if the myth is is her or not i don't know so yeah i want to ask questions why is it permissible to for me to eat it or it's not possible that i can ask me is the me era or is this because i'm not living with it it's what can i do is this per individual muslim yes he's a muslim we pray in the same masjid yeah every day he comes for prayer and then we see one another every day yes so what when you say that he considers you part of the family and you mix with his uh woman folk no he he can be to a husband when you cook and then he cook okay tell me that we have food for you let's go and then take the food and then i'll go back home got it got it i will answer inshallah alfred from usa he has a friend who prays with him in the masjid and he usually invites him or gives him food as a gift and he doesn't have the guts to ask whether this is halal or haram can he consume it the answer is by default any food that your muslim brother gives to you is halal you do not need to check and it's not permissible to check unless there is doubt that is so strong that you need to ask what do you mean when the prophet alice islam was invited by a jew woman he answered her invitation he went with his friends she prepared a ram cooked it filled it with poison the prophet when answering her invitation did not ask her what is the source of money you bought this with because we are told in the quran that the vast majority of their income is haram extortion embezzlement bribes and riba the prophet did not ask and the prophet did not ask allah to assalam was it slaughtered did you say in the name of jose or in the name of gods or did you find it dead falling from a cliff or something like that no the prophet simply went ahead and ate from it which indicates that this is what we should do and this was a jew woman from kitab so when i go to my friend's house or my brother's house and he offers me food it is totally inappropriate for me to ask is the food halal was it slaughtered because this is an insult that islam prohibits unless there is profound and solid evidence that this food is not halal how would i know if i know that the person inviting me drinks alcohol this guy doesn't care about halal and haram he's allegedly muslim if i see him eating pork chops or enjoying eating haram food and boasts about it then definitely i cannot eat without checking but a normal muslim a muslim who prays with me in the masjid a random muslim that i don't know whether he's good or bad i must not ask or investigate you"
