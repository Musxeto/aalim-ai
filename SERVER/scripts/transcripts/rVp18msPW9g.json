  "title": "Does moving the finger in Tashahhud hit Shaytan with an Iron Rod? saah",
  "transcript": "as it says what i said for the shahood i move my finger as i know it's a sunnah recently i was told by someone when we do this we are hitting trayton is it true the hadith says that moving your finger into shahood this is harder on satan than iron which indicates as if it i'm beating him with an iron rod so this movement is more painful to him because it means that i'm following the sunnah that i'm concentrating and he's irritated by it so this is what the hadith means best you"
