  "transcript": "Adie says is it from the Sunnah to ask for forgiveness from everyone before the holy month of Ramadan commences this is a common misconception so before Ramadan begins everybody texts me if I had done anything wrong please forgive me and let there be no grudge or hatred towards me in your heart may Allah accept Ramadan from us all they also do this before they go for ambra or Hajj they keep on calling people ask them for forgiveness and all of this is not from the sooner this is an innovation to think that this is connected to Ramadan or to ombres or Hajj this is an innovation yes you've done something wrong to someone ask them for forgiveness but not to connect it with Ramadan or to Umrah and hatch"
