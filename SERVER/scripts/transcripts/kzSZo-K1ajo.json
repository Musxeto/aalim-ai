  "transcript": "Our first caller for today is Farhan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Is believing that if we think of something while praying it will not be executed successfully a bad omen or is it a punishment from Allah because we thought of worldly things while praying. For example while praying salah if I think that of something like oh I have to study for the examinations or oh I have to want I want good marks and I don't get them is believing this shirk or it is a or is it a bad omen. Jazak Allah Khair. Thank you. This has nothing to do with shirk Akhi. This is this can be a belief in bad omen but it has nothing to do with reality. If you are a human being you have no choice these thoughts and intrusive thoughts and whispers they barge on you they don't come invited they just jump on you so you have no control over them and it would not be fair to say oh if I get them in my prayer Allah will punish me and this would not happen. No this is not shirk but it is irrelevant it didn't happen because you didn't study well you didn't do your level best in studying this why this is this is why you got bad marks."
