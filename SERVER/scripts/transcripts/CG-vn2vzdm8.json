  "title": "How to deal with kids who do not pray even after the age of 10? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sadia says what to do if a child does not pray regularly even after crossing the age of 10 you beat him the Prophet said Alice Aslam instruct him to pray when they're seven and beat them when they're ten that is when they refused to pray you have to reprimand your child and teach them that there are red lines that cannot be crossed and prayer is the most important one of them so you have to encourage him you have to advise him and sometimes you have to be a little bit harsh on him to reprimand him because this is not permissible at all and unacceptable and there is no discussion to be discussed it's like a wild horse it has to be broken when it comes to prayer there is no choice he has to pray because this is the line between him and disbelief"
