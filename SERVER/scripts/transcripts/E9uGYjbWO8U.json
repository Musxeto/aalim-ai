  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so our session for now is about the rights of children am I right I don't know is it alhamdulillah yeah maybe Subhan Allah so the rights of children are vast and diversified but we have to limit it within 40 minutes so we will take as much as possible and try to compare Apple to Apple when we learn and attend such workshops what is the purpose oh it's like video games I got more power I have laugh span no it's not like this it's not a power bank that you're energizing it's something that you're cross referencing am I walking the talk am I doing what I'm supposed to do or not so you have to rectify your life with this so what are the rights of our children Upon Us Allah says in the Quran oh Believers protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and Stones whoops then this is my first priority to protect my children from coid 19 I don't know if they have cover 23 now I enjoyed it when we had coid because meca was only for us Saudis I used to go the best hotel for 200 300 R Ghost Town nobody's there now alhamd yeah alhamdulillah anyhow so do we protect our children from the plague from coid from poverty first thing protect them from what Hellfire and do we do this the Sheikh asked a question I think today or yesterday do children have smartphones and everybody says yeah this is what takes them to hell if you yeah the biggest problem is do your children have passwords on their cell phones yes why oh they have privacy privacy of what yeah she if your husband or your wife has a passcode okay they're adults children why you should have the right to investigate and see their browser uh uh history each one of us on his will says delete my browser history why because if I die I don't want to be exposed T now Allah was watching you come on fear Allah so we have a problem with our children that we're not protecting them from Hellfire we buy the best food the best clothes the best schools but we do not care about their IM are they going to Hell or Heaven this is beside the point we want them to get a good job that's why we take them to International Schools they learn English Oxford curriculum Cambridge this and that mashallah and when they finish sh well I don't know send them to UK or to Canada which which place should I send my children to how much Quran they memorize nothing how many times do they pray per day well alhamdulillah on enough but in Ramadan they pray don't send them anywhere keep them here even if they work as a janitor unless you want to lose their identity and lose everything about them we have a big problem every one of you is a shepherd and you responsible for your flock Allah will ask you about your children and in the Hadith of Muslim the highest degree of Hadith of authentic the prophet says your son your Offspring your daughter they have rights over you and unfortunately we don't pay attention to these rights the first right and this was mentioned today in the is to build a proper foundation for the home the first right upon you as a a man is to choose a good righteous mother for your children and this is displayed in the Hadith women may be sought after for four things her wealth her lineage her beauty and her religious commitment therefore seek the one who is religiously committed may you prosper the prophet says do this and the vast majority of us men don't do that we focus upon Beauty and then we focus upon the family the lineage is she from a reputable family or not then we re Focus some of us not real men don't do this but some men are gold diggers they look for for wealth and especially those who are from I wouldn't say subcontinent from some place they request and demand dowy and I am shocked how can a man request his to be wife to give him Dowry and the family his parents go and taunt the woman and her parents you did not give our son a new car you did I what what are gold diggers these are the scum of the earth so I know some parents may be offended this is W intended I intend to offend you and insult you because you're not real humans a man does not take a penny from his wife let alone demand a DIY and you did not give us a car you did not buy us Furniture what is this this is a Hindu culture not a Muslim culture a real man pays for everything for his wife her clothes her jewelry the wedding the WIA everything is from my own pocket I'm the man not the opposite anyhow this is not our topic we're talking about children H wait until I oh Sal is going to talk about the rights of the wife anyhow why am so why am I so yeah harsh because because I have counseling sessions every day and these problems come to me and haunt me every day and it breaks my heart to hear these stories so what do you expect me to do to say have patience do no kick them out step on them this is not Islam we act upon Quran and Sunnah and what they're doing is not part of Quran and Sunnah rights of the children starts from the beginning choosing the right husband who is going to be the father who's going to raise the child and an an Islamic fashion and choosing the mother who's going to conceive and take her life and devoted to that child it also starts the right of children from the prohibition of abortion in Islam abortion is Haram generally speaking and this is the default unlike what's happening in America in Europe they have the right the woman has rights on her body she can terminate the pregnancy even if the pregnancy is 8 months old it's a human being with a soul they should kill it they don't say it killing it is it terminating the pregnancy no we don't have this in Islam Islam protects the fetus even when it is conceived and the difference of opinion is the limit so we know that the soul is breathed in the fetus when it is 4 months old 120 days before that it's not a human being because the soul is not breathed in yet the scholars prohibit a abortion even before that unless there's a legitimate reason such as the fear that the life of the mother is in Jeopardy and in great real danger and an amount some Scholars even go to say that from day one of pregnancy till 40 this is permissible to abort and this is why they say you can take the after pill so so from day one to 40 this fetus is not a fetus yet so it can be terminated but after 40 days the majority say it has to be uh protected and conceived Allah protects the children when they're even as a fetus that's why a pregnant woman is given the permission and the concession to break her fast don't fast in Ramadan make it up later on so that if you fear for your child if you're suckling your child and you fear that the milk would not be enough skip one of the pillars of Islam fasting of Ramadan and make it up later on one year two year 5 years 10 years whenever you don't have any obstacles it protects the fetus even if a pregnant woman is caused to abort or to have a miscarriage intentionally by someone beating her up forcefully forcing her to abort in this case he has to give the blood money for the fetus look how the religion protects this and if a pregnant woman conceived out of wedlock and confessed she is not to be stoned or the prescribed punishment is not to be implemented when she's pregnant for the fear of her conceived child until she gives birth and until she weans her child after giving him the amount of milk required after the child is born Islam keeps on protecting protecting the child and giving the child his or her rights one of the rights that Scholars speak about is the aan in the ear of the newborn and there is a Hadith but the Hadith is not authentic and this is why I'm inclined to always say do not do aan in the ear of the newborn because the Hadith is not authentic it was graded as week by Al Alani and many other Scholars now the people have not limited themselves to giving the Adan in the right ear they give in the left ear I don't know if they're going to later on pray two on the boy or the girl what is this I don't know but it keeps on evolving and some even justify and say you know why we don't we give Adan for the newborn so said why tell me oh great scholar of Islam he says because when the person dies and we pray funeral prayer we don't give aan Allah abbar and what about the prayer for rain we don't also give aan the prayer for Eclipse we don't give the Adan what should we do he said I did not think of that that's your problem don't try to logic everything we AB by Quran an authentic Hadith among the rights of the newborn is what is it's a that a lot of the Muslims don't apply nowadays was done at the time of the Prophet so whenever a newborn was delivered to this world immediately before anything they would take take him to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he would do a he would chew a little piece of dates very well in his mouth until it's almost moist no hard substances and then he would take a little tiny bit and put it in the ceiling of the newborn and immediately you would find the newborn doing tasting it because they love sugar as the prophet said the ansar children oh they love sugar they love dates look what is this child doing and this child is one day old so this is a Sunnah we don't have the prophet to do thisat you take it to a righteous man IM of a Masjid a scholar not available the father does it the grandfather does it anyone of the family because this has many medical benefits alongside the fact that it is a recommended sunah then after the child is born among the first rights of the child is to Bear the name of the father he has to have the name of the father is he born out of wedlock no he's she's married so immediately this is a right of the child the father doesn't have the right to say m I don't want to give my name no you can't by default he's yours whether you like it or not are you doubtful said yes I'm thinking that his mom maybe cheated on me now this is a major major sin are you slandering her I said in some cases that come to me yes he is slandering her and this is a major sin okay you have one of two choices either bring four Witnesses male Muslim men testifying that they saw her commit adultery or you do as mentioned inah but depriving your son from his lineage and to be named after you is unacceptable you decline we will flog you 80 Lashes in your back this is Allah's Shar ruling so the name of the father is one of the child's rights be careful because many men who don't fear Allah would find it easy just to say no no he doesn't belong to us also among the rights of the child is to give him a proper name what are you going to call your son lizard because he looks like a lizard I'm going to call him lizard in Arabic we have this you know Lucas jarat huh we have in in in some tribes they would called the the boy jarad Lucas some would call him wolf theb they would call this him by such they go yes I want him to become a wolf a beast so his name is VB and these are bad names in where I come from in Mecca in Medina when a child is born so that they ward off evil eye they call him fak poor so nobody would give him evil eye but the poor guy is really poor he grows up to be MK with his name what does he do with the name no the prophet Alam instructed us to give the best of names he used to even switch bad names into good names so if a woman's name is bar righteous woman no no no this is not good because she's praising herself change it into Jia or Muna if a man's name is Shan the prophet would change it and and by the way this is a fact there are people called Shan seriously I was in India in in 2003 or 2002 I was attending a conference and the driver who's taking me places asking what's your name Sayan many people when they want to name their children they open the Quran saidan this is Baraka people call their children Neal and who's n said this is the brother of prophet Yousef Nal is a verb to weigh things so that we can bring some wheat but they saw thought that he was the brother of YF by the name of Nal so no you have to choose the best name not a tribal name the prophet said the best of names the the the most beloved names to Allah Abdullah and Abdul rman and the most honest and truthful names are Al so these are what the prophet said har means the one who plaws so each one of us plaws for his dya or for his nobody just sits Idol does not do anything ham means the one who attempts so every one of us attempts to do good deeds or bad Deeds but you have this intention in you so it's the most truthful names of all so give your child a good name and the best of names are those with a history so you say my son's name is Muhammad one of the most beautiful names Prophet Muhammad he grows up he knows the S my son's name is s oh we have have Malik so many very beautiful name my daughter's name I have 13 daughters alhamdulillah no boys and this is why I always tied up by women huh because I have daughters I'm going to kill them um my daughter's names mostly are the wives of the Prophet Alam I have myuna I have Jia I have sopia I have and people say I go to hospitals for a checkup and said what's the patient's names said Jia and the woman is an Arab said what she doesn't even know how to pronounce said J she said why she's blaming why do you give her this name she's the wife of the Prophet don't you know said no no I know khad only what are the names of the wives of the Prophet people don't know maybe Asma I don't know so you give names with history so when the child grows up they know what is the name Mas not one of the great ansar who refused to be touched by a mush and Allah saved his body Body by the bees and by the flood after they assassinated him and they could not do anything to him I know my history so you know your name you know your history your child grows up to look for someone but now it is who are we calling boys Mah what's your name Abdallah masallah and your father's name ABD Mah and your son's name Justin excuse me yes and his sister is uh Jennifer mashallah JJ sh they're all J why are you doing this oh sh you know it's a revolving world we have to you know be with the flow no a this is not being with the flow this is being flooded by the flow be careful so among the rights of the children when they're born is to do a number of rituals number one shaving the heads on the seventh day and taking the hair weighing it and give the equivalent in silver for charity and naming the boy on the seventh day and slaughtering two Rams for a male boy and one RAM for a female girl on the seventh day and circum cion that is mandatory for males and it's an issue of dispute for females it's recommended but it is not mandatory and this is different from FGM female genital uh mutilation there's no relationship between circumcision and FGM and we will not go into this retracting a little bit like 65 seconds you said shaving the head is this for boys and girls it's an issue of dispute our Scholars say it's only for boys I am inclined to say it's for both why do you go against what your Scholars say because there are Scholars who said it's for both and the Hadith backs up what I'm inclined to the Hadith says the prophet said about the hair something that's harmful maybe it's a discharge that comes accompanied with the delivery process that may harm the skull and this goes for both males and females boys and girls so I'm inclined to say that shaving the hair would be beneficial and good and it's good for the girl to have a good fresh start and would help her hair in the future inshallah among the rights of the child is to be breastfed Allah says in the Quran mothers May nurse that is burth feed their children to complete years for whoever wishes to complete the nursing period upon the father is their provision and their clothing according to what is acceptable no person is charged with more than his capacity no mother should be harmed through her child and no father through his child and upon the father's air is a duty like that of the father so the child's right is to be breastfed who pays for it the father pays for it she's the mother yes she's still with the husband and she breastfeeds her child but what happens if the mother raises the red flag and says I don't want to breastfeed my child can she do this Mah sisters know their rights yes she can the husband says who will breastfeed it the wife says not of my business I conceived I gave birth it's your problem now it is the duty of the father to take the child and find a wet nurse to suckle the child for money and he has to pay her money there's no problem in that islamically as mentioned in the end of the of the Ayah part of the rights of the child is custody and financial provision so it's not that you bring children okay let's make babies you make babies and just throw them in the street no you have to take care of them you have to provide for them a shelter a roof food on the table clothes medical expenses schooling all of the package is forced upon you as a parent you have to do this the prophet says in the Hadith in Muslim the prophet saysat it is sufficient of sin that you waste the One You're supposed to provide for this is sufficient of sin upon you to not take care of the one who you responsible to provide for so now I'm providing for my son or my daughter I'm giving them everything they need they're growing up what else it's upon it's one of their rights that you are fair and just what do you mean he's my child I can do whatever I want no it's not true Allah orders you to be fair the prophet says theith is agreed upon fear Allah and be fair and just between your children even the children and it is a huge area that there is a lot of ambiguity in especially in the subcontinent why are you focusing on the subcontinent and what do is this something personal no I'm just not allowed to go there since 2013 they exited me from uh madas on the same plane I came in when someone came to power and he just wrote send him on the same plane so since then I cannot go there anyhow no it's not nothing personal but the culture is prevailing and the vast majority of the people here are from there so what is the problem Sheikh the problem is all parents save their life savings for the gold of the girls what about the boys no you go work and give us money so that we can buy more gold why is this so no no she the girls have to be equipped with gold and we have to send her to her husband's house with gold who said so this is Haram my mother died and she kept jewelry and I gave it to my wife and my wife said that this is for the girls Haram you have boys yes they have to be equal come on where did you get this from Sheikh you're asking me where I got this from any okay I'm I'm going to be modest and humble of may Allah be pleased with them both alash gave his son a gift and's mother was was smart she says no no no no no my son will not take your gift go and make the prophet a witness alash said no problem he went to the prophet am said oh prophet of Allah I gave my son a gift of course you know bash is one of the great companions young one who narrated theith one of the most famous Hadith in Islam narrated by this who was given this gift as a young boy so he said I gave my son a gift one narration says a slave another narration says a plot of land so the prophet immediately asked himam did do you have children other than him said yes okay I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and ask you a second question have you given them all equal to the same gift he said no so the prophet said the verdict then make someone else other than me testify for I don't WI witness Injustice fear Allah and be equal between your children then he asked him a logical question he said do you like all of your children to be equal in obeying you and being dutiful to you and respecting you do you want them all to be equal or you want someone to be more than others no no no I want them all to be equal in these qualities he said then be equal in giving them and how many of us give children a special gift because they brought a grades in school and the others who brought C or B are neglected how many times do you bring this a gift and this one a lesser gift this is not fulfilling the rights of your children and I'll wait for your hate mail among the things that your child has rights over you is inheritance and how many of us do Injustice especially living in the cafir countries when they don't have Shar law applied they have to write a will so oh yeah yeah my son I don't love him he doesn't call I will not give him anything or he married a woman I told him not to marry I will deprive him from The Inheritance this is Haram this is Injustice Allah will punish you in your grave for this but just my money no it's not your money you're dead you're rotten in your grave this is Allah's [Music] money you don't know among your parents and children who's closer to you these inheritance laws were set by Allah alone likewise you have to fear Allah in writing a will in uh uh gifts Etc among the when did you start I've exceeded my time huh by five minutes nobody's watching who cares okay well among the the greatest rights of the children is that you as a parent upbring your children in the best way and this is a huge topic we today Focus only on what how they clothes oh Louis vuon Prada shoes Armani and the likes how they eat where they eat which gym they go how people look at them but we don't pay attention to how we bring them up and this is the most important thing the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam used to raise children accordingly any child who does something wrong oh boy Say bah eat from in front of you and use your right hand correction you see something wrong you correct it on the spot so that the child learns when he was going with Al Abbas with Abdullah Abbas his cousin behind him on on the mule he utilized the time by saying oh boy I'm going to teach you a few words I shall teach you these words of advice be mindful of Allah and Allah will protect you and we tend to neglect a very important aspect of bringing up children we are professional Professionals in criticizing in scolding in reprimanding in pointing out mistakes we are good in this Mas Allah look at you why did you do this why didn't you do that why didn't you wake up earlier why didn't you sleep earlier why didn't you do your homework why did you and when you bring children under such pressure they will become big failures they will learn how to lie to evade and Escape your criticism when you have a child and you always say you're a failure you're a  you'll never pass exams you'll never do anything you will never gain any money or have a successful job everybody will hate you he will grow up to be a failure but when you encourage your children all the time mashall positivity mashallah my son Mah he prays five times in the Masjid my son loves his CH his siblings he always gives his toys to them my daughter is mashallah the best of girls she always brings me water when I'm thirsty she takes care of my uh uh feet and massages them she obeys whatever I say to her they will grow up to be leaders of the community and I could go on forever giving you stories of Imam bukari how he was encouraged by a single word this man is going to be an IM boom he became an Imam how many times do you say this to your children or to your girls encouraging them we are perfect in criticism and seeing people's faults and this is why we have miserable lives when was was the last time you said a positive thing to your wife long long time ago when was the last time you said anything positive to your husband oh he doesn't give me chance he always criticized me so T I have to do something this is not a life think and as I said we have a fast field to talk about this but the time is limited being kind to your children the prophet says who the sheh mentioned this Whoever has three girls and takes care of them there will be a screen or a visor between him and hellfire three I have 13 I I don't know I I tried my level best 12 of them by the way memorize the Quran by heart the 13th is H anyhow so let's not talk she she knows English ah so you should instruct their rights to upbring them upon Islam and sheh mentioned this instruct them to pray when they're seven beat them up when they're 10 so 3 years you just order no scolding no reprimanding no forcing 3 years 360 days five times every day it's brainwash h heart wash they will have to comply but after these three days if they mess up a nice spank would be y helpful inshallah too much but the prophet Alam used to show his compassion to Children listen mm one of the youngest youngest youngest companions he says I was 5 years old and I remember that the prophet Salli wasallam was once playing or using wo water and he saw me and the water he rined his mouth with he spit it on my face playing with me we do this with children huh when we're making w we do this to them and they laugh and he says I remember it and this is why he remembered it they comp they they they put him in the name of the youngest of companion also the prophet used to go to um's house she had a small uh Child by the name of ab he's the brother of an Malik and he the prophet used to play with him AB what did the Young bird that you had and died do and the four-year-old would you know feel remorseful and sad and the prophet is playing with him joking with him so he would detain him he would even put prizes for the children to race so he bring gathers the children of the Companions and say okay whoever reaches the door and comes back I will give him this prize he would pass by little children what do we do when we pass by little children in the street wet wet why it feels good she you know when I shout at them and they just run away I I feel the prophet Sall wasallam used to pass by little children and give Salam to all of them they feel acknowledged they feel respected he used to go and wipe over their heads when he speaks to them it gives him encouragement so the there are many many rights but I think uh the time and the the flag man is is showing to me like the airplane coming to Dock and muhamed"
