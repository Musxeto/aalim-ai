  "transcript": "n from France I still a question last week but I didn't give enough details you so as you what you did not what I didn't give enough details okay I think uh I asked you what to do when people in my class started making joke and about Islam and you told me uh that I could leave until the teacher comes back but uh the fact is uh they keep making jokes even when the teacher is speaking so when the teacher is giving his class I can't leave so uh I would like to know what to do because I can't leave and I'm afraid um are you are you are you engaged with them in their discussion and fun yes or no no so ignore them keep on listening to the teacher and ignore them and after class you may tell him that some people are talking while you are uh explaining the lesson and they're making fun of Islam and this is inappropriate that's it the Ayah 140 inaha chapter 4 is referring to the people who are listening and engaging with them then they are like them but if you're walking in the street and someone is making fun of Islam I'm walking talking I'm not even listening to him should I whenever a dog barks fall down on my hands and knees and bark back no of course not"
