  "transcript": "Naveed from Turkey. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. Is it permissible to talk to your psychologist about your sins and is it permissible for me to reveal how like I am treated by others or would that count as backbiting even if I'm like generally speaking? JazakAllah. First of all in Islam it is not permissible to expose your sins. That's a general tendency and rule and by exposing your sins this means that you go around and boast about them. So you go to your friends and say listen last night I saw this beautiful movie you would like it you'd love it or you talk to relatives and you say well when I was young I used to have illicit relationship with our neighbor friend or I stole money. Now you're exposing something that Allah has concealed. You're boasting about it. This is a major sin that would lead you to not be forgiven. The Prophet said all of my ummah, all of my followers are forgiven except those who boast about it Al-Mujahiroon and part of boasting about it is that you do a sin at night. Allah conceals it. In the morning you go to your friend and say didn't you know last night I did so-and-so. Allah will not forgive this. Now when it comes to therapy or treatment sometimes there's no way out. So you have to go to your therapist and say listen I have a porn addiction. I'm unable to kick the habit. I have these whispers and in order for him to help you he needs to know what kind of whispers related to tahara, related to divorce, related to shirk and you say I have these bad thoughts about Allah or the Prophet or the Quran. That should be enough but if there is a need because some of these doubts and whispers can be clarified through knowledge. I have these doubts about why Islam permits a man to marry four. Isn't this subjugating women? Isn't this that? Isn't this this? So a scholar, a therapist who has knowledge in Islam would clarify it to you. But some thoughts are totally blasphemous. Should not even cross your mind let alone you talking about them. You should put a lid on that and I hope this answers your question."
