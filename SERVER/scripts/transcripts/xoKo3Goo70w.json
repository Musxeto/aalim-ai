  "title": "How to be like the Prophet ‎ﷺ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Beckham from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh So it's just a general question that I have. So we know that the Prophet ﷺ was especially brave and the best of all role models in his character and conduct. So how should one balance between evaluating their own self without arrogance, as in their level of religiosity, their sins and mistakes, maybe their character, without destroying their own confidence, maybe exaggerating their own thoughts and letting that affect their bravery? I have no idea. This is too philosophical for me. It's way above my pay grade. All what I know is I go through the seerah of the Prophet ﷺ. I go through his Al-Shama'il Al-Muhammadiyah, which I made a series of a few months ago. It's being aired on Huda TV. Inshallah soon it will be aired on Zad TV as well. And I follow the footsteps of the Prophet ﷺ. I know I have a limit. I cannot be as generous or as courageous or as truly believing and trusting Allah as a Prophet ﷺ. This is way beyond our ability because he's the Prophet and we are who we are. However, he was sent to us to be a role model and we were ordered to follow him in to the best of our ability. So we do the best we can and hope for the rest from Allah Azza wa Jal and Allah knows best."
