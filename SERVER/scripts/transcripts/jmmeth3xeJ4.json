  "transcript": "And then she should put a stop to all this nonsense. Sad man from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I wanted to know that is our Dua accepted or is it highly recommended to make a Dua while we are doing a good deal? I have no idea what you're talking about. Can you make your question a little bit clearer? Is our Dua accepted while we are doing a good deal? Dua is accepted while you're doing what? Good deal. Good deeds. No, there is nothing related to this at all. I don't know of any hadith that says while you're doing good deeds, your Dua is accepted and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
