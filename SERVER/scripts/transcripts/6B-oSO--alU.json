  "title": "Short or long durood on Friday?Are the salutations apart of morning/ evening Athkaar? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "shot from saudi uh sheikh i wanted to know like when we are sending salutations from the prophet muhammad uh we have the long the root that we trained with the shahood and then we even have the smaller one that's there in the morning evening after so is it okay to keep on reciting the short one or like especially on fridays or the longer one is recommended to do or either one is okay okay the most authentic opinion is that the longer one is mandatory in salat frequently on friday suffices saying it in the morning and evening at car is not from the sunnah saying it 10 times in the morning and 10 times in the night or the evening whoever does this will achieve the prophet's intercession is not authentic it was weakened by sheikh al-bani uh may allah have mercy on on his soul so generally speaking yes saying the short virgin does the job in sha allah"
