  "transcript": "Inaya from USA Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. I wanted to ask you, I know an Awliya and I wanted to speak to him in regards to my marriage. I have a suitor and Alhamdulillah he's very nice in regards to his Islam and he's financially stable as well. But this Awliya is telling me that it is in my naseeb for me to wait two years. You must what? Wait approximately two years before I should get married to anyone. Why? Just more so that he believes it's in my naseeb for me to wait. So how old are you? I'm 20. And your Wali or your guardian, he's your father? This is an Awliya, it's not my Wali. Who is he? He calls himself an Awliya. What is his relation to you? An Imam. No, he has no right to consider this for you. Where is your father? He is in Jannah, InshaAllah he's in Jannah. Okay, do you have any guardian next of kin, brother, a paternal grandfather? I do not. You have an uncle, paternal uncle? I do not. You do not have any paternal cousins, no relatives at all? No, paternal cousins I do. If you have paternal cousins, they are your guardians, not this Imam. This Imam is a total stranger, he cannot be your guardian. Okay, so I should bring the matter to them, InshaAllah? Yes, you have to go and approach your closest cousin, paternal cousin, and tell him that I have a good suitor and I need you to be my Wali, my guardian, and he will marry you off, bi-idhnillahi azzawajal."
