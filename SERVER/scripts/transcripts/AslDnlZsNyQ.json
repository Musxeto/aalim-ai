  "transcript": "T from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Alhamdulillah after watching many of your videos My whispers of Shaitan that I have suffered with the OCD has greatly reduced with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal Just a quick question is what I wanted to ask you was I know that the certainty and doubt principle you have spoken about many times Sometimes I have also seen in a video If I remember correctly, Ghusl, you spoke about If someone's got nail polish and it's only 2-3 minutes gap Redo it just to be on the safe side So my question just is this When do I weigh up not doing something again just to be on the safe side And if something I'm doubtful about Just leaving it and not doing something again If my question makes sense please do let me No it doesn't make sense because there is a difference Between having nail polish which is something you can see And between a doubt that came to you after you finished your Ghusl And said hmm did I wash my ears or not I'm doubtful so let me do it again This is different The doubt in not washing your fingers because of the nail polish Is not a doubt it's certainty Your nail polish is there But the doubt that came up after finishing your whole Ghusl After the Ibadah was over This is a doubt that you disregard and Allah knows best"
