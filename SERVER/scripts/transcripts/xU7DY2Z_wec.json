  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh. My question is when I'm doing wudu, if I rub, like when I take water in my hand and I'm washing my arms, if I rub too much and the place becomes almost dry, do I have to re-wash that place again? It cannot be dry. This is shaytan. Move on. The moment you put water in your hand and you start to do this, it covers it. It cannot be dry. So don't even think and start bringing a magnifying glass and look for places that are dry. This is not the way Islam says we should do it."
