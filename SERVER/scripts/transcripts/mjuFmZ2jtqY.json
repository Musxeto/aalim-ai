  "transcript": "Rayan from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I have a question regarding Fajr prayer When I woke up once I had like Not continuous but like a Temporary Emission of Medin But the prayer time Was about to end And I didn't know what to do So I decided to just clean up and then pray After the prayer if I see Medin I saw Medin on my garment So I wasn't sure I wasn't sure if it came out during the prayer Or after the prayer So what should I do in this case? Nothing, Alhamdulillah Allah Azza Wa Jal says Fear Allah to the best of your ability And whenever the time is about To Be over And you still have emission of Najasa that breaks your wudu And you've tried your level best You just simply clean yourself and pray And whatever is emitted during the prayer Has no impact On it and the prayer is valid Inshallah"
