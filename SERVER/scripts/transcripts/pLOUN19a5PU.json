  "transcript": "Yusuf from Australia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh There is a nearby masjid with two sheikhs I would like to ask questions to and take knowledge from. Unlike the other masjids, they don't seem deviant. And I've never seen them follow an opinion not mentioned by you on Islamcare.info except for one or two occasions. But I don't know where they're taking knowledge from. On Islamcare.info, I was told to ask the scholars of my country about them, but I do not know who the scholars of Australia are. So I would like to know if it would be safe to learn from them or some advice on what I can do to know if they are safe. So Yusuf, you tell me. Are they more knowledgeable than you, yes or no? Yes. And do you have what it takes to determine whether they are deviant in aqeedah or not? No. In this case, you have to follow them as this is the best of your ability until proven otherwise. It is illogical to use the methodology of some factions of the khawarij where they say, we do not pray behind individuals and we do not take knowledge from individuals until we can verify where they took their knowledge from or their aqeedah is valid or not. This is not proper. As long as a person says, I'm a Muslim, he's teaching the Quran and the sunnah, he's a student of knowledge, he's a scholar, and you do not see anything that goes against the core of our aqeedah. He has no deviancy. He's not an innovator. He's not bringing something new to the table. If this is the case, learn from them until proven otherwise. And Allah knows best."
