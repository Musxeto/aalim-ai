  "title": "If someone offered their OWN Udhiya, should I give them a portion or find needy people instead?",
  "transcript": "We have brother Fahim from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, by analyzing the activities of Sahaba, the Imam at our mosque advised us that if both me and my relatives are offering Qurbani, it's highly recommended not to exchange meat between ourselves but to find relatives who couldn't afford Qurbani because they are the ones who are truly in need of that meat. But if any relatives who are giving Qurbani do not agree with this term and get offended, if I don't give them meat, then it's better to exchange with them in order to keep kinship. The same principle applies to neighbors as well. Even if all neighbors are offering Qurbani, then the Imam suggested to find another needy area or community or maybe donating to a charity foundation that distributes those meats to truly needy people. So Sheikh, does Sharia support the advice given by our Imam? Jazakallah. No, it does not support it per se as there is no prescribed portion to be exchanged. The Sharia states that when you offer your Udhiyah, you should give little to charity. Some say one-third and one-third you eat and one-third you give as a gift. But it does not say that this is a must. So if I just take a small portion and give it to charity and consume the rest or give the rest or give in charity the rest, it's all up to my preference and what these scholars or these da'is have said is not accurate or true."
