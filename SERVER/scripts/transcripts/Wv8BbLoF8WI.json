  "title": "The death of the Prophet’s ‎ﷺ son (Ibrahim), did it have anything to do with Eclipse?",
  "transcript": "hadith 147 and who will read it for us yes reported the messenger of allah islam said the sun and the moon are two of allah's great signs that he frightens his servants with they do not eclipse because of the death of someone from the people or life of anyone so when you see anything as such observe the prayer supplicate allah until it's clear from you muslim this hadith is one of the signs that our prophet is the messenger of allah ignorant people those whose hearts are filled with hatred and their eyes are blinded by prejudice they claim that our prophet allah was not the messenger of allah and this is a great sign why it so happened that the prophet allah had seven of his offspring he had the qasim he had abdullah he had zainab and he had ibrahim from a concubine from his slave maria al-qaeda the coptic now when the prophet had ibrahim he was in his late 50s he was about 61 years of age so imagine when you're this old and you don't have any male offspring of yours and all of a sudden at this old age you are blessed with such a child how would you feel you would love him so much because he wants someone to carry your name you want someone to be able to protect your daughters and to continue your legacy allah the pagans used to slander our prophet islam islam by saying that he is meaning that his he does not have any offspring he does not have anyone to carry his name and allah says those who hate you are those who have no mentioning and their reputation in their lineage would be cut off so when the prophet was blessed with ibrahim he already was frightened to hear that he is dying when he was just only 18 months old a year and a half when the child is just giggling and communicating with you when you love him at most subhanallah allah's will that he dies so when he died the day he died in the sun eclipsed so what did the people say they said subhanallah this is not eclipsed because ibrahim died if the prophet salallahu salaam was an imposter if he was fabricating this deen what would you do you said yes look what how allah azzawajal made the son grief for the demise of my own son but the prophet did not do this the prophet immediately came to the people and said to them no the sun and the moon are great signs of allah are great creations of allah they do not eclipse for the death nor for the life or the birth of anyone which indicates to you that this is a real messenger of allah who does not call people to worship him or to glorify him but who calls people to worship allah and to glorify allah of course the prophet felt very saddened by the death of ibrahim to the extent that he cried and when abraham objected and said also you prophet of allah you cried he said this is mercy from allah and then he said his famous statement the heart is saddened and the i weeps and we do not say except what pleases allah and by allah by departing you ibrahim we are saddened that's it that is it because the prophet knows what allah has in store for ibrahim is far better than what is for him in this life from this hadith we also learned that the prophet is human like any other human he gets ill he gets tired he gets sad he may cry and he loses loved ones so he is like anyone else and also this is to prove that he is human and that he is a servant of allah he also loses battles he was beaten sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he bled and one of his teeth was broken and one of the shields rings went into his cheekbones and he bled from italy he is human yet he is the servant of allah you"
