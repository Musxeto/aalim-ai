  "transcript": "the next question is the people it's a we have been told to pray with gaps by the government the people who pray with gaps in the Muslim with their prayers be accepted me and my friends just pray feet two feet behind them forming another line is that okay well I he it is something that is current and new which means that it was never done at the time of the prophet Sam or the Companions or the Tiberian Oh to a great degree so it said a recent issue and in Arabic in fact they call it nas illa de sending it's a problem it's a calamity that came down it was unprecedented so the scholars must sit and discuss it to my knowledge the major scholars council did not come with verdict on it but the major scholars of Saudi Arabia individually three or four of them said it is permissible such as she took him in San Lucas LAN a share I think sad shivery she had the Suleiman over Haley maybe one more they said it's okay because it's a necessity and praying in the Masjid with gaps is better than not praying in the Masjid at all so that we cannot abandon the message and leave them empty now this is their concept which is respected I do not have the authority to tell people no no no this is not a valid fatwa because these guys are major scholars are not and they have the knowledge to give fatwas and they have the authority and they have that responsibility to face Allah Azza WA JAL you cannot expect any Tom Dick or Harry to come in say no no this is not a valid fact or pray shoulder to shoulder foot to foot and if you guys all die they will be martyrs this is irresponsible however if a person was chronically ill someone who's diabetic or high blood pressure heart problems or kidney problems and doctors all say you should not train them as okay this is one exemption you have to pray home or if you're afraid that you will catch this virus to the extent that you don't go to work you don't go to school you're confined to your home because you're truly scared of it this is a legitimate reason or if you have a sore throat or you cough a lot you have a fever this is a legitimate reason not to oh and it is haram for you to go but if you go and do shopping and go to the malls and buy groceries and mix with people I saw a beautiful picture showing five people praying with social distancing in the desert they went camping so there is a meter and a half between each one of them the funny thing is that they came in one car so this is ridiculous you drove two hours in the same car and now when it comes to prayer it's this social distancing besides this virus is not a plague it is not smallpox it is not an illness that spreads in five or six days and kills like millions it's a flu but on steroids so the problem is that it's not more flu 80 P 80 percent of the people affected by it they recover without even needing any medical attention this quarantine themselves home-free for days and they're good to go so if someone believes this and he believes that it is not a necessity that mandates leaving a gap and he feels that when he goes to the message that I don't feel like praying it's my own prayer mat it's my own face mask and there's no one in front of me or behind me or beside me what am i doing and he believes that no this is not a thing that is following the right way of the sunnah and he decides to pray home i believe that there is nothing wrong in praying home and allah surgeon knows best but when it comes to friday friday is a different story friday we know that missing three consecutive Friday's would put a seal on your heart so even if there's social distancing happy pray friday and ask allah for forgiveness for what is happening because you don't do this with your own will but it is enforced upon us and allah knows best"
