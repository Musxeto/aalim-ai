  "title": "Will Missing limbs be restored upon Resurrection? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Marwa from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Walaikumussalam The question is, will those who underwent body surgery to beautify themselves, those who got tattoos, and those who have missing limbs, will they all return to their original form that Allah gave them on the Day of Judgment? Also, on the Day of Judgment, will children rise from their grave in the state of childhood, adults in adulthood, and old people in adulthood? And if so, will they all return to their original form that Allah gave them on the Day of Judgment? Also, on the Day of Judgment, will children rise from their grave in the state of childhood, adults in adulthood, and old people in adulthood? And if so, will they all return to their original form that Allah gave them on the Day of Judgment? Also, on the Day of Judgment, will children rise from their grave in the state of childhood, adults in adulthood, and old people in adulthood? One question at a time. So your first question would be, yes, all human form would be restored to the best of forms that is beyond our imagination. So if someone lost a limb in this dunya, he will gain it and it would be restored. If someone had a deficiency in his body, in his skin, in the way he looks, he would be or she would be in the perfect form that is beyond imagination without any doubt and Allah knows best."
