  "transcript": "anna says [Music] i ask dua like my particular property want to get sold quickly so that my debts will get closed if i asked in this way it is correct i am afraid that allah may have any other way to fulfill my debts so if i ask in the same way above then allah will have different plan so that my way of dua get ignored something gets delayed or get delayed please help me out in this i don't understand the question clearly but let me try to give it a shot so safana is saying that i'd like allah azzajan to assist me sell my property quickly so that i can pay off my debts but i don't know what allah has plans for me so i'm afraid if i make dua this would conflict with allah's plans and i don't want to anger allah or to not wait for what allah has in store for me this is all nonsense safanam no one knows what allah has in store for us no one knows what allah has predestined for us so all what we can do is make dua and be content with the result so if shaytan whispers in my ears and says ah if you make dua that allah helps you sell your plot maybe this goes against allah's plans and two months later the property value would double and you will feel sorry and regret it okay so i will not sell the plot then shaytan comes to you and says well if you don't sell the plot the debt would be haunting you 24 7 and you will feel depressed and maybe in two months time the prices and the values of property would go down and you would lose half of what you would have gotten if you were to sell it today do you think that this is logical or this is plain and simple from shaytan definitely this is from shaytan messing with your head and you should ignore that and not pay attention to it allah tells you to make dua whatever allah has in plan for you no one can force allah to do what he does not want so if there is good in it it will take place allah will make it happen if not then your dua would not be answered so be content with whatever allah decrees for you insha allah you will have what"
