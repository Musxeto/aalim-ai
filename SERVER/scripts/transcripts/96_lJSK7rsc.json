  "transcript": "Halima from France. Yes sir, I would like to know if I can go to Body Minute to do my body exfoliate and body massage by another female. You want to go to a massage parlour to get a massage. Is it for medical reasons or for recreational reasons? Honestly, it's for my skin because I think I don't know how to exfoliate my skin and done by another person, I'm thinking maybe it's going to help me. So I want to do a body exfoliate in a body exfoliate shop by another female sir. A body what? Body exfoliate to clean my body. Okay, so it's like detoxing or using some substances or some material that would purify your skin. This is permissible providing that the areas that you expose to this female practitioner are not your aura. So your arms, your legs below the knees, maybe some part of your neck and the back of your shoulders are permissible. But to expose your back, to expose your thighs, to expose your belly and the likes, these are all not permissible to be done unless there is a medical necessity for it. And Allah Azzawajal knows best."
