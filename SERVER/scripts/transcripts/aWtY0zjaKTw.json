  "transcript": "from the usum so um I was wondering uh because some mids here celebrate events New Year who who's with me IM yes um so some mids celebrate um like events such as like the Islamic New Year um Independence Day by like grilling burgers and hot dogs and like sometimes they also have an event called uh Haloween which is basically like on the night of Halloween they bring inside the Masid and like explain why it's Haram or play games and give candy so like are these events permissible to attend or organize as long as there's nothing Haram there's no problem inshallah as long as they're not doing anything that would annoy worshippers or disrespect the Masjid it is permissible the Masid is an Institute that gathers the Muslims and it has to be facilitating for their Affairs for the the youth for the children for the families to get them on on board and to try to make them come in this community or society as long as there is no disrespect of the Masjid and everything that is going on is halal and they're not celebrating anything Haram there is nothing wrong in that inshallah"
