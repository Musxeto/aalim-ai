  "title": "Ask for a ruling if the harm would outweigh the benefit? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Isa from the UK. Sheikh, we know that when we don't know ruling, in that instance, you can correct me, yeah in that instance, we have to go in accordance with our gut feeling. You can correct me if I'm wrong but Allah does not hold us to account to this gut feeling and later on we need to ask to get the actual ruling. So my question is, is it obligatory to ask for a ruling if there will be more harm than good for example, it will cause someone to be more OCD or it will give them the year. Jazak Allahu Khairan. This is too generic Isa, mainly speaking that Allah says in the Quran, Fas'aloo ahla dhikri in kuntum la ta'lamoon. Ask the people of knowledge if you do not know. Now to claim that if I were to ask this would open the Pandora box and it would increase my OCD and it would cause me a lot of hardship is not a legitimate excuse. If you're asking as a form of entertaining your overthinking, this is when the Sheikh would restrain you and put you back where you should be. Any knowledgeable Sheikh would say listen, you're overthinking, what you're doing is not healthy, you have to stop here. And he would not entertain your questions and he would block you from moving on and continuing to ask such questions. But if this is a legitimate doubt, should I be in a place where there is music blasting all over the place just to eat some ice cream? Is this legitimate, acceptable, permissible or not? You don't say, I'm not going to ask because this would open the door for OCD or it would cause hardship upon me. No, this is not permissible. You have to and your justification is not valid. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
