  "transcript": "[Music] and hamza from bosnia in my country when somebody dies they make a little poster like a death note about the person who died and they put all the information there about the dead person like when the person was born when when the person died the funeral date and who is the family of the dead person they also insert the picture of the dead person regardless it's male or female as for the females it's most of times that it's a picture without hijab so they will stick those death notes in the city so people can know about this so could you please give a few words about this jazakallahu wajazaku hamza from bosnia in his country and many muslim countries when a person dies they hang posters all over the city announcing that so-and-so had died with a photograph with when he was born when he died some of his achievements and some of the words that his loved one shared with about him so is this part of the sunnah the answer is no this is an innovation and this is sinful because it is a form of haram mourning mourning a deceased by publishing it is prohibited in islam and scholars say that it's not permissible to go and announce it over loudspeakers and messages and elsewhere that so and so has died this is totally prohibited and if you add to that putting a photograph of the deceased and if you add to that if she's a woman without a hijab this is definitely sinful you"
