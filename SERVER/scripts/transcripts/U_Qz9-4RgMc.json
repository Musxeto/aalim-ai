  "title": "Is playing with Dice ok for Educational purposes | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sallah is a math teacher and sometimes teachers become innovative not in religion but in the ways they want to convey the information and the knowledge to their students so probably she came up with the idea to test their I don't know his colon in English the multiplication timetable maybe so they the children or she throws the dice and it's six five and she points to a student and the student says six times five is thirty which is it good and she gives him a or her the the mark so this was at first but now she's saying that I didn't know that this was not permissible so is it sinful to continue doing this it seems to me that the hadith is referring to the dice itself when playing just to avoid I don't know that the wisdom when the Prophet tells us pray fetch Iraq two rakahs and Mallory Rakas I don't know what the wisdom is but I comply so when the Prophet tells us a sirum that whoever plays with the dice as if he's dipped his hand in swine blood and this is definitely an ijazah and impurity so I wouldn't come in there and say no no no this is only regarding gambling or regarding this or that the issue of playing with dice is prohibited now for you as a teacher you can use a computer or a number generator which is an app you can find and you just press it it it tells you nine times three you would say 27 or whatever this is what it generates and this is permissible because this is not a game this is a test for the children's to to revise theirs but avoid using the dice you can write it on pieces of paper five times for five times five and mix it up and they choose one and they answer it this would do the job in sha Allah just to be safe rather than being sort"
