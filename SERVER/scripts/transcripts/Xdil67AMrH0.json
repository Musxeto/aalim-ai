  "transcript": "Ibrahim from Guinea? Yes, Ibrahim. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. First of all, Jazakallahu Khairan for everything you taught me, Sheikh. And you as well. My question is about backbiting. I have a little issue knowing exactly when it starts. Basically, let's say, if I'm with my family, my mother, my big brother, for example, we are discussing the behavior of my little brother, saying that he's doing this and that, he's maybe going out and doing some bad stuff at home, at which point does it become backbiting? I'm not sure, because sometimes we have to discuss maybe the issues of the family, and we say, okay, this kid has to do this, or he doesn't do this, we have to find a solution for that, and so on and so forth. So I'm afraid that we might go into backbiting without really knowing. So I was wondering if you could give me details about this. When is it a fact? Okay, got it. Ibrahim, if you are just venting without any purpose of corrections or advice, this is backbiting. But when you discuss your kid brother's faults with your parents with the intention for all of you to collaborate and come up with a solution on how to fix him and how to help him, this is not backbiting. So advice is not backbiting. Warning others is not backbiting. Identification is not backbiting. Complaining to people of authority is not backbiting, and so on. You are a manager. You need to discuss your subordinates with other managers and supervisors so that you can evaluate them and correct them if needed. There is no backbiting in that, inshallah, and Allah knows best."
