  "transcript": "Raqib from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh in the last episode of Ask Sahib I told you about my problem that I am stuck in a loop and not being able to work on my goals even after trying for the last two years so you told me that it's an evil eye and if Ruqyah doesn't work then you'll tell me what the problem is so I'm doing Ruqyah with both water and without water but I'm not sure whether the Ruqyah is working or not so I'm eager to know what else the problem could be as you said so that I can inshallah deal with the problem accordingly in the future I don't remember your question Akhi but basically speaking when people complain of unable to achieve their goals or to organize their time or to accomplish missions assigned to them usually it's an evil eye and if you do the proper Ruqyah for that for four five days maybe maximum one week you will see a lot of improvement in your focus in your concentration in the way you deal with things if you fail to have any improvement this is a clear indication that Alhamdulillah you don't have any evil eye or jinn possession or black magic what you have is an inability to balance your activities to organize your time and to manage it you have a problem with time management with organization with discipline and this is something that Ruqyah would not help you in it's something that has to come within you need coaching courses and lessons where it motivates you and tells you how to run your schedule and your day and to mix with people successful people to see how they made it and what are you not doing correctly and that would also change your life inshallah"
