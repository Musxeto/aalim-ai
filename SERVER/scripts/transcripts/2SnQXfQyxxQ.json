  "title": "Day of Judgement will be like 50,000 years so how will Allah question ALL of us?",
  "transcript": "you know on the day of judgement is going to be fifty thousand a year so allah what you did with it how you earned your wealth and how did you spend your work and what did you do the knowledge that you got allah only these five questions or is it going to question each and every single like statement which you made from our mouth every action that we did throughout our life for example if a man lives for 60 to 70 years will allah held him accountable for even a mistake which he made in his early 20s and really bring him up bring him into account of the judgment because of that issue and if i say that yes to all of your questions what are you going to do of course i'll be like i'll be i'll make sure that i don't make single mistake i don't i don't come in okay then the answer is yes simple as that see this is what shaytan does occupying you with things that would not benefit you what would benefit you is i have to block facebook blog instagram blog snapchat because it is taking away away from allah azzawajal i have to stop watching movies listening to music i have to stop free mixing i have to learn my religion quran but shaitaan doesn't want you to do this he wants you to sit there and say how is it possible that allah would do this and this and this and this but i'll get it to your question he says how long is the day of judgment which is 50 000 years how is it possible that all these billions of people allah azzawajal would ask them the four questions or the three or five the question or five questions four or five questions and would allah as they would go into details with them this is totally disrespecting allah azzawajal to think for a moment that allah cannot ask the trillions of humans and animals and birds and fish and ants and uh viruses and and bacteria and everything that allah created that we can tell and things that we do not even know about to think that allah is not capable of doing that is an insult to allah first of all if you want to really ask a question of this category or of this caliber how could allah create all of this and i always give this example this i that we see through so magnificent that even the best of technologies could not manufacture something to replace it with blind people yet there are 14 billion eyes human eyes at the moment and there are billions in the making in the mother's wombs and allah azza made all of this and don't ask about the trillion of eyes of animals of fish of birds of insects that exist differently and perfectly in this universe let alone what's the things that we don't see so when you ask such a question this note means that you don't really know who allah is allah azzawajal told us that we will stand in front of him and we will be questioned we will be questioned for sure but there are two types of questions one is in general and two is in detail so those who are questioned in general they are forgiven and pardoned but those who are questioned in details you did this when you were 20 years of age you did this on that particular night you did not pray fajr on that particular day those who are interrogated and held accountable for each small thing those who will be doomed and thrown into hell as the prophet said al-islam whoever is interrogated about his record books he will be tormented in hell may allah save us don't spend much time on such things and focus on what i am doing today am i on the right track am i on the right path have i memorized sufficient amount of the quran do i know the tafsir do i know is my akida well am i enjoining a virtue and righteousness and forbidding evil and vice all of these things you will be held accountable on day of judgment allah knows best"
