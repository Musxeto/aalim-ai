  "transcript": "Binta from Italy. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So I have asked you if I could be at school without niqab and you said no. So I left school but the situation now is that my parents don't support me and if I don't restart school they don't support me. What do you mean by they don't support you? They kick you out of the house? No, but my father want to send me in Africa village where the life is difficult. Your religion is more important than how difficult life is in Africa, Binta. So if they insist that you take off your niqab, what will you do if they insist that you take off your headscarf? What will you do if they insist in you wearing a mini skirt or a short skirt that exposes your legs and wear a shirt that exposes your arms? When will you draw the line? So no, you have to put your foot down and say if this is what you want, I'll go back to Africa where I can practice my religion insha'Allah and Allah will make things easy for me. May Allah make it easy for all of us."
