  "title": "Is Abu Hanifa among the Tabi'een? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I think we have Talha from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. My question is that regarding Abu Hanifa, Rahim Allah, is he among the Tabi'een? Like has he met the Sahaba? Like I've heard that he's met like Ibn Mas'ud or Anas ibn Malik. No, the most authentic opinion that he is not from the Tabi'een. He is from Tabi' al-Tabi'een and this is as good as al-Tabi'een because these three favoured generations that the Prophet ï·º told us about, the Companions, the Tabi'een and the Tabi' al-Tabi'een. So the most authentic that he is one of the Tabi' al-Tabi'een. May Allah have mercy on him and may Allah be pleased with him for all the goodness that he had given to the Muslim Ummah."
