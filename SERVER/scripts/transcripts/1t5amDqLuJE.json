  "transcript": "muhammad is saying that while urinating when he wanted to do a stinger and wash his private part the water fell on the ground and it caused it to mix with the urine and splashed on his body if you are certain that there is urine on your body you have to wash that do i have to take a full shower no the only the areas that are affected but if the water is running the urine is running and the water is poured over it is also running so the water usually overwhelms the little amount of urine and whatever splashes that comes to you if you can identify that this is urine the characteristics of the color the the uh the smell and i hope you don't have to taste it then this is urine but if the characteristics are not there it's only plain water then the assumption that it is urine is not changing the fact of certainty which is everything is pure until proven otherwise allah knows best"
