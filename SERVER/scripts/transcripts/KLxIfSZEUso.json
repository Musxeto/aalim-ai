  "transcript": "Sino from Austria Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikum Assalam My question is Sheikh I often have extreme fear that I have committed kufr or shirk and I repeatedly recite the Shahada and you once told me not to say the Shahada unless a scholar confirms that the situation was actually kufr or shirk Now I have written down so many situations in my notes app that I can no longer keep up with all the questions Every day I experience situations where I am extremely afraid of dying as a disbeliever I never had such fear before I also suffer from terrible thoughts about Allah What should I do? I would highly advise you to take a counseling session with me where we can speak about this and clarify all these doubts and as a heads up and I'll tell you what why do you need such a session Compare how you are today with how you were 3 or 4 years ago and you will find that you are deteriorating and the trajectory of your life is going downhill quickly Why? Simply because Shaytan has messed up your head You need therapy You need someone to slap you on the face figuratively of course to wake you up and open your eyes and look what Shaytan is doing to you and this is what we do in our sessions We show people how foolish they are and make them laugh upon themselves, Ya Allah! I've been doing this? This is crazy Why was I doing this? People who quit smoking 10, 20 years later, when you say to them You used to smoke? He said, Yeah He said, How? He feels so embarrassed He said, Wallahi, I don't know It was the craziest thing. I don't believe that I used to smoke How would I inhale such filth and things that would make me cough and sick. I don't know what use it was to me but I used to do it So they don't believe that they used to do such things. Likewise in therapy when you show the people the traps of Shaytan and how he led them to reach such a bad valley of thoughts about everything they can see clearly and they can open their eyes and avoid this bi-idhnillahi azzawajal"
