  "transcript": "our first caller for today is zayna dean from the uk i'm sure this is regarding something that happened to me personally with one of those so-called codes and code muslims so i was going to a car and i did my best but i was going to a car and in the car the muslim driver he was having music in his car so i talked to him please turn the music off and i told him that this is not permissible and he said that why is this no no no no i told him the verse is at the quran and the hadith of the prophet said he says no no no this is not this is sahih bukhari we cannot trust the hadith and imam used to pray musical instruments so so why is it not permissible and so many other things and so i just wanted to ask you did i do something wrong and does his statement have any basis whatsoever because i know i have i have the quran and the student and the sooner from the uk he got into a vehicle and the driver who is a muslim was playing music so he gave him advice and explain to him the verses of the quran and the hadiths and the the guy simply did not listen did not comply so he's asking had i done anything wrong the answer is no you did not do anything wrong you did what allah told you to do and that is to forbid evil and to advise people however we have to be aware that your fingers are not the same length so not everyone who's called muslim is a practicing muslim there are muslims who are deviant they are muslims who are sinful there are muslims who are negligent they are muslims who are arrogant would not accept anything coming from someone your age or someone who they think less of so you did your duty and you should not expect praise or appreciation other from allah azza because whenever you start to react negatively when someone does not listen to your preaching this means that you're not doing the preaching for the sake of allah rather you're doing it for the sake of yourself or for fame and this is dangerous yeah"
