  "title": "Ruling on wearing only one shoe",
  "transcript": "is from Palestine Salam aleykum Selam to LA I don't know it's permissible to wear one shoe while finding the other okay this is your question yeah okay Pais is asking that what is the ruling on wearing one shoe until I find the other there is an authentic hadith where the Prophet Allah saw some prohibited this and he said either wear them together or walk barefooted because the Shaitaan this is the way that he wears his shoes and this is something we have to take for granted I didn't see Shaitaan and I don't know if he wears shoes or not but I believe what the Prophet had told me I saw sauna so as Muslims we cannot wear a shoe in one foot and the other foot we don't wear anything on it either wear them both or walk barefooted until you are able to do this so I hope this answers your question Clay's"
