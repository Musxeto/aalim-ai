  "transcript": "[Music] is true and should we differentiate between jews and zionists from indonesia says that his day differentiates between the jews and the zionists well such a difference has only surfaced lately zionists is a racist movement so among the muslims we do have zionists among the christians there are zionists so it's not related to a religion to my own humble understanding when you're a racist when you are part of the apartheid regime and you want to segregate people and classify them into castes as in the case of india this is part of being a zionist men are equal created equal by allah azzawajal but to try to polish the image of the jews and say that they're not zionists this most likely won't work the jews are the people of the book they're all not the same shade there are of them who are zionists there are of them who are open enemies of islam and there are those who are not fighting us not forcing the muslims out of their homes so we can try to get closer to those but in general the majority of them are against islam and the muslims therefore this is the default until proven otherwise not the other way around allah mentioned the jews in the quran and described them to us so do you think we are going to believe what the media is trying to polish nowadays and neglect our quran and the sunnah no matter who comes no matter who rules if they come and say that no no the jews are fine the holocaust was a horrible thing we have to teach it to our children the muslim children's in schools we have to emit and remove verses of jihad verses that describe the jews in the quran we have to remove them from our syllabuses at schools what is this it's a new religion choose a new religion other than islam but don't say that this is islam this is all part of the global movement to change islam to fine-tune it to dilute it so it becomes a liberal religion not related to islam where all religions are okay you want to prostrate to buddha it's okay you want to worship a cow we'll build you a temple all of this is not part of islam islam is clear quran islam is believed by 2 billion muslims all over the globe and it's the fastest spreading religion no matter what you do you will not succeed but here is your role as a muslim to stand up in the face of such attempts to change your religion in wisdom with wisdom with knowledge with peace explain to the people that this is not islam explain to the people what the hypocrites are trying to do to infiltrate islam to undermine the infrastructure of islam to change the conviction and the perception of muslims about quran sunnah their attempts to destroy our religion you have to stand up in their face and explain to the world not to sit idle and say laura and do nothing about it you"
