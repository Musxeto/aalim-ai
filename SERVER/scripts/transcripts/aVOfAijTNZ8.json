  "transcript": "abdul hamid says is it permissible to plant a tree on someone's grave to save him from punishment of the grave as people say that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam planted a tree on a person's grave and said until this remains green i hope he will be or he will not be punished first of all the hadith abdul hamid is referring to is not about planting a tree the prophet alison placed two twigs two branches that were green over two graves because he passed by these graves and he said they are being punished over something that is not so major by allah it is major one of them used to gossip among the people and gossiping here is in nemima so he used to listen to folks talking about other people and then he goes to them and say they said so and so about you so that he would cause a clash and fighting and the other one the other grave the man did not protect himself himself from a urine while urinating so the ricochet if this is the um the right word to use the deflecting urine coming back to his body and his clothes and he doesn't pay attention to that so he's being punished for that then the prophet is placed two twigs two branches and he said i pray to allah that their punishment would be reduced as long as these twigs are remain or these branches remain green once they dry it's over my intercession is would be over now abdel hamid says is it permissible for us to do the same to plant a tree to play place a branch that is green on people's graves because the prophet did that allah the answer is no this is not permissible one would say why didn't the prophet do it allah the answer would be as follows one did any of the companions afterwards did this to the graves of their friends and loved ones the answer is no did the prophet alaihisosam ever do this to other deceased or people who were in their graves the answer is no okay do we know whether my cousin or my brother or my uncle whom i had just buried is being tormented in his grave or not i don't know that does the prophet no definitely it was a revelation and he knew so how would we assume that my cousin my brother my uncle is being tormented in his grave who gives me this knowledge she said i don't know but just to be safe rather than sorry i'm gonna place it placing such a branch would be an innovation because this is is a speciality of the prophet islam he was given this intercession and he prayed to allah to reduce their punishment until as long as it is green who gave you that indication that allah would reduce their punishment let alone if not to increase their punishment because of your action of course this is something in the world of the unseen and we don't know hence it would be a grave innovation to do this and it's an innovation what people do when they visit the graveyard and they throw water on the grave claiming that this would call the grave down for the disease why don't you install an air conditioner maybe that would even cool it more all of these things are nonsense these things are of the world of the unseen that has no connection to our world so therefore we cannot claim things act upon them and innovate in the religion of allah and allah azzawajal knows best"
