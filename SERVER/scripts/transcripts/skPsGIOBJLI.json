  "transcript": "Laila from Pakistan. Sheikh, my question is about retinal discharge and I am so confused about it. For example, if one woman gets prone discharge in the middle of her menstrual cycle and I saw one of your videos and you said it's Istihaza and she has to perform Wudu and clean herself for each prayer, it's continuous. Okay, I understand. But if one sees prone discharge first and then after some time she sees pure white or clear discharge and when she sees white discharge, she prays the whole day normally. But again, when she gets discharge, it's very, very slightly yellow, which is very hard to see. So the confusion is how could I know that if it's prone, yellow or white? Because it's last time I saw and it was white and all the prayers I offered in this situation is valid or not. Please guide me about it. First of all, we've mentioned many times that vaginal discharges that are transparent or white in color, which women get usually, these are not affecting or impacting their Wudu, their purity, nor their prayer. Now, if a woman gets colored discharge, which are not the norm, remember, not the norm. In this case, this is part of Istihaza, which means that after the Adhan is called, if they want to pray, they have to purify themselves, change whatever stained with such impurity and make Wudu and pray, regardless of whatever comes out. The following prayer, she does the same. Now, when it comes to not being able to differentiate, how would I know? A woman should know the color of her discharges and whether it is abnormal or the norm. So if it's transparent or white or a little bit off yellow, she knows that this is the usual that she gets throughout the whole month. Then this is her normal vaginal discharges, it does not impact her purity or her prayer. But if it is a bit darker and she knows that this is not normal, in this case, she has to treat it as Istihaza, and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
