  "transcript": "Zuhayb from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, Wa Alaikumussalam Okay Sheikh, I had asked you this on text that I came in Saudi Arabia in the Marqat Shaban in Mecca. I did my Umrah Now in Ramadan, I'm in Medina. I would be going back to Mecca a few days but Now I'm confused whether I should do an Umrah again because it gives you a reward of Hajj But on the other hand doing two Umrahs in one journey is an innovation as you have said many times So I wanted guidance in this respect. Akhi, I answered you I think whether on my website or on Twitter And I told you you can make another Umrah. You assume you're a Haram from Medina because you are still a traveler so yes the Not Being recommended to make another Umrah is for someone in Mecca who made Umrah and staying Mecca he goes to Masjid Aisha perform a Haram from there and goes and makes a second Umrah the following day He goes to Masjid Aisha performs a Haram and comes and performs a third Umrah. This is not from the Sunnah Nevertheless, no one said it's not accepted. It is accepted But it's if you're looking for reward, this is not the right way of doing it because the Sunnah is to have one Umrah per travel as for you You have already traveled to Medina. So when you're coming back, this is a second journey besides Those who are deprived from coming frequently some people come For Umrah once in their lifetime, they don't have the means to come again and again We tell them yeah, if you want to make another Umrah for your father for your mom, no problem in that because You're different from someone like us who goes every month. For example, maybe twice a month That's different because we're so close to the Haram with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal or someone who's wealthy who could afford to travel That is also different and Allah knows best"
