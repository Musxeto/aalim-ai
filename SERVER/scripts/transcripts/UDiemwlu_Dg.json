  "transcript": "Emma from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. In some gatherings with my family there is free mixing, so can I still attend if I do the following three? If I speak to only my mahrams while my non-mahrams are all around too, I try to only say salam to my non-mahrams and I attend but isolate in a separate empty room. If as long as you are staying in an empty room or in a room that non-mahram cannot enter or mix with you, there's no problem for you in attending such gatherings because at the end of the day you did not attend a gathering of haram. You are in a room with your mahrams or with other women, so there is nothing wrong in that insha'Allah. The wrong is that you go and sit with them on the table or mix with them or exchange greetings and socialize. This is not permissible."
