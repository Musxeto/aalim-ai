  "transcript": "We have Younus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum The room we pray Jumu'ah in is a little small, so some of the congregation, including the imam, stands on a place outside the building. The thing is the ground there is rather rough, so what they do is they take a thick plastic mat and roll it all over the place. So everywhere there are these holes, yet you don't see them, there is this rubber mat. So when you prostrate, maybe your nose or your foot or so is prostrating on air, and the congregation stands on there. So the thing is, if the imam, me and some rows stand on this place, then 90% certain some people don't prostrate properly, and maybe the imam may also not prostrate properly. So is it okay? Because like in the row, I don't know, every third man's prostration is invalid, so does this mean the rows are broken? I hope you got my question. Not your question, I got your way of thinking. So you are judging people, you are appointing yourself as someone to say your prayer is valid or invalid, and this is a very bad mental status. You start to think that my prayer is valid, my prayer is good, my prayer is perfect, maybe the one did not put his nose on the ground, maybe the imam, his feet were not even, maybe this, maybe that, and this is a very dangerous way of thinking, which shows that shaytan is getting the best of you. Akhi, you have to stop what you're doing and ignore this totally, pray your prayer for Allah Azza wa Jal and move on. Allah did not send you to judge people. Allah didn't tell you, before you start your prayer, make sure that the ground is even, make sure that the people when they prostrate, better more, don't pray. Just sit there and watch the imam if he's praying correctly or not. This is not logical akhi, move on, offer your prayer for the sake of Allah, forget what others are doing, it's none of your business, and Allah knows best."
