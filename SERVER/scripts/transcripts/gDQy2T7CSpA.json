  "title": "Must we pay Zakat in Ramadan? Difference between Zakat and Zakat ul Fitr",
  "transcript": "[Music] lots of people do zakat in Ramadan is it necessary to pay zakat in Ramadan who should pay the cat who should pay the cat al-fatah these are many questions related to the cat first of all you have to understand what zakat is we're not going to talk about the cat of livestock we don't have livestock usually we're not going to talk about the cat of crops because we don't have farms usually and we're not going to talk about the cat of goods and commodities that are sold and bought as in groceries as in a showroom of cars etc because usually were normal people we talk about the cat of gold silver that is jewelry of the missus or cash which is what I save and possess among others so what are the conditions of the cat there are two conditions without them zakat is not obligatory number one that the amount of money saved or the jewelry possessed reaches what is known as nisab and this is known as threshold what is the threshold it's a limit which below it there's no circuit what is this limit well in terms of jewelry if the missus has 85 grams of gold or above and caliber of gold is 24 she has to be the cat for that if she has 84 there's no zakat if she has 85 but of twenty two or twenty or 16 karat gold there's no zakat you have to do the math because when we say 18 carat of gold this means that 18 carat is gold and 6 is compensated with copper so it reaches 24 so this is false it's not gold so the 22 you have to do the calculation the calibration until it reaches 24 carat of gold 85 plus in silver it is 595 grams of silver and the cash threshold is measured by silver so if you have the value in cash of 595 grams of silver which is approximately $300 give or take then zakat is due this is condition 1 providing that condition 2 is fulfilled and that is that you possess this for a whole lunar year so if I had it for 11 months there's no zakat on it 11 months and 25 days snow is a cat on it when it completes 12 lunar months in my possession then I have to pay 2.5% the easiest way to calculate the cat whatever money you have divided by 44 zero the result is your zakat easy if I have 40,000 dirham divided by 40 the result is 1,000 cars this is my jacket if I have eight eighty thousand miles ahead is 2,000 if I have a hundred thousand I wouldn't be here talking to you 2.5 mm 500 grams clear clear handle pipe we have this tendency everybody is giving zakat in Ramadan why is that they say it is more reward we want multiplication of the azure we want Allah to love our good deeds in Ramadan wait wait wait wait okay this doesn't work like this yes Ramadan is a blessed month to give charity not to give your do obligatory zakat what's wrong in doing that I'll tell you what's wrong the poor get all there's a cat in Ramadan the coming 11 months they're begging people for money and this is not how it works your wealth has to be calculated according to the completion of one lunar year it might complete in Muharram in Revere in Jamaat in Rajab in the Haeju depending on the circle the completion of the lunar year but to deliberately intend to give it only in Ramadan this defines the purpose of zakat if the lunar year is completed in Ramadan haleh's there's nothing for you to do this is how it how it comes but to insist on giving it in Ramadan whether by extending instead of one lunar year you say I'm going to stretch it to 15 months how long but if you shorten it if your zakat is in the ledger and you say no I'm gonna pay it four months earlier so I pay it in Ramadan no problem this is for the benefit of the poor instead of waiting another four months you are giving it ahead of time there's no problem but delaying it no it is not permissible who should pay the zakat usually women ask this question men never ask this question they know that it's their obligation to pay the there's a cat but women they possess a lot of gold and she doesn't want to pay the cat so she asks who pays the cat for my jewelry is it my husband answers no he's not obliged to pay there's a cat for you but sure I don't work I'm a housewife I have children I am poor a sister you have a kilo and a half of gold what poor are you talking about you're rich but you are dependent on your husband to pay it every year if he does this out of his own will Zaha logic he's a loving husband you should kiss his feet instead of nagging and giving him trouble but if he doesn't want to the person possessing the money the person possessing the gold is responsible in front of Allah I don't have an income share sell some of the gold you have and it's a small portion you sell it and give 2.5% on that who should pays the cattle further zakat afetr is something else it's called zakat avatars of the cattle Fattah it is not related to your possession to your wealth it's a different category the cattle fritter is related to the charity you are obliged to give at the end of Ramadan timeshare when does it start it should be given the night of Eid so tomorrow is the day of read you should give it before the Adana fetcher the last night ad it can be up to the 27th or 28th so giving it two or three nights earlier is no problem because Abdullah no more used to do this and a number of the companions may allah be pleased with them so can i give it on the 15th of ramadan no can I give it another first of Roma Bahn definitely not though some schools of thought say it's okay but it's not okay what is the amount ship the cattle footer as in the Hadees of Moosa a the hood REE and a beloved normal may Allah be pleased with him and others the Prophet Hollister I'm obligated the cattle fitter to be one Saur Saur what is Sasha I can even pronounce the aim as you do this is to love measurement by size so it's like leaders not like kilograms so asides a container and this container is measured or or we measure with it items like dates like barley like wheat like sugar things that are consumed and measured by size once are is equivalent to four would and the mood is what is gathered and the palms of your hands so if I have rice I just do this and I fill it up this is one wood one two three four this is one saw so this is a cattle filter is once are if it is measured with rice this once are when put it on a scale it weighs about 2 kilos 0.125 grams of course if I weigh in the SAR date the weight is going to be different if I put in this size barley it's going to be different in weight than rice or then wheat or then dates etc because the size is 1 the weight is different so usually the scholars give the weight in kilograms because this is the most common but if they give the zakat in flour it's different so they have to go to the size again and check how much it weighs in flour and barley in corn and whatever who should we give it on behalf of well it's the responsibility of the father of the house the guardian of the house the one who spends money and puts food on the table and he has to pay it on behalf of those who live under his roof and eat from his kitchen so we pay for Muslims whether women or men whether freed or slaves whether young or old and this is the instruction of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam why do we do this purpose one so that the poor would not need to beg on the day of eight so we suffice them from asking people for their essentials do I have to give total strangers to me no if I have relatives of my own cousins uncles aunts who are classified as poor or needy then giving them the catheter would give me double the reward the word of zakat and the word of connecting my kinship providing it is not my responsibility to provide for them what do you mean I can't go to my son who is poor and give him the cattle photo because it's an obligation upon me to feed him I can't go to my grandfather who is classified as needy and give him my zakat a photo because this is my responsibility but if a sibling of mine a brother who's married and if he dies I will not inherit him because he has children or my father is alive and my sibling is stoned broke and I give him the catheter this is valid and ok and I get double to your word can we give all my zakat hospital to one person who's poor yes I don't have to paint if I have ten in my family have I don't have to feed ten poor people no I can give all of our rice or wheat or whatever to one single poor person without any problem you [Applause]"
