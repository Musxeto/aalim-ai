  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam and you are? I am Emma. Did you say Ammar or Emma? Yeah that's what they told me. What is it the name? Emma. Emma okay. What can I do for you? Sheikh firstly I'd like to thank you and may Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la reward you for those because I am a convert and you were a major aspect in encouraging me towards it. My question is that from being a convert I am studying abroad in a free-mixing university and have taken to wearing the niqab. I'm from forbidden from my parents to stop my education and I conceal from them that I wear the niqab since they have forbidden me from it. I have tried to involve in practicing Islamic events and involving in more classes but please advise me on what more can I do without being transgressed by my parents. I think that you are almost doing the maximum to the best of your ability. As long as you go to your classes, you stay away from boys and you're abiding by your full hijab, you're not socializing or free-mixing or communicating with the opposite gender and you mind your own business and you go on your own so that you finish your studies peacefully, inshaAllah you're doing the right thing. Keep up the good work, try to serve your parents to the best of your ability so that they can see that Islam has reflected positively in your behavior and they would notice that this shift and the change in your character to the positive aspects of it is attributed to your Islam. And this is the best form of da'wah inshaAllah. May Allah Azza wa Jal make you steadfast on Islam and guide them to Islam as well."
