  "transcript": "so our friend from the UK zina Dean says that he downloaded an app of growing flowers on his mobile and his mother is telling him to delete it so he's saying that should I am I obliged to obey my mother I don't know this app but if this app is totally permissible and legit and you do not spend a lot of time on it so it's like 5-10 minutes something that is random so you're not obsessed with it and there is nothing harmful to you then you should try your level best to be diplomatic with your mother and explain to her that there's nothing wrong with that at the end of the day if she insists on you deleting it being a dutiful son and such an app would not harm you to delete you're better off deleting it but try to communicate with your mom and try to investigate why she doesn't want you to play with it most likely it has an impact on your concentration which your mother is afraid that it would deteriorate because of that app and Allah knows best"
