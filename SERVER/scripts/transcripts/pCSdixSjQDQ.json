  "transcript": "Hasnain says if I forgot to recite Darood and Darood I think they mean by 8 the salutation upon the prophet Isaiah Salam or dua Masuya and the drama surah I think it's the hadith of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him Allah any other on tune of seiderman Cathy Allah well in now allah fear allah allah and fulfill him l fear ottoman indica or how many in the country for Rahim so he says if I forget both is my prayer valid first of all the salutation upon the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam is an issue of dispute whether it is recommended mandatory or a pillar so scholars differed at the last shot before you conclude your salat 'what's the ruling on saying allahumma salli ala muhammad in wala anna muhammadan commands allah tala ibrahim etc to the end some say it is recommended to have some say it's obligatory some say it's a pillar and the most authentic opinion in my view which I'm inclined to say in use that it is mandatory if you forgot it it's compensated by to do the sell if you deliberately leave it your prayer is invalid this is what I believe as for Durham essaouira this is not part of the salat meaning that it is something recommended this is something that the Prophet has some taught Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him to say but it is not mandatory so if you say it it's good if you don't say it then there is nothing wrong on you insha Allah Azza WA JAL"
