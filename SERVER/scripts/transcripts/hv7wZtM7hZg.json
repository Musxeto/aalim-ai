  "title": "How to abide by the law in countries that do not implement Islamic Law? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "actually this is from Hamid Ahmed a second person most of the countries not following the Islamic law countries like India proposing uniform Civil Code so how Islamic jurisprudence is useful and practical in modern world well Mohammed what kafir countries say or countries that are Islamic but not implementing Sharia they enforce their own laws while we as Muslims are obliged by Allah to follow the Sharia law here we come to a fork of the road because Allah tells us this is Haram and the government forces us to do something that goes against our religion or prohibits us from doing something that is permitted in our religion here we have to weigh the pros and cons we cannot simply rehna gate and say no I'll not do this I will do and the consequences the disadvantages the cons far exceed the pros and the advantages and I'll give an example the government comes and says you have to insure your motor vehicle we go to the scholars and they say no insurance is totally Haram it is gambling it's prohibited so now I haven't a choice either to get car insurance due to necessity or end up in jail definitely you getting a car insurance that you abhor and hate and you take the bare minimum which is the third party insurance not the full coverage but the bare minimum would be allowed due to necessity like when you are in the desert starving about to die and there's only dogs meat or donkeys meat or work that you can eat no one would say madam adios die and we will pray for you rather you have to eat for necessity and Allah knows best"
