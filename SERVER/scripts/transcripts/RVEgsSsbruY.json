  "transcript": "Ismail from Denmark so when I was young I was young so you have to have some fun but I didn't know that so now a couple years later I am thinking for those months that I have to pass I have to regular online and do I have to pay registration for them because I know so so okay also where my parents are telling me not the best my parents also telling me enough to text because they think it is dangerous because your skin because I think I can pass without any problems or do I listen to them like white caps okay I will answer this mine first of all those who hit puberty and did not fast these days due to ignorance negligence they don't want to fast they know it's mandatory but they simply don't want to fast the most authentic opinion is that they do not make up these days whoa we thought that you should make up missed days you make up missed days that you intentionally broke after fasting them so today I woke up intending to fast I'm fasting everybody knows I'm fasting I pray pleasure nine o'clock ten o'clock am I woke up and I felt hungry I said tell you what I'm gonna call it a day and I eat and drink this day I broke intentionally I have to fast this day I have to make it up even after 20 30 years but if before going to bed tomorrow is a fasting day of Ramadan and I say to himself I'm not going to fast I'm gonna fool everyone else I'm gonna pretend to be fasting I'm not gonna fast so I intended not to fast it this day cannot be made up assuming that you are from the first type you started fasting and broke it you have to make them up how many days I don't know this is something you have to estimate if I say a thousand days oh this is too much if I say five days hidden no this is too little so 100 days no this is too much uh six days no this is too little and we go back and forth until we reach a date that you think that this is probable add a day or two just to be safe Point number three is there is a difference of opinion among Scholars whether we have to feed a poor person due to the fact that a Ramadan or more had passed without making them up or not the majority of Scholars say that you feed According to some Companions and the most authentic opinion and this is the choice of they mean that there is no proof or evidence from the Quran or the Sunnah to back this up so we don't expiate while making up for a day of Ramadan that was missed even if it was 20 30 years ago all what you have to do is to make them up and that is it an Allah Knows Best foreign"
