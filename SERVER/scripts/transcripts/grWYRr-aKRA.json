  "transcript": "Ahmed from Turkey Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Some days ago I asked you about the religious relics at the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, Turkey and you said all of them are fabricated and bogus. Do you have any evidence suggesting that they are fabricated and bogus? No, no, it doesn't work this way, Ahmed. Now don't let your nationalism kick in the way. You who claim that this is of the Prophet ï·º, you have to prove it. It's not the other way around. Otherwise I would say that this was used by Hazrat so-and-so of the Companions. He used to drink green tea in it and you can smell the green tea. You believe me. People bring a hair braid and it goes like 15 meters and this is from the Prophet ï·º and it keeps on growing and growing and growing and they put perfume on it and they put it in a glass and gold box. Akhi, what is this? All of this is bogus. So when you come to a sword that is three meters high and you claim that it is the Prophet ï·º, you do the math and get the archaeologists to do the carbon radiation, carbon whatever, carbon 14, I don't know what they call it, to check the time and you will find it's 400 or 500 years old. Not 15 centuries old. Garments that have not worn out again and helmets that people and historians say that no, these helmets were not the one that the people of the Prophet ï·º time used to wear. This came 300 years back or afterwards. These things, anyone claiming these things, they have to bring the proof and it doesn't work the other way around. And besides, akhi, don't be offended if you don't like what I've said. Disregard it and move on."
