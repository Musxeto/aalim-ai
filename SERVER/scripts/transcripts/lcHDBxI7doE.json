  "title": "Are women made from their husband's ribs? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - Dec 2",
  "transcript": "khadijah says is it true that Allah made women from her husband's ribs there is a hadith which is authentic where allah azzawajal where the Prophet said are insults on that Eve was oh ha WA or hawa was created from the left rib of Adam and in the Quran Allah told us that he created Adam and from him created his wife so the majority of scholars say that this is a fact that there was first Adam created by Allah's hands but then Allah created from his rib his wife Eve or hawa and from them are the human race therefore to say that women are created from man's ribs is not true only one woman was created from her husband's rib and that it was Hawaa mother hawa or mother if she was created from Adam's rib"
