  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamd now the force has shifted and the Muslims are getting stronger day by day the funny thing is that throughout the mecca period throughout the 13 years that the prophet had spent in meca the Muslims were ordered ordered not to fight back some of them were killed a lot of them were tortured physically Allah ordered them not to fight back and this shows you that this was from Allah the religion is from Allah any one of us would have given the the permission to take up arms and to defend yourselves and die in your cause but this was from Allah the all wise the all knowing Allah knew that if they were to even raise a hand the whole of quray would annihilate anyone who accepted Islam but because they did not fight back they felt these are insects aunts bugs they're not going to harm us let's just toy with them and this preserved Islam so what was next on the agenda of the idol worshippers of qur they made an unjust Covenant and they hung it in the Caba and this just to show you the audacity of these people what was in the Covenant that they would not marry from Beni Hashim and you remember the prophet's name Alam Muhammad abdah abdb Hashim now ABD mutb by the way Al mutalib is not a a God that they used to worship Hashim had a brother and his name was Al mutb this is why we have Banu Hashim andu ALB the descendants of Hashim and the descendants of al- mutalib and Hashim had a son when he married in Medina and came back to Mecca so the son was born in Medina he grew up in Medina with his mom and when he was about 14 or 15 years of age hashim's siblings talked to him and said we can't leave your own son in Medina and you has you have to bring him back so he sent his own brother al- mutalib to retrieve his son and gave him money to compensate his mom and his uncles so Al mutalib went to Medina and diplomatically and politely asked them that a boy boy should be raised with his father and Uncle with his tribe and they agreed and he compensated them with man was kind to them and he took his nephew with him back his nephew's name was when he reached Mecca in a caravan the people of Mecca knew the people in the Caravan we know this one we know Al mutalib but we don't know this 15year old with him this is the first time we see him oh he must be a slave he bought from his trip from Medina he is Abdul he's the slave of Al mutalib and this is where this nickname stuck to him he said no this is my nephew he's not my slave but already the name has been there so Banu Hashim and benan mutalib their cousins and because thereof they're being close to one another the people of Mecca in the Covenant treated them together could have said we have nothing to do with Banu Hashim they are our cousins but we don't have anything to do with them they did not they took sides and said we will stick with our cousins so they all went into the Ravine of Abu Talib an area was known for Abu Talib who the uncle of the prophet and his name as you know ABB and they boycotted them both Banu Hashim and B that they would not marry from them they would not sell them anything they would not sit with them they would not mix with them they would not enter their homes they would not speak with them until they surrender the prophet and give him to them so that they could kill him and they wrote this Covenant and hung get inside of the Kaa the Muslims were surrounded and they were blocked from all means to help and protect them their children started to cry their women suffered immensely because of this boycott and they could they could hear the sounds and C rise from beneath and Beyond the Ravine of hunger and starvation the Muslims suffered a lot to the extent that they had nothing to eat except leaves of trees and all pieces of thrown heaves and leather that was tossed away with the exception of what was sneaked in from their relatives and friends without the notice of the people of quray but this was not sufficient this was not enough s abas may Allah be pleased with him says I remember this heart time that we spent in that Ravine of Abu Talib once I was urinating and I heard something under my urine so after I finished I dug it out and I found a piece of heave or leather of a dead sheep so I took it and I washed it and I burnt it and I ate the ashes of it and it gave me strength for a few days see the amount of starvation and hardship they went through and this went on for three years until a group of men Idol worshippers but honest men they convened in secret and said to one another what's happening happening to our friends and relatives in the Ravine of Abu Talib is unfair 3 years and there women and children are suffering for doing what and each one of them started saying this is true this is unfair if I had a man to support me I would have stood against it and one of them said I'll support you and he said if I had another man to support us we will stand against it a third one stood and a fourth and a fifth and a sixth so they all plotted and in one of the Gatherings of the people of quray one man stood and said what's happening is unfair Abu jahal said shut up and sit down another man stood said no he's telling the truth you shut up and sit down and the third one stood up and said they are saying the truth it's unfair so so six of them stood up and proclaimed that this was unfair and Abu Abu jahal said this is something that was plotted earlier this is not something that was just spontaneous this was plotted earlier and the people of quray sided with them and felt sorry for those in the Ravine so they went into the Kaa to take down this unjust Covenant and to their surprise found that it was almost dissolved all of it except to the names of Allah the Bookworm came and ate most of it and alhamdulillah they were released from that Ravine unfortunately this three these three years had its toll over the uncle of the Prophet Alat wasam Abu Talib and 6 months after leaving the Ravine and being released Abu Talib fell sick and died and 3 Days Later our mother Khadijah also died may Allah be pleased with her and the prophet was 50 years of age at that time Scholars call and historians call this year where mother Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her and Abu Talib the uncle of the the prophet Alam died in they nickname this year to be the year of sorrow but nowhere in the authentic Hadith where the Prophet himself or his companions had called this year the Year of Sorrow so it's not an actual authentic name of it and this was about 3 years from migrating to Medina this was on the 10th year of Daw in Mecca so the support both Financial physical emotional and the rest that the prophet hadam from two of the most beloved people to his heart mother Khadijah and his Uncle whom he tried to the best of ability to make him say the shahada before his death so that he would intercede to Allah with it but he he could not and Abu Talib refused to embrace Islam this support that he got from these two individuals was all gone which meant that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam needed to look for other forms and means of support and protection for himself and for the Muslims alongside with him [Music] [Music] for [Music] for"
