  "title": "Calling others to do good while you do not, is it sinful or hypocrisy? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "there is a boy who may uh there's a car of morning and evening on your website alhamdulillah so a boy alhamdulillah he trans uh transformed or something like that he transformed it into a pdf and he sent it to many people urging them to recite all the asgard so in that asgard is uh the the longest one which is hundred times that 100 times so that boy himself he doesn't uh often means never almost never he recites that ascar so is that boy sinful okay faizan says if someone calls people to virtue and to good deeds but he himself is not involved in it is he sinful or not dancer is no he's not sinful if i tell people to pray night prayer and to offer witcher every night and i give a beautiful lecture but i myself don't pray night prayer am i sinful the answer is no because night prayer and witter are not mandatory when would i be sinful i would be sinful when i ask people to do mandatory things while i'm skipping it and to refrain from haram things well i'm involved engaged in it while they don't know while i am not remorseful for that you see when allah tells us to do something or to stay away from something there are four things that we must do one to do what allah tells us to do two to advise people to do these things three to refrain from what is haram for to prohibit and forbid people from falling into that haram so these four things i'm obliged to do now if i'm capable of advising people ahi you have to pray in the masjid the prayer of the masjid is the difference between a believer and a hypocrite and the reward you're getting i'm also obliged to go to the masjid myself but if i fail from going to the masjid this means i've done one out of two now what is the reason for not doing it if the reason is because i'm a hypocrite i just ordered people to do good while i don't do it and i tell people not to do haram while i'm engaged in it then i'm a hypocrite because i'm happy with doing this with my role and this the hadith of osama bin zayed may allah be pleased with the man with his father where the prophet tells us about a man on the day of judgment who goes round and his guts are spilled so he's going ground like in a mill and people say whoa hey dude what's happening when we were in dunya you used to tell us to do good and prohib and forbid us from doing bad so what's cooking he says well i used to tell you to do good and not do it myself and i used to prohibit you from doing haram and fall in it myself this falls exactly on a person who does this as a hypocrite not as a fearful person who asks others please don't smoke smoking is bad well he smokes himself and he's remorseful regretful and he doesn't know what to do he's so weak this is different we're talking about someone who's defiant between him and allah and he's happy that people think of him as a righteous person while in depth he is a hypocrite and allah knows best you"
