  "transcript": "um [Music] from the emirates we're trying to make one of my brothers over here in uae but he's from nigeria and the lady we have is in nigeria as well so we're trying to much make them but oh the boy here is asking for the mohara to be there if they have to make the video called to see each other so we want to know the the the alarm way to do this if they are going to make the video call is there anymore adam have to be with the lady or not so we want to know where where is where is where are the the parents and the family of the lady yeah actually mashallah the ladies the lady mashallah she's a child she's a she's a practicing muslim but i think she came out from the the outs of the cultural islam people so they don't really practice and they don't know they understand the way it's gone so for a mother is late but she still has the father but the father is the culture islam people they don't really understand the thing to the estate so she was trying to a bit panicky maybe they are going to ask some ridiculous question to the husband so she she didn't want to make she didn't want the or the father to be there or i don't know how what she's trying to give the experience okay i will answer i will answer you inshallah uh let's go back to mashud's question from the emirates mashood's dilemma is that his brother is interested in marrying a woman the woman does not have it seems the approval of her guardian now he said that she's practicing she's a good muslim woman but her parents are cultural and their family so there is a lot of ambiguity there is no ambiguity in islam marriage is a crystal clear cut process the prophet said allah there is no marriage valid of a woman without the consent and approval of her guardian who is her father end of story this is the fatwa of the prophet yes sheikh but the father is cultural and coming from nigeria most likely he would ask for a dowry of 50 cows so be it this is how people get married look for someone who's asking for 10 rams maybe get a discount this is not my problem as a muslim you have to follow the process of islam now if the father is deviant and he is rejecting all people of a good akida he's interested only in tariqah followers tijani jilani or whatever he doesn't want anyone who follows the correct authentic akida of allah and he refused so many okay this case this guardian has to be changed he's the father ditch him throw him in the garbage because he's not qualified he's not fit so what to do it's not the girl who chooses it is the muslim judge so you go to the muslim judge you present your case the judge looks into it he discovers that you tell what you're telling is true he appoints someone in the girl's family a brother a gra a paternal grandfather a paternal uncle someone who's close to her and makes him a guardian after checking out whether he's fit or not this is the right way of doing it now i've done and i've been doing and i'm still doing alhamdulillah counseling and i've met so many cases where the same issue comes to me and we need you to conduct the nikah and to be kind to us we are in a dilemma we don't want to fall in and they make you weep with them you're so sympathetic with their case if you did not have knowledge nor the experience nor the guidance from allah most likely would fall in their trap but you say to them how would i know that the girl is telling the truth oh she said to us that her father did you meet her father no okay then you're taking her word no this is not valid she might be a play girl she might be looking for a sugar daddy i don't know whatever is happening this is not legitimate so it has to be changed and allah knows best you"
