  "transcript": "in mentioning some of the cases where the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam wept uh in the Battle of bad at the night of the battle of bad Al AB Talib says at night I have seen all of the companions only the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was standing under a tree praying to Allah and weeping until it was morning this is what people do when they have something they want from Allah if you desperately want Allah to do something for you you have to show your sincerity you have to show your poverty you have to show your humility to Allah most people when they make Dua Ya Allah grant me this grant me that pay off my debt and do this and do that and what is this their hearts are not ATT tentative their hearts are not sincere the Battle of bad was a pillar in Islam and this is why the prophet spent the whole night praying weeping urging Allah Asel for victory and he was granted that Victory Abdullah Omar may Allah be pleased with him says may Allah be pleased with him fell sick so the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam went to visit him alongside abdas and abdah when he entered he found him fainting so he said is he dead and they said no so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam started to weep and his friends started to weep and the family started to weep so the prophet said to them reminding them don't you hear Allah does not punish and torment for the Weeping of the eyes nor for the sadness of the heart but Allah would punish you and torment you over this meaning what you say that shows you're complaining of Allah's Calamity or Allah would have mercy meaning if you say good things and the deceased is being tormented by his fam's crying over him and this is an authentic Hadith a deceased is tormented a dead person is tormented when his family cries over him and this is not a punishment because it's not his doing rather it is a sort of hardship that gets to you when you know that your family is grieving over you and likewise here is not punishment or torture rather it is a form of hardship and torment as the prophet said traveling is a piece ofab of Torment when you travel on people say okay when I travel I have fun it's not torment no it is when you leave your bed your home and you go to another place and eat new food yes you're enjoying it and you're having a holiday but it is a form of change of norms that would be causing you hardship no matter where you're going and enjoying it there is hardship in traveling and leaving the norm also animatic tells us may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was commenting on the events of the battle of M the Battle of M took place on the eth year of Hijra where the Prophet sent 3,000 men to fight the bantian Empire The bantian Empire came with how many men only 200,000 200,000 Army came to fight 3,000 men and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam appointed three leaders because he knew that something's bad going to happen so he said Z should carry the flag and be the leader if he dies then jaali should take it and if he dies then abdah should take it so this is uh um the the the the the art of management in management we have something called succession planning when you have a company and you have one president or a supervisor who's or a manager who's very good in his Department and then he goes for another offer or he dies or he retires if you don't have the proper succession planning your company will fail and this is what's almost happening to Apple after uh uh what's his name Steven Jobs they came someone and they've they're living on his ideas and Technology now iPhone 16 came after 15 what is the Improvement nothing so this is the downfall because they don't have the proper succession planning the prophet Alam was the best strategist he sent an army of 3,000 appointed Z who is z h he adopted son so he sent his most beloved person who's ja his cousin the most among the companions that looks like the prophet physically and in Behavior then he sent abdullaha who's Abdullah Raa his poet like the minister of information the prophet had three poets Hassan abdah and Malik they were the best poets that would propagate the da and defend the prophet and it so happened on that day of the battle thousand miles away Allah revealed to Prophet Muhammad alham and he announced it after the Salah to the people in the Masjid now the same thing where everything happens he said the armies of met and Z took the flag and he fought bravely in the cause of Allah until he was martyred then it was taken by Ja what's the other name of Jaffer nickname ja what is a the one who flies why because he took the flag they chopped his hand he took it with the other hand they chopped his hand he took it with his shoulders and they killed him so that the flag would not fall so Allah substituted him with wings in Paradise he flies so Jaffer took it and he was martyred and then abdah took it and he was martyred and the the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was weeping while he was telling the companions dear dear friends of his and relatives then took it and he is the sword of Allah he named him the sword of Allah without being appointed because when the three appointed all died the people said what should we do I don't know what to do we don't have anyone suggested so he came forward said I'll take it because he knows he's qualified and Subhan Allah 3,000 men managed to fool 200,000 and they retreated with minimal loss we would have expected that they would be annihilated and killed also the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to weep whenever he remembered death and in the Hadith uh the prophet Sall alhi wasallam was with his companions in the cemetery in the graveyard and he sat on the edge of the grave and he started to weep until the soil was wet with his tears and it shows you what kind of emotions he hadam and he said oh my brothers to this day a similar to this day you should work and be prepared and W it is a sincere advice we are all born to die we are on our path yeah how long do you expect everybody comes say may Allah give you long life long life then what yes then what I'm going to die so what's the point and mua sufyan may Allah be pleased with him when he was the kif of the umad Empire he went to the pulpit giving kba he said the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam died when he was 63 Abu Bakr died when he was 63 Omar died when he was 63 and I am today 63 years of age meaning what am I waiting for and he started to cry and by the way he died when he was 884 death doesn't come to you when you want it death comes to you unex unexpectedly are you prepared have you written your will have you prepared your wife and your children that you're going to die or they don't want to hear this a lot of us don't talk about this no talk we're going to die get ready some of us even prepared to transfer the mobile phones to their children and to their names and to ensure that everything is secured the bank accounts the hidden accounts some of them wrote their will everything has to be prepared for you to be waiting don't say oh I'll wait until I'm 40 or 50 or I'm 60 or I'm 17 no be ready to leave whenever it is necessary so from all of this we understand that crying is not something that shows your weakness or a deficiency or any of these signs that we associate with weeping it is a sign of sincerity of emotions of the Lively Ood of your heart and how compassionate and passionate you are the most important thing is that it is not accompanied by wailing not shouting not having a high pitch or Mourning the dead or this is what is totally prohibited and Haram so this was the beginning of the day of the Prophet Alat wasam the sun risen he visited his wives he checked on them came back to the Masjid he used to pray D prayer and usually as per sah Muslim the minimum is how much two the norm the prophet used to pray for as narrated by mother in Muslim the prophet used to pray for four Ras every day and we should try to at least pray two raas because we have to pay the compensation the S of our joints for every day and two does the job this time of D was also the time when the prophet used to make up for his missed night prayer mother tells us that he used to pray usually 11 ra every night sometimes he used to over sleep due to tiredness he was exhausted throughout the day so he could not make the night prayer sometimes he was sick he could not pray the night prayer what would he do mother AA said whenever the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did something he used to fix it not miss it even one small little deed he would be punctual he would be consistent so these 11 rakas if he missed them at night what he would he do he would pray them at the time of D this time but he would add one ra because wi is only for night if you're going to pray it in the daytime it has to be all it has to be even numbers so instead of praying 11 he used to pray 12 2 by two by two six uh uh sets of two these are twelves and this is the time for it and then this time would be a lot of time between uh uh um sunrise and so the prophet used to utilize this time doing what he used to visit those who needed visiting he used to go for different errands he used to utilize it so that it would be beneficial for him for his family and for the umah if nothing he would go back home and what would he do when he's home he used to help in the house Shores if needed so mother AA says he used to milk his own goat he used to stitch and uh uh um fix his own garment he used to serve himself he used to fix his sandals if it's needed fixing or sewing but when it was time for prayer he used to leave everything and go to pray with the people and sit to them speak to them teach them remind them and listen to their complaints try to reconcile between the people who were having disputes and then go back to his home again and all of this as mother AA says milking the goat and fixing his shoes and patching his thobes tells you that he's what that he's humble that he's down to earth most of us when they go home they are uncrowned Kings they sit on the sofa they have four remote controls one for Showtime one for Netflix one for Apple TV one for I don't know what and they have the table to the left to the right uh bring me coffee bring me latte bring me water bring me some crackers bring me some uh uh nuts bring me bring me anything just go go go and he's just being served and Subhan Allah he getting fatter and fatter by the day because he's not working he's not doing anything not the prophet he used to do things with his own self that shows you how humble he is in Muslim the prophet said Allah revealed to me that all of you must be humble and not to have any feelings of arrogance or to look up at yourselves and look down at others the prophet was a role model and it is mindblowing show me a president a king a ruler a government official who is not rich through Haram means they collect and gather and own everything and they're the richest and we know and they know that we know so when you want to judge someone look at his financials look at how the prophet lived he was so humble he did not own property no Mansions no properties of land no stock Investments he did not own rides and cars and and and and yachs and airplanes even his dresses he had only one maximum two and nothing fancy when he slept how did he sleep he slept on a mattress made of tanned hide of leather filled with palm fiber imagine do you think it's comfortable when you sleep on Palm fiber and every time you move things crack underneath you and it's harsh it's not like sleep high or sleep rest or whatever the sleeping is sometimes he used to sleep on a mattress made of straw the the same that we take for outdoors on it's very very thin sometimes he slept on the ground itself on the soil nothing and his pillow was made of the same material he's so humble that he made this clear to everybody Once A man was summoned in front of him while the prophet was sitting on the ground so the man started trembling and shaking he was afraid he's a prophet of Allah what did the prophet sayam take it easy I am the son of a woman from quray who used to eat dry salted meat take it easy I'm I'm just a normal person look at his humbleness he did not say I am the greatest of all mankind and he is he did not say I am the greatest messenger of Allah and he is he could have said anything he could have said I am the man whom Allah sent the angel of the mountains to collapse the mountains on top of Mecca's people if I wanted and I didn't he could have but he did notat he would not even allow people to compliment him and praise him with other than what Allah described him of so whenever people came oh you are our Master you are this you are that they Praise Him and compliment him normal people what would they say yes yes yes true I'm yeah I'm more than that all famous people like poets to come and give them poetry and you are the greatest you are the bravest and and they know they're lying but they give them a check yal they gave something in my praise not the prophet he would only say to the people do not exaggerate do not praise me and compliment me like the Jews and the Christians complimented their Messengers I am the servant of Allah and I'm his messenger that's it this is all what you say about me part of his humbleness that he was not a tyrant most people who fail to show their humbleness are tirant they don't consult they don't ask people for advice what I see is what I do not the prophet he used to consult his companions sh share your ideas with me and this is why when in the Battle of bad came to him and said oh prophet of Allah is this a place Allah told you to assume for fighting the kufar or is your own opinion he said no this is my own opinion so I say he said well I think this is not the best place oh prophet of Allah it's best that we keep the wells of water behind us so we have water to drink from to wash from when they're fighting us they don't they'll be thirsty they'll be desperate for water and the prophet liked the idea and he executed it and they won with the grace of Allah also Salman Al farise in the battle of the trench when the prophet said we will fight them but they're coming with like 5,000 men too many of them so Salman said in my country we used to dig trenches that would hinder and stop and delay their advances and the prophet liked it and they dug this trench and you know the story The Prophet himself Alat participated in digging the trench until he was filled with dust What leader would do this any leader would just give instruction and orders no the prophet participated with his own hands and he told us that there is nothing wrong in working with your hands in doing labor work not a prophet of [Music] Allah came without working as a Shepherd every Prophet was a Shepherd in his life and they said even you he said even I I was a Shepherd for few gold coins for the tribe of so and so when I was in Mecca why because a Shepherd learns how to deal with sheep how to be kind to them how to take care of them and a messenger has to know how to do the the same with his people so it teaches a messenger how to lead and to deal with the people as such an Malik says whenever the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam visited the ansar he used to go to their children wipe over their head gives them Salam what does this show you it shows you his humbleness nowadays people make this as a Public Relation stunt so in the social media you'll see a famous footballer stopping the security and going to a child and taking a picture and taking his T-shirt and come on you want me to believe this this is not you this is our Prophet this is his life 24/7 these celebrities arrogance shows in different ways but this is a Public Relation gimmick they do it once every blue moon to gain popularity and followers The Prophet's humbleness was also not limited to the people but even to The Messengers The Prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam would not [Music] allow others to say that he's better than other prophets and Messengers a man from the Muslims once argued with a Jew and the Jew said by Allah who chose mosa and made him better than everyone else on earth and the Muslims could not control himself he slapped him how dare you say that Ms is better than Muhammad Alat was so the Jew went to the prophet he said oh prophet of Allah this man beat me up because I said so and so and the prophet saidat do not favor me over Musa because on the day of judgment I am resurrected and I see that MSA would be among the first two to be resurrected before me so this shows you that the prophet is so humble that he's saying that MSA was resurrected maybe before me because I saw him catching at the pillars or at the feet of the throne and and the likes just to comfort the Jew and at the same time to show the Muslims how humble he is as for the truth of course he is better than mus he's better than no he's better than Adam he's better than ibraim sallallahu alaih wasallam he is the best of all Messengers of Allah and he's the best of all the humans and the gin and the majority say he's the best of Allah's creation though it's an issue of dispute is he the best of Allah's creation all in all or he's the best best among the Creations that we know among the Jews and the humans and and among the humans and the Gins the Gins and the and the Jews are the same so it's it's okay among his humbleness the prophet Alam he used to refuse and hate when people stand up for him in Arabia when we're sitting and someone comes into the room what do we do we all Stand Up Shake shaking hands and and and the likes the companions of the Prophet though they loved him the most they would never ever stand up when he comes in why because they can see how much he hates this this kind of praising and complimenting he does not endorse or like so they used to sit nowadays if you come if I come to a gathering to a room and I find you sayam and say and I come to shake hands with you and you are sitting down if I don't have IM I would feel a little bit bad and why why didn't he stand up personally I never stand up I just shake hands with people this is theah but if I see someone old I don't think the people older than me but if I see someone who's old or someone who is arrogant and I know that he will feel bad about it I stand up just to keep the evil away but if you guys among you know the Sunnah follow the Sunnah don't stand up and don't allow people to stand up when you enter sit down come on the love is not in Standing Up the Love is taking your wallet and give me some money no this is but unfortunately this is cultural so the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam would not allow people people to stand up for himself he was so humble that he rides on a mule a donkey yeah people of dignity would say me I ride only in a camel or a very big in expensive stallion a horse a donkey a mule no he would ride on a mule and he would take someone behind him on the same donkey in so manyi like well known he was on a donkey and ab was behind him only people of humbleness nowadays hi she come ride with me what is your car Cora no no no I go only in May maybe no sh I have Hundai oh it's even worse no this is not what defines you your car your shoes your house it doesn't make you who you are it's your character it's your knowledge it's your Iman that defines you but unfortunately nowadays people are so weird one of the sisters was telling me that her sister asked her to buy a bag of L Louis vuon I think HH sorry so I did not make a mistake in bukari and Muslim this is the name Louis vuon they say and she says it's 30,000 r a bag 30,000 R almost any 300 3,000 Dirham what you again it's not bukari Muslim 3,000 din this is crazy so no it's beautiful it's this it's that what are you going to carry minut maybe five five dinar this is insane this is extravagance this is Haram but people they think that this identifies them this brings them Prestige and this makes them and these are the poorest on Earth if you think that your watch or your pen or your car or your slippers or your shoes or your house makes you a person you're nothing you're not a person look at the best person that ever walked the Earth used to ride a mule he used to even go to war on a mule in h t he went on a mule people need something strong to March and Retreat and run and attack the prophet had so much confidence in Allah he went on a mule and when everyone dispersed and ran away after being ambushed the prophet on the mule was kicking the mule charging on the enemy saying come to me bravery Beyond imagination he's marching through the to the Army he's saying I am the Prophet this is another lie and I am the son of Abdul mutb my grandfather ident ifying himself this is humbleness of the Prophet Alat also his humbleness was not only with his companions it was also with the strangers who was he was one of the old Arabs before Islam and in Arabia anyone you say he's as generous as hatim because he is the utmost in generosity among the Arabs hatim why they said he had one of the most expensive horses in the world a guest came he did not have anything to host him he slaughtered the guest whoa that what I this is what I would have done but he slaughtered the horse and presented it to the guest without the guest knowing and after the guest ate and found said the meat was good what is it he was my horse the guest was what have you done this is one of the most expensive horses in Arabia said you deserve more than that his son was the trib's leader of and he came to the prophet so he was walking with the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam and when he went to the prophet's house the prophet invited him to his house the mate gave the prophet s wasallam a cushion now the logical thing among and he's a king this ad is a king the logical thing that in my house what will I do with a cushion I will put it and sit on it he said instead the prophet sat on the ground and put it between him and me to lean on and I said no no no no no this cannot be a king no King on Earth would do a thing like this and he ADI says I was walking with the prophet still he did not accept Islam and he was hesitant he wanted to and when a young girl came and took his hand and started speaking to him for a while in the streets and the the prophet was listening to her he said no this can't be a king no king would ever stop to a commoner and chitchat with him in the middle of streets like this this shows you the true nature of the Prophet part of his humbleness the companions say that when he walked he would never allow them to walk behind him usually people of importance and Authority would always walk in the front the prophet says no you all walk in front of me so that I can see you and protect you if you needed protection they said oh prophet of Allah what about your back maybe someone will attack you from behind he said Allah will protect me don't worry about my back and this shows you the humbleness he uh was in he looked like everyone else to those who did not know him and this is why whenever the prophet was sitting in the Masjid with his companions a stranger would come in and starts to ask who's the prophet who's the prophet who's the prophet until they tell him this is the prophet of Allah they they could not identify him this is why the companions when they saw this they built to him a Porsche of clay of mud a little bit higher so that he would sit on it and we would sit on the sides so whenever someone came and saw him elevated and we're sitting by his side they would knew know that he was uh uh the prophet Alat so we're still in the blessed time between sunrise and what would the prophet do this time he would utilize now why do I emphasize the word utilize unfortunately we are the slaves of routine of a system I confess guilty as charge this is something very bad in me I have a routine that I never break it's like clockwork you know I I go to the mid I come back I do this I go to the gym at this specific time if I miss the time by half an hour it's gone I don't go I don't like to leave the house after if I pray and I have an invitation I don't go I don't do this I don't do that if the lunch is not served at exactly 1:00 if it's 1:30 I don't eat I just go to bed I sleep very bad this system is very bad because it makes you a servant and a slave to it the prophet did not have this Alam the only system he had was what Salah everything in his life revolved around prayer time so this is how we should build our system our times our schedule our planning revolves around the times of prayer not the opposite nowadays the priority list the end of the list is Salat but we go out we do our shopping we do our business meetings we do uh family visits we do this we do to go to the restaurant and Salah if it comes within alhamdulillah if it doesn't who cares I'll pray it when I go home and this is totally totally totally against Islam your day revolves around the prayer times your timings your visits your outings your Innings everything revolves around Salah then you will get the full Baraka in your life in your studies people come to me she I have exams next month okay can I skip Salat in the Masjid why because if I go to the Masjid and come back this will take a lot of time and I have I think it's called mbbs what five minutes I thought it was lights doing what's wrong okay five minutes so um distracted me so they have mbbs so we have to study we have to okay what will happen if you go to the Masid and come back so no consume a lot of time what time you want Baraka where does the Baraka come this is very weird if you want to skip Salah and pray home and disobey Allah and you expect him to give you high marks go to the Salah and make that your priority and study hard and Allah will put so much Baraka that you will get better grades than anyone else but it is not a choice Salat or my studies no Salah comes first everything is cascaded afterwards so the prophet Diversified his time in this be blessed time he used to go and visit his relatives his friends he used to often go and visit Fatima why because he was in love with Al Hassan and Hussein his two grandchildrens and he used to say these are my sons not my grandchildren they are my sons and they are the masters of the youth in paradise and he used to say oh Allah I love them oh Allah love those who love them and we love alassan Hussein undoubtedly of course so he used to always go there and Fatma knew it and she used to prepare them and dress them and they used to come and play with him and he used to play with them catch and hide and seek no catch and seek so Hassan would come and the prophet would do this to him as the Hadith says and he strives to escape him and then he Embraces them and he embrace the prophet and they kiss one another he was like three four year old child but he knows those who love him he used to the now well I can finish two minutes okay um so he used to also go and visit anas Malik's house whenever he went there anas says oh prophet of Allah wouldn't you pray for us meaning it's a place of Baraka so he used to bring this mat washes it for him prays with behind the prophet Alam and his grandmother and his brother when the prophet used to walk he used to walk in the markets in this time and visits he used to walk in a very agile and fit manner as if is picking the ground he wouldn't walk like us you know old guys and no he used to walk in a very fastpac people catching up with him would be tired but this is his nature he was not faking it this is how fit he was and whenever he sees boys he would stop and give Salam to them wipe over their head make Dua for them he would smile in people's faces and any child any woman who would like to speak to him he would wait and listen to their queries sometimes he in the Hadith in this blessed time he used to pass by seeing someone skinning a sheep he slaughtered the Sheep he's skinning it and skinning a sheep is an art it's not just pulling the skin out so he saw some man doing this said my nephew my my son this is not the way of doing it and he went out of his way and started insert in his palm between the skin and the flesh this is the way of skinning it and said this is the way it's done how humble you can be doing this and teaching people something that is of not great importance Malik one of his companions says oh prophet of Allah can you visit me home I am too old and tired to come and pray in the Masjid the prophet goes and visits him and prays he says where do you want me to pray for you so that they would take this spot in his house as a Masjid so he prayed for him in that spot and answered the the the the call of his uh companion visits anas house Young Brother Abu om he had a small bird that died every time the prophet goes He jokes with the boy what did this small bird do and the bo laughs and remembers his he used to go and visit and utilize the place if it's before the time he would go back home and take his Siesta what we callula the Siesta is before and this gives you like 10 to half an hour 10 minutes to half an hour a boost and energizes you to go on for the rest of the day sallallah alai what you success"
