  "title": "Can we accept a dinner invitation from a NonMuslim Family? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The next question is, is it okay to accept dinner invitation from a non-Muslim family? The Prophet ï·º, as in the hadith, the sahih, was invited to a sheep that a Jewish woman invited him and his companions to come and eat from. And he came and answered it. This is a clear example that it is permissible. Now, it is also permissible for us to invite them. But what is the reason? Is it just to be friends and to be buddies and besties? No. My intention when I answer such invitations is to represent Islam, to give da'wah directly or indirectly. Likewise, when I invite them to break the ice because they think, oh, this Muslim family is a terrorist, they're going to blow us up. No, come to some samosa, some shorba, you know, and eat together and try to show them what Islam is. But not to be best friends and to hang out together and to invite their Christmas Eve turkey food and wear Halloween costumes like I think soon Halloween and trick and treat. What is Halloween? No, Halloween. When is it? 31st. Oh, alhamdulillah. Anyhow, so this is problem. Either you are so rigid that people hate Islam because of you or you're too soft and mashallah, we're besties. I have a Christmas tree in my home and I will invite you to a turkey and Thanksgiving. No, we're Muslims. We're proud of who we are. But when we invite or answer the invitation, it's for the sake of Allah to give da'wah and Allah knows best."
