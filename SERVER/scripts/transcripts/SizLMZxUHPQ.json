  "transcript": "Sophia says is wearing niqab an obligation or a voluntary act and what are the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah as why to wear the niqab nabob is what is known as a face veil so whatever a woman wears on her face this veil with an opening for the eyes this is called niqab and it's called me up because of the opening of the eyes it's not which is a hole and this is an obligation according to the most authentic opinion of scholars Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned in the Quran in chapter 33 surah 2 adds up in verse 53 he orders the mothers of the believers who are the wives of the Prophet Allah salatu salam to communicate with companions of the prophet from behind a hijab and the consensus of all scholars of Muslims that all wives of the Prophet Allah so some must cover their faces there's no difference of opinion upon them or among them all wives of the Prophet SM must cover their faces and this ayah 53 whenever you ask for your 10 cells from them ask from behind a screen this is purer for your hearts and their hearts so this this is total segregation you cannot see the wives of the Prophet as Salam faces this is verse 53 now have this at the back of your mind and moving six verses later from the same surah allah says in verse 59 yeah you Halloween yeah you Hanabi Oh prophet of Allah only as Logica woburn Attica when he said in what meaning command your wives your daughters and the women of the Muslims you didn't inna la Hinnom injurer be behind to lower down from their garments valleca aDNA a you AR othn ax fillet Dame this is more befitting that they are not recognized so that they are not harassed now in this ayah the command is for three types of women to lower their garments so that they're not identified so the wives of the Prophet the daughters of the Prophet the women of the Muslims three types now if you compare this ayah to verse 53 where it commands the wives of the Prophet to cover their faces if you come and compare this ayah to this ayah the command in this ayah is for what to cover their faces but in addition for the wives of the Prophet are excellent Allah included the daughters and the women of the Muslims which means that they as well should cover their faces as mentioned in a at 53 because the mothers of the believers are joined with them in this command in ayah 59 and there are a lot of other evidences mentioned in the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam which is logical but before it's logical it is the ruling of the Quran the Sunna according to the most authentic opinion of squad why do we say logical the face of a woman as they say is her identity if her identity is open to all this is what includes features of beauty this is when she smiles her frowns this is where expressions happen and if this is exposed than those with illnesses and their hearts will be surely tempted and when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam showed us the process of getting married he commanded us to look at the woman we are interested in getting married a man came to the Prophet alakazam he said o prophet of Allah I proposed to so-and-so from the Ansar so the Prophet said did you look at her before you proposed he said no the Prophet said go and look at her this means that if the woman was walking in the streets of Medina going to the shopping centers or to sharps or to the Masjid and she was unveiled the Prophet would not have told him to look at her because the man can't see her but this indicates that every woman according to a mother Aisha used to wear the veil and cover from head to toe there are so many examples that we can talk about but this is not the time it is safer for a woman to hide her identity to hide her beauty so that she is not harassed a woman wearing the niqab no one would come and say whoa what a beautiful look what a gorgeous woman nobody would whistle to her but a beautiful woman who is not covered she would probably be her in such a awful and disrespectful fashion and Allah soldier knows best"
