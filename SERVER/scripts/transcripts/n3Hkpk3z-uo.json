  "title": "Comics, books, & novels with magic or time travel (Harry Potter) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "One is about comics or books with magic \nor time travel. The questioner says,   'Is it a major sin, or shirk, or kufr, to \nread comics or books that include time travel,   magic, communicating with the dead, or coming back \nto life even though these stories have nothing   to do with reality or any religious beliefs and \nthere is absolutely zero fear of getting doubts   as these stories are child-ish and \nnobody believes these are real?'  First of all, we have to look at things through \nthe lens of Islām in order to know whether this   is permissible or not. Because nowadays people \nmeasurements of things is at fault. The measuring   'stick' is wrong. So people weigh things \naccording to the customs, the traditions, logic,   everybody's doing it. And this does not \nwork with Islamic rulings. Because Islām   is a defined religion that has boundaries, \nthat has sets of rules and regulations   which makes everything easy to be judged \naccording to the Qur'ān and the Sunnah with the   understanding of the righteous predecessors. So in \norder to look at the issue of comic books, novels,   stories, books, we have to look through it \nin accordance to the Qur'ān and the Sunnah.   Scholars differed. A vast majority of them said \nthat this is totally prohibited because these are   a set of lies and fabrications. And a Muslim \ndoes not lie. Islām does not endorse lying,   or cheating, or making up things. So a chunk \nof the scholars said that this is harām.  Some other scholars said, 'Well, \nwe have to look into it'. If,   morally, it is a good story that \nhas a good benefit to the reader   and it does not include anything harām. So the \nwhole structure of the story has a good ending,   builds up courage, honesty, \ntruthfulness in the readers' head   and evil loses, it doesn't beautify evil, it \ndoesn't include anything harām - some scholars   say that this is permissible.\nBecause   Allah mentioned examples to us in the Qur'ān and \nHe set an example of so and so doing so and so.  Which is not a reality, rather it's \nan example to us to learn from.   And stories that people know that are not true \nand they are fiction, as long as nothing harām   is included this is a part of teaching people \nwith good moral conduct, Islamic beliefs   and entertaining them at the same time.\nNow having said these two different views,   I'm inclined to the other one. And this is Sheikh \nibn Uthaymeen's opinion, may Allah have mercy on   his soul. Providing there is nothing harām - 'What \ndo you mean by there is nothing harām?' - Anything   of the unseen is totally prohibited.\nSo mentioning angels,   hellfire, mentioning jinn, reviving the \ndead giving them life, changing the form of   an animal to a human being or an animal to another \nanimal, all of these things are blatant lies and   only Allah can do this. So even if it's in \na novel or a story this is totally harām   to write or to read. When you talk \nabout time travel this is nonsense,   because there isn't any such thing and just to \nmake up the idea and to have the ripple effect   from going to the past and changing \nevents that would mean to change the   future which is a present, blah blah blah.\nAll of this is not possible and can not happen and   it's claiming to change people's fates according \nto what is going on this is totally prohibited.  Magic, having magical powers to do things. \nMagic is harām in Islām. Which leads to   Harry Potter's novels and stories and movies \nto be all impermissible for Muslims to watch.   And the list goes on. So at the end of the \nday, Sheikh, we are limited with very little   amount of novels and stories that we \ncan read and write - Yes, this is true.   And we don't have to bend the rule, we have \nto follow them. And these rules are not mine   or yours, these are divine rules from Allah \nAzza wa Jal. Muslims don't cheat, don't lie,   don't fabricate, and don't talk about the world \nof the unseen. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
