  "transcript": "or receiving gift in form of food from non-muslims on christmas diwali etc you said it's permissible to eat if they send you so then please clear that then or fatty food or from any dargah graveyard you are participating in it if someone sends then can we eat that food i hope i explain it properly hope insha allah you answer my question first of all i never said that it is permissible to participate in such haram gatherings whether muslims or non-muslims it is totally prohibited to attend the maunit of the prophet saw or uh quran or a diwali or uh the shabby barat or and the likes all of these are totally prohibited for you to attend now the confusion masuma has is with the food if it comes from a place where shirk is committed or at least innovation how is it possible that i eat and consume this food diwali is a hindu festival so they send us sweets and we know that these sweets were placed in front of their gods and they recited their prayers on it now they're giving it to us i'll make this as easy as possible insha'allah let us assume that this is an apple if i take this apple and i place it in front of buddha and all the buddhists say their prayers and i don't know what that is what i mean this is their prayer and they do this for half an hour or an hour or a full day then they take this apple no pun intended this is apple that so happens they take this apple and they give it to me can i eat it or not you would probably answer without thinking by saying yes you should not eat from it because it was given to the gods of the disbelievers i said i understand but is this apple turning into something haram is it nejis no is it something that i have to throw in the dustbin or it's still an apple that allah sent the rain to the tree so that it grows up and i can get it all foods in islam is halal whether it's coming from the disbelievers idol worshipers christians shoes atheists the food itself is halal except animals that need to be slaughtered living creatures other than sea creatures no we're talking about land creatures land animals here we're told uh you muslims cannot eat from that meat unless it is one slaughtered two the person slaughtering has to be either a jew christian or a muslim and one other condition that we don't know of that you have to be certain that they did not mention any other than allah's name so if you heard them mention the name of allah other than allah it's haram done okay done understood therefore the candies the sweet they send us as long as it is halal in itself there is no non-veg ingredients in it there are no harmful things in it even if they recite their prayers a thousand years it remains halal to eat what is haram is for us to participate in their gatherings or to give them in their festivals a gift this is totally how and the fourth caliph the companion of the prophet the husband of his daughter fatima may allah be pleased with them all he himself was given a plate of sweets and it's called from the fire worshipers on their nairu's festival so not they're not even jews or christians but it's sweets it's though sugar nuts etc so he ate from it and he liked it and he said whenever you guys have something like this send it over which means that the food itself does not turn into haram if it was prepared for a haram event unless it is non-veg it has to be slaughtered for the sake of allah if it's slaughtered for their idols or for the grave's sake it becomes haram and i hope this answers your question and um yeah we'll still have some time left so do ruta"
