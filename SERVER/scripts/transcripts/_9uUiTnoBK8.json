  "title": "How to know if we are really afflicted with evil eye, jinn or black magic? Assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "abdel aziz from sri lanka says you say that not everything we can blame on jinn that's true so how do we know if someone is afflicted by jinn magic evil eye or envy well this is something that the experts in rookia could tell you i'm not an expert in it but i can tell you that if someone feels awkward if someone feels that he did something but he didn't actually do it and people are coming to him he says what's wrong with your head you should have done so and so and said i did it no you did not then this is something to raise a flag if someone whenever he reads the quran he yawns and falls asleep if someone all of a sudden goes into sieges and sometimes speaks different languages then these are question marks but not every failure in our life is attributed to this so if i have a flat tire this is envy if my kid fails at school this is evil eye if my wife nags me she is possessed by jinn if i don't get a raise or a better position or a job then this is black magic etc no this is not true there are no signs but it is indeed a an easy way out for most of us this is why we try to clench to it and justify our failures and mistakes and allah knows best"
