  "transcript": "sam you're from saudi arabia i wanted to ask about the thing i suffered from a problem and everybody has asked me to perform related to marriage and i'm not getting married so can you suggest something that is i can do it for long because then it's a long procedure i usually fail to keep up with it i can do for 2-3 months and then i stop is there anything short and powerful that can be done consistently apart from the morning and evening first of all not every delay in marriage is attributed to an evil eye black magic envy or uh jin possession therefore it is not correct that every shortcoming or a calamity that befalls upon us in our lives we tend to use this to blame whatever is happening to us so the wife is nagging she's possessed by jen the child did not pass his exams it's an evil eye i had a flat tire it is envy um i didn't get a raise this is black magic no this is not the way but if there are symptomses and you feel that there is something that was done you may do rookie and very easy ayatul kursiy the last two verses of surat al-baqarah that's it it doesn't take more than a minute and a half to recite all of those blow on a number of bottles of water reciting them three times and blow after each time and drink from that water in the morning evening afternoon before you go to bed 24 7. only drink from these bottles of water while making a lot of dua in your sujud that allah azzawajal cures you if there is anything to be cured from and to send you a righteous uh pious spouse and inshallah things would be to the better"
