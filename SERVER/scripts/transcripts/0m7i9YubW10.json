  "title": "Knowledge That Raises You By Degrees! Mombasa Dawah Tour 2024 | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] the beauty of our religion is that the more you know the more humble you are and with knowledge Allah raises people and lowers others to the extent that with knowledge Allah differentiates between even dogs imagine dog a dog that is not learned you cannot eat whatever it hunts for you but if you taught this dog and it becomes it has knowledge it knows how to restrain itself from consuming what it caught for you then it becomes Halal for you to send your dog and it hunts for you and it brings a prey back to you all of this is because of what of knowledge Allah subhanahu wa taala is the granter of knowledge he's the one who gave us this knowledge it's not by our own intellect it's not by our own powers and ability it is the grace of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala Allah says in the in the qur [Music] it is Allah subhanahu wa taala who has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you knew nothing when you came from your mother's womb what did you know nothing and subhanahu wa taala is the one who gave you hearing sight and hearts that you might give thanks to Allah subhah and knowledge that is not accompanied by Deeds is harmful because it backfires and you will be held accountable for what you know but you do not Implement so you have to have the deeds and the knowledge side by side Allah says so know oh Muhammad that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women know and ask forgiveness they go side by side and this knowledge raises people even if they don't have a family name even if they don't have a good Financial State uh uh status even if they're not strong in their physique their knowledge raises them up levels in the community in the society and above all with Allah Allah the almighty says Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge by degrees this knowledge raises them by degrees and nowhere in the Quran is our Prophet wasam told to ask Allah to increase him in anything other than knowledge we don't find in the Quran oh Allah increase my health my wealth my Offspring nothing but we find and say my Lord increase me in knowledge how how many Among Us say this seriously how many Among Us in suud every day you say increase me in knowledge increase me in know I I'm one of them I do why because we are dependent on Allah now most of us ask Allah for risk not knowing that risk is not limited to money the best form of risk is IM and knowledge this is the best risk of Allah upon you much more important than a car or a house or a property or a bank account when you ask Allah for Ean this is risk when you say and you have in your intention that you want Allah to Grant you IM and to Grant you knowledge and Allah Asel tells us that the people of knowledge are not like any other where he says say are those who know equal to those who do not know the answer this is a rhetorical question what's the answer of course not they're not alike when you find someone of knowledge by default people look at him to learn and to see if he makes a mistake or not Subhan Allah not only to learn also to see if he oh he oh the Sheikh made a mistake sometimes in in lectures intentionally I put the vessel in here and while speaking I do this and people say sh sh left hand I said hey it's empty got you so Subhan Allah they are waiting for the Sheikh to make a mistake but they also learn from him and this is why they say Imam Ahmed 5,000 used to attend his lectures 500 to write down the knowledge and they write down 4,500 they just look at the Imam and learn from his icate how he speaks how he behaves the the status of Scholars and this is Subhan Allah contagious when you are with righteous people practicing people people of knowledge you have no other choice but to be like them but where you are with the people of Dunya you begin to curse like them backbite like them and behave like them now knowledge when we speak about it it's derived or divided into two types Islamic knowledge and conventional and non-islamic knowledge Islamic knowledge is the one that is praised in the Quran and the sunah which refers to the tap the Quran the Hadith the and above all and everything related to Iman these are the Islamic Shar sciences that cleanses the heart and purifies the soul nothing on Earth does this nothing on Earth can grant you tranquility and peace of mind except these sign I es nothing when someone has a Calamity his father dies his son dies his loved one dies he loses his business he's afflicted by an chronic illness he's devastated he's depressed nothing can comfort him yeah she there is drugs drugs comfort you for what for for a short period of time and the moment you're sober and it gone you become more depressed so you near need a bigger dose and a bigger dose until you overdose and he's dead but when you have the signs of in your heart and you know that this is this is the decree of Allah the Divine ruling of Allah you're content like the prophet said the heart is saddened and the eyes weep and we don't say anything except that pleases Allah and by Allah Oh ibraim by departing you we are sad but we're content yes we're humans my son dies I am sad but I'm content I don't bang my head on the wall I don't pull my hair I don't have hair but if I had I would not pull my hair because I know this is something Allah wrote upon me this is the first type [Music] of the Islamic sh related the second T type of is the non-islamic the permissible and this is divided into two types permissible and impermissible so the permissible that is not related to Shar such as engineer engineering mathematics physics medicine anything that we study in conventional schools and this type is beneficial and can be rewarding if you have good intention what's your intention to become a doctor oh I want to become rich halam Muti I'm asking you guys is it Halal Oram to study medicine and work as a doctor to become rich Hal it's good are you rewarded for it no but it's Hal I'm not doing anything Haram if someone says w because it's a beautiful science and it helps me cure and treat many many people and through which and I know personally doctors like this W Subhan Allah they're doctors and they're rich h no doubt in that but every time they treat a patient the first thing they say and the patient is Moana who's this the IM I'm I'm com to the doctor alhamdulillah okay let's see this Allah will put Allah will put cure and he relates all of his work to whom he's going doing da why are you doing this he said because I want to get the people close to Allah Subhan Allah he becomes rich and he is on the path of Da and he's getting benefit and reward and everything you do in life if you have a good intention Allah will reward you for that even drinking tea you wake up in the middle of the night you want to pray tud but you're sleepy like me so what do you do I'll make some chai and I make this chai I drink it now I'm awake my intention is to get awake drinking the tea is a form of and Allah will reward me because my ni is to strengthen myself everything you do if you have good intention it becomes so this is part of the non-islamic knowledge or science that can be permissible can be also rewarding there is a branch of this knowledge which is Haram and lots of the people people are indulged in it such knowledge and science that has no benefit neither in the dun nor in the such as astrology they study for hours and for years about astrology this is the SC scorpion this is the zodiacs this is and they ask you when were you born why just tell me when you when you were born I was born this this month okay this is what will happen to you in the next 5 years huh how did you know I can see it in the Stars okay the brother also was born in the same date and this one and this one and this one we're all going to have the same events um I never thought of that yeah I think so yeah the the Stars say and this is Haram reading Zodiacs do you have Zodiacs in Kenya yeah in the newspapers they say this H at at the end of the newspaper he said this will happen to you will meet a good friend Subhan Allah this happened to me last week I met a good friend how did you know and you will be disappointed yeah Subhan Allah I was disappointed this morning as well how do they know the future all of this is nonsense now the prophet saidat wasam whoever goes to a soothsayer a fortune teller just for the fun of it I'm reading it for the fun I don't believe in this baloney but um yeah I just read it or listen to it the prophet says 40 days of your Salat will be invalid Allah will not accept you praying 40 days from that day but if you believe it then you have left the fold of Islam you have become a cafir how do you believe it you read it and it says that uh watch out this week there will be a huge accident and tomorrow while going to work you see this huge accident should you this is what they told you believed it you're a cfir now done deal because you believe that someone other than Allah knows the future and also part of the knowledge that is Haram is the knowledge of acting we have Hollywood Bollywood Nollywood inshallah you don't have kinwood I know they have kinwood which is you know like Sony and uh and the likes but I don't know the knowledge of music you get people going to school and colleges and studying musical instruments in D and and the likes and notes and how to play and Mah he's a good guitarist he's a good pianist he's a good violin he's a good ballet dancer a man wearing tights like this shame on you go wear pajamas wear something decent but they have this and they consider to be something nice knowledge but it is Haram knowledge that Allah does not approve of and you're sinful for doing it therefore we always hear the misconception of people saying this professor he teaches uh uh mathematics you say that he is not a scholar he is not he's not someone Allah loves a mathematics is a science that is Hal but it is not what Allah praised in the Quran listen to what Allah said in the [Music] Quran only those fear Allah from among his servants who have knowledge does this professor fear Allah His science is not related so he's not considered to be from the the of Shar of Dean of Islam he might be a good person but he's not praised for the knowledge he has therefore from this Ayah we understand that if you fear Allah if you practice Islam if you do your obligations and you Frain from doing Haram even if you were a Layman even if you don't know how to read or write even if you don't memorize anything of the Quran as long as you are a person who fears Allah and does not indulge in Haram and you do your prayers in the Masjid you fast Ramadan you give charity for the fear of Allah and the love of Allah you my friend are a scholar you are aim because you have the of Allah and on the other hand and if we see maana His Highness his Eminence eminent he's mallah big turban like this scholar his beard mashallah is 2 m behind him and he has PhD master degree BS BS nothing in bachelor degree not BS anyhow so he has so many degrees but he doesn't pray in the Masjid the Masid is next door why aren't you praying I was asleep you've been sleep for 6 years I haven't seen you once in the Masid um it's an issue of dispute he sits with women and premixes and listens to music and says Haram things and gives wrong fatwas does he fear Allah no is he a no even if he's highly decorated even if he has Quran in the 10 if he does not walk the talk if he doesn't fear Allah if you cannot judge him by his actions how do you judge him by his actions visit his neighbors Salam alaykum our the Beloved Sheikh how is he enough you've answered my question why yeah sh he throws garbage on our homes and every night music is so loud from his house his women folk don't wear the hijab and he is indulging in Haram activities mashallah he gives fatwas for banks to deal in riba and he stamps and takes mashallah and he if you go for him for for fatwa and it's you know it's Haram we can make it Halal it depends you know this is 2024 everything goes but if you know how to pay the right price I will I divorced my wife 10 times oh she's totally Haram for you yeah I'm willing to pay anything if I can get her back well it's an issue of dispute we have to talk we have to talk how much you're willing to pay to get her back then this is not a this is a you know what is a it's a big bag we put in it and the likes this is not someone who fears Allah and there is why we have to be selective in learning and choosing and wanting to be close to Allah subhanahu wa taal now the vast majority of Muslims today they speak without knowledge and this is a very dangerous thing if it's politics you cannot speak without know know if it's medicine you cannot speak without knowledge you will kill someone if it is economy you cannot speak without knowledge because he will be investing money and losing it because of your advice in religion it's even worse because you can give him the wrong advice and he would go to hell and take you down with him and this is why Allah says and do do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge of indeed the hearing the sight and the Heart about all those one will be questioned if you say something it will be written down and Allah will ask you why did you say I think this is halal why did you say oh I think this person is how do you take someone out of the fold of Islam without knowledge how do you label someone to be cfir we have this FNA so-called students of knowledge or Scholars who sit and label Mash label Scholars label du she do you know she so and so he's and Sh so and so he's M and so and so he's sh so and so he's Sufi from suf and she so and so he is from mallah and he starts labeling people left right and Center she who's left W he in Mombasa Nali maybe no no nobody nobody I know in Mombasa but I think I'm the only one left so yeah if you want you can take Knowledge from me everybody else is they areh Allah they have an arsenal of labelings these are not Scholars and this is FNA available of people just wanting to label people and if they don't have any people to label what do they do they stand in front of the mirror and they look at themselves I think you no you you have a problem they backfire on their own selves no no no this is not knowledge the first that Hellfire will be lit by are three as per the Hadith of Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him in s Muslim one of them is a scholar Allah will bring him and show him his favors and blessings and Allah will ask him do you acknowledge and the man says yes of course all of these favors and blessings you bestowed upon me and Allah said what did you do to show your gratitude and the man said I taught the people Quran and I taught them knowledge for your sake Allah says you are a liar you did this so that they would point at you and say a scholar and you recited the Quran so that they would say a reciter take him and throw him in hell and he will drag on be dragged on his face and thrown in hell so this the first thing it requires is what sincerity without sincerity Allah does not accept your Deeds with sincerity all of your Deeds are accepted and valid inshallah and this is why the prophet saidat whoever calls people to write guidance will have a reward like that of those who follow him without it detracting from their reward in the slightest this is from Allah you learn one Hadith and you tell it to one you will have his reward every time he says it imagine if you are blessed with some knowledge you come to this huge Gathering and you say to them the prophet of Allah said whoever prays 12 RA in the day and night Allah will build him a house in Jenna two ra before four before two after two after and two after how many 12 so imagine if 15 took this Hadith and said Ya Allah I will inshallah always do this you go home sleep and your meter is running every single day they pray because you taught it to them I remember 35 years ago almost I was a teacher in high school and you know my beard was long as long as this it's not long it's not going to get shorter but my th was short I was really extremist at the time my th was to the middle of my legs yeah it was like Chanel you see if you see me from behind she or a woman I don't know it was very short because I loved the Sunnah and I thought that this is the only way of the Sunnah and the Sunnah is to wear your th four fingers under the knee this is the prophet snah and he said if you refuse then this and he added another four eight fingers below the kneecap this this is the Sunnah who's doing this nowadays imagine me going to a meeting with the CEO and the company and the board members and wearing my three-piece suit and my trousers are to them what is this Charlie Chaplain Nobody Knows the Sunnah they'll make fun out of it so alhamdulillah our religion is tolerant and easy and simple the prophet says and if you don't want it's okay to go down to the ankles but do not not exceed the ankles so alhamdulillah we have an excuse at the time I was no I was really uh abiding by the Sunnah may Allah forgive us now we're much much lenient the older we get we get softer so I was wearing it to this extent and there was a colleague of mine he teaches Arabic I used to teach English in high school and he teaches Arabic and he is not practicing he's not you know we call the guy with the long beard he's normal person but every day at 11:30 like clockwork this is the time of his free uh uh session he goes to the toilet makes W comes puts his s prayer mat and pray two every single day and I watch him I watch him I watch him I said to myself W shame on you you're a sh you're and this guy is praying and you don't by Allah I will not stop he will not be better than me since that day I've never stopped praying D alhamdulillah if I'm traveling if I'm staying it's in my system sometimes I think of stopping why Envy Envy I'm envious because my friend is the one who's getting the reward and I am giving so okay I'm going to stop so that he will not but then I said I will be losing so Subhan Allah wherever he is may Allah Asel Grant him reward to give dawa through your actions so imagine if you teach a brother teach your father teach your mother teach your sister teach your colleague very little thing anticipating the reward you're and you'll be getting that reward on the day of judgment now they told me this Masjid is comprised and made of students of knowledge they are knowledge lovers mashall and I'm not a scholar sorry I'm just a funny man coming to crack Jo and remind you of Allah I do have more knowledge than you okay but another scholar so a lot of the Muslims and the youngsters come and say how can I be a scholar question number one you should not aim to be a scholar because your intention is either to be famous which means you don't have sincerity or you want to lead and control people and again you have lack of sincerity what should Our intention be how do I please Allah the answer is gaining knowledge okay how do I gain knowledge now lots of the people who come to gain knowledge and become students of knowledge and Scholars they come with enthusiasm they're hot blooded they want to learn and when you come Hot Blooded like this you're extinguished your fire is extinguished quickly because you have very very high expectations and all of a sudden when it does not materialize in short period of time you give up hope we see this in the gym those who get go to the gym regularly like I do yeah the people are laughing what do you what doesn't it show yeah my age it doesn't show alhamdulillah but those I've been going to the gym for the past 50 years only alhamdulillah we go to the gym and we are normal we don't want to impress people I'm pushing come on okay you're a beast go do it I don't you you you shout on your own I'm going to do do my routine and leave you shout as much as you want I'm not going to do this those those who come to the gym we see them in the first one week two weeks enthusiastic doing this and trying and and we say to them take it easy so no no Uncle I want to be strong I want to do this friend listen to me take it easy so no no okay two weeks we don't see him for another 5 years why because what goes up must come down if you are hungry and you're used to eating this much every day one day you see a lot of delicious food and you eat twice the amount you eat usually what will happen your stomach is going to be sick and you're going to be sick the whole day the following day when you want to eat your normal portion you won't be able because you're still sick and suffering the same thing goes with knowledge you have to go slow you have to have a channel where you acquire knowledge according to your own ability imagine Allah says in the Quran and those who disbelieve say why was the Quran not revealed to him all at once logical question the Quran came on Parts 23 years why not the whole thing so Allah says thus it is that we may strengthen thereby your heart and we have spaced it distinctly so Allah revealed the Quran in Parts first so that the heart of the Prophet Alat wasam can bear it and it can strengthen it rather than giving it in one go and the Shar was also given gradually it was not given all of a sudden mother AA says the Quran was revealed to remind the people of J and of Nar of hell and of the day of judgment and nothing nothing was revealed correct how many years did the prophet spend in meca huh oh he was in mecah W I thought he was in Medina you're teaching us wonderful knowledge come on guys you have to know the of the Prophet we have to know it so he spent 13 years in mecah before he he was permitted to migrate to Medina in these 13 years what was his dawa he was going okay how long will it take you to to give one day two days then what he was teaching the people and preparing their hearts and their souls to the real da so he was telling them IM he was telling them about the Quran how to rever the Quran and how to respect it he was telling them about the belief in Allah the belief in the day of judgment and what entails the belief in the day of judgment like the life before death the life after death the life on the day of Resurrection the the scale the pool the Heaven and Hell the signs of major signs minor signs he was preparing them but there was no don't drink Al intoxicant don't drink uh wine they used to drink wine 13 years they used to drink wine in Mecca it was not Haram they used to do many things there was no sh there was no fasting there was no zakat there was no uh rulings on Za and marriage and divorce and andah all of these F and rulings came in Medina why to prepare the people now many of you and I don't want to take much time many of you come and say she especially the youngsters my father I think is cfir my mother well am most likely she's a mush as for my sister she's an apostate my brother well I wish I can kill him where are you living in the jungle what are you from Safari what's happening he just accepted the Sunnah and embraced Islam but he's diving without knowledge and he's listening to The Whispers of shatan without proper guidance without proper mentoring without going to the scholars you start to develop your own ideas she I've been calling my father and mother and my sister to abide by Islam and they're fighting me they're making fun of me and they're ridiculing me my father doesn't allow me to go to the Masjid and if I'm 5 minutes late he beats me up my mother does this my sister always makes jokes she doesn't abide by the hijab and sounds familiar to you guys huh it sounds very familiar and it will continue to be like this why because you are the worst advocate of Islam you are the enemy of Islam yeah I'm following the Sunnah I'm doing everything according to the Quran and Sunnah I'm attending uh um lessons and lectures of of yes but you failed to do the most important thing in da what is that create love and respect when you come and address your father and mother with the little knowledge you have it's like the eggshell broke and the little uh chick came out and trying to teach the chicken and The Roaster how to call the aan what are you doing I'm teaching my father how to call the Adan this is not the right way they will not accept it you are still a punk in their eyes regardless of the knowledge you have what should I do 6 months to a year don't speak to them about Islam Halal Haram nothing don't speak to them about it at all yeah she what should I do act like a Muslim act like a son act like a brother show them that you love them show them that you're compassionate show them that you want to help show them that you want to do whatever you need to do just because they are your father mother brother brother and sister after one year when they feel that you're genuine they feel that you love them they will love you back and wall when they love you back they will be like a ring in your finger whatever you say they said yes sir they will obey you because you they know you're genuine but when you're from your Ivory Tower you say Simon says where the hijab you're not wearing hij what it doesn't work this way you have to lead by example they have to see that you're generous you're brave you're courageous you're kind you're truthful you never lie you never curse you never do anything Haram you walk the talk now after one year they will believe what you are telling them this is not our topic I don't know why I wrote this but I told you I'm not a scholar and you guys come here to listen to me it's your fault not mine so to acquire knowledge you have to take it easy like the prophet Alam for 13 years cemented the ground when he went to Medina the ground is solid now I can build High risers and even those who know construction when you start to construct a house you see that they build a wall or put the bricks water it leave it for 2 three days why are you wasting time keep the work and and he said no no no it has to mature it has to you know be take its time to strengthen after 3 4 days they put another layer and Foundation no I'm not talking about the foundation I'm talking about even the walls itself sometimes we can put six seven stories at once but it will collapse we need 3 4 days for each level to take its time and likewise with so you have to take it easy on yourself so that it is solid and strong and this is why in the beginning when you want to seek knowledge what is the knowledge you must seek H knowing Allah asael h y I'm giving you a chance to be a scholar and to speak without knowledge and to go to hell yah you'll all go to heaven inshallah inshallah none of us will go to hell why because Allah is most merciful and because Allah knows that we're sitting here wanting his forgiveness so he will not turn us down we have our shortcomings we have our sins but we think and believe that he is merciful most forgiving he's the one who guides to repentance all of these names will never ever over let anything else overwhelm them thinking that Allah just wants to throw us in hell no we have our shortcomings we will pay for it but we know that his forgiveness is far greater than his wrath so what is the first thing that we should learn a number of things that is called this is a mandatory obligation upon each and every one of us so if I tell you is it for you to know when to perform in the brother says yes the brother says no the brothers is from the subcontinent he I don't know what this is yes or no so what's the answer the answer is no if you're not going to Hajj you don't have to someone who doesn't have money is it mandatory upon him to know that the nisab the threshold of camel zakat is five camels you have to pay one sheep no he doesn't have camels why would I have to know this so this is not an obligation to know the obligation upon you to know is what Allah will hold you accountable for such as the Oneness of Allah to acknowledge that no one in this universe isik the facilitator The Giver of life and death the one who lets the rain come down this is all part of of Allah this is something you have to know you have to know that Allah is the only one worthy of being worshiped so no prayers no fasting no charity no no no no nothing can be diverted other than to Allah and we cannot associate others with Allah his beautiful names and attributes it's a must that you learn and know it's not something that oh okay I just know Allah what's the meaning of M M he say one of Allah's names I never know this well you you never don't know a lot 99 names and you don't know the names of Allah the meaning subhah waala what does it mean if it's yes or not if one of Allah's beautiful names and so forth Al what does Altin one of Allah's name okay so this is mandatory for you to know it's mandatory to know the rulings of Salat because you pray how many times a day huh the brothers are saying how did the Sheikh know yeah we skip fer every day no it's five there's no 20% discount Subhan Allah Salah is strange and Allah is most merciful subhanahu wa ta'ala it was mandated in the beginning how many 50 yeah every for every 28 minutes we have to pray imagine we just say how are you we come back from the Salah okay let's drink CFE Salah every 28 minutes you have to pray Salah Allah made it how many five and even the five one says she can we get 40% discount and too difficult if you can find us a way we can everything has a price Subhan Allah so this Salah you have to know everything about it such as how many oh this is easy she but what is not easy what is a pillar what is mandatory and what is Sunnah why would I know this because if you make a mistake can it be compensated by or is my prayer invalid oh what to do well she ibraim will conduct inshallah a seminar and a workshop for how to teach you how to pray and he will explain all of this for you inshallah free of charge true inshallah so this is something you have to learn Ramadan comes now you have to understand and believe and know the rulings of Ramadan sheh I was carrying a packet of cigarette in my uh uh pocket is My fasting valid or not what do I say to him what kind of cigarettes light or [Applause] regular so many people don't know what breaks your fasting and a lot of them don't know what breaks your wood so even the woodo what breaks your woodo how many things break your woodoo now if we make a yeah a small questionnaire you will see Miracles people would come and say um picking my nose um break my woodoo I think well yeah maybe if I do this it breaks my woodoo if I do that breaks no the things that break your woodo are five the things that break your fasting are seven limited if you know them anything that comes from out it doesn't impact your woodo it doesn't impact your fasting these are Mand upon you to learn if you want to go to business oh yes I am a businessman I have a shop I have a restaurant I have uh dealings with other companies then you have to it's a must that you learn the rulings of trade what is halal what is Haram what is ambiguous what is riba what is this what is that so that you don't deal with Haram other than that is not the things that are not related to now and today in your daily life is communial obligation this we can learn on our own paste and you also have to understand that the more you learn the stronger you get and the wiser you get and the more humble you get look at the people who learn martial arts karate kung fu uh MMA in the beginning in their first year they're troublemakers they just go out of the dojo and just want to fight find anyone to fight with what I'm not looking at you no but when they become professionals when they become really really good at what they do even if someone wants to fight with them said because they become wiser they become stronger and this is why we have to learn this knowledge only to please Allah so now we want to start to become students of knowledge what knowledge should we start seeking the most most important science in my opinion for a student of knowledge who wants to become a scholar is Quran yes before the Quran this is obligatory Arabic you need to learn Arabic you cannot Master the Quran with without Arabic you cannot understand the Quran without Arabic so if you master Arabic and you're fluent in it you can find the sweetness of the Quran I've been to Indonesia W You Hear the People reciting the Quran there I feel a little bit small I'm Arab and the way they're reciting the Quran is so perfect and they Mah excellent they don't so a lot of people say a lot of people don't pay attention to that and they're excellent recit reciters uh not a single Arabic word they know okay the Quran you've read what is the meaning of this I don't know are they rewarded 100% but you need Arabic because you have a long way ahead of you so the more you master the Arabic The more your level is higher in in knowledge and this is why you cannot do it all at once so one spreads his himself too thin I'm learning Arabic in the morning and I'm learning in the evening and and the and and he will come after one week where are you going I'm going to the beach why mbasa has one of the best beaches she yes but bad don't go there I need to refresh you have a problem take it easy little by little learn a little bit Arabic learn the essentials of of IM muhammadd and if you feel feel that okay I'm established I will go to it takes time and you need a mentor you need a sheh you need a group of students of knowledge to give you strength and you feel that there is competition and motivation if you do it on your own Shan will come yes I'm listening to whoever XY Z on YouTube and I'm learning and I'm after 10 minutes something pops in YouTube oh she aam please sit down and you spend 2 hours the first time I downloaded Tik Tok I think was 2 3 years ago I just downloaded it for the fun it was like maybe 7:00 p.m. and I woke up at 12:00 because I kept on doing until 12: p.m. 5 hours said this isan I deleted it until date it's deleted people send me Tik Tok uh Clips I open it it says download again no yeah not interested this is Shan is coming to destroy you so you have to channel your work alone shatan will always be with you but when you are with Brothers each one of them is giving you incentive encouraging you asking you questions calling you about this masah we discussed with the sheh about you start you will find life beautiful and easy and you can go in with this you can go in Arabic with has a very beautiful explanation of you can listen to it and and and learn from it you can study in and the likes you can study uh from a very short concise books regardless of the school of thought you can start with small things but at least it gives you a holistic preview from beginning to end of this particular maab so now you can say I finished the F according to theab of IM Malik good for you m IM shaf good for you now you have acquired 85% of now we can go and to level two where we can compare what I've studied with the Quran and Sunnah and so on and you have to acknowledge that you cannot be a lone wolf you cannot depend on your understanding by reading a book I become a scholar no you have to have the affiliation with a sheh with a that would guide you and correct you because he had been in the same place you are now so he knows the flaws and the shortcomings and the loopholes that you may fall in so he would correct you and you will learn and you will be able to teach others and yeah I think this is more than enough and I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who continue to learn until the day they die learning never sees learning never stops and if you have two things you will not learn what are they someone who's shy and someone who's arrogant will never ever uh learn knowledge why the shy one has questions but every time he say what will they say they will laugh at me no I will not so he will stay ignorant the ignorant one or the Arrogant one says I have a question I say okay what does he know and he I I was I went to school with him he doesn't know anything so he keeps on discrediting people and he will never learn anything but those who have the sincerity and would like to learn to please Allah they will learn quickly and Allah Knows Best"
