  "transcript": "Yunus from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I hope you are good Sheikh I am doing well Alhamdulillah Sheikh, first of all, I am not trying to be a religious police Sheikh Some people say and believe that the Muslim society and Islamic scholars must have an opinion to give time to revert women to adopt hijab in their lives like they will start it by putting scarf over the head while wearing tight jeans and t-shirts including in the matters of taking Mehram while travelling and in other matters too So do we find this kind of belief and excuse from our Salaf? Jazak Allah Khair Sheikh Wa Jazak First of all, Allah Azawajal stated in the Quran in Chapter 5, in the beginning of Chapter 5 اليوم أكملت لكم دينكم وأتممت عليكم نعمتي ورضيت لكم الإسلام دينا Today I have completed your religion and perfected my blessing upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion When was that? That was on the 10th year of Hijrah So one of the last ayahs to, not the last, but one of the last ayahs to be revealed The deen is complete, agree? Everyone in this world will say, yep, agree, the deen is definitely complete Number two, if someone says, okay, we want to take things gradually So today, for a month, we only pray Dhuhr, no other four prayers And following month, we will pray Dhuhr and Asr, little by little Another one says, for women, yeah, they can't go to the beach with a bikini So they will only go to the beach with a one-piece suit Just for a month, and then we will try to improve their hijab Is this acceptable? The answer is, of course not You have to totally eliminate all of the haram and wrong practices and abide by Islam So anyone who says that we have to gradually take such things We would say, no, you misunderstood what Islam is all about Islam is about submitting your will to Allah So mandatory things must be implemented on the spot Haram things must be left on the spot Recommended things, okay, you can take your time Not recommended things, makrooh, that are not haram, you may take your time I hope this answers your question"
