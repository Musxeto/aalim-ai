  "title": "Can a woman touch or recite Quran while on Menses (Period) tafseer book, mobile, etc?",
  "transcript": "um actually i just wanted to know the ruling of touching and reciting the quran uh during impurity or during memphis or like that okay actually some certain school of thought they say that yes it is allowed certain things that it is not allowed to i just want that okay the most authentic opinion is that a person who is not in the state of purity should not touch the quran directly and if a woman is in her state of impurity due to her menses she is also not allowed to touch the quran directly with her bare hands but if she were to wear gloves there's no problem if she were to recite the quran from memory there's no problem if she were to read the quran from a pda or from her mobile or from a book of tafsir because the book of tafseer is not a quran it's a mixture between the quran and the tafsir and the words of human beings this this is why there is no problem in that none whatsoever as for the opinion of some scholars who say that a woman in her monthly period must not recite the quran this is not authentic nor true and allah azzawajal would not prevent a woman from staying away from reciting the quran for a week or more and allah knows best you"
