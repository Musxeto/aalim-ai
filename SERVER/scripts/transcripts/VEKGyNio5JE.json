  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the US. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam. If someone pays the cot and later that same day they find out that they're going to be receiving more money in a couple of weeks, does that person have to go back and add more money to what they gave? I do not understand your question. Like if someone pays the cot because this is like the lunar day that they have to pay it, and they have like the money, like they paid that money, and then they find out that they're going to be receiving money late, like in a couple weeks, that same day, so do they have to go back and add to that money since they found out on the day that they're supposed to pay? The answer is no. The second condition of zakat is that a full lunar year passes while it is in your possession. So if you give your zakat date on the first of Muharram, for example, this lunar year, so you've done your due diligence. If you receive any money even on the same day, or a day earlier, this had not completed a whole lunar year in your possession, so there is no zakat on that particular amount of money, and Allah knows best."
