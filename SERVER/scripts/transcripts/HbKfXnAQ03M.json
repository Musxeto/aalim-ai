  "title": "Can I have intimacy or intercourse with my wife before she moves in with me (Ruksathi)?",
  "transcript": "An anonymous person says, I'm married, \nbut have not done Rukhsati yet. Rukhsati   in Urdu means consummating the marriage. \nSo the contract is done. She's his wife,   but they have not consummated the marriage. \nShe has not moved into his house permanently.   He says they are saying his in-laws. After \none year you can take your bride home. Due   to their personal family issues. My question \nis, till that time, can I have intimacy with   my wife using contraceptives, using condoms? \nFirst of all, as long as this is the agreement   between the two families and you agree \nto that you have to honor and respect it.   She is your wife, the moment the contract \nhas been signed. You had the right to say no,   I demand to take my wife tonight or next week \nor next month. Or next year, this is up to you.   Because you agreed to postpone the consummation of \nmarriage for a full year, you have to honor that.   As long as she is with her father's responsibility \nand in his house, he provides for her financially,   you're not obliged to do anything or give her \nanything. However, for you to consummate the   marriage not publicly, but between you and \nyour wife, totally legit, totally Halal,   you're not sinning, you're not fornicating, \nyou're not doing anything wrong. She's your wife,   you can talk to her, you can touch her, you can \nlook at her, no problem, however, we have customs   to respect. So people know that she has not \nconsummated marriage. And after three months,   she's got a baby. What is this? People would \naccuse her of something that is not honorable.   Her father would be feeling like he was stabbed \nin the back. So generally speaking, you should not   have any intimacy with your wife until you get the \ngreen light from the father. How is that possible?   I'm too shy to ask. Well, if her father says \nto you, come and spend the weekend in our home   and they allocate a room for you \nand for your wife to sleep in.   What greener light are you looking for? You must \nbe colorblind if you don't see this. But if they   are careful not to leave you guys for too long \nalone and every five to a minute someone knocks   on the door, you would like some drinks, \nyou would like some food, you would like,   what is this? It's an open buffet, khalas \nI don't wan't anything. You get the feeling   that they don't want anything to happen so that \nit would not tarnish their reputation and the   reputation of your wife. Therefore you have to \nplay its safe. You can always demand that listen,   I'm not going to wait for a year. I want my \nwife and I want it ASAP. My house is ready,   it's furnished, I'm financially capable. \nThen In Sha Allah things would progress. [ ]"
