  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] last time we met we talked about the things he loved and today we'll talk about the things he hated and this is not strange because as human beings we tend to love and hate we tend to be pleased and angry and the prophet Allah is indeed a perfect human being but when we look at the things he hated it was not for personal reasons it was not for his own ego sallallahu as we know that he was the most humble person on Earth rather the things he hated were attributed to being sins and things that offended Allah azzawajal and that is why he had this hate to them so let us look through some of the things that the prophet salallahu hated and learned from these things for example the prophet Allah hated a segment of people what are their characteristics he said among the dearest of you to me and those who will be seated closest to me on the day of Resurrection are the best of you in attitude and the most hateful of you to me and those who will be seated furthest away from me on the day of Resurrection are those who number one talk too much number two those who talk down to people in an affected Manner and number three those who are long-winded and pompous so those who talk a lot the prophet is hated them why he himself people could count the words that come out of his mouth but they were filled with wisdom and Iman and would only get you closer to Allah azzawajal and hence he did not like those who talked a lot because those who talk a lot usually talk in vain and there is nothing beneficial from what they say Allah says in the Quran no good is there in much of their private conversation except for those who enjoy in charity or that which is right or conciliation between the people most of our conversations are based on what unworthy matters on things that have no benefit and every time you ask people what are you doing they're saying to you we're killing time a crime that time did not commit yet it's being punished for why do you kill time they just waste their times in idle talk did not like wasting time in speaking like this without any benefit and Allah stated in this Ayah that if you enjoy in charity this is something Allah loves if you speak about that things that are right so anything that is beneficial whether in this life or in the Hereafter or that can get you closer to Allah this is something that Allah loves and thirdly when you reconcile between fighting factions between two who have Feud among themselves then this is something that Allah loves also the prophet said that he does not like those who talk down to people in an affected manner who despise people who make fun of people and thirdly and those are a segment that usually when they speak they fill up their mouths with big words and expressions and even the way they talk they don't talk normally rather they speak in an exaggerated way in a way that you would abhor you don't think that this is natural it's all made up and such people usually do this to attention that we have knowledge that we speak especially when people speak in Arabic language and they speak in a certain fashion that is not natural this is not how they usually speak to one another but because they're giving a speech they tend to inflate themselves and this is different from perfecting your words and what you say in order to have a good impact on the listener that is totally different there's nothing wrong in that what's wrong is to show off and to try to flex your muscles through your oration and your speech where people would not feel comfortable when you do that among the people whom the prophet Islam hated most are liars and we know that lying is a major sin said no characteristics was more abhorred to the prophet Allah than lying and if they Prophet Islam detected that a person is lying he would still have something in him against that person until he figures out that he had repented to Allah and felt remorse over the sin that he had committed lying is a major sin and unfortunately most people lie nowadays as a daily routine to make their business successful so they think to evade a problem and run away from trouble and to apologize or to avoid apologizing to people so they lie and lie and lie and this is totally prohibited and the prophet Allah used to hate this among the things that a liar usually is bad character bad attitude and this is something that the prophet sallallahu told us that he abhors and those who are furthest from him on the day of judgment are those with the bad attitude what is meant by bad attitude bad moral conduct bad ethics someone who cheats lies betrays someone who's stingy a coward someone who does not enjoin virtue and righteousness and rather is afraid of speaking out someone who's a not helping others all of these are bad characteristics in a person arrogance Pride thinking that you're better than others this is what the propheted wasallam among the things that the prophet hated is argument and it was reported in a number of hadiths when people talked back to him in an argumentative way he would be upset and that would be seen on his face as in the case when he visited his daughter and his son-in-law and recommended them to pray night prayer instead of sleeping and Ali may Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet is said well our souls are in the hands of Allah whenever Allah sets us to wake up we will pray and this is not an appropriate answer one should have said inshallah we will do that and the prophet left and said that man was mostly argumentative that's amazing instead of being a cooperative and saying we will do that likewise the prophet's face would change when he sees sinful things when a sin is committed as in the case when he saw one of his friends wearing a ring made of gold you can see that he hated this on his face he went there and took it off and said why would anyone put a stone of fire in his hand and tossed it away this is something that we also have to have in US nowadays we see Vice and evil things happening all around us in our own homes in the streets in the malls we see Haram being committed the mixing of men and women the music the entertainment all of this is something that Allah hates and the prophet saws hates and it's a sign of hypocrisy not to hate it when you feel that whoa this is cool this is fun I am I'm enjoying myself and you don't see any signs of hatred on your face to such sinful Acts in this case this is a huge sign of hypocrisy may Allah azzawajal make us among those who enforce and enjoin virtue and righteousness among the Muslims the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam as we mentioned yesterday used to love perfumes and he used to hate anything that had a bad smell so the prophet salallahu would not consume anything that had onions raw onions or garlic and he would say that I do not like the odor in another narration he said because I speak with the Archangel jibril peace be upon him so I don't want anything offensive coming out from me but this does not mean it's Haram for us we eat it and enjoy it however we know that we should not approach the Masjid when we have consumed it because then the angels in the Masjid would be offended as well as the worshipers from such an odor the prophet saws used to hate drinking hot boiling liquids soups or any other type of drinks and he is according to Allah be pleased with them he used to hate drinking such hot fluids nowadays people enjoy drinking hot fluids I'm not talking about warm fluids no I'm meaning hot fluids and this could burn you this could hurt you this could be very bad for you the Sunnah is to keep it until it is drinkable and not uh uh hurtful or harmful also used to hate things that harm people such as reptiles specifically the Scorpions so the prophet salallahu cursed cursed the Scorpion and this is an A A an insect Maybe that cannot be tamed and the prophet said Allah may Allah curse the Scorpion it doesn't leave anyone whether he's praying for Allah or not praying you must kill it wherever you find it whether in normal areas or in sanctuaries in the Haram areas you have to kill it so this is one of the living creatures that were ordered to kill whether in Hell or Haram either in an open area Halal area or in the sanctuaries around the Haram area among the things that the prophet sallallahu hated was for people to stand up to him and this might sound a bit weird for us because in many cultures if you enter a room and no one's and everybody stands except one or two you would feel bad feelings and negative feelings towards them thinking that they're disrespecting you on the contrary the Sunnah is that you do not stand up except in certain times the prophet Allah as anas says was the most beloved person to the whole of the companions may Allah please with them however whenever they see the prophet Allah they would not stand up because they know that he hated this he does not endorse or like people to stand up for him imagine if a Sheikh comes into a room and everybody else is sitting and nobody stands up how would the Sheikh feel who cares the sun is that you don't stand up so what's the ruling on standing up to people Scholars say that standing up all the time behind a tyrant or an official is prohibited and this is how tyrants live and exist they want people to stand behind them and never sit never feel comfortable and if anyone is not standing behind them they feel humiliated and agitated and disrespected and this is not true this is a sign of arrogance and hypocrisy again you should allow in order of people to sit down and not to stand like this secondly when people come from a journey this is permissible for you all to stand to greet and this there's nothing wrong in that or to help someone if he's in need of help like when he came to the prophet he was injured the prophet said go and stand up and assist your master thirdly is when you stand up whenever you see someone coming in and this is a an issue of dispute it seems that it is totally prohibited when the person coming in wants people to stand up for him because this is a sign of arrogance and the prophet saws never allowed people to do this so you're not better than the prophet sallam so why should we stand to you unfortunately in some countries in Africa not only they want people to stand to them even the elders want people to bow to them or squat to them and if you don't do this they consider this a sign of disrespect subhanallah what religion do these people follow they said no no this is cultural you have to bow you have to squat no this is not part of Islam even if it's your culture Islam comes first if you're a true Muslim if you're not and you prefer your culture over Islam then on the day of judgment you know will where you will be insha Allah as a Muslim I have to tailor make my life according to Islam not the other way around Islam is to be followed and not to follow so we follow what Islam says squatting and bowing down to the elders if it's a cultural thing keep it in your culture but don't do it it's unislamic it's not permissible this is a form of glorification for other than Allah also the prophet Allah did not like people walking behind him as a form of respect or as a form of protection this is something that he would not endorse rather he would order his companions to be to his right and to his left walking side by side among the beautiful etiquettes in Islam is that when a person is traveling out of the out of town and he's coming back to his wife if he's coming back at night time he must not come unannounced so lots of Us come and say okay I'm gonna make it a surprise my wife is expecting me next week I'm gonna come tonight and surprise her there's a Prohibition the prophet said I said do not do this if you come at night time don't surprise your wife why because she was not expecting you and the norm is that if she were to know she would have taken care of herself she would have removed unwanted hair from her body she would have calmed her hair wore her best attire put her uh moisturizers Etc or body lotions so that she would be in a presentable way for you but when you come as a surprise and which she's not ready you may see something or smell something or touch something that would make you hate her so this beautiful etiquette shows that such surprises are nightmares and not a surprise you have to announce that I'm coming at this time at night so that she can prepare herself you also prepare yourself by having a shower and taking care of your hygiene Etc among the things that the prophet Islam disliked where to sleep between Asia and to speak after Asia so sleeping before Isha means that you may miss Asia prayer your sleep may be prolonged so that you Miss Aisha prayer and you wake up midnight and then fail to sleep the rest of the night this is not normal and speaking after Aisha after we've prayed Russia to just sit and engage in idle talk again this is a waste of time which is to be utilized because night prayer is to rest and to spend in praying and worshiping Allah and seeking his forgiveness if there is a legitimate reason such as studying researching something for Islam or hosting a guest who came to visit this is permissible insha Allah things that the prophet hated Allah are things that most of us enjoy and that is stand-up comedy imitating people impersonating people the prophet said mimicked someone impersonated someone he said I don't like that I have so and so of worldly wealth and I would impersonate a person no I would never do this and he also commented on a word said about mother Sophia that she's short she's this so the prophet said Allah uttered a word so bad that if it were to be mixed with the water of the oceans it would have mixed it this is a sinful act that you had done because this is backbiting and it was only said so that it would reduce the status of that person in my heart that's why you're impersonating him or making fun of him or backbiting him also the prophet Allah while sitting with the others and eating would hate it when people take the food from the middle of the plate and he would say the Baraka the blessing of Allah descends on the middle of the food so when you eat do not eat from the middle of the pile rather eat from the edges so that everyone would attain this Baraka among the things that the prophet also hated cauterization which is getting a piece of iron and heating it up until it's red and then go to specific areas of the body and cauterize it this is not recommended though it is one of the means of healing the prophet said Allah healing or cure of illnesses is in three one a drink of honey to a slash of a copper the man the man who does cupping to extract the rotten and and spoiled or bad blood from the back of the neck or the shoulders thirdly cauterization so this is not to limit means of healing rather to state the foundations of healing the principles of healing in these things and the prophet Allah did cauterize himself some of his companions when it's needed so what's not liked is when people do it without any need the Arabs used to do this as a precaution though they're not sick but they used to do this so that they would prevent any illness from coming in and this is not recommended and this is what was hated by the prophet was and finally the prophet salallahu hated to delay and postpone Good Deeds one day he was praying leading the prayer in In Asar prayer and all of a sudden after he finished the prayer he immediately stood up and went to one of his homes and the companions were frightened by the speed of the Prophet salaam after concluding the prayer not saying that car immediately standing up there must have been something wrong so when he came back they told him well prophet of Allah we were frightened by the speed that you stood up we thought that there's something wrong happening what was it the prophet said I remembered some raw gold that was given to me before Salat for sadakha for charity and I did not like the idea the notion that it was in my possession this long so immediately after I just went and ordered it to be given in means of Charity and this shows you that one must not delay Good Deeds when are you going to take next month maybe the month before why not now when are you going to memorize the Quran maybe after Hajj when are you going to wear the hijab or sister she said inshallah when I reached 40 this is not what the prophet Islam used to do he used to hasten to doing good things and never delay or postpone them we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
