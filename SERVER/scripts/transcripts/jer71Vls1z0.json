  "title": "The Prophet ‎ﷺ would joke with his wives assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "A lot because a lot of laughter kills the heart. And the Prophet ﷺ as I said used to joke with his wives. Once he met Mother Aisha and when she saw him she complained of a severe migraine or a headache. So the Prophet ﷺ was joking with her and said to her, Oh Aisha, what would it be if you were to die before me and I would wash you and shroud you and offer prayer of funeral upon you and then bury you? What would be? So Mother Aisha immediately her jealousy meter went to the roof and said, Oh yeah of course if this happens and I die before you, immediately the following moment after burying me I think you're going to get married to another woman and bring her to my house. So she didn't think about dying. She didn't think about being buried. Rather she thought of who the Prophet ﷺ was going to get married to and bring in her house and the Prophet ﷺ smiled in her face."
