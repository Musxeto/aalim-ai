  "transcript": "so Fahim says is it permissible to close our eyes during prayer the vast majority of Scholars say that closing the eyes during prayer is not recommended it is not something that is must it is Mak it is not from theah yes a lot of the people Satan May mess up with their heads and say to them when you close your eyes you're more you're closer to Allah and you're less distracted by what's happening in front of you but this is stage one this is the first step of Satan and after a while he will say well maybe putting something like ear muffs or something in in your uh ears so that you don't listen to something maybe if it's dark it's best for you maybe if you pray in an isolated room not in the Masjid little by little this is how shatan creeps into our heads and isolates us from the Sunnah and isolates us from other Muslims this is not right the vast majority of Muslims say that this is not part of the Sunnah otherwise the prophet would have done itat so this is not part of Islam yes maybe some sects and cults may do it and um encourage people to do it like the sufis but it's not from Islam however if there is something that is abnormal something that's not usual that so happened in that particular prayer once in a blue moon then this is permissible for you to close your eyes in Salat for example while you're praying you get a three-year-old old child standing just right in front of you and I've seen this in congregation I was in once and next to me were two men in their mid-50s they're grown-up men and the Imam we were behind the Imam and the imam's son was like in six seven years of age he wasn't praying he was sitting next to his father looking at us and all of a sudden these two men started giggling in the middle of the prayer and it was obvious that the child was doing faces and they were looking at him and they could not hold back laughing so in such simil similar cases you may close your eyes just to be able to concentrate and not to be distracted but this happens once every blue moon so um generally speaking that's answer is no it's not permissible for you to close your eyes during prayer"
