  "transcript": "[Music] zed zubair says how did the prophet salaam fought hypocrites well we know that the prophet allah did not fight the hypocrites with the sword like disbelievers because the hypocrites pretend to be muslims while inside they're none muslims however as muslims the prophet is our role model he gave us the way not to treat the hypocrites so if it were to him he would have killed them all because they are disbelievers but he didn't because he's giving us a lesson such hypocrites who pretend to be muslims we can only deal with them with what shows to us so they pretend to be muslims we take that as it is as face value what is in their heart is up to their lord as they to hold them to account nevertheless the prophet salam fought the hypocrites by showing us their characteristics their signs what they're well known of how they behave and he told us to be aware of how they act so that we don't fall in the same category allah described them to us in the quran clearly lazy when they pray they never remember allah except seldomly they are neither to the believers nor to the disbelievers and they're in between they plot they betray they break promises they do a lot of things so these were all ways of fighting them once you know them you can be aware from them and you can protect yourself and iman from falling into their category so scholars say that we can only fight the hypocrites by rhetoric by exposing them by showing the whole world and this is nowadays extremely needed because the hypocrites now are not individuals they are countries they are institutions they are people that are backed by the media and they have influence everywhere and you can see when someone does a sin then we are all sinful but you can see when someone is a hypocrite in trying to undermine islam sides with the jews and the christians against the muslims prefers their festivals takes part in their religious rituals whether they're hindus or christians or jews and they participate with them if this is not hypocrisy what is so you have to expose such people and this is how we fight the hypocrite you"
