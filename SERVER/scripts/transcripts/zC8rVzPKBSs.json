  "transcript": "Sad man from Bangladesh Sad man Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh my question was that is it mandatory to pray in the masjid or is it mandatory to pray in the with the congregation for men the answer is it is mandatory to pray in the masjid unless there is a legitimate reason that would make you pray elsewhere but with the congregation so the default is that whenever the adhan is called all muslims should pray in the masjid if clusters of muslims prayed in their homes four or five of them in congregation then that would make the masjid the masajid vacant and that would dismantle the purpose and the role of the masjid and this is not part of our religion and allah knows best"
