  "transcript": "Hameed from Nigeria. Hameed. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Jazakum. There isn't any prescribed du'a that we know of to go into a nap during the day time. So if someone says, Bismika Allahumma Adha'u Janbi Wa Bismika Arfa'u, the rest, that would be sufficient. In your name I put my, I lie down and in your name I rise up to the end. That's sufficient insha'Allah. Though it's not prescribed for day time. It's prescribed for night time. And if one says, Alhamdulillah Alladhi Ahyanan Ba'di Ma Amatana. Praise be to Allah who gave us life after this minor death. And to him is the resurrection to return. Also this is fine but again there is nothing prescribed for the day time sleeping."
