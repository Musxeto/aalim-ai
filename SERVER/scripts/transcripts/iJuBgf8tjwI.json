  "transcript": "from india actually my question is like uh i live with my rent so they also earn and i also want and i contribute some amount as a monthly basis from my salary to them for the monthly household basis so and for my tax purposes uh there is a clause in the rule that if you are giving rent to someone if you are living on rent the rent amount can be deducted from the uh your salary so that you can pay tax on the lower amount so my question is can i go into an agreement with my parents that this this amount is as a rent to you so that i can show it to the government that i am giving this amount as rent and i can pay tax on the lower amount if you have an agreement with them there is no problem in that because this is not lying you're giving and contributing for example uh 10 000 rupees a month to the household whether they buy food whether they uh pay electricity bills or whatever it's up to them because you're living with them so if they agree to allocate this amount to rent for you staying with them there is no problem however i would suspect that the authorities would require a lease they would try uh require a contract between you and the landlord which is not uh feasible and you would have to lie you're living in one of the rooms so they're not releasing you that room per se and there is no unofficial contract that you are allocated a portion of the house if there is and you can do it legally there is no problem insha'allah in that you"
