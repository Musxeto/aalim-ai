  "title": "You said photography is halal so can I take & keep photos as my parents ask",
  "transcript": "Ibrahim from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. You have clarified before that photography is permissible. So you have said that so I don't really care about pictures but my parents do and they ask me to take pictures everywhere. So I would like to know if it's permissible to keep them for memory for my parents. JazakAllah Khair. Wa Jazakum. I did not say that photographs are halal. You have to be really careful when you quote something as such. Photography of landscape, of objects that have no life, there is no difference of opinion among any scholar that it is halal to take photographs of mountains, oceans, gardens, jungles. There's no problem there at all. Nobody disputes in that. The problem is in taking photographs of living creatures, humans, animals and the likes. And a lot of the scholars say that this is not permissible because this is mimicking and imitating the creation of Allah and it falls under the warning of not taking such drawings and pictures. Some scholars say that this is permissible because it is not actually mimicking the creation of Allah, it is the creation of Allah. So it's like a reflection of yourself in a mirror or on a pond of water. It's like when you sign a check and you xerox it, when you see the xerox copy, you wouldn't say that this is not mine, you said this is my signature, because it is your signature. However, those who permitted taking such photographs, they said it has to be halal photographs. So you can't take photos of a man who's not covering his awrah or to be used in an indecent thing. You can take photographs of normal men in normal poses without any problem. You can take pictures of children without any problem. You cannot take pictures of women because this defies the purpose of hijab, even if these women are your mahram, even if she's your wife or your daughter or your sister, you can't take her photograph. And some argue, they say that, oh the phone is secured, the camera is secured, the laptop is secured, it's mine, I'm not going to sell it, I'm not going to do anything. Akhi, it still can be hacked, it still can be retrieved, even after formatting the hard disk, it can be retrieved. So it's always best to be safe rather than sorry, and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
