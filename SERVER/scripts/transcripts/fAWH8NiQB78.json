  "title": "Loudly Saying Takbeer !!!AllahuAkbar - in masjid permissible? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "What is this place? This is a masjid and the masjid is the house of Allah Azza Wa Jal. And I have noticed in Indonesia that whenever I come they say Takbir and everybody shouts Allahu Akbar. And this is not from the sunnah and this is not permissible and this is disrespecting the masjid. The Prophet ﷺ said do not raise your voices in the masjid. This is the house of Allah Azza Wa Jal. If you come to my house and you say Allahu Akbar, I'll kick you out. Therefore there are etiquettes we have to observe. I know this is your culture but what would you like to have or follow? The culture or the sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ? This is what I will talk about today. How much time do I have? As long as I want. Okay. I hope you brought your pillows with you because it's going to take a long time."
