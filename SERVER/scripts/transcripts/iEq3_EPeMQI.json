  "transcript": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My name is Muhammad Khairul Fahmi, Sheikh. I'm a college in One University in Maiden City. I have a question. Maybe this is the question another way with our lesson today. So actually I have some problem and sometimes feel hopeless some week later and I feel like a useless people in this world and I feel that this is the problem in our millennial generation today. So I have the question, what's your opinion and what's your suggestion, Sir, Sheikh, to prevent and solve this problem as we are a millennial generation today in Islam? Thank you, Sheikh. What problem? I have some dreams and the dreams is fail and fall and I never get it, Sir, Sheikh. So you mean that you have aspirations to do things but you never succeed in it? I do hard to get it but in the end I fall, Sheikh. Okay. Thank you. This is not the problem of the Millennials. Even the old people have this problem. If you go to someone who's 60 or 70, you said, I have the same dreams, my friend. This is life. Everyone on earth is being tested. Everyone. See, I myself, I'm being tested like a roller coaster. In my life, I had a time where I was very, very rich. Alhamdulillah. And I had times when I could not pay the rent. And I was looking for work outside of Saudi Arabia. Nobody knew about this. But this is life. Sometimes in my life, I was very healthy, very strong. And then all of a sudden, I was very sick, very weak, very tired, problems health-wise. And you go up and down. So, a Muslim takes this with content and happiness. Number one. Have I done anything wrong? What do you mean? Why are you poor? Are you trying hard? Yes, I'm looking for a job. I'm doing business. I'm losing. I'm trying to knock all doors. I'm doing everything halal. So, you're doing your best. Yes. How do you feel? Content. Although I am poor, I'm content. Because this is what Allah decreed. How about your health? I couldn't do anything. Do you smoke? No. Do you drink? Of course not. No, I don't drink anything haram. So, why is your health bad? I don't know. Then, how do you feel? Content. So, this is from Allah. Everyone is being tested. But be fair. Has Allah Azza wa Jal always been testing you and you're going down, down, down until you're dead? No. There's always some way up. But we only see the downs. We don't see how many good things we have. I get counseling sessions. People speak to me. Shaykh, I'm suffering from this. I'm suffering from that. And I say, do you have a roof on your head? He said, yes. Do you have food on the table? He said, yes. Do you have feet to walk on? Can you see? Everything is fine, mashallah. But one issue. Oh, I lost my job. Tomorrow, you will get five jobs. Wait. Oh, Shaykh, I got sick. I got corona. Ask those who got corona among you. Raise your hands. Oh, give me my mask. Okay. Have you died? No. Of course not. Look at them, mashallah. They're healthy. They're walking. They're talking. They play sports. So Allah has given you so much, but you don't see it. You only see what you... And this is why He is Allah and you are His servant. You ask Allah, give me this, give me this, give me this. Allah doesn't give you. Why? Allah does not give you what you want. Allah gives you what you need. So always be thankful and grateful. So many times, I say to myself, Allah has not done this for me. Allah has not done that for me. No. Allah has done everything for me right on time. So alhamdulillah, I got to come to Indonesia when I'm 63 years of age. If I came 30 years ago, not good. I may not have left. I may not have stayed. So everything has a particular time. All what you need to do, number one, make a lot of dua. Dua. Dua. Every day. Not once a day. How many times do you make dua a day? After salah, that's it? No. You make dua every sujud. You make dua between adhan and iqamah. You make dua half an hour before fajr, after tahajjud. Oh sheikh, I don't pray tahajjud. How do you want Allah to answer you? So you make dua when it rains. You make dua when you hear the roaster making his sound before fajr. All of these are times of istijabah. Number two, think positive of Allah. What does it mean? Now, Allah azza wa jal has 7 billion humans living on earth. Who's giving them food? Allah. Who's giving them water? Allah. Who's giving them air to breathe? Allah. Who is making their blood run in their veins? Allah. Now how many animals are on earth? Billions. Who's giving them? Allah. How many birds in the sky? Billions. How many fish in the oceans? Trillions. How many insects in the world? Who's taking care of them? What's the difference between us and them? Allah created us for jannah. And created them for us. So don't ever think negative of Allah. Allah azza wa jal has the whole world in His hand. So when you ask Him and He doesn't give you, it's not because He's stingy. He gave everything to everyone. And He did not prevent it from coming to you because He's poor. He owns everything. Trust Him. Think positive of Him. Make dua and be content. Be happy. And you will find that the whole dreams of yours will come true inshallah."
