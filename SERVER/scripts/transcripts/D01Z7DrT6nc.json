  "transcript": "and they get a heart attack and they die. Allah says to His Messenger ﷺ, and whoever has disbelieved, let not his disbelief grieve you. Because you've done your due diligence. You've done all what is in your effort to get them out of the darkness to the light. They don't want to. So, it shows you how much love the Prophet ﷺ had for people. That he wanted them to share the goodness that Allah has given him. And finally the Prophet ﷺ was addressed by Allah in this beautiful ayah, So do not let yourself perish over them in regret. Take it easy on yourself, Muhammad ﷺ. It shows you the huge responsibility that the Prophet ﷺ had on his shoulders to the extent that it could have killed him out of grief and sadness and sorrow that they did not accept Islam."
