  "transcript": "yes brother most welcome okay my name is Kofi abria Clement I'm a senior high school graduate and um unfortunately I was not able to come early actually Friday I was here and I I didn't get the announcement so I was called from bed right now but I have been following you most often on peace TV so I believe that um on that prerogative vowel give some questions based on your subject matter the few I have followed you concerning on peace TV thank you very much um first of all I looked and I know that the topic you brought forth was Muhammad in view of the Bible like Muhammad as written in the Bible and you have listened to you most often and you have asked for a very simple straightforward scripture that confess the godship of Jesus Christ and you've even um said that if you are convinced you are going to be a Christian I'm also here with the all genuiness of heart that if your answer also comes and satisfies the questions also becomes a [Applause] Muslim first of all um your apologetics is very powerful and this is the case I want to raise for you to ask a question that um scriptures should be given talking about the deity of Jesus Christ as God I believe that you have taken the case from scriptural point of view to philosophical argument um you've quoted a lot of scriptures and a lot of scriptures you have brought forth and one of the scriptures you quoted somewhere in the book of Acts chapter 3 um about when when Peter was addressing the people and it spoke of the man Jesus approved of God I know you've quoted that scripture as well but you see you are asking of scriptures in where Jesus himself made a statement that he is God but you went beyond the mark and quoted things other people have said about him that has actually opened the argument now you have taken it from the first person who is testifying about himself to what other people are saying about himself then it will mean that I'm not only allowed to talk about what he alone has said about himself but also I'm also allowed to make references in respect to what other people has made about him but let me narrow it down here you see this is i s to reason the first question I wanted to ask you is which um sect of Christians do you actually listen to because if you come to Christianity like I attend the house of Faith uh Ministry I'm also in the KFI so per every kind of Christian sect you realize that it is the knowledge that actually defines why they are there as such particular Christian sect and there is a saying that the abuse of a philosophy as you know does not nullify the philosophy so um I want to first of all know brother brother brother this is a question answer time not a lecture time if you heard the rules and regulations very clearly the question should be posed in two or three sentences if it's more than that it's a short speech the speech is over you came late the lecture is over now don't give a lecture I know the background you have already spoken for 2 three minutes you already spoke 10 20 sentences and yet you have not POS the question question should have a question mark I've read many Christian Bibles King James Version New International Version jah's witness du version many you ask the question simple question two or three sentences should have a question mark That's it pose your question no salute question thank you um for the question mark I know I can't write it but I know I'll POS it um but the case is this when Jesus talks about the spirit he said that he's going to send a comforter someone just like him according to what he said in the Book of John now if you read the book of John chapter 20: number 22 the Bible said he came and he breathed upon them and said receive ye the spirit I've heard that you said that um the Holy Spirit was there before but this is how we understand it in our Dogma the case is like you being a mathematic teacher I know you are capable you been a mathematics teacher you have a lot of topics you can teach you can teach binomial polomia but all of them is under mathematics brother do you understand English yeah two or three sentences you have come here to give a speech I think you're a teacher don't give a lecture here two or three sentences with a question mark you don't have to write your question what is your name it's a question mark it's a question I cannot write I cannot see simple if you don't ask a question I'll give another person a chance you are wasting your time and wasting everyone's time pose a question all you're wasting time I'm being very kind don't test my patience I love you brother I love you I love you Jesus Christ peace be upon him said seek the truth and the truth shall free you you want to go around the bushes bushes bushes words words word without question if you want to preach you can hire this H tomorrow and give advertisement people will come to listen to you those who want to come don't waste there I know about 10,000 people here don't waste their time please don't cause harm to all these people they have come to listen to me not to you you pose a question I'll give the reply only two or three sentences if you pose more than two or three sentences I will go to the next question don't say anything extra please start so so in John 2022 he said receive ye the spirit so those who were there at that time received so I want to know why you think um it goes beyond that point to the prophet Muhammad thank you brother asked a question in John 2022 Jesus Christ peace be upon him said that receive is the spirit but this is not talking about the comforter is different spirit is different receive is the spirit that means the spirit was there this is another verse of the Bible I didn't quote John 20:22 I quoted Gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16 I will pray to the father to send you a comforter who will abide with you forever Gospel of John chapter number 15 verse number 26 but when the comforter will come who I will send from my father he will show you things to come he shall testify me Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth it is experient for you that I go away for if I go not the comforter will not come for if I depart shall I send him you have gone to Gospel of John chapter 20 I'm quoting Gospel of John chapter 14 chapter 15 and chapter 16 you're going to chapter 20 where what are you talking Gospel of John chapter 20 is talking about the spirit I'm not talking about the Holy Spirit I'm talking about comforter holy spirit is not Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him the comforter is Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him did you hear my lecture I said I was late because I didn't know but you said you heard on the television did you say that yeah I said that I spoken many times on P TV okay then I can post the question better now so that means spirit is different Prophet Muhammad is different and Prophet Jesus peace be upon him said in the Gospel of John 16:1 12-4 I have many things to say unto you but he cannot bear them now for he when the spirit of truth shall come he shall guide you unto all truth he shall not speak of himself all that he shall he speak he shall glorify me who is this person the Holy Spirit brother can you understand English Gospel of John chapter 16 verse number 7 said that it is experient for you that I go away if I go away the Comfort shall come Holy Spirit was already there before Jesus Christ peace be upon Him came into the world so this person cannot be the Holy Spirit you say if you convince me I'll become a Muslim what language do you understand English yes English the Bible says that the Holy Spirit was there in the womb of Elizabeth before John the Baptist was born and John the Baptist came before Jesus Christ peace be upon him correct yes please Holy Spirit was there when Jesus Christ peace be upon was being baptized yes so this comforter cannot mean holy spirit yet you say holy spirit you're going in circles that's why I was bringing the issue of mathematics that not mathematics I'm talking about Bible I don't want to learn mathematics here um and not from you especially we use analogy to actually create a statement I believe that for you to make in mathematics we use analogy to create a statement which mathematics are you talking about I said in in life which mathematics are you talking about where does it say you use the analogy to make a statement mathematic book says that I'm asking a question which mathematic book says that use analog that was a different statement that was not concern to mathematics I'm asking you which book says that you use an analogy to make a statement in mathematics have you studied mathematics I've studied mathematics a little which book says that you use an analogy to make a statement okay that statement was not part of the mathematics that was a St wrong you made a mistake correct no it was not a mistake I was making different statements you said in mathematics you use anal stat you do not do it in math matics you made a mistake yes or no Lee they were not joint statements I it was like you said in mathematics to use an anology to make a statement is it right or is it wrong in language we are not able to apply comma and full St so you may not have known but I was not making the same statement I was like answering the second question you asked when I talked about mathematics what are you doing sorry there's no comma when you speak it is understood whether comma is there or not you don't have to mention it only when you write you have to mention when you say understood whether it's a comma or a question mark you have POS the question I've given the answer you have posed the question on gopel of John chapter 20 verse number 22 and I answered you the answer is over you didn't understand it it's your problem you asked the question on Gospel of John chapter 20 verse 22 I gave you the answer that is the holy spirit it is not Prophet Muhammad peace be upon Him Prophet Muhammad peace be on me the comforter in which I gave the talk if you want to know more you go and hear my lecture on the YouTube Muhammad saham in the Bible and then when you finish then you can write to me on the email okay brother thank you question"
