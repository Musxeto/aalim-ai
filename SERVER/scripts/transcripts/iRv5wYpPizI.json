  "transcript": "might my my fair break uh most most time times i make my ubu but sometimes it doesn't happen so should i need to do a game um it doesn't make sense either you break your wudu then you have to go and make wudu and pray again or you don't break your wudu then your prayer is valid uh i mean to say in a deeper and it happens almost okay is is it due to gas or to urine incontinence yes yes problem no do i call a billion consulting doctor yet but i think i have guest problems okay i would answer inshallah um she says she has problems with uh gas incontinence so she feels that her wudu is broken now with gas either a person is certain one hundred percent that he leaked gas and this breaks his will or he has a feeling the prophet said allah when you have a feeling that you broke your wudu do not leave your prayer do not make wudu again unless you hear a sound or find a foul smell this is certainty but if it's just a feeling it's just movement in your stomach this doesn't impact your wudu now if um salman is definitely certain that her widow is broken then she has to make wudo again if this is continuous then she is madur she is excused because this is a continuous breaking of the wudu and it's causing hardship to perform wado eight nine times and every time you start to pray you break it and you perform you can easily be exempted from that by telling you make wado once the adhan is done and then you can pray the whole time until the time is over once the adhan of the following salat is called if you broke your wudu within the duration then you must make wado again for that other prayer"
