  "title": "Punishment in the grave because of urine uncleanliness | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says what is the punishment if people soil their clothes or body while urinating now this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam warned the Muslims from it was reported in a authentic hadith while the Prophet Alice of some was walking with some of his companions they passed by two graves and the Prophet said early in salat wa salam these dead people are being tormented in the graves over something that is not big by Allah it is big meaning that leaving that sin was not a big issue but the sin itself was really big major and he said about one of them he did not protect himself from urine meaning that when he urinated he did not do what was needed to ensure that the urine does not reflect back on his clothes his body or himself and this is why he's being tormented in the grave which means that soiling yourself your clothes not washing yourself after urinating or purifying yourself with tissue is a cause of torment in the grave why because this renders your prayer as invalid if you are in such a state of impurity you perform model and you pray your prayer is not valid it's rejected because one of the conditions of prayer is to be in a pure state and not to have any impurity on your body on your clothes or on the spot you're praying on therefore the torment of the grave is caused by this and this means that people should be careful when they relieve themselves and to ensure that there are no impurity on their body due to urinating defecating or anything else we we see people dealing with dogs affectionately and they love their dogs they cuddle them the dogs lick their faces their clothes and then they go and pray their prayer is invalid and definitely they will be tormented and their graves because of this sin similarly because it's the same concept praying without being in the state of purity in addition to what will happen to them of losing the reward every single day a carat of good deeds and the Prophet explained to us a character of good deeds is equivalent to the weight of mount or hood of good deeds every single day because you are raising a dog in your house so people can't comprehend this or don't want to or don't want to learn about this because they don't read the Quran they don't read the Sunnah of the Prophet and they don't read books of fik they don't have time for that they're spending time watching their movies and enjoying life which would end soon and then in their grave may Allah protect us all they will see what they were missing"
