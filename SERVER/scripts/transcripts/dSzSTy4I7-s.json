  "title": "Should I pursue a Professional Career or become a Student of Knowledge? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "my brother is gone is gonna complete his ug I think she means undergraduate course soon so he is really interested in becoming a student of knowledge meaning Islamically but i feel like he should rather help our family by earning through job although my dad is financially stable at hamdulillah but I feel like he needs rest and will soon have to retire so what should be done first of all there is nothing better than seeking knowledge Islamic knowledge there is nothing if you're sincere and you seek Islamic knowledge you're benefiting the whole world rather when you pursue your mechanical degree engineering degree or medicine degree etc this is good this is benefitting a portion of the people but this does not come close to studying the Islamic knowledge this benefits you most and it benefits the whole Ummah secondly as long as your father is still working is financially alhamdulillah stable he would be the first to benefit and reap from his own sons knowledge in Islam and I know a lot of the guys who struggled to get their degree in Islamic studies and in few years time they ended up being a diary teaching people in the message leading prayers in taraweeh benefitting others I know them personally and I can see the look of pride in their parents eyes when they see their son doing so well and the people are praising them for having such a son so your father would be one of the first to benefit from his Suns pursue of Islamic knowledge so as long as a hand Allah he is financially stable and as long as your brother has the urge to pursue and to learn and to fulfill and to fulfill his role as a Muslim scholar or a student of knowledge then he should be given a helping hand and Allah knows best"
