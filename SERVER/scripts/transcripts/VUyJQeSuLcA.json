  "transcript": "The Prophet ﷺ also used to hate things that harm people, such as reptiles, specifically the scorpions. So the Prophet ﷺ cursed the scorpion. And this is an insect, maybe, that cannot be tamed. And the Prophet ﷺ said, may Allah curse the scorpion. It doesn't leave anyone, whether he's praying for Allah or not praying. You must kill it wherever you find it, whether in normal areas or in sanctuaries in the Haram areas. You have to kill it. So this is one of the living creatures that we're ordered to kill, whether in Hil or Haram, whether in an open area, Halal area, or in the sanctuaries around the Haram area."
