  "transcript": "So you want them to make me kafir? You want me to take sides? Ok, I know your question, Akhi. I've been doing this for almost 23 years. So when you start the question, I know exactly what you want and I would save time. So the issue is the hadith of the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. When he said, The day of your fasting as a nation is when you fast as a nation. And the day to break your fast for Eid is when you break your fast for Eid. What does this mean? It means that the majority rules in the sense that if you have a religious authority, whatever the religious authority say, you follow. So if your religious authority, the Mufti, the Islamic ministry, I don't know, don't put us in politics. I just want to leave and go home. If you have an Islamic authority in your country, they adopt moon sighting, you follow them. They adopt the sighting of Mecca, you follow them. They adopt the astrological calculation. No sighting, no Mecca, nothing. Okay, from six years, they know that today is Eid. They announced it. You follow them because this is what the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. By this, the Muslim is one Ummah and they're following their religious authority. In a nutshell. And Allah knows best. And this is not my fatwa. This is Sheikh bin Uthaymeen's fatwa. So all the scholars, trusted scholars say, follow your religious authority and you're in safe hands. The office of the Qadi is the religious authority. Follow him. Alhamdulillah. Walaikum Salam."
