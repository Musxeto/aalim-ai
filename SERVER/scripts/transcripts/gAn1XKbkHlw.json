  "transcript": "Halima says if somebody has passed away and you go to pay your condolences they offer you food that was sent to them from neighbors or other extended family members or friends should we eat or refrain from eating the issue is not should we eat or refrain the food is halal by itself so the neighbors send to the family of the deceased food Brioni carry rice whatever the food itself is Hollande the issue is can we sit and eat or not sitting and eating again is Helen generally speaking but in the hadith of jarir evening abdullah al Bocelli may Allah be pleased with him he is a companion he said that we meaning the Companions of the Prophet Isis I used to consider gathering for mourning and the preparation of food to the gathering part of wailing wailing is a major sin when you start screaming and shouting and slapping your face and touring tearing your clothes and saying all my disease oh my dears and you wail this is a major sin so the Companions used to consider gathering for the morning as an innovation so when someone dies we don't give our condolences no give your condolences but don't gather where I come from they allocate between mahadeva narration the time for accepting condolences so outside of the house of deceased they block the roads so no cars can come in or go out and they put lights so the whole street is lit with light bulbs and they put chairs in an organized fashion and they put a row in front of that for the family of the deceased to sit and those who want to give their condolences come between mother Benicia sit usually they give them coffee and tea it's in the open and some of them go the extra mile and they hire a car it who they pay money and the guy sits on his bench and recites parts of the Quran with a microphone those who cannot afford that they bring a cassette player or a DVD player and they play the Quran and every like five to ten minutes there are intervals where they stop the Quran or the car it stops those sitting stand up and go and give their condolences album Allah Allah may Allah forgive the sins of your deceased one by one and they leave this is an innovation by itself because this is a gathering usually the family of the deceased says listen listen don't go after Isha we will put food and sheep and rice and we will eat dinner together this is part of whaling which is not permissible so what is permissible share what is permissible in giving your condolences for men is that when you see them in the message it when you see them at work when you see them in shops and or in the market or in the streets you give them their control if they're closed you visit them not during this time rather after a sir or after Asia and you give your condolences and leave maybe sit five minutes four minutes depending on the environment in their houses as a normal guest but not in such gatherings that are dedicated to morning and to giving condolences this is what is your any part of the sunnah and allah azzawajal knows best"
