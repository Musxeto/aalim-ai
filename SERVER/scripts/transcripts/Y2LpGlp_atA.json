  "transcript": "McKenzie from the usum so some people say to new Muslims that they aren't expected to pray five times a day immediately or fast Ramadan completely but rather to take it easy and build up these habits gradually such as praying sometimes and fasting some days and they referen the fact that rulings in Islam were revealed over a course of many years therefore people should also introduce the rulings gradually in in uh their own lives so is what they're saying valid are correct what they are saying is totally bogus and baseless because Allah although in the beginning had gradually given the commands of Islam on the 10th year of Hijra just few months before the prophet's death Allah revealed the Ayah that says to today I have completed your religion so now no one has the right to say listen I'm a new revert and I used to drink a lot of booze so we know that boo prohibition came on three stages so can I follow that no muslim in his right mind would say yeah sure don't uh um overdo it in the first stage in the second stage Don't Pray when you're intox intoxicated and in the third stage it's Haram for you no it's Haram on the spot when someone accepts Islam he has to accept it wholeheartedly we don't say to him okay you're a revert we'll give you like six months eight months pray fer uh uh when you wake up uh you don't have to pray and skip this and skip that this Ramadan it's good if you do 10 days 20 days is on the house this is not Islam this is cherry picking and whoever say such things to reverts they're ignorant imbeciles they know nothing of Islam don't be confused don't be distracted by their titles or their position because they're totally ignorant of the rulings of Islam and Allah Knows Best from Bangladesh you said the alignment should not choose between and but how can I know if I am a lman or a toble in if I books on my own watch videos of sh do courses read had on my own can I choose between fwa what qualities do I need to choose betweena this is too generic because there are things that are crystal clear in Islam the prohibition of wine intoxicants the prohibition of fornication Zena the prohibition of stealing of killing of lying you don't need to ask a sheh for this these things but there are things that are detailed and not a lot of people know about and laymen for certain are not qualified to choose and pick which is the right thing to do and this is why it is extremely dangerous for laymen who don't speak Arabic who've not done courses of uh comparative to come in jump the gun and say okay I'm going to choose this why it looks nice or the she who presented to us on YouTube was excellent his presentation was nice you're not qualified as you're not qualified to talk to a neurosurgeon and say to him the procedure you want to operate through uh why did you choose this and not something else and explain it to me this is a logical you haven't done any medical school you haven't done any research you have no knowledge therefore it is dangerous for a Layman to just go and scroll fatwas and choose what he likes because this is called cherry picking you must ask people of knowledge Allah says twice in the Quran ask the people of knowledge if you do not know so you don't know ask Those whom you trust and you cannot keep on jumping and hopping from one Sheikh to the other asking for a specific answer that you're looking for and then you grab on to it and next time you ask the other Sheikh and you grab on to his answer because this is again fatwa shopping or cherry picking you need to follow one individual whom you trust in his knowledge moral conduct his uh uh religious commitment his righteousness and whatever he tells you you follow that and that would CL clear you in front of Allah"
