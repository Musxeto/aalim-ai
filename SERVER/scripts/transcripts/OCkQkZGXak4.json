  "transcript": "Halima from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam wa rahmatullah Yes sir yesterday when I was um after urinating so I got this feeling that um I forgot to that what that what I did not reach um the middle part of my private part so I did not eat because for me at that time it was not logical so when I felt guilty when I was praying while I was praying I felt guilty that I should have finished and now it has transferred everywhere so I finished my prayer and I cleaned everywhere but I did not redo my prayer and my prayer is valid sir any doubt that comes to you after finishing the ibadah it must be ignored so if a person answers the call of nature washes himself cleans himself and then makes wudu then gets the idea that he did not do it well because of shaitan there's no evidence to support it one must ignore such whispers and pay no attention to it"
