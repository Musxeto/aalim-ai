  "title": "Should I stay away from Nike as I have stocks in it? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "T from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh, hope all is well. Yeah so I've had a look at some of your videos related to wearing Nike brand and when it's a doubtful matter yet I will just stay away. The only reason I'm asking this question is I've got some um for related to business stock related to Nike and the other day I came across where they're starting to sell the Nike product where it says Goddess of Victory and also like a logo with the like a like a god type figure something recently I came across so I just thought I'll run it past you because obviously I won't wear it but I've got stock to sell so just thought should I stay away from this or is it still okay to wear this in spite of it because it's not really well known anyway but I thought I'd double check. Thank you. My video is crystal clear in what I think and believe so if you've watched it it would be illogical to ask me again. My stance is the same I personally wear Nike shoes and shirts and caps and the likes and I don't have any problem with that because nobody believes in the goddess of sports or whatever they think it is nobody even knows about no nobody knows about it nowadays and nobody worships such a god or a goddess or whatever it's just a name it's just a brand so I have no problem in that inshallah."
