  "title": "Army or Navy official took 2nd job while he was not supposed to, is his income halal?",
  "transcript": "Uthma from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. I hope you are doing well Sheikh. Alhamdulillah. Barakallah Fikum. Sheikh has recited that the wealth haram in itself as in acquired from cheating or deceiving would remain haram for the person himself and the family. So if someone was retiring from the Navy or Army and it does not allow a person to apply for another job before the release of the retirement letter and date along with the issuance of no objection certificate but he violated this and was already in the process of another job application for his own and family's security. That is before the retirement letter and NOC was released and that too despite that the salary is granted for one year post retirement also. So is his pension that still comes entirely halal for his own self or does it fall under wealth haram in itself due to the way acquired and any Zakat or Sadqa would be invalid? The income is halal if the job is halal and he has, his services have been terminated from the Navy or his previous job. So if he is in the waiting period just to clear his papers and to get a no objection letter etc and he works, he has broken the law, he is sinful for breaking the law but his income if the job is halal, his income is totally halal and Allah knows best. You are entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they are poor, I will give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
