  "title": "Angels Whispers & Devil's Whispers, not all whispers are from Shaytan? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Alima from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. Yes sir, like sometimes I must concentrate on what I'm doing most of the times. I get the whispers so I'm unable to say the dua we must say and I think people judge me by listening to the whispers without even asking me if what they are hearing is true or not. So how can I go about this? I do not understand your question. If you're saying that you get whispers from shaitan and you ignore them without trying to investigate whether these whispers are good or bad, this is illogical. Why? Not everything that goes into our minds is from shaitan. What do you mean Sheikh? I mean that there is a hadith where the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam stated that the angel has whispers and the devil has whispers. So the angels with whispers is it's promising you of truth and to believe in goodness. And the whispers of the devil is to promise you of evil and to disbelieve in the truth. So not everything that goes into your mind you have to disregard. No, you have to analyze it. If it is something that pleases Allah, if it is something that is in accordance to sharia, then this is from the angel. It's a good thing, you should do it. And if it's the other way around, then this is from the devil and you have to ignore it. And Allah knows best."
