  "transcript": "[Music] I don't know I lied my heart's age your mercy is what I believe [Music] in your help me in my quest permit me to pass the ultimate best help me in my quest [Music] foreign [Music] coming to you every Sunday and Tuesday at five o'clock local time here in Cairo Egypt and we're waiting for your phone calls to come and we have the first scholar is brother ahna from Bangladesh Allah what is the ruling on painting statues of living creatures and earning money from it the person who would paint it who didn't make it him themselves but they just painted it Allah the almighty says in the beginning so he says o you who believe you have to collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon Vice and transgression the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam also said that the most tormented people on the day of judgment are those who make such images sculptures and those who draw portraits of living creatures they are the most tormented people in the day of judgment Allah tells them to give life to what they've created and they won't be able to do so therefore when you collaborate with such people by painting it by maybe softening the surface beautifying it by carrying it you are sharing a great amount of sin with them because you're helping them and whoever assists and helps on evil will get a fair amount equal to that evil as well as whoever assists and helps on righteousness and virtue will get a similar amount of such righteousness and virtue and Good Deeds with the grace of Allah and I hope this answers your question from the UK how are you I'm doing great alhamdulillah now my question revolve around um that there is celebration in Islam so I have a brother who is a practicing Muslim and he made it known to his family that he doesn't celebrate the Day and he tried to teach his kids this um path of Islamic teachings however his wife his resistance to the message and sort of uh sometimes argue with him but the point of this question is that the wife celebrated at birthday usually for the children recently and the brother decided not to participate by leaving home the birthday was done on a Saturday but the brother left home on a Friday with the intention to go back home on a Sunday because it doesn't want to participate and be there however this is causing a sort of backbiting and slandering towards this brother that is taking Islam to extreme and the prophet did not obey us from doing birthday so the brother is like very confident in what he did or he just made a sort of guidance from people like you to understand better that what he has done is it right or is it wrong for not participating and collaborating with his wife in this birthday celebration for the kids first of all Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe protect yourselves and your family your household your wives and your children from Hellfire so this is an instruction in order an obligation that the guardian of the house the man has to protect his women folk and children from whatever may lead them to Hellfire secondly celebrating such feasts and events is not part of our religion definitely birthdays were adopted from other nations it is part of their customs and traditions and the prophet had said be pleased with a man with his father and whoever shall imitate a people then he is from among them this does not relate to wearing a watch or driving a car or using glasses to see this is related to whatever is considered to be part of their Customs Traditions religion and so forth and birthdays are not part of our own Customs or traditions this is taken from the non-muslims therefore celebrating them is not permissible otherwise we would have been celebrating the birthday of the Prophet Allah which is the most noble of all birthdays and the birthdays of Abu Bakr or Omar Osman Ali and the whole nine yards but this is not part of our religion therefore celebrating such birthdays Mother's Days the Labor Days Halloween Easter Christmas New Year Valentine and the list goes on all of this is totally prohibited and not permissible thirdly it's a man's job to enforce such conviction and beliefs in his household in his home unfortunately I've been doing a lot of counseling sessions and I get a lot of brothers like your friend from the UK and elsewhere who accepted to be treated as a doormat I am shocked sometimes traumatized when the brother says to me well my wife did this my wife did that and I said wait wait wait is your wife earning says no I'm the breadwinner does she chip in in the bills in the rent in the foods and no no nothing I give her allowance and I give her a credit card and I give her a car and I bring her a maid but she does this and that she refuses to obey me or to listen to me she kicks me out of the house if you're a wimp if you don't have a spine I can't help you when it comes to Halal and Haram we love our women we love our wives we are willing to swim oceans and climb mountains and cross deserts for them but when it comes to disobeying Allah this is a red line that I'd rather never cross even if it was for a woman I love and if she insists well another one bites the dust I could get someone younger smarter more religious and much much much more beautiful and they're Cheaper by the Dozen and no disrespect is intended but this is reality if you fail to find your purpose in life in obeying Allah and implementing Sharia in your life with diplomacy with being polite and uh kind and easy going but never ever allow anyone to cross the red line simple as that now these brothers are seriously a doormat their wives control them shouted them slandered them say lies about them and they come to me and say what should I do learn how to be a man I'm not talking about being a tyrant or being abusive deal with them like the prophet used to deal Allah he was the kindest of all men but when it came to Red Lines he would never compromise his religion it is an issue of zero tolerance when he comes to the home and he finds curtains that have life portraits of animals he doesn't enter and you can see anger in his face and mother she says the most beloved woman to his life to his heart o prophet of Allah what have I done I seek Allah's forgiveness he says Aisha don't you know that the owners of these portraits are being tormented in hell end of story she takes them down tears them up put them in a pillow and that's it stuff stuff's pillows with it and that's it it's torn it's it's totally deformed so this is what you need to do explain to them show them but at the end of the day you're the man of the house put your foot down who says you have to leave the house no I'm not leaving I'm not an ostrich whenever there's danger I just put my head in a hole in the ground to say whoops it's dark I don't see anything everything is fine no it's not like this it's your home you're paying the bills they have to comply and Obey whatever you say not you fleeing the battlefield and letting them do whatever they want so tomorrow they say we would like to have a party and we would uh smoke or maybe have some a pint of lag every now and then and you say okay I told him and I advised them they wouldn't listen and I leave the home put your foot down be a man and act like a man within the boundaries of sharia and Allah Knows Best from the Emirates I have four questions four four is a lot yeah even for Huda four is a lot can make them two okay not a problem so um I I came across one ID about the process of Allah said to Addy that if you live long enough a woman will travel from aliera to Mecca to dutawal and this Hadith is enough of bukhari so how do we reconcile this against with the I did that a woman cannot travel by themselves because I thought like you can travel if it's safe but you cannot if it's bad okay so my other my other question is can we lie to our husband about things that we're doing because we know there is going to be um Jenna like if you're exercising to lose weight and you cannot lose weight so if he knows that you're exercising it becomes like a Debbie Downer and be negative about it and stuff like that is it allowed to be like no I didn't exercise today and stuff like that okay first of all the Hadith um Amina is referring to is authentic and the prophet said please with him that soon you will see a woman vaina traveling on her own from Yemen to had ramout or from had remote to Mecca or from this area to that area different narrations fearing no one except the wolf on herself or something similar to that as the prophet had said and she's asking how is this possible when we know that the prophet prohibited women from traveling alone without the companionship of a male mahram first of all the prophet was giving us a prophecy of what would happen in the future not that he is approving of it when the prophet tells us that at the Jal the Antichrist The Imposter would come and do heinous things in the world within 40 days that's his lifespan on Earth did the prophet Allah endorse his actions of course not their heinous actions their kuffer their blasphemous but he was telling us a prophecy of what was going to come so this is one of the logical answers to why the prophet told us about a woman traveling on her own secondly the prophet has said in numerous hadiths a lot of hadiths and directed us and told us and taught us about the prohibition of a woman traveling on her own so we don't need to come to an isolated incident as such talking about the prophecy in the future and try to bend evidences to justify that women May travel alone the ruling is fixed till the day of judgment so we have to stick to it because this is what Muslims do and Allah knows best as for her second Hadith lying is prohibited in Islam and it is sinful yet the prophet said that there are three places or situations that is permissible for a person to resort to lie one of them is a man or a spouse lying to his or her spouse what kind of Lies you see today is Sunday it's poker night and I tell my wife listen I have to work late in the office and we have a new shift and I may not make it except at three or four a.m so don't wait for me for for dinner you just tuck yourself in to bed and and go to sleep and I go with the boys to play cards or to spend time together without informing my wife this is Haram this is a lie what kind of a lie is permitted between the spouses the type that increases love so if my wife comes out and says to me do you think this new dress fits me or it's too tight instead of breaking into laughter and saying is this yours or your granddaughter's address you're gonna tear it into pieces what is this you're so big and huge for it it should come in a family size award this is not good for you what would happen probably a swollen eye for five days because of her punch maybe not being able to have lunch and dinner for three four days and not being able to communicate with her for another six months well deserved the here I have to lie so I would look in her and say with great love and acting ability that subhanallah I don't know which is making which more beautiful is it the dress that's making you charming and beautiful or are you making the dress looks beautiful and attractive so it gave you a pre a free pass for another six months so this is the kind of lying that is permissible now you have to weigh the pros and cons and it's up to your preference and judgment if you feel that if you were to tell your husband that you had worked out and he would be envious be jealous be sad he can't do that and his love to you won't make him overcome such negative feelings you can lie there's no problem in that but if no you know that he cares for you and he encourages you and he wants you to work out more than he would have done and he would not have any feelings in this case lying would not be permissible on Allah Knows Best from the U.S is Allah actually if I have two questions first question what is the ruling on a woman giving her elderly father a bath if there's no one to help take care of him okay second question uh is a woman encouraged to give up her uh inheritance in Islam because in Pakistani culture this is very frowned upon for women to demand their inheritance but the brothers kind of want them to it's frowned upon because they're the ones who took care of them and provided for them after their father's death so is it encouraged in Islam for her to give up her inheritance to her brothers because her brothers took care of them okay I'll answer your question first of all what is the ruling on a female bathing a male an elderly a patient who is unable to do this whether mahram or Nan maharam if this person is unable to do that for himself like an elderly father and there is no one of the same gender to do this task we can't hire a male nurse we there aren't any of his sons or grandsons or nephews who's willing or siblings who's willing to do this and there's only this nurse a female nurse or his daughter in this case due to necessity this is permissible providing that this daughter wears gloves so that she does not touch the aura directly and that she does not look directly at the auras of her father's body because they're still prohibited for her to look unless there is a necessity that calls for her to look and observe other than that there's no problem insha Allah and Allah Knows Best as for her second question are women encouraged to let go of their rights and inheritance of course not that's weird and strange and totally unislamic Allah azzawajal is the one who himself divided these wealths Over The Heirs of a deceased it was not done by the prophet Allah it was done by Allah he is the one who divided the wealth of a deceased and he's the one who allocated such inheritance to The Heirs who are you to come and say you well sis you should let go of your rights and give it to me and my brothers why because we're taking care of you and who said you should take care of us again this is unislamic it's a misconception unfortunately among the Muslims that oh the brother is obliged to provide for his sister this is not true where did you get this from oh I heard the Sheikh saying that the brother is obliged to provide for a sister no this is not true a brother is obliged to provide for his sister if the conditions are fulfilled what are these conditions number one his sister is Stone broke she doesn't have any to uh any money of her own but if she inherited if she's working if she has savings I don't give her a penny second condition is that she doesn't have someone who blocks me from inheriting her such as a father so if she has a father then I'm not obliged to provide for her even if she's poor because this is the responsibility of my father if she had a son it's a responsibility of her son thirdly in order for it to become an obligation upon me to provide for her is that I have extra than what I what my wife and my children need if I I can barely go even hand to mouth I don't have uh the necessary means to fulfill my own needs and requirements let alone someone else I'm not obliged to provide for her even if she's stoned broke or I inherited her this is not mandatory because I can't this is all what I have and I have to feed my wife and children first if I have extra and the other two conditions are fulfilled then I may give myself I may give my sister therefore coming back to your question it is not recommended at all to give up what Allah has given you this is your god-given right okay but if I do this my brother would boycott me and may not speak to me till the end of time so tough luck for him he's the one who's going to hell insha Allah for sivering the ties of kinship over something that is not his if your brother is a thief he's a crook for asking you to let go your uh uh um god-given right who gives whatever about him let him go this is not something that people could twist your arm and force you to do something when Allah is the one who graced you with it and Allah Knows Best brother Aslan from Qatar assalamu alaikum how are you getting old alhamdulillah the question I have is that what is the ruling of Islam about working for a company that takes interest-based loans for financing of his projects but in a different Department inside which is not dealing with such things unlike finance department that involves with a bank loan interest what is the line of this company okay what is the line of work well uh it's a different business like utility company something like that okay I will answer inshallah first of all taking loans to finance your projects is a major sin in Islam now those business owners CEOs CFOs and those in charge of companies should fear Allah azzawajal getting richer and richer and more successful and focusing on the end of Year's bonus an increment would not will not save you from Hellfire one of the major sins in Islam is dealing in riba and don't be fooled by the amount of companies worldwide even the Muslim world that have no problem in borrowing in riba and financing their projects in River this is a major sin so it's in your neck you'll not come on the day of judgment in explain yourself to Allah and say oh Allah I was the CEO the board of directors directed me to do this I could not do anything else he resign work as a janitor rather than accepting to facilitate and endorse interspace River secondly if the line of work of the company's Halal they work in construction they work in Services they work in manufacturing Halal things and it so happens that you work for that company in a Halal Department in the department of premises in transportation and procurement in manufacturing in operation in Human Resources but not in financing because you don't do anything you have nothing to do with riba if this is the case then working for such a company is halal even if they Finance their projects or deposit their savings in exchange for riba why because the sin falls upon the one who's dealing in River your job the line of work of the company's Halal so whatever their doing and financing their projects by it's the sin is on them unlike if you working in I.T or working in HR or working in procurement for an interest-based Bank a conventional Bank though your job seems Halal quote unquote yet the line of work of the institution or the company itself is Haram therefore even their drivers and janitors their earning is Haram because they're collaborating with the whole system over Haram which is based all in riba and Allah azzawajal Knows Best we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back and welcome back we have sister soda from Tanzania uh what should a person do when they forgot whether they recited the fact here or not and they already reached in Roku is that Haram for them to change their intention to turn the prayer into a Sunnah if they don't do it regularly only once they do it once like you know what okay first of all reciting the Fatiha in the Salat is a pillar of the Salat if a person skips it whether intentionally or due to forgetfulness or due to an error and does not make it up in the same Salat the Salat is rendered invalid secondly if a person is in the state of rukur and he gets The Whispers of shaytan whether he recited the Fatiha or not This is highly unlikely to happen and usually people who come to me for counseling and they say sheikha I forgot I made a mistake and al-fatiha I say to them what's your name he says she's done for example and I said how many times are you asked about your name per day he says once or twice so I said then you say your name once or twice a day he said yeah approximately this is the average he said how many times do you recite the Fatiha he said at least 17 times in four prayers and you can add a number of more tens of times if I pray Sunnah prayers and night prayers and that likes so I said subhanallah when I ask you about your name that you only pronounce twice you immediately said it without any mistake and Fatiha that you recite at least 20 to 30 times a day for the past 10 20 30 years of your life and you still make mistakes in it don't you think shaytan is messing up with your head big time likewise for you soda when you go for record and say hmm did I recite the Fatiha or not this is definitely from shaytan first because it did not come to you while you were in the standing position it came to you when you went for when you actually were almost 99.99 certain that you've finished your Fatiha and your Surah therefore if you get some doubts like this ignore it and move on because such doubts are 99.99 are from shaytan what if they are genuine Sheikh if you are 99.9 percent certain that yes you did Skip Fatiha your mind wasn't with you you were thinking of something else definitely big time I've messed up in this case you don't change it into Sunnah or voluntary because this wouldn't do you any good because the the the prayer itself is invalid what should I do you immediately should rise up consider you have not done your record and recite your Fatiha because you're still in the same raka and finish it and do your record and the rest of the prayer as usual offer your salutation upon the prophet assalam offer your salaam alaikum then offer to the sahu afterwards and then when you said offer to salaams to the right and the left and your prayer is valid and Allah Knows Best brother Yusuf from the Emirates Yusuf Yusuf maybe we don't have Yusuf anyone else brother Muni from the U.S yes I uh I I I have a question um I've heard that I've heard uh that uh the audio of Quran recitation in which an echo is heard it's prohibited to listen to is this correct well how strong is the echoing if the echoing is going to cause the Quran to be intermingled together and you don't know what is being said because of one word is being inserted in the other right this is not befitting of the Quran but if it's normal echoing foreign this is okay there's nothing wrong in that this is the type of sound effects found in the vast majority of masjids but to put such sound effects into effect where the Quran is intermingled and you aren't able to focus when the Imam is reading because once he's reading live the fourth word you're listening to the second word being echoed so this distracts you from understanding the Quran this is totally prohibited in Haram and Allah Knows Best from Italy is the question is if I go to Friday prayer and Imam during the language he's speaking I don't understand it can I continue doing my zika the answer is yes the essence of sitting for Friday oration or hotwa is to understand comprehend and implement if you fail to do this due to the fact that you're unable to understand the word of what the Imam is saying due to the language barrier there is no problem in you reciting in your head the Quran or making thicker or offerings salutation upon the prophet without you have to be careful without annoying those sitting around you or distracting them and Allah Knows Best Jahan from Bangladesh I would like to ask one of my cousin tries to brainwash me about my future and tries to prevent me from admitting in University I talked about it is my mother and so angry and called my aunt and talked about it but they got really angry now they are not receiving our calls as we want to apologize to them and don't want to break the kinship what's the ruling on this should we continue calling every or is there any time limit timely beginning to this this is an internal dispute that happens in all families as long as they're in a state of Rage most likely because your mother miscommunicated with them and maybe was a bit harsh to their son and they felt offended due to this it's Human Nature give it some time give it few weeks so that they can calm down and forget about it and then try to either contact them through sms's General sms's without referring to that topic or you probably would meet them in a wedding or a family gathering or someone would come and invite you for a feast or something like that and then little by little you can start to build up the relationship as it used to be before little by little to try and reconcile immediately after they had a fight or they expressed and showed their disinterest in communicating with you is very unwise let it settle let them calm down for a while and then inshallah things would go back to normal uh brother Shaban from South Africa yes who hunted I think we've lost trouble do you have someone else okay we have a question for the emails from Abdullah from Germany he says a friend narrated Hadith from the prophet Allah that a man gave water to a Thirsty Dog and we went and he went to Paradise Allah forgave him and took him to Paradise but also we know that there's a Hadith about Abu hurairah may Allah please with him where he said that it was a prostitute who gave also water to a dog from a well and that Allah forgave her sins is this friend a kafir because narrating Hadith with mistakes in it is kufur what should he do he has deep remorse and he fears that he may left Islam first of all I think he should be careful in the friends he select Abdullah with all due respect because you're definitely not a good friend why the guy did not do any kufur and you making here feel making him feel upset depressed and you're making him feel that he committed kufur because you've stated that making such a mistake in a Hadith is good for who said so tell me show me who said that making a mistake in the Hadith is kuffer no one did he make the mistake intentionally it's not a mistake then it's deliberate thirdly fourthly who's counting I don't know there are two narrations of this Hadith both are sahih and authentic and 100 correct in one narration it was a man who went to the well and brought water in the shoe and held it with his mouth until the dog the Thirsty dog drank from it and Allah thanked The Man by forgiving his sins and the same other Hadith it was a prostitute that went down and did the same for the dog now you can come and say was it the same dog come on give me a break these are two different narrations why would it have to be in the same country the same city the same era the same month the same date these are two separate incidents which illustrates to us the mercy of Allah azzawaja but both Hadith are authentic so there is no kuffa from your friend but definitely you jumping the gun is a very dangerous thing and by the way there are mistakes that are said that on the face of it is totally blasphemous yet the prophet Allison did not consider it to be even sinful as per the Hadith which is in the sahih where the Prophet said Almighty is more joyful and happy when his servant repents to him then the happiness and joy of a man who was in the desert traveling with his food and drinks on his camel and when he took a short nap woke up to find his camel not there it disappeared he looked for it everywhere but he was in the wilderness he was in the desert so when he thought that he was dead for sure he took another nap only to wake up to find his camel next to him he grabbed the camel's harness and out out of extreme joy and happiness he said oh Allah you are my servant and I am your lord the prophet says he made the mistake out of Happiness now such a mistake did it take him out of the fall of Islam definitely or not did the prophet say anything about it definitely not which means that the last verse of Surat al-baqarah o our Lord do not hold us accountable if we were to forget or to make an error Allah said I shall do that Allah will not hold us accountable so I hope this answers your question aftab from Malawi assalamu alaikum how are you doing I'm doing great alhamdulillah Malawi okay the question was if am I sinful if I set an alarm for Fajr and the alarm rings and I wake up knowing consciously that okay I'm awake now okay so we've lost aftab and most likely his question was if I were to set the alarm to wake up for Fajr and I wake up and intentionally snooze it and go to sleep and then I don't wake up until the sun is in the middle of the sky I miss Fajr so am I sinful this is in Allah's hands if you were mostly certain that when I snooze the alarm definitely I'm gonna wake up within five to ten minutes before the time is over I know myself I've done it a gazillion times in this case you're not sinful but if you intentionally do this without setting the alarm again to ensure that you're gonna wake up and you know for certain that you're not going to wake up then you are sinful and Allah Knows Best brother Adil from India am I sinful for loving Ibrahim more than Professor like not loving but I feel more connected to Ibrahim like I when I hear his stories I feel like emotional I don't feel like that there is there is something wrong in you this is not logical because we love Prophet Muhammad more than ourselves the prophet said in an authentic Hadith he will not be a full-fledged believer who does not love me that is a prophet Muhammad more than his father his mother his wife his children and his own self he will not become a believer so what would happen if someone loves Prophet Ibrahim more than Prophet Muhammad there's something wrong in his mind what did Prophet Ibrahim do to you compared to what the prophet Muhammad had done to us we definitely without any doubt love Prophet Ibrahim we mention him in every salutation when we say so we definitely love Prophet Ibrahim we know his sacrifice we know that he was an um of his own we know that he was thrown in the living fire and in The Inferno and Allah saved him we know that he was ordered to slaughter his own son who was like 13 14 years of age and he complied that Allah saved him and sacrificed him and substitute him with a great Ram we know that he opposed his father his tribe the whole world and stood alone in front of them and destroyed the idols we know all of this but then what compared to what our Prophet Muhammad had done and it would take me ages just to say the tip of the iceberg of what he had done to us definitely you have something wrong there are a fuses you know a short-circuiting up in your head if you love anyone more than the prophet yes you will love Prophet Ibrahim Prophet Prophet Musa Prophet Issa and all the prophets of Allah and each one has a special place in our hearts but none all and all of them combined would not become even close to our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam so would you be sinful yes you would without any doubt would I be a Muslim I'm not sure you're not hating the prophet saws but in order for you imagine there are three questions for you to be asked on the day of judge on in your grave when the two angels come to you who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you if you don't have complete and undoubtful and unconditional love to Prophet Muhammad you won't be able to answer these questions and if you don't you're going to be hit on your head with a hammer that would turn you into salt may Allah protect us all so think again go and buy the book called how he treated them where it describes the shemael and the characteristics of the Prophet Allah in like three four months time or maybe less inshallah on Huda TV on this blessed Channel I will begin inshallah they will Air the series that I'm recording about the prophet Allah of the book uh compiled by Lima termidi and authenticated by Sheikh al-bani Hashem it will tell you who Muhammad is and I hope this would help you open your eyes and see the sun in the middle of the day and acknowledge your Prophet Muhammad to be the most beloved person on Earth to your heart may Allah shall make us under his Flagship on the day of judgment may Allah grant us a sip and a drink of his pool on the day of judgment and may Allah make us among those close sitting to him in Paradise I mean foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]"
