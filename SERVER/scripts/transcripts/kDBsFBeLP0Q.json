  "title": "Do our hands become impure after waking up from sleep? Is sleeping in daytime included?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] says do our hands become \nimpure after waking up from sleep because   we are commanded to wash them thrice, is \nsleeping during daytime also included? This is an issue of dispute. The Prophet ﷺ said that, so the Prophet ﷺ says when one of you \nwakes up, and this is morning and evening,   he must not put his hands, you know they did \nnot have faucets, so it was a bucket of water,   if you insert your hands in it then we don't \nknow what might contaminate the water or not,   the Prophet ﷺ says then you should wash your hands \nthree times before putting them, inserting them   in the bucket because one does not know where \nhis hands, quote unquote, spent the night,   and those who say that this is only for  \nnight sleep use this word [ ], to indicate that   it is referring to night sleep and those who said \nthat no [ ] it is generally understood because   most of the sleep happens at night, so \nthe general terminology would be use this,   but this does not mean that when you wake up \nfrom daytime sleeping that you should not do it,   and it's an issue of dispute. Now does my \nhands, why do we say the answer is no because   even if I sleep with gloves of plastics \nlike the surgeon gloves on, if I wake up   and take them off I still have to wash my hands \nthree times, though I know definitely that   my real hands did were not contaminated, so \nthis is something to deal with the unseen,   it is like when the Prophet \nﷺ tells us when you wake up   you have to pull the water up your nostrils and \nblow it three times, why? I didn't see any devil,   but I believe in what the Prophet \nﷺ says I am so this is what I do   and likewise when it comes to my hands \nit's not necessarily that my hands touched   any Najaasa or were contaminated by it \nbut still I do what the Prophet ﷺ said."
