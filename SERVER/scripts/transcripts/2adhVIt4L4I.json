  "title": "Can a woman attend a mixed school in Full Hijab due to neccessity, what about giving a presentation?",
  "transcript": "Khadija from Morocco Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh So my question is due to necessity I study in a mixed school like there are no homeschooling or schools for girls only in my country and if I don't go to school my adoptive family said that they will not be able to provide for me forever so I wear the proper hijab and stay away from the opposite gender but my question is is it permissible for me for example to ask the male teacher during the class if I didn't understand something or if I have to give an answer or give a presentation is any of this permissible because it's almost impossible to avoid it it is not permissible to study in mixed schools in the current situation where there is free mixing however when a woman or a girl abides by the full hijab and sits far away from men or boys and is totally segregated I hope this is acceptable due to necessity as you have mentioned now for you to give a presentation is totally out of the question because this defies the purpose of the hijab and maybe to ask a question would be acceptable if there is a need for it and you did not understand asking a straightforward question without beautifying your voice to the point would be acceptable inshallah and Allah knows best"
