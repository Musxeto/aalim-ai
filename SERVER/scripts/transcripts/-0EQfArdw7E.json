  "transcript": "Safiyya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is if you, if it's Maghreb prayer and you join someone on second rakat Tashaud, how do you pray that prayer? Jazak Allah Khair Wa Jazakum. Take it as a rule of thumb Safiyya. And what is the rule of thumb? Whatever you begin with your imam, it is your first rakah. Regardless of which rakah the imam is in. If I join the imam in his third rakah, this is my first. The imam sits for Tashaud, I sit with him, he offers Salam, I stand up. What should I pray? Well I've already done my first, so I pray the second, sit in the Tashaud, third, sit in the Tashaud and the salutation, Darood, Sharif, and then offer Salam. So to look at your scenario, you join the imam in his second rakah, which is your first. So you pray with the imam, you sit with the imam in the first Tashaud, and you make the Tashaud with him, he stands for his third, which is your second. And you sit with him in the last of his Tashaud and the salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ, and he makes Salam, you stand up for your third rakah, and you pray on your own, you sit for Tahiyyat, you sit for salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ, and you offer Salam. You say, okay Sheikh, these three rakahs, I sat in the first and second and third. There's no problem in that. Your prayer is totally correct and valid and Allah knows best."
