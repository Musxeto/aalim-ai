  "title": "Zakat on present value or rate we bought? Zakat on gold we daily use? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "a man from india my question is regarding zakat on gold do we need to calculate zakat based on present resale value or at the way hour at which i bought it and do we calculate zakat on jewelry which is one daily okay these are two questions you have cheated and sneaked a second question but being forgiving and merciful i will let that go zakat with zahab or the zakat on gold you estimate the value of the gold today regardless how much you paid for it 10 years ago maybe you paid 10 years ago for it peanuts and now it's in the thousands you have to estimate the value today and give 2.5 percent even if the opposite happened if you bought it for thousands and today's peanuts you give the value there's a cut of the value of today and not the buying value rather the selling because when you buy you buy it high i'm not buying i'm selling what i have so you get the a selling price and give 2.5 on that as for the jewelry the gold and silver and this is a misconception that a lot of the muslims have they think that we have to give zakat on jewelry this is not true you have to give zakat on gold and silver which means that titanium is not the catapult diamonds even if they are forever they are not zakatable rubies precious stones emeralds etc not the catapult only the metal of gold and silver so a woman who has a necklace of diamond that is worth ten thousand pounds she takes it to the jewelers shop and he says that there is only 15 grams of gold there's no zakat on it while another piece of necklace gold or bracelet that might be way way cheaper than this diamond necklace there has to be zakat if it exceeds 85 grams of gold or the total and allah knows best"
