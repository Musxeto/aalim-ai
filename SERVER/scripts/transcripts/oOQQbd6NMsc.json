  "title": "Hadith about not counting  how much money is left, what about recording it expenses on spreadsheet?",
  "transcript": "Abdul Samee from Pakistan: The hadith where\nthe Prophet said ﷺ, do not count so Allah would not count over you and do not, umm how\ndo you say it? Close the container and make it tight so that\nAllah would not make things tight over you? Does this go against having a spreadsheet\nor an excel sheet where I record my expenses and my income just to monitor how much I have\nspent and how much I can plan? The answer is \"no\" the hadith is specific\ntowards a category of the companions, of the Muslims, whom, the Prophet ﷺ was elevating\ntheir level of Iman and Tawwakul so in one incident, he (ﷺ) gave Aisha a certain bag\nor container, he (ﷺ) gave Abu Hurairah a certain bag or container with food in it and\nhe gave Asma bint Abi Bakr a certain pot or something like that and he told generally\nspeaking all of them that don't count, don't weigh how much is left and spend in the cause\nof Allah without counting. Abu Hurairah for example kept on spending\nfrom that container for years and so did Aisha, (May Allah be pleased with her) and I don't\nrecall Asma what happened, this um I'm remembering this vividly, if I knew this right to the\nletter I would be with the major scholars, not sitting here. So, they said that after so many years something\nhappened and just out of curiosity we weighed whats remaining because we've been spending\nlike crazy and it's still full and the barakah went and it got through. So the hadith means that if you spend without\nnoticing how much is left for the cause of Allah, Allah will put Barakah in it, and this\nis why one of the 7 who will be in the shade of Allah azza wa jal on the day of judgment\nis one who gave out to charity with his right hand [in another hadith, his left hand] where\nthe other hand does not know how much he spent, meaning he just took a bunch and gave it,\nhe doesn't know how much he gave, trusting Allah, not like us opening the wallet and\nseeing how much and we choose the worst bill we have that is torn and not looking good\nand giving it to the poor. No, this guy just takes whatever he can and\ngives it for the sake of Allah. Allah puts Barakah in it. But is it wrong Sheikh to have a spreadsheet\nor to have an excel sheet with my expenses? [Answer: There's nothing wrong in that, it's\nhalal] Is it the best thing to do? [Answer: umm maybe but umm, it's up to your\npreference]"
