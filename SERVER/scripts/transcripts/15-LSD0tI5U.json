  "transcript": "Sam from Canada how are you alhamdulillah alhamdulillah uh my question is when uh somebody is uh like we know the Hadith where the prophet he say that there is no prayer without the F but if a brother enters the Mas how do we explain to him that if you catch the r with the IM you caught the raat maybe he's going to say I did not recite I didn't recite the how I catch but he did when he did the the prophet as per the Hadith of abuur may Allah be pleased with him he said do not recite behind the Imam anything except the fa and Abu said and after some time the people were denied from that meaning that even the fa do not recite it behind the IM and the recitation of the fa in silent raas is a pillar so you have to recite it in silent ra whether you're a im or a follower or someone praying alone silent raas you have to pray it or or off recite it if you don't your prayer is invalid because it's a pillar in loud R like the first two Ras of and and the two raas of f it is an issue of dispute and some Scholars like Imam bukari say that it is a pillar and you must say it and if you don't say it your prayer is invalid others like Imam Abu hanifa say no you must not recite it at all and T may Allah have mercy on his Soul took the opinion of Imam Malik which states that if the Imam recites it in loud prayers that is sufficient for the follower but if he's praying alone or he's an Imam it's a pillar for him but not a pillar for the follower when the the raak is loud when the recitation of the fat is loud so if the follower comes in a silent and the IM goes for before he joins the Salat there is a Hadith where a man came into the Masjid where the Prophet was in R so the man did not catch up the first ra so from the doors he said allahar allahar he did R and walked in the ru position until he stood up in the Raw After the prayer was was over the prophet said who did this the man said I the prophet said may Allah increase you in being steadfast and careful but don't do that again meaning don't do r at the gate and walk in a r position doesn't look good and it's not part of the Sunnah and the prophet did not say to himam repeat your ra from this Hadith Scholars understood that if a person finds the IM in the ru position or is unable to complete the fat because the moment he joined the Salat when the Imam was standing up the Imam actually has finished everything he recited so he said allahar and the man immediately goes for allahar I don't have time to recite the fat so now I'm risking lose the r or lose the fa The Scholar say lose the fa because you have a concession you have permission from the Shar to join the IM and you Exempted from reciting the fa and I hope this answers your question"
