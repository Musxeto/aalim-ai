  "title": "Dawah: Calling people to Allah #2 (Basics Part 3) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "um [Music] and welcome to our ramadan program the basics and we are still discussing the topic on calling to allah azzawajal now dawa and the art of giving advice and invitation to others to come into islam this is an art this is a science this is a gift from allah azzawajal that each and every one of us has to have in him but how do we call to allah azzawajal because when we look around there are so many fitnah so many calamities so many sins widely spreading like wildfire fires so what should we begin with and how to address these issues so many times as muslims we fail to understand how to begin and when we begin on the wrong foot this means that the consequences and the result won't be satisfactory what do you mean by this you get people complaining oh there are so many sins around us there are women not abiding by the hijab there are men who are clean shaven there are men who don't pray in the masjid there are places where they play music publicly there are movies and tv series and women photos everywhere and we keep on focusing on these things which is logical because these are all haram we're not reinventing the wheel this is allah's religion and allah's religion started 1500 years ago and will continue to the end of time as is no one can come and say we have to progress we have to evolve we have to modernize islam this can be blasphemous depending on the intention of the person why because allah has revealed this religion and allah has completed it perfected it and accepted it to be a religion so who dares come and say we have to evolve we have to modernize we have to change we have to bend the rules because rules are made to be bent not broken all of this is rubbish so what is the problem and why aren't we able to give proper dawah to people dawa is a very huge umbrella that has many aspects underneath it and we do not undermine people's efforts by saying this is not the right way of doing it this is not the right way of doing it and criticize their efforts which are in line with the quran the sunnah but may not be a priority at this moment of time and this is why we have to prioritize our dawah without looking down at others appreciating what they're doing but may decline to follow their way due to our belief that this is not the best at this moment with a little bit of clarification which i have done so many times in the past but will insha allah keep on repeating it until we have an understanding of it when someone comes to you complaining of severe headache and stomachache if you give them pain relievers the pain would go but it will reoccur a couple of hours later you keep on giving them pain relievers pain killers but this will not work for too long because you are only tackling the symptomses but not the core illness or disease so if someone has cancer may allah protect us all and he suffers from such symptoms you can't cure him by giving him painkillers you have to address the tumor whether it is through prophetic medication mixing milk with little portions of camel's urine or whether it's through chemotherapy radiation and the whole nine yards but you have to address the core of the problem what we see around us when we see people falling into sin when we see people not going to the masjid rather turning their backs to it not interested in prayer not interested in reciting the quran not interested in wearing the hijab not interested in segregating insisting on free mixing and sins etc these are symptomses the core of the problem lies deep within now i asked a question at the end of the episode yesterday and that was food for thought the question was was the longest period of da'wah which the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had given throughout his life was it in mecca or in medina the answer is in mecca how long 13 years how long did he spend in medina 10 years after he migrated so what was his da'wah throughout the 13 years in makkah what did he call people to bearing in mind that salat was not prescribed at that time it was prescribed at the end of the period of the makkadawa when the prophet hassan was resurrected and ascended that is he was ascended to the seventh heaven and allah ordained the five daily prayers as we know them there was no fasting there was no zakat because these two pillars of islam were prescribed and mandated on the second year of hijrah so after 15 years of receiving the revelation the second year after he migrated to medina hajj was not there umrah was not there so what actually did the prophet allah call people to this is very important to know because if we fail to set the foundation whatever building we are going to build will soon collapse because the foundation is not stable we have to follow whatever the prophet alaihis salatu followed if we want our da'wah if we want our calling to allah to be successful imam malik said that these generations we live in will not be corrected and their affairs will not be rectified except with what corrected the previous generations so what corrected the previous generations what was the methodology of the prophet islam in giving dawah at the time it was to hate and we will come in sha allah to designate a full episode on tawheed so the essence of the prophets prophet in medina was to make the people know who allah is didn't the people know who allah was the answer is yes even the idol worshipers they believed that only allah creates only allah provides only allah owns everything allah is the giver of life and death allah is the provider the sustainer allah is the creator the facilitator they know this and they declare it it's not something that they have kept deep in but they declared this so what was the problem then the problem was that their knowledge of allah was not complete and their worship to allah was not complete because they were diverting their worship to someone other than allah so when we face this problem today with our children with our wives yes they're not worshiping any idols that we can see but they're worshiping their whims and desires and they are prioritizing that over allah quran sunnah and islam they dare not say it but they are acting upon it and you can see that in the symptom says why do they skip prayers because they don't know allah why do they free mix why do they openly sin why do we see someone who was born and raised as a muslim living in a muslim family all members abide by the islamic attire and perform the islamic rituals on time and they're proud of being muslims why would we find a member or two willing to rebel and become a renegade and leave all behind because they don't know allah the vast majority of muslims today suffer from this void in their hearts their hearts are a vacuum that requires to be filled and a heart can be filled with goodness and can be filled with evil it depends on what you fill it up with through what you see what you hear through what you have as a conviction the prophet sallallahu sallam's role in the beginning was to fill this void was to polish what has become rusted and tarnished to restore the fitrah which we spoke about in the first episode to restore the true nature of these hearts believing in the monetism believing in the oneness of allah and his existence and that he is our lord and creator subhana who's deserving to be worshipped and no one else is the deserved or worthy of being worshiped other than him so when we come to address the problem we will find great results i speak with a lot of youngsters and elders and you can pinpoint the problem immediately in the first couple of minutes there is void in their hearts there is vacuum there is emptiness and this is what shaytan fills with whims desires anxiety negative emotions lusts this is what shaytan does and he does that extremely well if we were to check his cv his resume would be made of like billions of pages because he's been devoted to this task of his since the time of adam peace be upon him imagine how many people he managed to get them in to hell to accompany him in hell how because of this vacuum in our hearts if our hearts were filled with trust of allah dependence and reliance only on allah fearing only allah hoping only in what allah has if it were filled with the love of allah azzawajal and the submissiveness to the creator subhanahu and the submission to his commands none of what we see around us would ever have existed but the problem is when we address our children pray fast don't listen to music don't wear these clothes they are inappropriate don't talk to the elders in such a fashion forgive your friends and and brothers and sisters and pardon them do this do that it's all to them superficial it's not real because it's not coming from within it's something that is forced upon you so you may do it reluctantly not willingly and the moment no one is looking it's gone you don't care anymore because no one is looking and that's why when are we within our community we tend to be respectful practicing trying to be dutiful as much as possible the moment we travel out of our country out of our locality the moment we are somewhere where no one knows us this is where our true identity is revealed and this is only possible with the hypocrites a muslim does not change colors a muslim in saudi arabia is the same as in america is the same as in china when you look at a muslim you immediately identify him whether male or female you can tell they are muslims by their commitment to their religion why are they committed i'm fasting why am i fasting for the sake of allah because allah ordered me to do so don't i feel like eating and drinking yeah if i were in malaysia or if i go to the emirates or if i go to egypt if i go to nigeria or to uganda i'm not within my locality nobody cares if i eat or drink would i still be fasting yep why because it comes from within of your conviction what drives such a conviction your belief in allah azzawajal your trust in allah azzawajal your conviction that allah is the one who is rewarding you and the one who's punishing you if you were to sin this is what we should call people to we have to begin to teach our children the beautiful names of allah if you remember last year allah blessed me to go through the beautiful names of allah in our ramadan series and it's on youtube and it's on zad youtube as well the beautiful names of allah that's this knowledge itself elevates your iman strengthens it makes complying with allah's instructions and laws and orders very easy because it comes from within we have to teach our children and our loved ones the beautiful names of allah to fill their hearts with beautiful these beautiful meanings so that we would be in sync with the da'wah and with the call of the prophet salam to allah and this is inviting people to the way of allah with proper sight and wisdom and knowledge we will go inshaallah later on and discuss the topics and aspects of tawheed and until then inshaallah we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back"
