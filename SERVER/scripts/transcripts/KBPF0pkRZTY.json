  "title": "If Imam skips a Sunnah, can I still do it or must I follow him rafa yadain, tawaruk, etc?",
  "transcript": "Ayaan from Bangladesh Yeah Ayaan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum So if I'm in a congregational prayer and the Imam prays in a different way like let's say the Imam does not include certain like you know voluntary acts in the prayer but I do is that permissible for me to do yes yes it is permissible for you to follow the sunnah even if your Imam skips it so for example if the Imam does not do like the Hanafis skip it you can do it if your Imam does not say you can say it if the Imam does not point his index finger you can do that if your Imam does not spread his arms when making prostration and the likes you can do that if he doesn't do in the last sitting you can do that without any problem"
