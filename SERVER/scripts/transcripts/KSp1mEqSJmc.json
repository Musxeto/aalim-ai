  "transcript": "John from Slovakia. Hello Sheikh, I have a question because we don't have any masjids in our country. We are the only country in Europe that doesn't have any masjids and for a long time I wanted to revert but I don't know how. Do you have any solutions to this? The solution is there are many websites that would help you online. There is a famous website called Sa'at Hiwar I think. No it's not Sa'at Hiwar. Rukn Al Hiwar. Dialogue Corner I think it's called. I'm too old to remember this. But I think it's Dialogue Corner and they have 24 hours seven days a week online qualified people to communicate with you, to answer your questions about religion, and to invite you. The second way of doing it is to see which country is closest to you and to communicate with them, the Islamic Center, to teach you and to go with you step by step so that you can embrace Islam. Embracing Islam is very easy. What's difficult is to follow through. So to embrace Islam all what you have to do is say, You say this with conviction that there is no god worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Prophet Muhammad ï·º is his servant and messenger. You say this with conviction in your heart, boom, you're a Muslim. That's it. But what follows is critical so that you have to learn the essence of Islam, how to pray, to build up a community, to look around you where there are Muslims that you can hang out with to strengthen your Iman and knowledge and Allah knows best. you"
