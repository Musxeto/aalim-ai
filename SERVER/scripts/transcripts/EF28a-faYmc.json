  "transcript": "is from namira she says i know women aren't allowed to travel without a mahram does this also apply to girls below the age of puberty can a girl who's three or four years old travel with other women who have their mahrams with them but the girl isn't a mahram to any of the men the hadith that prohibits a woman from traveling stated that she's a woman and not a girl and the prophet said that it is not permissible for a woman who believes in allah in the day of judgement to travel without a mahram so a woman by definition is someone who has reached the age of puberty therefore a three or four year old child if it's safe and this is the most important uh condition even if she did not reach the age of puberty it has to be safe if it is safe she is with good companionship with other women who will take care of her she hasn't reached the age of puberty there's no problem in her traveling allah azzawajal knows best you"
