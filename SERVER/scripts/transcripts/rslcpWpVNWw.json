  "transcript": "Yunus from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question is that nowadays we see thousands of cases Sheikh where all over the world where Muslim women who does not want to seek khula according to Sharia rules and they run to the non-Muslim governing courts which are governed by liberal man-made laws and there she fights against her husband to seek alimony from him to herself, her family and also sometimes for her pets too. So what's the hukum on these women in the eyes of Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala? What Yunus is referring to is unfortunately prevailing in non-Muslim countries where women when seeking divorce from their husbands they do not follow Sharia though they have the option in the Islamic court rather they go to the civil court or the man-made law court where they would file for divorce knowing that these disbelievers would give her way more than her rights. So they would say half of the wealth of the husband goes to you, he has to give you x amount of alimony for the rest of your life, he has to do this, he has to do that and all of this is un-Islamic. Such women if they do this believing that such laws are superior to Sharia law, to the law of Allah or equivalent to it, they are kafir disbelievers and they leave the fold of Islam. According to the verses of the Qur'an in Suratul Ma'idah chapter 5 verse 44, 45 and 47 and if she believes that no no no no these courts have no superiority, have no legitimacy and I am just simply stealing this man's wealth. I hate him so much that I want to deprive him of his God-given rights and I'm taking his money unlawfully and I know what I'm doing is sinful all what she consumes is haram money, it will be burning her intestines in hellfire on the day of judgment and in her grave insha'Allah. Unfortunately I've done counseling sessions with hundreds of such women who claim to be Muslims from America, from Canada, from Europe and they insist I've spent 15-20 years with him and look at him now divorcing me or I don't want to live with him and he wants to enjoy his wealth and trade and companies, no I'm gonna sue his backside and this is haram money, it's unlawful, I don't care so unfortunately this is happening and this is why we say to those who are getting married in America or in Canada or in Europe to sign a prenup so that in the future may Allah forbid the same with men, I also had counseling sessions with so-called men who go to Islamic University in Medina and study and now they want to divorce their wives, they want their wives to pay for their uni fees and to pay for their apartment and for their new car, they're divorced and they bought Allah may postpone you for some time but when he strikes, he strikes with vengeance and wrath Azza wa Jal"
