  "transcript": "and we have namira from georgia um uh i read your uh one of the answers on one of your questions that um like the woman should cover her eyebrows so i'm not sure if this is like uh when is it like when you're going out or like in front of non maharam's or is it like also in prayer like is the eyebrows also covered up considered a part of your hair okay first of all the issue of covering your eyebrows was directed to nikabi women so definitely a woman who is wearing the niqab she must cover everything in her face except for her eyes to expose her eyebrows this is not permissible because it's part of her beauty in salat it's totally irrelevant because she's ordered to uncover her face as long as there are no nan men around her so her hands and her face are to be uncovered in salat which includes of course her eyebrows so i hope this answers your question namira that this was related to wearing the kneecab that a woman must cover everything in her face on her face especially her eyebrows her nose her cheekbones etc and only leave an opening for her eyes you"
