  "title": "Can a person who gets wounded in war refuse medicine so he can die as a martyr?",
  "transcript": "Ahmed, from Egypt, says; 'If a person gets wounded   in war, on the battlefield, and he refuses to \ntake medication, hoping to die as a martyr,   would that be permissible?' First of \nall, a martyr is a person who dies on   the battlefield. So if a person was \ninjured, and then was taken to a hospital,   and stayed in a hospital for a week or so and \nthen died, he's not considered to be a martyr.   And, of course, at the side of \nAllah, He has great reward but,   not a martyr who would not be washed or shrouded \nexcept in his clothes and he would be buried. That   is a person who died on the battlefield. Secondly, \nseeking medication when a person is ill and needs   medication. We've gone through that and said \nthat, if taking medication would save him,   or improve his case, then it is a must. And if he \ndoesn't and dies, then he has thrown himself into   harm's way. You know that taking this medication \nwould save your life, but you insist not on   taking it until you die, that would be similar to \nsuicide. But if the doctors say, 'This medication   has side effects and we can't guarantee that \nit will save you or improve your life, maybe,   maybe 50/50', then this is up to your preference. \nAnd if they say, 'Well, 70% most likely it won't   help you, 30% there's a chance and you don't take \nit because of that, that's a good thing because   you're trusting Allah, Azza wa Jal, and putting \nyour full trust in Him. 70% not beneficial is   nothing to be blamed for. Because the \npercentage is very low. 30% of recovery   is very low. I'd rather take my chances \non trusting Allah. And Allah knows best."
