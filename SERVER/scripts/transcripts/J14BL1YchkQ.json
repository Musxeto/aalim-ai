  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India okay here so Sheikh \nmy question is before I studied Aqeedah I   used to believe that self-amazement is halal \nand that the credit of my good deed goes to   me why should we love Prophet Muhammad (Peace \nand Blessings Upon Him) if all the credit of   his Good Deeds Goes to Allah our Good Deeds \nare gifts from Allah all the good deeds of   Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings Upon Him) \nwere gifted to him by Allah so if Allah is the   one who gifted him why should we love Muhammad \n(Peace and Blessings Upon Him) shouldn't we love   Allah instead of loving him if Allah tells \nyou to love him what are you going to say   I have to obey him so what this question is a \nclear manifestation of how shaytan is messing up   with your head and if you're studying Aqeedah and \nyou come up with such a question you are studying   something wrong or you're selling out on your own \nnot with not with Scholars this is dangerous if   it takes you to this level Allah tells you to love \nMuhammad (Peace and Blessings Upon Him) and Allah   tells you if you don't love Muhammad (Peace and \nBlessings Upon Him) you will not enter Jannah and   it is one of the pillars of Islam to believe that \nProphet (Peace and Blessings Upon Him) is Allah's   messenger and servant and this entails that you \nbelieve him in whatever he tells and that you   refrain from whatever he tells you to refrain \nand to do whatever he ordered you to do and not   to worship Allah except with what he had ordered \nyou to do and if you don't love him then you will   not be a believer as the prophet said no one will \nbecome a Believer until I that is Prophet Muhammad   is more beloved to him than his wife his \nparents his family his wealth and himself   so this is the essence of Islam to love \nAllah azzawajal and to love those whom   Allah told you to love and on the top of the list \nis Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings Upon Him)"
