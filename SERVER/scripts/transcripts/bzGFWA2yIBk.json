  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I just wanted to know what could be the causes for someone who is usually consistent with the Al-Fajr prayer to occasionally miss it? Because sometimes I really unintentionally miss it when the alarm rings, I turn it off, like intending to wake up a few minutes later but the time when I actually wake up, the sun has already risen or it's raising. So in this situation, what should I do? Like, what are the causes that I sometimes miss my prayer? Jazak Allah Khairan Wa Jazakum. First of all, Alhamdulillah Azza Wa Jal that Allah has guided us to observe these beautiful rituals and forms of worship. Secondly, Allah is the Most Merciful, Most Forgiving. He has pardoned us when we do things out of forgetfulness or due to unforced reasons. The Prophet said, the pen of accountability has been uplifted, meaning that there are no sins registered upon three people. An insane until he regains his sanity, a child until he reaches the age of puberty, and a sleeping person until he wakes up. So as per the Hadith, there is no negligence or mishandling of things when a person is asleep because he's not accountable. The negligence and the mishandling of things is when a person is awake. Allah will not hold you accountable for not waking up because you set the alarm, you tried your level best. Allah will hold you accountable for the four hours prior to that which you were supposed to be asleep so that you would be able to wake up. Thirdly, the Prophet himself, alayhi salatu wasalam, along with all of his companions, missed Fajr once until the sun was in the middle of the sky. They were on an expedition and they were so tired and beaten up, they set the camp and they went to sleep. The Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, appointed Bilal ibn Rabah, may Allah be pleased with him, his muezzin. And he said to him, wake us up for Fajr. Bilal sat down for the watch, put his back to a camel that was sitting behind him and while he was doing this, boom, he fell asleep. And he only woke up when the Prophet was standing on top of him saying, Bilal, look at the sun. Why didn't you wake up us? Wake us up. Bilal said, oh Prophet of Allah, by Allah, the one who made you sleep made me sleep. So there is no sin in that. But Salat, no problem. I don't care. But working hours, no, they'll deduct from my salary. The teacher would deduct marks of attendance. This is the biggest problem and Allah knows best."
