  "transcript": "Ayaan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. What should be our stance on the clock tower in Mecca? As I hear people say that it's wrong how it's like taller than the Haram. And that being said, would it be like permissible to like stay there like as a hotel stay? Whoever says such a thing is an ignorant imbecile. What do you mean? With their analogy, you can't pray in the second floor of the Haram, in the same masjid, because you'll be overlooking the Ka'bah. This is, with all due respect, utterly stupid and dumb. They can't afford to stay there, or they don't want to stay there, and they just criticize people who want to go and have Umrah and peace. Akhi, go and stay in the highest level, and enjoy the view, and enjoy your stay, and enjoy your ibadah, and ignore the ignorance."
