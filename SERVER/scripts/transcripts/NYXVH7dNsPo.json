  "transcript": "are from turkey i want to know if if you are playing if you are praying behind the imam and he has like different footballs like for example when you risen from the pool if you fold our hands or leave them should we like follow the imam in every messiah even though we disagree with him okay i will answer inshallah araf from turkey says when we pray behind the imam and the imam leaves a number of sunnah acts due to his school of thought so for example he only says allahu akbar raising his hands in the beginning but when he bows and he rises from bowing and when he stands from the first the shah to the third raka he doesn't raise his hands if he puts his hands below his belly or he leaves it to his sides are we obliged to follow him because the hadith that the imam was made to be followed the answer is no you follow the imam in what is a pillar of salat or something that is mandatory other than that the sunnah acts and and verbal things that he says if he doesn't follow the sunnah he's not sinful and his prayer is valid but there is nothing wrong on you following the sunnah to gain more reward than allah azzawajal knows best you"
