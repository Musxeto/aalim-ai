  "transcript": "Omar from Australia? Omar from Sudan. From Sudan. Yes Omar, what can I do for you? So Sheikh, so for you know like stores like for example like Walmart and Five Below, so if someone like stole something from them like three, five years ago and he wants to like go back and pay it and he's and he lives in like a country and he's scared that if he's like tell them they might arrest him. Can he like tell one of the employees like that he seems like he will not get him in trouble and he was watching him put the money in the cashier like like in like where the money is supposed to be because if he tells the manager, the manager might like call the cops and then he can like get in trouble. Can he like do something like that? Jazakallah Khairan. If a person steals money from a store, he had committed a major sin in Islam, whether the owner is a Kafir or a Muslim. Stealing is totally prohibited from any other denomination so it doesn't matter who you're stealing it from. You have to repent, ask Allah for forgiveness, show and express sincere remorse and intend not to do this sin again and you have to return what you stole or the value of it to its lawful owner. If this is not possible because you don't know the owner or you're afraid that if you do so it would put you in trouble or maybe they may arrest you for it, in this case take the money and spend it in means of charity for Muslim poor or needy with the intention of cleansing your wealth and Allah knows best."
