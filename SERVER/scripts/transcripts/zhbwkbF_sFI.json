  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK if you were ignorant \nand you stole like a Haram item from a person   but you repented do you still have \nto con compensate with like charity   first of all when you steal \nsomething from an individual this is a stolen property \nyou took from me this mug   whatever you've done with it you broke it \nyou sold it you used it you still have it   my possessions are missing so you cannot \nrepent without giving this item back to me or   the equivalence of its actual cost why because \nyou've taken something from me and you owe me   and the Prophet (Peace and Blessings Upon \nhim) said who had ever taken something   or done something to his brother in \nthis Dunya he has to clear that with him   in this Dunya before the day of judgment because \non the day of judgment there is no Dirham or dinar   there is no dollar or Sterling pound there is \nonly good deeds and bad Deeds which means that   if you failed in compensating me for what you had \nstolen from me I'll take from your good deeds on   the day of judgment if you don't have any good \ndeeds I'll give you some of my sins and put it on   you so that you would be punished instead of me \nfor those sins therefore you have to compensate   the person you stole the property from I don't \nhave money I don't know where the person is   I know if I do such a thing I'll be putting cups \nin cuffs and and they'll throw me in jail okay   there is a greater harm in this case you have to \ntake the equivalence of the cost of this mug and   give it to the poor and needy Muslims as a form of \ncleansing your wealth and on behalf of that person   hoping that on the day of judgment he \nwould approve of such charity and accept it   otherwise may Allah azzawajal make him pleased \nand compensate him with whatever he would   make him forgive your crime on the day of judgment \nbut these are the only two choices you have foreign"
