  "title": "Does leather have to be halal? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdul Malik says does the leather that one wears belts purses shoes does this leather have to be slaughtered in order to be halal do the same conditions of slaughtering as for meat that is eaten have to be fulfilled and if so what about if somebody does not know whether the animal was slaughtered in a halal way or not keeping in mind that nowadays in non-muslim countries this is mostly not the case well first of all in terms of leather that we buy on the market the Haram things for us to wear if it's swine or pig skin or of animals that are not permissible for us to eat such as lions tigers snakes all of this is totally Haram this is beside the point and we have a category which is camels cows which is the majority beef or cow and sheep now these we can eat if we slaughter and by default when we slaughter them in Holloway the skin the leather is Helen the difference of opinion among scholars is if there were a cow dead by itself it got a heart attack or even worse a corona covered 19 may Allah protect us and it died can we use the skin the leather or because it's dead meat we have to throw it all in the garbage the answer is the most authentic opinion is that the meat of animals that we are allowed to eat we are entitled to use the skin the leather of a dead animal only if the tanning is a process where you put special herbs and implants and ingredients to remove the fat and the smelly part of it so the vast majority of leathers on the market has been tanned so if it's made from cow camel or sheep skin then you can wear it and the default is that it is permissible to wear until proven otherwise and Allah knows best"
