  "transcript": "Ahmed from Pakistan Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I have a question Good for you. Okay. So in my country In my country there is a company named PTA which controls the Telecommunication for mobile network every mobile have a specific IMEI number. So they control this IMEI number Okay, so whenever you buy a Mobile phone from Pakistan. It is officially approved and you can use it for the rest Until it dies. Okay, if you buy that Any other device from any other country and you get back to Pakistan you have to pay tax they will Allow you to use the same card for two months, but after that they will block it I don't know why but one of my friend used to change the IMEI from an Approved phone to a blocked phone. So it is like Deceiving the system so it is okay for him to do. First of all, what is Being provided to you is a service from this company So this is a service provider and what you have with them is a contract They're not obliged to give you this service and You're not obliged to take the service from them. It is something that you pay for Now if you're refusing to pay What they ask you for the service and you bypass this and try to cheat them. This is haram It's okay Sheikh, but they're forcing us to buy the devices from them and they force us to do this. This is extortion does it? Don't buy from them go to another service provider. There isn't any service other service provider Don't use their services. I need a phone Sheikh Well, you have to then comply with the conditions they have set or otherwise you'll be cheating"
