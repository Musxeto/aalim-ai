  "transcript": "uh how to clean medi from private part and clothes sprinkle water it's an issue of dispute and the scholars differed because there are narrations that use the word and has two meanings sprinkle the other meaning is to wash and the most authentic opinion is that the impurity of methi which is a prosthetic fluid that usually is emitted when there's foreplay or when sexual desires are aroused the most authentic opinion is that maddie's impurity is a lower grade than normal impurities such as urine and the likes and this is why the hadith states that take a handful of water and sprinkle it over or put it over the area and that's sufficient while washing requires rubbing and putting water on it and washing it and this is not required with medi and allah's best you"
