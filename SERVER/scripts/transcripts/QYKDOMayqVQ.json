  "title": "Naming Children After Surah Names Permissible? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh er fan from the uk uh i was reading uh one of the photos online by edna um which he advised against uh keeping the name of your children on suraj names especially the full khan and one of your video i saw a couple of weeks ago uh you did you actually also uh advise against keeping a name of children on sunnah's name like chasing poha i just need to ask does that apply on a name called for khan as well because fur khan is also a super says i've heard you saying that yes these are the names of surahs and it's not recommended to call our children with it i said these are not the names of the prophet so thinking that yasin is a blessed name or paaha is a blessed name because it's the name of the prophet this is not authentic this is not true at all but if someone wants to call his child nur and we have suratu nur there's no problem in that if someone wants to call his child maryam and we have maryam we have al-imran there's no problem in that and likewise furqan has no problem inshaallah in it"
