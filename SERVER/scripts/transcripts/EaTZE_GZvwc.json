  "transcript": "consider subscribing from qatar so my question is that uh does playing with the intention of it at the time of duha fulfill the obligation of like of of giving a charity for every limb in the body okay so far is referring to a hadith where the prophet salallahu said that any day the sun rises there is a charity upon each and every bone on a man's body which is approximately if i recall correctly 360 joints or bones and saying a good word is a charity helping your brother in need is a charity filling the um the bucket with water of your brother is a charity uh giving um enjoining virtue and righteousness and forbidden evil is a charity etc and something that sums all these things up is praying to raka of duha and if you do pray these two raka's you have sufficed your obligation of such daily charities so to answer your question is yes two raka's of doha suffices from offering these charities of over these 360 joints of your body and it does the job in sha allah you"
