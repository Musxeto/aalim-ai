  "transcript": "a sad man from bangladesh says what's the ruling on working for an advertisement company that has mixed halal and haram works and projects the answer is it depends on your job description so if the vast majority of the income of this advertisement company is haram you're not allowed you're not entitled it's not permissible at all for you to work there if the majority of the project so it's 90 percent haram in 10 halal but if it is 50 50 or less and you only work on halal activities and projects there's nothing wrong in that insha allah azza wajal and you try your level best to look for something that is totally halal i believe that all countries including bangladesh have a lot of keen muslims who are trying their level best to make halal money and that would never ever indulge in such haram activities look for them they might be rare but you'll find them insha'allah"
