  "title": "What is better, Women Praying in the Haram or the Hotel when coming for Hajj?",
  "transcript": "I want to know which place would bring me more rewards for praying or obligatory prayers uh is it haram or my hotel room told us that praying in your home which is at the moment your hotel room is more rewarding than praying in the Haram now logically most women and men would think that come on the prophet said I pray it in the Haram is equivalent to a hundred thousand and you want me to pray in my hotel room I said I don't want you to pray in your hotel room this is what the prophet said to one of his female companions who said o prophet of Allah I love to pray with you in the Masjid of Medina where the single prayer there is equivalent to 100 to a thousand prayers elsewhere other than Mecca Haram so the prophet said I know you love to pray with me but praying home is better than praying with me in the Masjid and that the prophet continued to emphasize this fact in a long Hadith praying home is better so it depends you want the reward pray in your hotel room you don't feel like praying in your hotel room you want to pray in the Masjid be my guest the prophet did not prevent Italian he simply directed us to what is more rewarding and better you want to choose that welcome if you don't this is up to you you haven't done a sin inshallah"
