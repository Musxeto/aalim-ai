  "transcript": "first one is from amrin says there is a man from India who has started walking to Hajj and his mission is to reach Saudi by next Hajj is this permissible the answer is this is not part of the Sunnah and this is a misconception that a lot of the Muslims fall under when they think that the more hardship you inflict upon yourself the better it is for you at the sight of Allah which is not true when the hardship is a result of your worship inflicted upon you not by choice you are rewarded someone traveling to Hajj and on his airplane or the bus or whatever means of transportation is using he falls sick he gets a fever he is really tired and finding it hard he's rewarded someone by his own intention willingly instead of sitting under the shade or under an umbrella he goes in a convertible or decides not to have anything on top of his head exposed to the Sun the whole day time he's sinful the prophet saws a man walking barely being carried by two of his sons but still insisting to walk and the prophet said to his companions Allah is not in Need for this man to torture himself and he said to him right and don't walk Allah doesn't want you to torment yourself and he also heard of a man who to can a vow to not ride and walk instead for Hajj or for umrah and the prophet said Allah to him or to some other woman I forgot he said order them to write and not to walk and not to fulfill such a vow because this is not a vow in worshiping Allah azzawajal Allah doesn't want to burden us but if you're walking on your normal rituals and you find difficulty alhamdulillah but if you had the means to sit in an air-conditioned tent or a room and you say to yourself no this is too luxurious I'd like to sit in the heat under the sun this is not something that you will be rewarded for"
