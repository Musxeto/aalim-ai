  "title": "Do we need to stay in the same position after prayer, or just the same spot, to get the reward",
  "transcript": "from Bangladesh. We know that we are rewarded for remaining in the prayer as long as we do our atkar sitting in the place we offered salah. So my question is do we have to remain in the same position we finished our prayer in? For example, if I finish four ragas of duh and I'm sitting in the position of tower, do I have to do my atkar remaining in the position of tower? The most authentic opinion that I believe in is that you don't have to remain in the same sitting position. You can sit in any different way you wish. Other scholars even say that as long as you are in the vicinity of the masjid, even if you go from the first row and sit at the uh back of the masjid on a chair, then you're still are in salat and allahel knows best."
