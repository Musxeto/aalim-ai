  "title": "Gatherings in which people sit & complain about a the Non Muslim Government | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question was about people living in an unlimited as a complain about the government the government the president the Prime Minister the whole nine yards they're all non-muslims so he says that they complain and they start to discuss things and he says that inshallah everything will be fine we have to do whatever we can do to continue looking for the welfare of our people or families and and our careers etc so it's saying that is this the right approach or should I join them in complaining ah he putting hurdles and complaining would not take you anywhere now you have a situation and in this situation you have a number of choices and you have to list these choices what should we do should we riot should we overthrow the government should we take up arms should we be submissive and just go into our holes and cover ourselves with blankets and until we die should we live our lives and do whatever we can do all of these are different choices and the best of them is that you are a minority and you have to live exactly as the prophet sallallaahu hari salem lived in mecca with his companions so for 13 years they were forbidden from raising the sword and picking up a fight not even that they were prohibited from defending themselves and this shows you the wisdom of this Dawa because had they not followed this procedure the idol worshipers would have annihilated them and killed them all they were only a handful of them but Allah told them not to take up arms and to fight back so you as a minority you have to think positive instead of wasting time talking about the government its corruption its hatred to Islam and the Muslims what does this add value to you as Muslims instead talk about something that would make the Muslim progress make them evolve and become more developed through education through business through coming together living in the same neighborhoods holding one's other's back so that by this you would inshallah it be able to progress and what you're saying is true there is no other alternative logically nor Islamically but to live your life to take care of your kids of your neighbors of your Muslim brothers and sisters and to try to help one another in order to ensure Allah prevail"
