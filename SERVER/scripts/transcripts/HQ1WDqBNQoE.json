  "transcript": "authentic and profit often follow it so it is not better if we follow only this law uh other than subhanallah since warner brothers no it is not permissible for you muhammad to say this dua without saying subhanallah in subhana rabbil ala in sujud because this is the minimal requirement you should say once at least subhan rabi al-imr and then you should say whatever duas like the dua of mother aisha when the prophet used to uh recite it after the surat and nasser was revealed to him he's doing a an interpretation of the quran by saying that in his record but you cannot say any other dua before saying subhana rabbi wabi hamdi once and allah azza knows best you"
