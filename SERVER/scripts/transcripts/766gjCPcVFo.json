  "transcript": "basically i'm a young person who is trying to find work and basically it's very difficult to find the pure hello world working in the west and for example let's say um work in a warehouse you might have to pick um hard stuff or grocery method um had on food and drinks or shops had on clothing wallpapers containing image images and and all the rest and i would like to know um what's the um islamic ruling in these circumstances okay from the uk he says nowadays it's difficult to find halal jobs in the uk this is part of the mind games that shaytan does on us putting hurdles in front of you is an easy game that everyone can play so if i don't want to study oh i don't want to study because they might teach us in biology uh the darwin evolution theory and in geology this and that and they may use some kuffer statements and english literature they may talk about the greek gods and in mathematics the secular atheist teacher may say that infinity is this and that and so don't study what to do go work or if i work i may see and look at women i may be exposed to haram i may see something with an image i cannot sell i cannot work in a warehouse everything is niges everything is haram so what do you want to do commit suicide okay this is not islam these people who put hurdles obstacles and try to stop life from moving on they're not related to islam islam is a religion of ease and allah has made it easy for any person to be a muslim whether you are in saudi arabia whether you're in europe whether you are in siberia whether you are in the eskimo it is easy for you as a muslim to practice your religion without any problem whenever there's a will there is always a way there are means that you can work in halal if you work in a warehouse most of the people who work in warehouses don't know what is in the packaging so there's no problem for you to carry it if i'm a mailman and i have packages to deliver i don't know what's inside whether it's wine or halal food but the default is it's halal why should i assume the opposite so there are so many things you can do you cannot just simply put obstacles apply for a job if you find something haram try to avoid it try to communicate with the management that i can't work at that specific place but work show them that you are a hard worker that they can depend and rely on you and that you have limits people like this even the disbelievers they like when you have things to be committed to and that you have red lines you cannot cross"
