  "transcript": "okay my question is I wanted an explanation on his utter prayer I made it for someone I wanted to marry and The Times showed that maybe it wasn't the best for me but I haven't felt content about that after I need the prayer so how I should proceed following this I would like your advice on that okay and so Hyatt from SEO Pia is asking about istikhara one of the greatest misconception among people among Muslims is that when they praise Tijara they anticipate a dream or a sign from Allah Azza WA JAL and this is not related to stay harem esta hora is to make your due diligence to investigate to start firmly thinking that this opinion this option is the best of all other options so you opt for it you select it now I praise the Hara Torah cos I make the door allahumma inni Esther here o Kabir olymic I seek your choice through your knowledge and you say the drug and you move on you proceed now if there is good in it for you because you chose this and you went ahead with it after praying is the Hara Allah will facilitate it and what happen if and if there's nothing good in it for you Allah would make it difficult and then you'll be turned off and you'll choose something else so it is not a sign that you see or seek it's not a dead cat that you find out your doorsteps or a wedding that passes and makes everything happy for you and for your family it is to go ahead with this marriage if you did your due diligence if you checked on the boy his righteous is practicing his moral conduct is good he has a good job and actually he's stable his family is okay you have a separate home of your own you're not to live with your in-laws what more do you want he's a good person go ahead for it what about this feeling that I'm having what about this chest that I feel that it is getting tighter and tighter this is from j-pod this is from Shaitaan because this is a good proposal and you both will be or will do become a good couple but if there's something else that came up after Sahara like the guy smokes or the guy is insincere or he flirts with women or he has rage fits or he's stingy these are all part of the signs that may help you reject such a proposal and Lazo knows best"
