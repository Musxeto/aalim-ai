  "transcript": "and his third question Navid their thirst question those who died in wars are they martyrs well the Prophet Allison was asked a similar question once said Oh prophet of Allah a man dies due to pride a man dies in pursue of wealth a man dies so that people would praise him for being brave who among them is a martyr the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever dies in the cause of Allah to make a large word the highest so whoever dies for Islam to prevail whoever dies to protect the religion of Allah Azza WA JAL he's a martyr so for example if there is a war between a country trying to split up four and each party is fighting for independence or to regain control over the other area so they're fighting for the land for the dirt for the rocks for the houses not for the religion of allah azza wajal their death is not martyrdom and it's in vain and Allah knows best Sidra says I heard your previous post that all sea animals are halal so my question is sea animals also include shark and whale how could they be halal as they eat humans the ayah in the Quran clearly states that anything that lives in water is halal for us to consume the exception would be if it's something harmful so if there is an animal or a fish that if I eat it I get poisoned poisoned and I know this then in this case it cannot be consumed why it falls under the new guidelines because of other general guidelines the Prophet said I am now da da da da da da and Allah said do not throw yourself in harm's way do not kill yourselves and the Prophet said lebara there is no harm to be inflicted by me or to be inflicted by others upon me anything that does this is hallam so sharks whales and the likes are halong even if they consume humans which is rare but they consume other animals and they consume anything that has flesh in it I was a Adel hooded in Allah be pleased with him tells us in the hadith in sahih bukhari and elsewhere that they found a huge whale dead on the beach so they ate from its meat for a whole month and he described this huge whale in a way that is quite strange and shocking but it shows you that whales were eaten at the time of the Prophet Isis am so all types of animals of fish that lives in the sea and cannot live elsewhere they can be eaten regardless of what they consume and Allah knows best"
