  "title": "Uncle took my inheritance unjustly, how to maintain kinship? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Maintain ties, but take him to court. Yakhid, don't mix apples with oranges. Your uncle is a liar, he deceits, he forged paper to take the inheritance of your father from his father so that to deprive you and plot it to do this. I get this every day from some subcontinent, I will not call the name. Every day I have tens of problems and counseling sessions and sitting and yakhid, I don't know if it's in the DNA or what. They love money, subhanAllah, and they don't fear the grave, they don't fear the hereafter. Some of them, they have problems and the minute they sit with me and I just speak about the grave, they retreat and they feel their mistake and they give back. Others would come into your eyes, poke them, no, let them do whatever they want. So don't mix apples with oranges, they made a mistake, don't kill them. You have a mosquito in the room, it's a mosquito DNA different with a fly, so they mixed up. I don't know, hybrid maybe. You want to kill it, it's bothering you, you use a cannon, you're going to kill it and everyone else in the room and the whole house. This is an overkill. Treat them in proportional to their crime. So yes, don't be best friends with them and go to their house every week and dine with them, but don't cut them off, they're still your kinship. Take them to court, take them to the police, everything is legal and still call them, how are you uncle, I hope you're fine, everything business as usual. If they boycott you and you try your level best, this is their sin, not yours."
