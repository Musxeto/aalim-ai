  "title": "Affiliate Marketing referring to Websites With Pictures of Women?",
  "transcript": "Arafat from Bangladesh. I publish product reviews of other online sellers. You publish product reviews of other online sellers, okay. And this is lie or truth? No, no, no, honesty. Good. So? So the question is the online sellers sometimes use images of girls who still haven't attained puberty and sometimes use videos of women playing with their children. So can I promote those websites? And another question is can Iâ€¦ No, no, no, you can only ask one question. Now in the first question you asked which is what's the ruling on affiliate marketing? What you're doing is advertising for these websites. So if you're writing reviews of for example xyz.com for products of children, and you say that the products are good, the baby oil is fine, the formula milk is healthy, these are the reviews of the doctors, this is halal. However, if you give reference to a particular website and the people visited because you wrote a review of it, and on their website there are many haram things, this is not permissible because you're endorsing them. If you're just writing an article and you're not being paid for it, you're just saying that this xyz product is good and it's best value for your money. Without endorsing it, without making or steering the public to their website and to watch haram things, there is nothing wrong in that, inshallahu azza wa jal."
