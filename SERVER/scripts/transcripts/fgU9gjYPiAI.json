  "title": "Is Not Calling a Kafir, KUFR, WHEN can we make Takfeer on Others? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Lasha from Georgia. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam. Sheikh I have question for for many years this question and we know that if Muslim does not make Takfir on Kafir he becomes Kafir but when does this happen? Who said so? Who said so Lasha? Who said so? We know this from Nabiullah. I don't understand. I don't hear you. We know this from nullifiers of Islam. Okay the 10 nullifiers of Islam is not Quran or Sunnah. It is Ijtihad from scholars. So not every statement we take we just label people or stick it on people and have conclusions and you think that it's like a house of cards that we take one everything collapses. No there are conditions there are obstacles but what is your question? My question is when should we make Takfir? Wait you don't. First of all you don't make Takfir. It's not your job. Allah did not send you to judge people. Oh this guy is Kafir. This guy is hmm let me see uh maybe I should give him a test. No someone who says he's not a Muslim. I don't have to be a rocket scientist. You're not a Muslim. You're a Kafir. Full stop. So there is no ambiguity. Hi. Hello. What's your religion? I am XYZ. Oh you're not a Muslim. No. Okay thank you. He's a Kafir. No doubt in that. None whatsoever. Now someone who is a Muslim or says ash-hadu illa ilaha illallah ash-hadu inna muhammadan rasoolullah. You cannot give Takfir without fulfilling the conditions that he nullified Islam because he did one two three four and the conditions of knowledge, choice, no misinterpretation or ambiguity, no confusion are there. It's fulfilled. The guy committed Kufr wholeheartedly and knowingly. Then you can after ensuring that there are no obstacles and the scholars say yes this guy is a Kafir. But generally speaking I'm in a non-Muslim country. The inhabitants of that non-Muslim country are either Christians, Jews, Atheists. They're not Muslims. And I meet Tom, Dick or Harry. G'day. G'day. Or bonjour. Bonsoir. Whatever. They are not Muslims. I do not doubt maybe. No no. The default is that they're Kafir. I go to a Muslim country. I go to Pakistan. I go to Indonesia. I go to Turkey. Hi. Hi. What's your name? My name is Muhammad Abdullah. The default is Muslim. I don't have to give him a quiz to make sure that maybe he's a grave worshipper. Maybe he has problems with Aqeedah. Maybe he's. No no. The default is he's a Muslim until proven otherwise. So I hope this makes sense."
