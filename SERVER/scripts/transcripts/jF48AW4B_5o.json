  "title": "Joined Imam in 2nd rakat but accidently concluded with the Imam ðŸ˜“ assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Anas from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So I joined the imam at the congregation at the second raka'ah and forgetfully concluded it with him then remembered and completed the last raka'ah. I did not know when to make sujood so I made it after salam. So would my salat be valid and if that case ever happened again when should I have made sujood? Jazak Allah Khair. Anas what you've done was the right thing because your prayer the obligations and the pillars are full are good. The only thing that was extra is following the imam in the salam. So when you offered salam you added something to your prayer. You should have stood up but you've added something. Because you added something you should prostrate for sujood al sahoo or the prostration of forgetfulness. After you conclude your prayer and offer your salam you offer two sujoods and then you offer another salam. So what you've done was the right thing."
