  "title": "Sat in masjid after Fajr for reward  someone disributed food from bidah event, impact reward?",
  "transcript": "Fahim from India. If we are sitting after Fajr till the sunrise or we are sitting in Ribaat, if someone offers a food or snack, it so happen that in our locality if someone dies and when it reach one year they stay to the Imam to make Dua, so after that there will be a snack, so if I eat that will it break my reward? If they are collaborating and joining in the Masjid on such a snack which is commemorating a deceased who died a year earlier, this is totally prohibited for you to participate or to eat from it, because this is collaborating on evil and vice, but if you are sitting there and someone randomly comes and gives you food, this does not invalidate your sitting after Fajr till sunrise or your Dhikr and you can accept such a thing, but it is not permissible to participate and collaborate upon innovation and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
