  "transcript": "so my question is about uh something that you know i've noticed you know um with regards to the to the prayer you know i've noticed that recently uh it's taking me a bit longer to pray and of course i understand the virtue of of taking time with the prayer and i'm not placing myself but i've noticed that even with like others in the congregation and stuff when i'm in when i'm in the masjid like even like others are praying quicker than me and it's taking me a bit longer to do the third time like say everything in the summer because i i don't know i might be repeating a number of times because i feel like you know um i feel like you know i might be making mistakes okay okay i will answer inshallah abdul aziz from the uk he says he discovered that he prolongs the salat more than normal and sometimes even a congregation he finds himself late what to do this is an ocd symptom this is a problem that you have to fix and rectify before it's too late before it destroys your whole life now you ask your question you ask yourself a number of questions do i know better than the prophet haslam and the companions definitely not did they do this no okay do i know more than the 2 billion muslims living on earth today no how come people in malaysia people in bangladesh who are not arabs and they recite the fact normally in like 15 seconds and they pray without any problem because it's all in your mind shaytaan is messing up with you he's trying to make life difficult so number one ignore don't repeat number two try to practice outside of the salat so recite the fatiha if you're having problems in it a thousand times a day i bet you halal betting in couple of days or three days you will be perfect in pronouncing it correctly and you will not have these whispers anymore"
