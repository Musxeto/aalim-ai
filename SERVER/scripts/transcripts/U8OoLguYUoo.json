  "title": "Smiling is recommended in Islam assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "That was his nature, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. And he himself advised us that do not look down at any type of goodness you can do or belittle it even if you merely meet your brother with a smiling face. And he said that smiling in the face of your brother is a charity. And his description in the old scriptures that he was prolonging his silence, he doesn't talk a lot and that he would laugh little. So laughter a lot is something that is abhorred in Islam and some of it is recommended in Islam. So smiling which is just the opening of the mouth without any sound and this is the minimum amount of laughter, this is the best and it is desired and recommended in Islam. As Allah mentioned about Prophet Sulaiman Alayhi Salatu Wassalam in the Qur'an when he heard the aunt advising the other aunts. So the aunt is advising other aunts that go to your holes so that Sulaiman and his troops would not step on you without them noticing you. Allah says, He smiled in a gesture of joy or laughter from what she had said. And the Prophet's laughter was like that. He would not open his mouth and fall on his back and make this big sound of laughter like people of ignorance do. That wasn't his style Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. His laughter was just a gesture."
