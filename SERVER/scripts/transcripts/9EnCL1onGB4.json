  "title": "4 Year Old Twins, One Good, One Bad, Bad one wants more attention even though sheâ€™s BAD, what to do?",
  "transcript": "Yumna from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. I want to ask, I have twin daughters, Abiha and Manal. The one is more obedient and always listens she wants extra love from me but still she is stubborn. How to deal with stubborn? How old? They are four years old. Okay, first of all, you have to fear Allah Azza Wa Jal. A four-year-old child is not a rocket scientist or a nuclear physicist. It's a four-year-old child with a four-year-old child's brain. So you have to cater for her feelings, emotions and look at your own hands. None of your fingers are alike. They're not in the same length. So you can't treat both of them just because they're twins in the same identical way. Now there has to be jealousy especially when they see you treat them differently. So you have to add more compassion and love, unconditional love to the stubborn one to show her that beside all what she's doing you still love her and care for her but when she makes a mistake she has to be reprimanded and she has to pay the price so that she would learn. Not that you deal with the good one and the bad one alike regardless of their mistakes. So you have to be diplomatic, you have to be compassionate and caring and loving to both of them and be patient because four years old, it's still a child. Doesn't know what's right and what's wrong. It needs to be conditioned, to be trained, to be taught how to behave. And this may take five, six more years but it would pay off sweetly insha'Allah azza wa jal. If you decide, no I am fed up, I've had enough, I'm going to treat her as a a spoiled, undisciplined child and the other one I'm going to give her love and care, you are destroying her totally and she will grow up to hate everyone around her and to be rebellious all the time and it's your fault. May Allah azza wa jal protect us all."
