  "transcript": "I had a question regarding if a \nparent is not necessarily discouraging but they're pushing you to not wear the Niqab. They're not letting you wear the Niqab \nat all costs and they've removed you from being able to wear gloves and they're telling \nyou to wear the Hijab or at least a [ ] dress. Are you sinful if you were to listen? Okay, so this is commonly happening \nunfortunately in some households. The parents do not believe in niqab and do \nnot endorse their daughters wearing the gloves and sometimes they fight and intimidate \nand threaten. So what is to be done? This is not a one-size-fits-all. A girl has \nto look seriously into the consequences. The general idea is there is no obedience \nto anyone in disobeying Allah, end of story. If they tell you to wear \nmini skirts is this halal? You would say \"Oh no way I'm not going to do this \neven if they slaughter me\" (Figure of Speech) Good, what about maxis? No, \nI will not expose my feet. What about short sleeves, no \nhalf sleeves maybe to here. So what's the red line that \nyou would say 'yes' or 'no'? It's the Sharia'h, it's not \nbased on my whims and desires so if your conviction is that wearing the niqab \nis mandatory which is the most authentic opinion and covering the hands whether with gloves or \nwith your Abayah is the most authentic opinion then you have to follow that. Let's look into the consequences, if your father \nis a tyrant, he's a nutcase, he's a lunatic. He would probably harm you or probably do \nsomething that's illegal or inflict damage. In this case, you're oppressed and you're \ncompelled to obey within the limits up to necessity. So yes I may have to take \noff my niqab if I'm with him   but if I'm going to school \nor to work or somewhere else and he's not with me I fully cover so I have to \nreduce the damage to the best amount possible. If he's just saying things without carrying \nthem through, dogs that bark don't bite So you should not be intimidated and \nyou should try to remain steadfast and holding your grounds and \nmay Allah make things easy."
