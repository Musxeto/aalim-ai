  "title": "Can we enjoy Fireworks, Lights & Decor of Non-Muslim Holidays? Can we take advantage of sales?",
  "transcript": "can Muslims enjoy the non-muslims festival season like going to malls enjoying lightining decorations and the festival season only enjoy festival season decor yeni mainly speaking this is not permissible now I know you're not celebrating Christmas you're just enjoying a Christmas tree I know you don't sit on Santa's lap but you enjoy watching the kids do that and the distribution of candies I know you don't go to the church or to enjoy the meal on Christmas but still you are favoring and admiring the fireworks this by itself leads to in free arity complex the Muslims tend to feel inferior tend to feel less than all these guys who are enjoying their time and having fun and your children would be drastically affected by it and this is not a very healthy thing to do or to have so it is best for you to go on Islamic retreat for example if the Muslim Islamic centers have Muslims retreat where they go you know somewhere nice and pleasant among the community among the Muslims having lectures enjoying their time maybe horse riding etc this is far greater than staying where you are and feeling sorry you don't have things like this or wanting to contribute and to participate and Allah so gel knows best going to malls to eat on the vacation to holidays going to buy things on sale this is all totally permissible there's nothing wrong in that"
