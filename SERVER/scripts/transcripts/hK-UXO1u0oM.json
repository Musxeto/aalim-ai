  "transcript": "Okay, first of all, Akhi, when you started your question by saying, I don't see them pray, not even eat, this doesn't mean that they do not pray. A lot of the Muslims, unfortunately, have weak imaan. They're so far away from their religion, yet they still pray on their own, on their own terms, where people don't see them. So this does not label them as kafir. They're still Muslims. Not knowing what their Aqeedah is, when you called me and you said Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wabarakatu Sheikh, I replied to you. I did not refrain from replying and I did not say hi. I didn't say what's up? I replied and said w1 wa rahmatullah. Though Shaitaan came to me and said how do you know that Salman has a good aqeedah or he's a Muslim? He might be from the CIA. He might be someone pretending to be a Muslim. No Akhi. The default is that you're a Muslim. They say they are Muslims, say they are Muslims, then they are Muslims. I don't have any reason or evidence to change to change this default. Therefore you can implement it and act upon it."
