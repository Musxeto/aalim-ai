  "transcript": "my last question is can you please clarify the Ahmadiyya effect and that belief okay I will try in my level best Nisha Madea what I what is a Madea al Ahmadiyya is a deviant cult that claim to be part of Islam and they're not and any cult can claim to be part of Islam yet in order to be part of Islam you have to fulfill the conditions so it is not simply a claim that you prove that you provide if someone says that we believe in Allah the ocean and in Muhammad sallallaahu areas in them we say good for you man this is Islam and then they nullify this by saying but we believe that mirza ghulam whatever his name is is a also messenger who came about 150 years ago and he is a messenger after the Prophet Isis am all the Muslims worldwide the 1.7 billion Muslims agree that these are disbelievers likewise if someone comes and says listen I'm from a cult I pray five times a day I fast Ramadan I offer hatch but I don't believe that there are a hundred and fourteen chapters in the Quran I believe only in a hundred and ten and four chapters I don't believe immediately this is not a Muslim this it's a no-brainer you don't have to be a rocket scientist so the Ahmadiyya cult or or whatever they call themselves they do not relate to Islam none what's it's totally prohibited to marry their women or to eat their meat slaughtered by them or to say Salam to them because they're not Muslims they're like any Buddhist or anything or any other religion they have their own religion Lokhande nakum Walia Deen"
