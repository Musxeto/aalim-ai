  "transcript": "fausan from indonesia says i understand where you're coming from when you see say that the person who does not pray is a kafir and this is theoretical but to when it's practical there has to be conditions to be fulfilled etc and you said that whoever prays three prayers a day is still a muslim so how is this possible and what about if he one day misses the full five prayers what counts according to our knowledge this is in allah's hands at the end of the day what we label a person a person who prays three times a day acknowledging that he's sinful that he missed two prayers and that this is haram we say that he's muslim because he is still classified to be among the worshipers he prays three times a day a person who prays nothing except once a year in eid he doesn't pray a single prayer he would not be classified as a worshiper or a muslim so if a person abandons prayer for one day the five whole prayers and he dies do we classify him as a kafir the answer is no because his previous years he used to be a worshiper when he died before his death were the conditions fulfilled in him has anybody put him to trial to to see whether he is a kafir or not and to uh ensure that the conditions are fulfilled and there are no obstacles to prevent us from giving him tak fear no so the default is he's still a muslim you"
