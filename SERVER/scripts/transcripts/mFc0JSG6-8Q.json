  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK. Sheikh I have. Ammar. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh I wanted some advice on a matter. I recently started gaining knowledge Alhamdulillah as much as I can in English. But because the resources are really limited in English and not much can be attained compared to the sources that are available in Arabic. So like Jamil Bayan and the great books by scholars in Arabic. So I wanted to start learning Arabic. But the issue is because I am also currently studying in the university and gaining, learning Arabic would require me to completely focus on it. So that I could reach a level where I could read books which have such high advanced Arabic. But I am scared that if I tell about this, about my desire to learn Arabic to my parents, they would be, they would not accept it because they have already, because I am already studying something in the university. So I wanted to ask like, is it possible to reach that level of Arabic if I start right now? So that I would be able to read such great books and maybe understand Arabic and maybe understand books of Islam in such a way that like gain more knowledge. Jazakallah Khair. Akhi, knowledge is not acquired overnight. It takes time. And learning Arabic with the grace of Allah is quite easy, especially for those who have a great desire to it, like yourself. Yes, if someone was forced to learn it due to work requirements or because someone is forcing them to do so, it won't be as easy as when someone is eager to learn it for a noble cause that he has. Nevertheless, at the moment, I would think and believe that you should focus and make your priority to graduate from uni and to get your degree. This doesn't mean that you should stop your pursuit of learning Arabic. Rather, you should do that but on a scale that would not negatively impact your studies at the uni. Once you're over, then you can have full blast with the grace of Allah. And believe me that within a year or two, you would be able, inshallah, to read books in Arabic on your own pace without rushing things and without jeopardizing your academic achievements and learning at uni. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
