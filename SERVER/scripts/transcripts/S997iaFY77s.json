  "transcript": "I would like to know how can we beautify our voices without imitating a mahram please JazakAllah Without imitating who? A Qari Sheikh There is no problem in imitating a Qari So if you recite Qur'an and imitate Sheikh Shreim or Mahir or Maigli or anyone you like there is no problem in that but beautifying your voice is to make it appealing whether it's your own recitation or you are imitating someone else there's no problem in that and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best"
