  "title": "Is Controlling Time in Video Games Kufr?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing from bangladesh my question is a little bit weird because it is about video games um my question is there are some video games set on 90s or or future and there are some video games which allows us to control time while driving or while shooting so that we can slow down the time and we can shoot enemies is this uh as we know time is or can only be controlled by allah and is any kind of coofer because they are allowing us such control this is my question okay first of all video games are games which means that they are not something of reality or seriousness and as long as there is nothing coofer no no worshipping of other gods or reincarnating or giving life to the death uh to the dead or signs of other religions if you're not killing the muslims and impersonating the disbelievers if you're not giving dignity and honor to the disbelievers by honoring their troops and etc if there is no excessive violence if there is no gambling or anything haram if there are no profanity nudity and the likes etc generally speaking if you're spending moderate time like maybe half an hour a day insha'allah this is permissible though i do not like this because time is precious and it's the essence of our lives and the moment an hour is gone from our lives it will never come back and we will regret that hour on the day of judgment and we would have wished that we've spent it in something that pleases allah now fantasy related issues slowing of time stopping of time giving you the ability to kill enemy troops by pausing time or delaying it or going back in time a moment or two these are all things related to fantasy and not to belief no one believes that he is assuming the role of the creator in doing that or rewinding time or going to the past or traveling to the future all of these are nonsenses things of fantasy and i don't think that there is kufur in that and allah azza knows best you"
