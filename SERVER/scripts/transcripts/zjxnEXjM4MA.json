  "title": "Change in characteristics of water change (smell, color, taste), can we make Wudu with it?",
  "transcript": "Kalume says as you told us about water so that means if the color taste smell of water changes naturally like in some places the water is sour and tastes like salt so we can use the water for voodoo also even it tastes changes because it's natural not by putting anything correct or not no it's not correct in a sense even if it was changed not naturally the scholars say the purity of water is considered pure providing one we can describe it as water 2/3 of its characteristics has not been changed by an impurity and that is the smell the color and the taste let's go to number one I have water do I call this water glass yes water if I put a teabag in it for a couple of minutes and I take it out would you perform water with this no why is it no jeez no snap Naji's cheese is pure so why will won't you perform model because Allah says that we have to perform water with water so this is not water this is tea so it has changed its nature to something else now if I have water and someone drops a drop or two of we call it matte what flower water or rose from rose water which has very beautiful smell so hmmm smells nice the colors okay I drink it no problem can I perform model yeah yeah but it has a beautiful scent to it it still remains water not like the tea the second thing is changing one of the characteristics with an imperious so I put a drop or two of urine in it and it becomes a little bit yellowish I can see the urine I can see the impurity this is not permissible because this is neji's so if you have a lake if you go to the beach the ocean water sea water is salty you cannot drink it but you can perform will do with it you have a bucket of water that was stagnant for a while the taste changed the color changed the smell changed but it's still considered to be water and it did not change with an impurity change was stuck with something hella likely you have a bucket of water that was used to prepare dough and this flour in it so when the water comes in the water becomes a bit white whitish but still water not dough it's still considered to be water you can perform water with that and allah azzawajal knows best"
