  "transcript": "with practicing islam we'll find that this topic is endless it depends on how you look at it from which angle are you looking at it sometimes people think really really deep and sometimes people think on the surface what to do in the times of wearing the cup or growing a beard or free mixing that's it this is what they know or understand about islam so it is always essential to go back to the fundamentals oh that's why they call you a fundamentalist true fundamentalist means a person who abides by the fundamentals of his beliefs and this is why such people are always classified as extremists so when you abide by your religion when you abide by islam to the letter this doesn't go well with the vast majority of muslims let alone with the disbelievers imagine even the muslims would not accept it oh this is too extreme what is extreme quran either you're not a real muslim or we are the few who are following the footsteps of the prophet so it's always essential to go back to the basics because what i'm going to say is not rocket science everybody knows it all the duat and the and the students of knowledge and the scholars they're not reinventing the wheel they're simply opening your eyes and due to the fact that you live in a cafe country among disbelievers among muslims who are sinners or barely muslims your brain is being washed and lots of the basics are being compromised till the extent that we have reached the end of time where the prophet ali salazar told us that evil would become good and good would become evil this is how people see it nowadays so let's attempt to explore such venues and open our eyes together i might be wrong you have the right to correct me but if i'm right then it's about time for you to reflect on your life and to see whether you are on the straight path heading to jannah insha allah or you need to do something about it you"
