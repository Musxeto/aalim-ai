  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Saudi Arabia thank you so much for your give us the true \npath of our questions my question is that   when I pray the fard Salah after that can I \nmust change a place if I pray that Salah first   and then I sit and make athkaar you know \nsubhanallah and other athkaar after salah   and then I pray the same place after uh after the \nfirst prayer that will be allowed and my question   is also the same for my woman female okay I will \nanswer you inshallah so latif's question is clear   there is a Hadith or a number of hadiths such as \nthe Hadith of Mu'awiya may Allah be pleased with   him and others where the Prophet (Peace and \nBlessings Upon him) orders those who prayed   Friday prayer not to connect it afterwards \nwith the Sunnah before speaking to someone   else or changing and shifting their position \nand the Hadith also was mentioned in other fard   prayers not only Friday where the Prophet (Peace \nand Blessings Upon him) says is it hard for you   to go a bit forward or backwards or to the \nright or to the left before you pray your Sunnah   and this is an instruction from the \nprophet Islam to change your position   so the most authentic opinion is \nthat after concluding your fard   you must not pray your Sunnah unless you speak to \nsomeone by giving him Salam or checking the time   or standing and Shifting the position a little \nbit to the forward or backwards or to the right   or to the left and this is the most authentic \nopinion some Scholars said that if you concluded   your fard and engaged in dhikr that would be \nsufficient because this is considered to be   separating the fourth from the Sunnah but this \nis not authentic and it doesn't require you to   be a rocket scientist to shift a little bit \nor at least say salaam to the one next to you   in order to follow the instruction of the \nProphet (Peace and Blessings Upon him) should   a woman who's praying in her home follow the same \nruling the answer is yes after fard prayer do not   connect it with Sunnah unless you change \nyour position the place you the spot you   prayed on or you speak with someone but if you \nprayed the Sunnah and you want to pray another   Sunnah or to follow the Sunnah with fard you \ndon't have to change your position if you want   to pray you're witr you don't have to change \nyour position only after concluding the fard   do not pray the Sunnah on the same spot \nuntil you do one of these two things and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
