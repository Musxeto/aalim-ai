  "transcript": "We have uhamlaykum uh I'm a student in the 12th grade. Uh please advise on which of the following path leads to greater reward and brings one closer to Allah. Dedicating oneself to Islamic studies and engaging in da'ah or pursuing a career in medicine while also acquiring Islamic knowledge and actively engaging in da'ah. Which of these holds more of a virtue according to Islamic teachings? It is not one size that fits all. Sometimes people are not qualified for Islamic studies and dawa. They don't have it in them. And I've seen people so enthusiastic wanting to learn dawa and they want to go to Islamic university in Medina or im in Riyad or inim or in here and there and they go the first year second year then they're homesick. What are you doing? Yeah, I can't stay. It's too much. I miss my mom's biryani. I I just want to go and you're here for dawa. you're dedicated for Islam. So, no, no. Okay. If you need someone to change your pampers, go go back. So, he wasted 2, three years and he goes back home. And he doesn't have a plan B to fall back on. And everybody who was with him in high school, they're already in third or fourth year, medicine or engineering or business. This guy doesn't know what's he's capable of. So, I said, \"No, you're not qualified.\" if he's qualified. He said, \"Listen, I'm 100% dedicated for da'wah. I love Islam. I've memorized Quran when I was 12 years of age and I've memorized the books of hadith when I was 14. Oh, wow. This is a highly decorated and a scholar to be no no go and pursue knowledge.\" And he says, \"I know if I get a BA in Islamic studies and maybe masters and maybe PhD, I'm going to be paid 10% of what a doctor gets or without an engineer. I don't care. I want a I want Allah's pleasure. I want to help people. I want to teach people. I want to be someone that's qualified. So you're the man. You're my boy. So I'd like you to continue.\" someone else he says I struggle in in memorizing al fat how long you been Muslim said 20 years but I you know when I say the fat I make mistakes but I want to study Islam so no please don't study Islam you're going to make a problem for us how are you in biology said she I'm A+ I'm good no go and study medicine and while study medicine improve your Islamic studies and learn but you excel in medicine. So what would I do if I have a thousand scholars teaching Quran and Sunnah and hadith while not a single medical doctor and what would I do when I have a thousand medical doctors and without one imam giving fatwas and leading the prayer and and and helping the community? It's an issue of balance. So it's not one sizefits-all. What's in you? What are you capable of? And this is why I say to the people from outside, my advice to you, if you're not this top niche of a highly decorated student of knowledge, if you're an an average Joe, I would say get your degree in engineering, medicine, physics, whatever, then apply for Islamic uh uh university degree because then you would have a plan B to fall back to if you need to fall back to something."
