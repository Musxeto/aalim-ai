  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam So my father forced me to eat for two days in Ramadan. Do I have to fast for two months or just make up for those two days? When you say he forced you to eat during Ramadan, did he hold a knife or a gun to your head? No, but he forced me. How? He would maybe beat me. If he beats you and you ate, no you don't have to make up for this missed, skipped day if you continued to fast. See, if someone comes and exerts pressure on you and you're compelled, so he has a gun and you know he's going to use it, or he has a knife, or he's going to belt you and hit you really hard and it's going to hurt. In this case, Islam says you're forced. You may eat or drink until this stops and then you continue your fasting and your fasting is totally permissible. But if you ate and drank and took the rest of the day off and kept on eating and drinking, then this is a skipped day. You have to make it up now. There is no fasting of 60 days except for having sexual intercourse with your spouse or with another person during the daytime of Ramadan while fasting. Breaking your fast, you have to make up for that day alone and Allah knows best."
