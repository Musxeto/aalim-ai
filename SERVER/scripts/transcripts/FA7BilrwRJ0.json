  "transcript": "from isra what is shik in love if I talk to the one who I am learning Islam from in my mind all the time is this shik in love how do I stop this this is one of the things that a lot of the people keep on confusing themselves on and on again what is shik in love what is shik in fear what is shik in this and that and they keep on whispering to themselves and Shan utilizes this big time shik is to associate others with Allah so if you love someone love itself is something that's Mutual there is natural love a Hungry Man Loves a good meal a adors a big medium well done stake Is This Love shik No a person may out of compassion and mercy love his children out of being associated with others love his colleagues who share the same passion and hobbies with him so I'm a mechanic I love those who love cars like me for example a woman loves her husband there's no problem in that there's no shik in that the shik in love is when it is associated with worshiping Allah with and means is to pave the road in Arabic we say meaning it's paved and this is when a person worships Allah when you worship others when you submit your will to them when you worship them when you have total humility and submissiveness and total obedience to them whether they're present or not this is shik in love and the idol worshippers as mentioned in Surah Al Bak they love their Idols similarly to their love to Allah so this is and this is what Allah made mentioned to us and then in comparison Allah says but the Believers love Allah more so they don't associate others with Allah because their love is purely for Allah because it's a love of worshiping Allah therefore loving someone and thinking like Romeo jolate all the time about one another daydreaming fantasizing this is is not shik in love this is either normal love or a sinful love but it is not shik Andel Knows Best"
