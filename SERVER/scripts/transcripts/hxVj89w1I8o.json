  "title": "if i pray at work during my break and exceed the time allowed, do i have to compensate them",
  "transcript": "Kaif from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I am working in a company which says that you have to work for 9 hours and 30 minutes are for a break all the day. So it includes lunch break, tea break, etc. So it becomes quite difficult for me to pray approximately 3 prayers. So am I sinful like if I exceed the time? Or do I have to keep each and every second in check? No, you have to pray Akhi. Whether the company allows you or not, prayer is a divine right upon us. This is from Allah Azza Wa Jal. Now you have to do the minimal amount of time for your prayer, not to take your time, not to go to the Masjid and spend minutes and hours maybe from your working hour schedule. But if you do it in the office, it's like with great difference of similarity, but it's almost like going to the toilet or having a coffee break or relieving yourself. It's the same thing. This is your natural right. Now if you can compensate the company, that would be a win-win by adding maybe 5-10 minutes at the end of the working day. And Allah knows best."
