  "transcript": "Salman from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. May Allah make you live long and make you continue what you're doing like no peace be upon you. And you as well but 950 years is a lot Akhi. May Allah Azza Wa Jal make it a swift and easy and peaceful ending for all of us. What's your question? Sheikh I know of a brother who does not wear underwear. He forgot to close the zip in his pants and after praying two and half rakahs in Dhuhr behind Imam, he realized that he did not close it. So it was very much probable that his private part was exposed. So is his Dhuhr Salah valid? No. If his private part was exposed for or more, then this is a lot of time. The scholars say if the awrah was exposed for a little time and then concealed, there's no problem. But if it was exposed for a long time, whether you knew about it or not, the prayer is invalid. He has to repeat the prayer."
