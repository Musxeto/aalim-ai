  "transcript": "Recently, I just have a podcast with one of the reporter from USA, he said that, he said his country having a mass in many countries, yeah, but because of that mass, there are a lot of refugees coming to their countries, to US, mostly Muslims, so that becomes the growth of the Muslims in USA by themselves. So, it is like a kickback effect. Payback. Payback. Payback. This is what you do, this is what you get. Yes. This is all from Allah Azza Wa Jal. We have nothing. It's Allah that plans everything. 9-11 took place. Yes. I said live on CNN and on other channels that this was fabricated. You do not expect me to believe that a bunch of illiterate Arabs who don't know how to speak English would be able to fly a jetliner and maneuver between high scrapers in a naval or in an air force approach and then strike twice without missing. Yes. They can't do these things when they can't even fly a normal private one propeller plane. I personally asked two of the royal pilots and with experience over 30 years, can you as experienced 747 pilots do this? And they said to me, we tried this last week on a simulator. Okay. We tried the settings and instruments exactly the same time, the twin towers, and my brother here, captain, we tried, we missed three times. From how many trials? Three times they tried. They tried three times. And the fourth time, they made it. Oh, I see. So these are experienced pilots. So if you tell me that this was staged, I would say 100%. But look what happened. Yes. Everyone would expect that people would hate Islam. Yes. Would reject Islam. Yes. On the contrary, in the first week, 35,000 accepted Islam in America. Yes. Because of what? MashaAllah. This is in Allah's hands. This is Allah's way of guiding people to Islam. So we do what we do. But Allah, Azza wa Jal, at the end of the day, does what he does. And I read somewhere that on that day, 3,000 Jews don't go to work. This is conspiracy theory. I don't base my knowledge or my thoughts on they say or he say. No, I base it on facts. These are two pilots that I know personally who said we've tried it three times and missed. These are logical things that if you have a skyscraper and you hit the top, the bottom would not collapse. Yes. It would melt. It would bend. But to go down like an orchestrated demolition, this means that you can see that this has been staged. Somewhere something exploded below. On timings. On timings. Yes."
