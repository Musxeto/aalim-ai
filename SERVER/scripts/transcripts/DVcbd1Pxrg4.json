  "transcript": "a from Malaysia to ask so I like to ask about Bry um teaching I'm still confused if I see um a security gut at um my housing area that is uned by the developer of my housing space if I give them food or greens is this perable or is it permissible if I give to my staff that is employed by a company or if I see a garbage collector I want to food or money or green thank you sh I don't understand your question a are you asking me about tipping giving a tip to a security guard or or garbage collector uh food and drinks is it permissible for me to do so to give what is it permissible for me to do so to give food and greens to the security guard or the garbage collector that I see okay see basically speaking bribe is something that is given to an individual for his position meaning that if he was not working in that position I would not have given him anything so giving a government official like what happened in America and he gets bribes in gold bars and money and this is part of lobbying politicians do this regularly this is a bribe because if this politician was not working in the senate or in the Congress or elsewhere if he was a normal person no one would give him a single dollar but what he is receiving is because of his position likewise someone working in the Customs so you give him a gift so when you bring merchandise next trip he doesn't take taxes on you or someone who works in the Airlines and you need to have a booking or a discount so you give them a gift for this purpose if they were not in that position you would not have given them anything likewise the gifts that pharmaceutical Representatives give to doctors a laptop a smartphone a course in Sharm for three days with business class ticket and lodging and your wife and your kids this is a clear bribe and many doctors take it without any problem business as usual but when you go to a restaurant or someone comes and does work for you or the janitor or the trash collector and you give them food as Charity or a bottle of water in the heat of the Sun or you give them a small tip because you know that their salary is not sufficient this is inshallah acceptable in a gesture of kindness that is permissible and Allah Knows Best"
