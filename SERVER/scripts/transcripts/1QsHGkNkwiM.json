  "title": "Is it Haram to watch or read something that has a Kufr Name in it such as \"Magic\" | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I used to watch the NBA the American Basketball League but I stopped because there are a few of the teams in particular to wear their names are Orlando Magic and Washington Wizards so I wasn't sure about the permissibility of you know watching you know the sport when they have names related to magic so so this means when Magic Johnson scores you close your eyes though he scored the three-pointer I wouldn't even watch it okay what's your second that's all ok Baraka Luffy Abu Yussef oh brother you sir from the UK asks about the names of some sports teams so because Orlando Magic has the word magic and the other team has wizards in it so he stopped watching it no this is not a legitimate reason to stop watching it you may stop watching it because there are cheerleaders for example coming between the breaks and doing things that are not approved in Islam you may stop watching it or at least listening to it whenever there is this music that is heard loud and clear when the time is close I don't know what when they play it or whatever but the name itself doesn't have an impact on the permissibility of watching a sports team or on buying a product just because magic donuts for example so I don't eat donuts because of the magic well for your information use of the natural magic is Haram and the Prophet said alehissalaam in an authentic hadith in nominal bayani lacera that some articulation some words that people use when they give a narration or a speech or they present themselves some of these words have the same impact as magic so would we say okay hey please try to speak as bad as you can because we don't want anything to do with magic no this is not logical this is an Islamic so it is not related to halal or Haram regarding the name but if there are other things that are Haram associated with watching the NBA then you should not do that and I hope this answers your question"
