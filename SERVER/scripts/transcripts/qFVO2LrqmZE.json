  "transcript": "uh he's asking about while having an online class and they say that you have to have your camera on all the time if he turns it off um and and drinks uh water or eats lying on his bed would he be sinful the answer is no it's something that is conducted in a classroom like when you are in a actual classroom and the teacher says no one should speak we all speak to the one next to us or in front of us or ask a handout or a pen or something and and nobody's committing a sin nobody is going to be executed for that therefore as long as you're not caught there is no problem in that"
