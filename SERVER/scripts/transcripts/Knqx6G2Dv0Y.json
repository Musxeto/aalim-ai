  "title": "Difference between Sunni and Wahabi? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "from india i am 21 years old and for a long time i am tackling the issue of sunni and wahhabi i asked my elder that what's the difference between two and the conclusion was they saw their four fathers following something so they are following the same and the issue is so much that the sunni hafiz does that do not read the meaning of the ayah of the quran which is translated by a wahabis father or vice versa okay i will answer in shock from india he wants to know the difference between sunni and wahhabi and some of the half of tell him do not read the interpretation of iwahabi all those who talk ill about wahhabi though we don't have a sect called wahhabi but my teaching makes me classifies me as a wahhabi so anyone who talks ill about wahhabism or sheikh muhammad or his books he is someone who's deviant either a super sufi or a rafaeli or someone who is deviant martezili or ashari or whatever following these deviant sex this is why they don't like the mainstream of islam that is following the footsteps of the prophet sallam the favorite generations of the companions the taberean and the tabitha this is all what wahhabism is and if you study their books you will find that it fits as a glove to the sun of the prophet hassam and to the correct arcade and the pure raped of the favorite generations"
