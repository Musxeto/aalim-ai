  "title": "Can a latecomer join another latecomer who is praying his remaining prayer? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Japan I wanted to ask   um if I come to the congregation late and if \nI find Imam already giving Salah but one of   the brothers stands up probably because he came \nlate as well and he can he continues to pray the   remaining Salah he finished can I join him \nand uh make a congregation with him and if   there is a place next to him can I stand by him \nor if there's no place can I stand behind him   okay so basically what you're asking about is I \ncame late to the congregation and I found that   the congregation is over and some of the late \ncomers are already completing what they had missed   so can I select one of them tap him on the \nshoulder and join him so that he becomes my Imam   and I continue to pray with him whatever I can \nfrom his remaining prayers the answer is yes   and usually people do this with the last one \non the right so they can stand next to him it   is illogical that you come to a row they're all \nstanding to pray and you select one in the middle   and you tap him to pray with him but you can't \nstand next to him why pick him go to the far right   to the last one who came late and then join him \nand you can stand next to him and Allah Knows Best"
