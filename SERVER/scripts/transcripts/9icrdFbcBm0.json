  "transcript": "daily from Bangladesh assalam alayum alayum sh there is dispute if we should makea before or after as we said the DU after so should we make Dua before will it get accepted and also I want to say sh okay the control already cut the call because they know you have only one question most likely it wasn't a question it was a remark but they made please control don't make let me handle the second question as for your first question the Dua is an issue of dispute whether it's before during or after actually the scholars say that it is supposed to be before because while you're anticipating the aan and the call forar you are in need need because you're hungry you're thirsty and you are in a state of desperation so this is where you're most vulnerable and you express your poverty and humility to Allah this is when you make Dua what you say after the Dua this is considered to be rather than to be a Dua and either way alhamdulillah Allah's favors and blessings overwhelmed us you can do it either way"
