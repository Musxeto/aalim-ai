  "title": "Can I Talk About Past Sins Before Reverting to Islam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So am I allowed to talk about certain things that I did in the past like for example before I reverted to Islam or like about other people's like what other people did and that also like includes sometimes like sins? I don't know. If a person reverted to Islam and he wants to speak about things he used to do before accepting Islam, it seems that this is permissible if it will not tarnish his reputation. In the authentic hadith, the companions after Salat al-Fajr used to sit in the masjid and speak about things they used to do in pre-Islamic era, in Jahiliyyah, and these things were funny and the Prophet would smile, alayhi salam, such as worshipping a statue of dates as a god and when they felt hungry they ate it. So this is sinful, this is shirk, but it's funny. So if it's this type, yes, but if a person was doing some heinous stuff like raping or prostitution or selling drugs and he boasts about it, no, it should be concealed and Allah knows best."
