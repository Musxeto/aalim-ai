  "transcript": "Mail from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Walaikumussalam Sometimes in Sujood, some parts that need to be on the ground lift unintentionally. Like my forehead may accidentally touch the ground twice while going into Sujood, or my finger may rise on accident for a brief moment. Does this impact my Salah? If this was done unintentionally, as in the case, sometimes people, when they go for Sujood, they like bump the ground twice. I don't know why they're head-bumping the ground aggressively like this. So it bounces and then goes back. This is not an issue because it was unintentional and this counts as one. Similarly, if someone raises the hand or does something with the other limbs of Sujood unintentionally, then Inshallah their Sujood is valid, but they should try their level best not to do that."
