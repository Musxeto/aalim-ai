  "transcript": "suhail from malaysia says so what happens if i were to come to a masjid and i found someone who missed the congregation i've already prayed maghrib or isha or whatever and then i join him so that we are both a congregation but i pray three raka's instead of the two sunnah of maghrib would that be included among the 12 raqqas of the answer is no because you are not praying it in the same format as the ratiba yes for example if for uh you came to the federal prayer late and you prayed with the congregation turak has a fart now you have two raka of sunnah which should have been before the fart but you came late and you saw someone coming late and you joined him in congregations so so that you would give him the lord of jama'a and you intended by that the two raka's of sunnah fajr this is valid because it comes with the same number the same format of the mist sunnah and allah knows best"
