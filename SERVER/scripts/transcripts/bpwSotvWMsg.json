  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from France Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So my question concerns about if I wear ankle boots with low heels and a shorter dress so my feet and ankles are covered by the boots but the part around my ankles like fitted on my feet so would this be considered appropriate according to hijab guidelines? No it would not be considered appropriate because this is eye-catching and it is quite attractive to some and what would be the limit if someone says okay I'm wearing my boots to my knees and it's covering my feet but I can see the boots so this is quite attractive to so many people so no this is inappropriate for a woman to wear such shoes and expose her feet this way by wearing boots and Allah knows best if her dress or abaya is going down and covering it there is no problem in that Inshallah"
