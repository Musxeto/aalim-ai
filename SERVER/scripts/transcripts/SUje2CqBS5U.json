  "title": "Can we call those who mock Islam an Apostate Will we be a disbeliever if we don't declare them kafir",
  "transcript": "my question is some people they claim to be muslims but they also uh mock islam and shariah and so now i don't know if this type of uh mocking uh the religion makes them apostates so my question is uh if we don't recognize these uh people as apostates as well like do we nullify our own islam because i've read somewhere that if we don't recognize uh someone who is not muslim as non-muslim we also nullify our islam if this god please he says there are people that mock islam they pretend to be muslims but they actually mock islam so should we consider them apostates and would be would we be considered disbelievers for not consider them as apostates first of all the ruling you said is one of the nullifiers of islam which has listed down the ten categories whoever does not make the disbelievers disbelievers and does not believe that they are disbelievers he is a disbeliever this is in people that are 100 percent known to be disbelievers so if someone says well i listen the christians and the jews they believe in the torah and the injil so our friend here john and and jim and and brown or whatever they are they are christians and they're jews but i wouldn't say they're disbelievers okay it can't be either they're believers muslims or disbelievers non-muslims said well i don't i don't believe that they are disbelievers this is an act of apostasy because you are saying that what allah has described them as in the quran and the prophet sallam in the sunnah is not true allah said that they had committed an act of disbelief they have gotten out of the fold of islam and they're disbelievers and you say i have my reservations this is an act of disbelief now in your case those who are doubtful maybe they made what they had said out of ignorance maybe did not mean it maybe did not understand what it is so individual tak fear is different but generally speaking those who mock islam on social media or in public and they say that the quran is this and that they make fun of islam they make fun of the quran they make fun of the sunnah they make fun of our prophet alison or the companions they're making fun making jokes stand up comedy this is an act of apostasy whether they were serious or having fun or whatever this is an act of apostasy and we believe them to be disbelievers"
