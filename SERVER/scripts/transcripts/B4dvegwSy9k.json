  "title": "Can a woman in menses make dua before Iftar like everyone else? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "okay when women are unable to start the during ramadan and pray so do we have the same privileges of uh when you know the for the dua's acceptance and everything during the breaking of past or it's only for the person who is fasting so if a woman has the monthly excuse and she says and complains why am i deprived from the so many benefits that others are enjoying well this is allah's test for you not only that al the prophet has given us a beautiful uh condolence if we can say that when he said when a person falls sick and menses is a form of sickness when a person falls sick or travels allah will write down for him whatever he used to do while being healthy and residing so when a woman cannot pray cannot fast allah would reward her for that because when she was pure she used to pray and as for the dua it seems that the dua is conditional that is when a person is breaking his fast so a woman in her menses is not breaking her fast and hence she cannot get the same advantage but she has other places where she can get her dua answered and that is between adan and akama and that is at the last third of the night even if she is not praying she makes dua and allah would accept that and allah knows best you"
