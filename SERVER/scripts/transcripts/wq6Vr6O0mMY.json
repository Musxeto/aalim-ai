  "title": "Can I make my mom quit haram music by emotionally blackmailing her so she stops",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Uganda I'll check my question is \nmy mother has a PlayStation and the PlayStation is   in one room in the block rooms where I sleep like \nshe rented one room for me to sleep and in the   other for for the games now the games have music \nin them and they are played and and the games are   also played even the time for Salaat(prayer) \nand then some of the games are not good for   see like the musician all that so me as a person \nI I quitted from uh working there but now the   issue is that the music pops up at any time like \nfor five to eight seconds and I hear it well I'm   in my room so my question is can I stay outside \nand refuse to enter my room telling her to to   close the business because I tried telling her \nto reduce the the volume uh the voice of the   but on the same day I still had the music again so \nso learning the voice does not serve any purpose   so I I know that she may cry and talk some \nsweats on me but at least I'll make her quit   the Haram business so can I do this or is it \nharam will it be bad for me to do this to her   Anna the problem is that sometimes we \nexaggerate in our reactions if I have a mosquito   that is annoying me if I kill \nthe mosquito with a cannon   the mosquito is dead but so is everyone else \nin the room because the cannon will blow up the   whole place so was my action correct or not \ndefinitely not it was out of proportion and   likewise forcing your mom to close such a business \nthat is impacting you only for a few seconds a day   and making her cry and make her sad and being \nunduteful staying out and Allah knows what would   happen to you as a consequence all of this \nis not logical I go to malls I go to shops   I drive in the streets and sometimes people who \ndon't fear Allah who don't know Allah blast music   what do I do confine myself to my quarters and \nnever leave no there is a difference between   hearing and listening if I am hearing something \nI don't want to hear there's no sin on me   but if I go and listen and I'm \nhappy and tapping and enjoying   what I'm listening to then there is a \nsin so I hope this answers your question"
