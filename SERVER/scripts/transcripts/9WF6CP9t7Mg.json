  "transcript": "how do I deal uh please how do a Muslim answer the question from an atheist who created Allah well this is illogical because if there was someone to create Allah he would not qualify to be a god a god that is created cannot be a God because part of the description of God that he does not that he is not created he's one of a kind he's the first without a beginning he's the last without an end this is the definition of God so his question is not relevant it's not logical because if there were someone who created God then that someone would be God himself then we would go into the then who created God then who created the one who created God then who created the one who created the one who created God all of this is nonsense God is one subhanahu waala he's not created he's not begotten and he does not beget and there's nothing like him subhanahu waala"
