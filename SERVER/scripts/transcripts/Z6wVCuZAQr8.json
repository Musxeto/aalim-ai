  "transcript": "Zainab from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh my question is that I didn't know that wrist is part of the Aura and we have to cover it during prayer. I have prayed all this time without covering the wrist but I did cover my elbow and till the mid of my forearms always. But sometimes I also pray with my wrist covered. So my question is do I have to make up for all of those prayers? And if yes, then how do I pray it because I don't know how many times I have prayed with my wrist covered and how many times I have not. Jazakum Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. Allah Azza Wa Jal is the most merciful, the most forgiving and the most kind. Allah Subh'anaHu Wa Ta-A'la does not hold us accountable when we behave out of ignorance or due to an error or a mistake. So Alhamdulillah what had happened in the past without your knowledge of this being from the Aura is forgiven and you don't have to make up any of your prayers."
