  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I'm struggling to understand how to approach forbidding evil especially with my non-Muslim family at home like they often engage in things that are haram like eating prohibited foods or watching tv shows that include free mixing and inappropriate content I try to turn off the tv sometimes but they get frustrated so I worry if that are they Muslim no they're not Muslim if they're not Muslims the level of sins and disbelief they are engaged in is far far more worse than these trivial things compared so eating pork watching haram content content free mixing doing drugs consuming intoxicants all of this is compared to the kufr and disbelief they're doing is nothing so again and again and again I always repeat this these are symptoms but it's not the true illness watching haram content listening to music eating pork consuming intoxicants doing drugs free mixing and the likes are all symptoms you keep on tackling each one maybe one would disappear only to get three or four popping up instead because you're treating the symptom someone with a severe headache giving them two tylenols every six hours fix the symptom but not the real illness they might have cancer they might have an infection they might have something serious so your family their kufr is the real disease tackle that first and leave these issues aside don't even open it to them don't even discuss it with them because it doesn't make any sense someone who's worshiping other than God someone who worships the cross or Jesus someone who's agnostic or atheist and you say to them oh consuming wine with white cheese is haram doing drugs is haram watching movies is haram said duh where are you coming from this this doesn't make any sense because you're talking to them in a different language they cannot comprehend and understand rather tackle the biggest problem which is their disbelief let them believe in the existence of Allah let them believe in the attributes of Allah then let them believe in Allah sending a messenger with the book that is the last revelation in its perfection and its miraculous nature that is second to none then you will find the symptoms disappear inshallah"
