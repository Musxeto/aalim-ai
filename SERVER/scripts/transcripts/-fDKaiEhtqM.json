  "title": "If I get the nationality of a Kafir country will I become a Kafir? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Qasim from Qatar. Hello. Qasim. Yes Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. You took too long Akhi. Oh sorry Sheikh. I'm new at the app. Yes, what can I do for you? My question is I'm born and raised in Germany but I'm Turkish and I want to apply a German passport. Some people told me if I do that I will be a Catholic. Is that right or wrong? First of all it is not correct that whoever opts for a nationality of a Kafir country becomes a Kafir. This is totally bogus and not true. However it is not permissible for a Muslim who belongs to a Muslim country to opt for the nationality of a Kafir country. So Turkey is a Muslim country. If you have their nationality it is not permissible for you to apply for the German nationality and alhamdulillah nowadays the Turkish nationality is sometimes equal if not stronger than the European nationality and Allah knows best."
