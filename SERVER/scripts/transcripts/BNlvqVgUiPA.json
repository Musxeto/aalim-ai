  "title": "If I read a silent prayer outloud or miss a Sunnah, do I make sujood as sahu",
  "transcript": "Ibrahim from Guinea. Ibrahima. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Allah bless you and reward you Sheikh. I hope that you had a beautiful Eid with your family. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, my question is about prayer today. I remember that you said that, and even the teacher here explained to us that, you know, even in the prayers where you can, you are supposed to read silently, you can read aloud. It's not really a problem. But he said here that actually it depends on the intention. If you were supposed to read it silently, but your intention, and you did a mistake. So basically you did a mistake on that time, you are supposed to do Sujood and Asaww, because your intention was not to read it loud. are you supposed to do Sujood and Asaww then as well? First of all, the most authentic opinion is that Sujood Asaww is done when you make an error of forgetfulness or incorrect action or something you say, which is obligatory or a pillar. If one forgets a Sunnah, that does not require Sujood Asaww. and I want to go for Ruku' and I say Allahu Akbar, and I forgot to raise my hands. And while in the Ruku' I said, Ya Allah, I forgot to raise my hands. I have to offer Sujood Asaww. Or I forget to point my index finger in Tashahud. All of these are Sunnahs. If I forget them or abandon them deliberately, there is no Sujood Asaww for that. And this is the most authentic opinion. and the congregation is absent-minded as well, he didn't raise his voice, so we shouldn't remind him and say Subhanallah, Subhanallah. And he continued the prayer like that. He did not follow the Sunnah, but he did not skip something that is mandatory or a pillar. And I say that he does not have to offer Sujood Asaww, and Allah knows best."
