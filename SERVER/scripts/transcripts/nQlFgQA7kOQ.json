  "title": "Can we opt for a higher Provident Fund to get exemption from taxes? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh the provident funds that the government takes mandatory from every employee so if they were to opt to a higher fund so instead of them taking from them let's say 20 of the salary they say no you take 30 but through this they manage to get exemption from their taxations so they would be saving some money is this permissible the answer is no profit and fund is haram but because it's mandated by law and you don't have any escape away and out of it we say that it is permissible because you're forced to do it opting for a higher level is haram regardless of the reason it's like insurance policies for your car this is mandated by traffic police if you don't do it they'll fine you so we take it but we take only the minimum which is the third party insurance and not go for the full coverage and allah knows best you"
