  "title": "Men & women in same row of masjid but each on their own side & some women pray upstairs, valid?",
  "transcript": "Imad from the US Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh The Salat, the Salat is valid, especially if we talk about people praying in the second or in the above floor. So women praying on the above floor and men praying in the floor below them, is fine. It's not the ideal situation, because the ideal situation is men up front, women at the back. This is the sunnah. But if for one reason or the other, this is not followed, as in the case where, unfortunately, in some places they would have men and women side by side with a partition. This is wrong. Nevertheless, the prayer is valid and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
