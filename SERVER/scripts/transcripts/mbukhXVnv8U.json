  "transcript": "Danielle from Ireland I want to ask you know in Salah we cannot let the IM go two pillars ahead of us but if the IM is two pillars ahead of us what do we do in this situation do we just leave the Salah like what do we do what did why did he become um two pillars ahead of you is it because because you came late or he was too fast or you were too slow um I was too slow I was too slow then in this case you skip this R and keep on praying with the IM but consider this Rak to be void so once he offers Salam you stand up you don't offer Salam you stand up and make up this raak as if you've missed it with him okay do I also do of course you do before or after you you do it after the Salam because you've added something to the prayer okay"
